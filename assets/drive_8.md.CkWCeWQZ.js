No; The sentence provided, \\"However, the emperor permanently barred Li Ying and his associates from serving in office, marking the beginning of the Partisan Prohibitions,\\" does not answer the question, \\"During what type of crisis did Emperor Huan alienate the bureaucracy?\\" To answer the question effectively, we must provide some background and context related to Emperor Huan and the type of crisis that occurred during his reign that led to his alienation of the bureaucracy. Emperor Huan, also known as Liu Zhi, was the 28th emperor of the Eastern Han dynasty, ruling from 146 to 168 CE. His reign is marked by multiple power struggles, factions, and crises within the imperial court and bureaucracy. The specific crisis during which he alienated the bureaucracy is known as the 'Partisan Prohibitions' which occurred during the period between 166 and 168 CE. The Partisan Prohibitions were a series of political purges that took place during Emperor Huan's rule. These purges targeted members of the bureaucracy associated with opposing factions, especially the faction led by the scholar-official Li Ying. Li Ying and his supporters, known as Confucian purists, were critical of the emperor's extravagance, corruption, and preference for eunuchs in important government positions. Emperor Huan, influenced by the eunuchs in his court who opposed Li Ying and his associates, took harsh measures that led to his further alienation from the bureaucracy. He permanently barred Li Ying and his associates from serving in office, effectively disabling their political careers. This marked the beginning of the Partisan Prohibitions, a period during which Emperor Huan and the subsequent emperors would continue to suppress dissenting voices within the bureaucracy. The crisis that ensued during the Partisan Prohibitions significantly weakened the Eastern Han Dynasty by undermining the relationship between the emperor and the bureaucracy. This ultimately contributed to the decline of the dynasty, leading to increased corruption, loss of central authority, and the fragmentation of the empire into the subsequent period of the Three Kingdoms. In conclusion, although the sentence provided does indicate the start of the Partisan Prohibitions, it does not explicitly mention the type of crisis that occurred during Emperor Huan's reign which led to the alienation of the bureaucracy. To answer the question correctly, we must consider the broader context of Emperor Huan's rule and the events that led to the Partisan Prohibitions, as outlined above."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Gene is also responsible for completing a major project started by Dodge—the construction of an irrigation system that would bring valuable water to the faithful Rancho Grande employees in the southern part of the valley. Dodge mortgaged his ranch in order to finance the project. When Dodge's grandchildren, Tom, Kay, and Patsy, arrive from the east, they are unimpressed with life on the ranch. Tom and Kay are madcap college types who think ranchlife is boring and long to return to the big city. They resent Gene's authority and dismiss his talk of developing a work ethic and the importance of the irrigation project. Meanwhile, crooked lawyer Emory Benson is planning to seize the mortgage to Rancho Grande. After meeting Tom and Kay, he decides to take advantage of their discontent in order to slow the irrigation project and prevent the bank from renewing the mortgage. Gradually, Gene is able to win Kay over to his way of thinking, but Tom falls in with a group of partying tenderfoots from the east. He invites them to stay at Rancho Grande, where they get in everyone's way. Gene and his sidekick Frog Millhouse finally succeed in scaring the dudes off the ranch.

In 1920 the Norwegian ship Spangereid caught fire and sank at her mooring at James Bay, depositing quantities of coal on the beach below the wharf. A census in 1921 showed the islands population was 3,747. The first islanders left to work at Ascension Island in 1921, which was made a dependency of St Helena in 1922. Thomas R. Bruce (postmaster 1898–1928) was the first islander to design a postage stamp, the 1922–1937 George V ship-design—this significantly contributed to island revenues for several years. South African coinage became legal tender in 1923, reflecting the high level of trade with that country. There were nine deaths from whooping cough between 1920 and 1929 and 2,200 cases of measles in 1932. The first car, an Austin 7, was imported into the island in 1929. A census in 1931 showed a population of 3,995 (and a goat population of nearly 1,500). Cable & Wireless plc absorbed the Eastern Telegraph Company in 1934.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many months after the Ukrainian People's Republic was created was a Ukrainian declaration of independence from Russia made?","output":"Title: Unraveling the Timeline of Ukrainian Independence: The Path from the Ukrainian People's Republic to the Declaration of Independence Introduction Understanding the historical background of Ukraine is essential for exploring the complex relationships it shares with its neighbors, particularly Russia. One key moment in Ukraine's history that forms the basis of the country's statehood and identity is the Ukrainian People's Republic and the subsequent declaration of independence from Russia. This article delves into these events by asking: How many months after the creation of the Ukrainian People's Republic was a Ukrainian declaration of independence from Russia made? Background To answer this question, we must first explore the context in which these events unfolded. The early 20th century was marked by a turbulent period as the First World War occurred between 1914 and 1918. Amidst this chaos, the crumbling Russian Empire faced internal turmoil, giving rise to the February and October Revolutions of 1917. The Ukrainian territories, historically part of the Russian and Austro-Hungarian Empires, saw this as an opportunity to pursue national ambitions and shape their own destiny. Establishment of the Ukrainian People's Republic The establishment of the Ukrainian People's Republic (UNR) marked a significant step in the journey towards Ukrainian independence. The Bolsheviks’ control over the Russian government and their willingness to grant a certain level of autonomy to the non-Russian nations resulted in the creation of the UNR. The Ukrainian Central Rada, the governing body of the UNR, announced the establishment of the Ukrainian People's Republic on June 23, 1917, with its capital in Kyiv. At this stage, the UNR was not entirely independent from Russia and enjoyed a level of autonomy within the Russian Republic. The Declaration of Independence from Russia As the relationship between the UNR and Soviet Russia grew increasingly strained, the need for an official declaration of independence became apparent. By January 1918, the situation had reached a tipping point, and the Central Rada proclaimed the Ukrainian People's Republic's independence from Russia. On January 22, 1918, the Fourth Universal of the Central Rada formally severed all political and legal ties with Russia. This declaration was promptly followed by a war between the UNR and Soviet Russia, with the latter attempting to incorporate Ukraine into the newly-formed Soviet Union. Conclusion In conclusion, to answer the question posed initially, a Ukrainian declaration of independence from Russia was made six months after the creation of the Ukrainian People's Republic. While the UNR's existence was a milestone in the struggle for national identity, the Declaration of Independence on January 22, 1918, was a pivotal moment that established Ukraine as an independent entity, marking its determination to forge its own path amidst the complex dynamics of European geopolitics."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: What is a name of mission? Day of the Dead Answer:","output":"Title: Day of the Dead: Operation Requiem Genre: Action/Thriller Plot: In the heart of Mexico City, the annual Day of the Dead festival is underway, drawing millions of participants from all over the world. Unbeknownst to the festival-goers, a mysterious and powerful artifact has been hidden in the city's catacombs for centuries. This ancient relic has the power to open a supernatural gateway, allowing the dead to return to the world of the living. A notorious terrorist organization, The Divine Hand, led by the enigmatic and ruthless leader, General Alistair Mercado, is determined to seize the artifact and unleash chaos on the world. Mercado's carefully woven web of espionage has infiltrated the Mexican government and military, creating a dangerous atmosphere of uncertainty and distrust. When intelligence agencies around the world receive a tip-off about the impending catastrophe, they assemble a multinational team of elite Special Forces operatives named Operation Requiem. This team is the last hope in preventing the artifact from falling into the wrong hands. Their mission: to infiltrate the Day of the Dead festivities, locate and secure the artifact, and eliminate The Divine Hand. As the operation commences, the team members find themselves navigating through an increasingly complex and dangerous maze of clues. Meanwhile, they must stay one step ahead of Mercado's ruthless assassins and avoid the suspicion of local law enforcement. To complicate matters further, a rogue Mexican Marine, Lieutenant Sofia Isabella Ruiz, has taken matters into her own hands and is on her personal mission of vengeance against Mercado. As the intensity of the Day of the Dead festival reaches its peak, revelations about the true nature of the artifact begin to surface. The team discovers that the relic is actually a remnant of an ancient Aztec civilization that foretold the return of their god of death, Mictlantecuhtli. If the artifact is activated on the Day of the Dead, it would summon this god and cause an unstoppable cataclysm. In an action-fueled race against time, Operation Requiem must forge an uneasy alliance with Lieutenant Ruiz as they storm General Mercado's heavily secured stronghold. Just as the final explosive confrontation takes place, the agent entrusted with the artifact faces a life-changing decision: use the artifact's power for the greater good or destroy it and risk the wrath of Mictlantecuhtli. The fate of humanity hangs in the balance as Operation Requiem confronts the true meaning of sacrifice, forcing them to redefine their own code of honor and duty. In the ultimate battle of good versus evil, the Day of the Dead will go down in history as the day the world stood on the brink of annihilation, and a small group of heroes banded together to save it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Phase transitions are one obvious example. When a substance makes a transition from the liquid state to the gaseous state, the particles have many more possible arrangements, because they are no longer confined to a specified volume in which they are close to each other; gas particles can move freely throughout their container. Vaporization represents an increase in entropy. In the opposite direction, a liquid loses entropy when it freezes to a solid. Because solids have very ordered structures, there are fewer possible arrangements of particles that would result in the properties associated with a solid.  Paragraph: George is going camping and forgot to bring water with him. He decides to collect water from a nearby stream and boil it to make it safe for drinking.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will boiling the water increase or decrease entropy? The answer is:","output":"Boiling the water will increase entropy. Step 1: Understand the concepts of entropy and phase transitions Entropy is a measure of the number of possible arrangements of particles in a system. Phase transitions, such as vaporization (liquid to gas) and solidification (liquid to solid), involve changes in entropy. Step 2: Identify the phase transition in the given scenario In the camping paragraph, George is going to boil the water to make it safe for drinking. Boiling water involves the phase transition of liquid water turning into water vapor, which is a process of vaporization. Step 3: Determine the impact of the phase transition on entropy As mentioned in the background information, vaporization represents an increase in entropy because the particles have many more possible arrangements in the gaseous state compared to the liquid state. Step 4: Conclusion Based on the understanding of entropy and phase transitions, and considering that boiling water involves vaporization, we can conclude that boiling the water will increase entropy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

My heart shattered into a million pieces that weekend in February. I knew that I wanted the chance to bring home another live, healthy baby in my arms. I had some medical issues that would concern doctors during a uncomplicated pregnancy and would put me at high risk if, and that at the time was a big if I was able to get pregnant, and could I make it past the second trimester. I had doctors who supported my decision to try again, but my body wasn’t co operating. 2015. I got pregnant, straight on the medication I needed, lots of blood tests. Got a horrible sinking feeling something went wrong at the 6 week stage, bleeding at 8 weeks. At 9weeks of pregnancy, got a scan and no heartbeat was found. I choose the d&c operation, I couldn’t deal with seeing the miscarriage blood for days. I tried to convince myself to give up, move on. Wasn’t an easy thing to do, but the depression and sadness wasn’t fair to my 6 year old son. He needed his mummy who was always sad, in his mind. About 6 months later, I was having a scan. This time, I had a strong heart beat on screen. The pregnancy was extremely high risk, consultant led, daily injections, scans every 2 weeks from 18 weeks. No guarantees of a good outcome.

What did the writer end up having? - not enough information - A puppy instead of a baby - A baby girl - A baby boy Answer:","output":"The writer ended up having a baby girl. Her journey was difficult and filled with loss and heartache. After suffering the tragedy of losing her baby boy in February 2013 at 31 weeks, and facing various medical issues which put her at high risk during pregnancy, she still didn't lose hope. Somewhere around 2015, she was able to get pregnant again, but unfortunately, this pregnancy was also fraught with complications. At around six weeks, she experienced a foreboding sensation that something was wrong, and by the eighth week, she began bleeding. A scan at nine weeks revealed a devastating reality - no heartbeat was detected. Having chosen to go through a dilation and curettage (D&C operation), the ordeal was nothing short of rugged. Despite her attempts to convince herself to give up, she found herself, about six months later, looking at a scan that portrayed a steadily beating heart. This pregnancy was deemed extremely high risk and was monitored by a consultant lead. The author had to endure daily injections and frequent scans, but despite the harrowing journey and the anxiety it brought, she persisted and had a planned C-section at 38 weeks. In that moment, her hopes, courage, and persistence bore fruit - she gave birth to a healthy baby girl. Looking back, even after all the heartache, the fear, and the tribulations she went through, the author affirmed it was worth every single moment.

Martin Luther King Jr. won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. He also had a traveling Bible, the one that President Obama used when he was sworn in for a second term. Neither of these items is currently in the possession of any of King’s children. Neither of them is on display at the King Center, a memorial and nonprofit in Atlanta, or at any other museum. Instead, they are where they have been for nearly a year: Sitting in a safe deposit box in a bank, hidden from the public, as King’s children continue their latest legal fight. The argument is spilling into a courtroom this week, which could shed some light on who decides what happens to the two items. It comes as the holiday bearing King’s name looms, and also as King’s legacy and works are the subject of “Selma,” an Oscar contender that has been the subject of arguments regarding its depiction of King’s relationship with Lyndon B. Johnson. A hearing Tuesday could decide who should be in possession of the prize and the Bible. Last year, Dexter King and Martin Luther King III, two of his sons, voted that the estate should sell these two items. Bernice, their sister, disagreed. In a statement issued last February, after her brothers filed a court complaint, Bernice said she was “absolutely opposed to the selling of these extremely sacred items.” She went on to say: While I love my brothers dearly, this latest decision by them is extremely troubling. Not only am I appalled and utterly ashamed, I am frankly disappointed that they would even entertain the thought of selling these precious items. It reveals a desperation beyond comprehension. These items are worth quite a bit of money. Appraisers told the Associated Press that the Nobel Prize could go for anywhere from 5 million to 20 million. This would not be the first time some of King’s artifacts have been sold, either. Morehouse College in Atlanta hosts a collection of 10,000 notes, unpublished sermons and other items. The price for this collection was 32 million, according to Morehouse. A judge in Atlanta is hearing a legal battle between the children of the late Martin Luther King Jr. over ownership of his 1964 Nobel Peace Prize medal and his Bible. (Reuters) Robert C. I. McBurney, the Fulton County superior judge who is hearing the arguments Tuesday, ordered Bernice King to hand over the prize and Bible last year while the court figures out what to do with them. She gave up the itemsin March, and they have been under the court’s control since. The hearing Tuesday offers a familiar tableau: Members of King’s family engaged in an argument, either with each other or with someone else, over something involving King’s possessions. There was the announcement in 2005 that the King Center (controlled by Dexter King) would consider a sale to the National Park Service, which was followed by a news conference with Martin Luther King III saying he and Bernice King were unified in fighting “with those who would sell our father’s legacy.” There was the 2008 lawsuit involving how the estate’s money was being used and the counter-suit in response. There was also the suit that same year involving the three siblings differing over providing their mother’s papers and photographs to a biographer. These lawsuits aren’t limited just to members of the King family. King and, later, his estate, have tightly controlled use of the “I have a dream” speech and his likeness over the years, which resulted in lawsuits against CBS and USA Today for using it without the estate’s permission. (The King estate licensed his speeches for a movie that may be produced by Steven Spielberg, which is why the movie “Selma” does not include any of King’s historic remarks.) Coretta Scott King sued Boston University over 83,000 of her husband’s papers, but a jury ruled against her and the papers remain at the school, where King got his doctorate. In 2013, Harry Belafonte filed a lawsuit against three King children over who owned some of King’s papers (including an envelope King had in his pocket on the day he was assassinated in 1968). Meanwhile, this latest spat may not even be resolved after the hearing Tuesday. If this hearing ends without the items being given to either side, the dispute could go to a jury trial, which would begin Feb. 16, according to the court.

Rival magician Alfred Borden, in disguise, sneaks under the stage. At the trick's culmination, Angier drops through a trap door and into a waiting water tank, where Borden watches him drown. At Borden's murder trial, Angier's ingÃ©nieur, John Cutter testifies how Borden pushed the water tank under the trap door to catch and kill Angier during his New Transported Man trick. In prison, Borden is visited by an agent of Lord Caldlow, who offers to care for Borden's daughter Jess in exchange for all of Borden's tricks. As a show of good faith, Caldlow gives Borden a copy of Angier's diary, which Borden reads. In flashback, Angier and Borden work as shills for Milton the Magician, alongside ingÃ©nieur John Cutter and assistant Julia, who is also Angier's wife. Milton's famous trick is the water tank trick, where Julia is bound in ropes and dropped in a water tank, from which she frees herself and escapes. Borden, with Julia's consent, ties her hands with a more secure, yet difficult knot. Julia fails to slip the knot and drowns, infuriating Angier and fueling his deep-seated grudge against Borden.

In addition, it's important to recognize that 'selling' isn't necessarily meant in the traditional, commercial sense; pro bono cases are often taken on voluntarily by professionals, such as lawyers, who are not compensated financially for their work. Instead, the 'selling' in this context refers to the cases' appeal and the reasons professionals choose to contribute their time and expertise to pro bono cases. The \\"interesting, meaningful, and rewarding\\" nature of these cases attracts professionals and convinces them to take on these cases without financial compensation. It is also worth exploring the reasons why pro bono cases tend to be interesting, meaningful, and rewarding: 1. Novel legal challenges: Pro bono cases may push professionals to tackle new legal challenges, strategies, and techniques that they might not encounter in conventional, paid cases. The opportunity to work on groundbreaking or unusual legal problems can be intriguing and professionally satisfying. 2. Social impact: Pro bono cases often involve clients or organizations that do not have access to adequate legal resources due to limited financial means. Working on these cases allows professionals to contribute to a larger social good and advocate for disadvantaged individuals or groups. 3. Personal and professional development: Taking on pro bono cases often necessitates honing new skills and expanding existing knowledge on particular subjects. This growth not only strengthens professional abilities but also keeps individuals engaged and motivated. 4. Networking opportunities: Pro bono cases may open doors to working with other experts, non-profit organizations, and individuals involved in social causes. These connections can prove valuable for future collaborations, knowledge sharing, and developing a more holistic understanding of the legal landscape. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"Pro bono cases aren't really selling because they aren't interesting or meaningful in any way\\" is inconsistent with the provided premise. The premise establishes that pro bono cases do sell because of their interesting, meaningful, and rewarding aspects. Pro bono cases offer unique challenges, social impact, personal and professional growth, and networking opportunities that appeal to professionals and motivate them to contribute their time and expertise."},{"instruction":"This is a correct answer to the following question about American Civil War.

During glaciation, these valleys are widened, deepened, and smoothed, forming a \\"U\\"-shaped glacial valley. The erosion that creates glacial valleys eliminates the spurs of earth that extend across mountain valleys, creating triangular cliffs called truncated spurs. Within glacial valleys, depressions created by plucking and abrasion can be filled by lakes, called paternoster lakes. If a glacial valley runs into a large body of water, it forms a fjord. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What do glacial valleys run into to form paternoster lakes?","output":"Sure, I can explain that a bit more! Glacial valleys don't \\"run into\\" anything to create paternoster lakes. Instead, these lakes are formed within the glacial valley itself. Imagine you're playing in the sandbox, and you're dragging your shovel through the sand to make a valley. Sometimes, if you lift your shovel a bit more or push a bit less hard, you'll leave behind little \\"pockets\\" or hollows in the sand. If it rained into your sandbox, these \\"pockets\\" could fill up with water and become tiny lakes!  That's pretty much the same way paternoster lakes form in a glacial valley. The glacier, which is like the huge ice shovel, moves through the mountain valley carving it out. But in some places, it carves out deeper areas than the rest, which are like those \\"pockets\\" in your sandbox.

Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"The answer provided does not correctly answer the question. The question asks for the percentage of Iran's population who were internet users in 2014, whereas the answer talks about Facebook usage in Iran. In order to correctly answer the question, we need to find the relevant data. Step-by-step process to answer the question: 1. Research the population of Iran in 2014. 2. Research the number of internet users in Iran in 2014. 3. Calculate the percentage of the population using the internet by dividing the number of internet users by the total population and multiplying by 100. After researching, we find that: 1. The population of Iran in 2014 was approximately 77.45 million. 2. The number of internet users in Iran in 2014 was approximately 42.3 million.

Process: - Coal is heated in the boiler - The water tank over the boiler is heated - Creates steam - The steam is funneled to the piston - Piston uses the steam as energy - The piston causes the crankshaft to move.  Question: suppose more cooling occurs happens, how will it affect LESS power produced by the steam engine.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"Let's analyze the effects of more cooling on a steam engine's power production, step by step: 1. Coal is heated in the boiler: More cooling will require more energy to maintain the temperature for heating coal. This could make the heating process less efficient. 2. The water tank over the boiler is heated: With more cooling, the water will take more time to reach the desired temperature, again making the heating process less efficient. 3. Creates steam: As the water is taking longer to heat up due to increased cooling, the rate at which steam is produced would also be less. 4. The steam is funneled to the piston: With a lower rate of steam production, there will be less steam being funneled to the piston. 5. Piston uses the steam as energy: Since the piston has less steam to work with, the energy it receives is reduced. Therefore, the piston's movements might become slower or weaker. 6. The piston causes the crankshaft to move: With less energy from the piston, the movements of the crankshaft will also be reduced. From the above analysis, we can conclude that when more cooling occurs, the power produced by the steam engine is affected and is generally less than under normal conditions. The perturbation of more cooling influences the second effect (water heating) by causing the process to become less efficient and take longer, which subsequently has a cascading impact on the entire system and results in less power being produced."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

We want to get 'v' all by itself. Right now, the equation looks like this, right?  -123*v + 1984 = 1492 First thing we should do is make that +1984 disappear from the left side. To do that we do the opposite, we subtract 1984 from both sides. Let's do that: If we subtract 1984 from both sides,  on the left side, +1984 and -1984 will cancel each other out and disappear, and on the right side, we will have 1492 - 1984 which equals -492. So now, our equation looks like this: -123*v = -492 Now we just have to get rid of the -123 that's attached to the 'v'. To do this, we do the opposite of multiplying which is dividing. We divide by -123 on both sides. When we divide -492 by -123 we get 4.  So 'v', the one we were finding, is equal to 4.

However, this is an indirect impact, as it affects the overall health of the forest and the potential for new trees to establish themselves in the area. 2. The trees die off: This step is directly impacted by the presence of dead trees in the forest, as they contribute to the overall death of trees in the ecosystem. 3. The dead material provides nutrients for more trees: The dead trees can potentially provide nutrients to the soil, boosting the growth of new trees. This would be an indirect impact on this step. 4.

See a doctor before you start doing any exercises or taking any medication.","output":"The most logical next event after acknowledging hip pain and understanding the importance of getting a diagnosis would be to make an appointment with a healthcare professional who can provide a diagnosis. This would often be a general practitioner, but could also be a physical therapist or an orthopedist depending on the resources available to you and the severity of the pain. During this appointment, you should prepare to share with your doctor a detailed history of your problem, including the exact location of your pain, when you first noticed it, any possible incidents that may have triggered it, and how it has been impacting your daily activities. You should also indicate any previous treatments or diagnosis that you have sought before for hip pain. Your doctor will likely ask a plethora of questions to understand your situation better.  Your doctor will then perform some physical tests to assess your conditions, such as examining your hip joint's range of motion, strength, and evaluating your gait. If needed, your doctor might recommend specific diagnostic tests including X-rays, MRI scans, ultrasound, or blood tests in order to get a clear understanding of what's causing your hip pain. Based on the findings of both your health history and the results of these tests, your healthcare professional will diagnose your condition. This could range from conditions like arthritis, bursitis, hip fractures to various other possibilities depending upon the specific symptoms and the results of the diagnostic tests.  Once you have a diagnosis, the next logical event would be to discuss the treatment options with your healthcare professional. This will typically involve a combination of pain management options, physical therapy exercises, lifestyle changes, and possibly surgical options in severe cases. The treatment options vary greatly depending on the underlying cause of the hip pain. The most critical part of this stage is patient compliance and follow through. Implementing and maintaining the prescribed treatment is crucial to managing hip pain effectively. Remember, it may take some time before the treatment starts showing results. Therefore, patience and persistence are important during this phase. Next, ensure that you schedule follow-up appointments with your healthcare provider to monitor your progress, adjust treatment plans as needed, and ensure that you are on the way to recovery. To sum up, the most logical next event after acknowledging hip pain and understanding the importance of diagnosis is to secure an appointment with a healthcare professional. The subsequent steps would involve going through the diagnosis process, resulting in a treatment plan to suit the specific situation.

UPDATED:. 08:07 EST, 10 July 2013. China's trade declined abruptly in June in a sign growth in the world's second-largest economy might be cooling even more sharply than expected. Exports fell by 3.1 per cent compared with a year earlier and imports contracted by 0.7 per cent, customs data showed today. Both were below forecasts of growth in the low single digits. China's economic growth has slowed this year and is expected to fall further due to weak global demand and an effort by the Chinese central bank to cool a credit boom. Slump: A view of the Yangshan Deepwater Port in Shanghai. Exports from. China have fallen by 3.1% and imports contracted by 0.7%. 'The export sector is faring very badly. It does suggest overall growth momentum is going to be weaker than we initially expected,' said Societe General economist Wei Yao. New communist leaders who took power last year say they want to pursue slower, more self-sustaining growth based on domestic consumption, reducing reliance on trade and investment. But some analysts say the latest slowdown might be so deep they could be forced to temporarily reverse course and boost lending or government spending to stimulate growth. A decline in Chinese economic activity could have global repercussions, denting revenues for suppliers of commodities and industrial components such as Australia, Brazil and Southeast Asia. Lower Chinese demand already has depressed global prices for iron ore, copper and other raw materials, cooling an economic boom for exporters. The ruling party's growth target this year is 7.5 per cent, down by almost half from 2007's staggering growth rate of 14.2 per cent. Some analysts have suggested growth might dip below 7 per cent in coming months - dangerously low by Chinese standards. Some analysts have suggested growth might dip below 7% in coming months - dangerously low by Chinese standards. Some private sector forecasters cut their growth outlook for the year, though to still robust levels above 7 percent, after a credit crunch hit China's financial markets last month. That came as the central bank tried to rein in a lending boom regulators worry could spiral out of control. 'The most likely outcome, in our view, is the Chinese economy going through a period of sluggish growth and adjustment,' said UBS economist Tao Wang in a report this week. Communist leaders have promised to promote private businesses that generate most of China's new jobs and wealth but have yet to make major changes. Retail sales have fallen short of official forecasts and a HSBC Corp. survey of manufacturers showed activity contracted in June for a second month. Still, Chinese leaders are unlikely to back away from efforts to overhaul the country's growth model, said Societe Generale's Yao. 'The plan is still to induce some short-term pain in exchange for long-term sustainability,' said Yao. 'That is still the most sensible choice, but sure, they need to make some marginal adjustments to make sure the economy doesn't slow too fast.' China's new communist leaders who took power last year say they want to pursue slower, more self-sustaining growth based on domestic consumption, reducing reliance on trade and investment. Analysts expected China to report slower growth in trade due to a crackdown on misreporting of data by exporters as a way to evade currency controls and bring extra money into the country. But even with that taken into account, Wednesday's figures were below forecasts for exports to rise by up to 3.5 percent and imports to grow by up to 1.5 per cent. June's export growth was down from May's year-on-year gain of 13.5 per cent and import growth was down from 8.2 per cent. China's politically sensitive global trade surplus contracted by 12.4 per cent compared with a year earlier to 27.1 billion. Exports were 174.3 billion while imports were 147.2 billion. Growth in exports to the United States, China's biggest foreign market, fell to 1.8 percent from May's 3.5 percent. Exports to the 27-nation European Union contracted 3.9 per cent. The trade surplus with the U.S. contracted by 15.5 percent from a year earlier to 17.5 billion, but still one of this year's highest levels. The surplus with Europe shrank 20.3 per cent to 10.2 billion. Highlights:","output":"1.

The film adopts a linear plot. Ice Quake is an action film about the Alaskan landscape, where there is a great threat that is going to affect the beautiful and gentle scenery. Under the permafrost, organic materials have been rotting for thousands of years and the compound is very deadly to the planet. As the permafrost thaws, underground volatile liquid methane and gases are created which causes a succession of violent and very destructive earthquakes. A family ends up going to this Alaskan landscape on the hunt for a Christmas tree, hoping to have fun, and unfortunately finds out firsthand how deadly this can be. As they are exploring these mountains,  their dog runs away for an unknown reason and soon after there is an explosion of gas from underneath the ice that ends up causing an avalanche. The family has to run for their lives. The father takes charge and tries to lead them to safety when suddenly another tremor occurs. This time, it causes the ground to split open, creating a deep ravine dividing the family apart - the parents on one side and two children on the other. They cannot group back together as there is dangerous gas flowing out the ravine so the father tell them to go to the summit and wait for rescue. The children head up to top to then find out there is a storm on their way causing more concern. The younger brother suggests they keep moving until they can stop at a safe place As this chaos is going on, the military based around the mountain are investigating the tremors.

He is looking at two samples of soil, sample A and sample B. Sample A is from Amazon Rain-forest, where they get one of the highest rainfall in the world. Sample B is from the Atacama Desert, where they get one of the lowest rainfall in the world. He needs to determine the properties of these samples.  Would new surfaces be exposed or stay covered in sample A? Answer:","output":"As an environmental scientist, Rob would analyze the properties of the soil samples from both the Amazon Rainforest (Sample A) and the Atacama Desert (Sample B). Each sample would have distinct characteristics due to the different environmental conditions in these regions. Sample A - Amazon Rainforest: The Amazon Rainforest is known for its high rainfall, which can significantly impact the properties of the soil. This high rainfall would likely lead to increased rates of weathering, erosion, and transportation of soil particles. In the Amazon Rainforest, the soil is often covered with a thick layer of organic matter due to the high rate of decomposition of plant material. Paired with a warm and moist climate, this environment provides ideal conditions for lush vegetation and biodiversity. In the Amazon Rainforest, new surfaces would generally be exposed rather than staying covered. When heavy rainfall occurs, the rainwater would flow downhill, washing away the topsoil and decomposing leaf litter. This process exposes new surfaces as the original layers of soil are removed, revealing the underlying layers. Additionally, the roots from plants and trees could penetrate and break up the soil, contributing to the exposure of new surfaces as they grow deeper. Sample B - Atacama Desert: The Atacama Desert is known for its extremely low rainfall, making it one of the driest places on Earth. This arid environment results in minimal weathering, erosion, and transportation of soil particles. The soil in the Atacama Desert typically consists of sandy and rocky materials with little to no organic matter due to the lack of vegetation and scarce water availability. In the Atacama Desert, surfaces would tend to stay covered rather than being exposed. The infrequent rainfall means there is minimal natural water flow to wash away or expose new surfaces in the soil. The vegetation is also sparse and unable to penetrate or disturb the soil significantly to expose new surfaces. Evaporation rates would be higher than water infiltration rates in the soil, so the surface layer would remain dry and static most of the time. In conclusion, in Sample A from the Amazon Rainforest, new surfaces would generally be exposed due to high rainfall, erosion, and the presence of dense vegetation. On the other hand, Sample B from the Atacama Desert would likely exhibit surfaces that remain covered, owing to the scarcity of rainfall and sparse vegetation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: The disputed South China Sea will soon see increased U.S. military activity from five Philippine bases, following the signing of a deal between Manila and Washington that will allow the Pentagon to deploy conventional forces to the Philippines for the first time in decades. The deal — called an Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement — was reached Friday between State Department officials and the government of the Philippines, and will allow the Pentagon to use parts of five military installations: Antonio Bautista Air Base, Basa Air Base, Fort Magsaysay, Lumbia Air Base, and Mactan-Benito Ebuen Air Base. It comes at a time when the United States and its allies in the region have expressed concern about China increasingly deploying military assets to man-made islands in the South China Sea. China has laid claim to a number of islands in the South China Sea, building airbases on tiny spits of land while installing powerful radar and missile launchers. Here's why. (Jason Aldag,Julie Vitkovskaya/The Washington Post) State Department spokesman John Kirby, a retired two-star Navy admiral, said that the United States has “made absolutely no bones about the fact that we take the rebalance to the Asia Pacific region very seriously.” But he added that there is “nothing offensive or provocative” about any of the Pentagon’s deployment of troops to the region. [China testing Obama as it expands its influence in Southeast Asia] “It’s not about selling it to the Chinese or to anybody,” Kirby said, under questioning during a media briefing. “It’s about meeting our security commitments in a serious alliance with the Philippines. That’s what this is about.” The map above shows where the bases are. Antonio Bautista Air Base, on the island of Palawan, is a few dozen miles east of the disputed Spratly Islands, where China’s military buildup is underway. Basa Air Base is also near the South China Sea, and is in a rural area outside Manila. Bautista Air Base is the closest installation the Philippines has to the Spratlys, according to Philippine air force. Other bases were considered, according to Philippine media reports, but ultimately not included in the agreement. China raised questions about the plan Monday, saying that cooperation between the United States and the Philippines should not harm the sovereignty or security interests of any other country. “The U.S. has talked about militarization in the South China Sea. But can it explain whether its own increased military deployment in the region is equivalent to militarization?” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a media briefing, according to Xinhua, a state-run news agency. The United States had a conventional military presence in the Philippines for nearly a century until 1991, when the country ordered the U.S. military to leave its naval base in Subic Bay after the countries could not reach an agreement on the extension of a lease. A U.S. Special Operations task force was based in the Philippines for 13 years after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, but was phased out last year in favor of keeping a small amount of U.S. troops nearby to assist Philippine forces in their fight against Islamist militants.

The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  Paragraph: Greg is studying the environmental impact of agriculture. He noticed that in his own state a lake near agricultural lands has been declared as a dead zone. For his study Greg labeled this zone as zone A. Then he found near a national park in his state a lake is not declared as a dead zone. To further his study he labeled this zone as zone B.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would zone B see less or more organisms than zone A? Answer:","output":"Given the information presented, Zone B would likely see more organisms than Zone A. The reason is due to fertilizers from agricultural lands impacting the environment of the local bodies of water. In Zone A, by the agricultural lands, the runoff from the land seems to carry fertilizers into the lake. These fertilizers, rich in nitrogen, stimulate excessive growth of algae, a condition known as eutrophication. The proliferation of algae eventually depletes the water's oxygen levels as they die and decompose, creating a 'dead zone' where life can't be sustained due to the lack of oxygen. Therefore, the number of organisms in Zone A would be significantly lower. In contrast, Zone B is near a national park, likely meaning that there is less human agricultural activity and therefore less artificial fertilizer runoff to the nearby lake. This would mean less nitrogen-induced algal blooms, leading to healthier oxygen levels in the water. With a balanced aquatic ecosystem, a variety of life-forms can thrive, leading to a greater number of organisms in Zone B as compared to Zone A."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. I was a bit jet-lagged and wondering around Downtown Fremont when I felt the pangs of hunger hit my stomach. I grabbed my phone and used my mobile Yelp app to take a look at my options. That is how I found this nifty little gem.  I sat at the table and before looking at the menu I was looking through yelp reviews (I know, it's a problem). It seems pancakes were the popular choice, but I didn't want to be swayed by my fellow yelpers. My friend and I decided to split a short order of pancakes and a chicken fried steak and eggs.  Service was excellent, everyone was friendly, and the food came out fast.  The Chicken Fried Steak wasn't bad, but I've definitely had better. Nothing particularly special about it, the gravy, the eggs, or homefries. I may be a bit biased since I've already found the best Chicken Fried Steak this side of the world (in Fountain Valley, CA no less). A bit pricey for what you get, IMO.  The pancakes, on the other hand, were out of this world! They were lightly crispy, or glazed? Yet they remained fluffy and buttery in the middle. They never broke apart or crumpled, nor were they chewy. The most perfect pancakes! They were heavenly.  I might consider trying their other items on the menu (maybe in time for their midnight- 7 am specials), and I will definitely come back for pancakes!  I have dreams about them now. Damn you, Vegas. What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is mostly positive. The reviewer found the place through the Yelp app, enjoyed the fast service and friendly staff, loved the pancakes, and even dreams about them! The only negative point was about the chicken fried steak and the eggs - the reviewer said they weren't anything special and that it was a bit pricey for what they got. But overall, they liked the place enough to consider returning again."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Doctors say obesity,also known as severe overweight,is a complex condition.A doctor may advise medical interventions  in addition to changes in behavior.But experts say the more successful weightloss plans include a wellbalanced diet and exercise. People who want to avoid weight gain have to balance the number of calories they eat with the number of calories they use.To lose weight,you can reduce the number of calories you take in,or increase the number you use,or both.Experts at the National Institutes of Health say to lose weight,a person should do some moderate or intensive physical exercise most days of the week.This could include fast walking,sports or strength training. A recent study looked at four of the most popular dieting plans in the United States.Researchers at Stanford University studied more than three hundred overweight women,mostly in their thirties or forties.Each woman went on one of the four plans:Atkins,The Zone,Ornish or LEARN.The women attended diet classes and received written information about the food plans.At the end of a year,the women on the Atkins diet had lost the most,more than four and a half kilograms on average. Christopher Gardner led the study,reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. He said the Atkins diet may be more successful because of its simple message to lower the intake of sugar.Also,he said the advice to increase protein in the diet leads to more satisfying meals. But last week,another report suggested that only a small minority of people have longterm success in dieting.Researchers at the University of California found that most dieters regained their lost weight within five years.And often they gained back even more.But those who kept the weight off generally were the ones who exercised. Question: Which one of the following is NOT right according to this passage? Options: A: The change of your life habits can help you lose weight. B: You'd better exercise once a week to lose some weight. C: The Atkins diet may be good because of lowering the intake of sugar. D: Some people gain weight back for their unhealthy diet. A:","output":"B: You'd better exercise once a week to lose some weight.

Movie title: Mother and Son Movie plot: The film opens on two human forms, which soon reveal themselves to be that of a young man and a frail old woman. They recline in a silence broken only by whispers and indistinguishable noises. The young man is the son (Alexei Ananishnov) who is taking care of his exhausted sick mother (Gudrun Geyer). Her illness is undefined and from time to time causes her great pain as she gasps for air. Her son combs her hair, feeds her, covers her with a coat, and takes her in his arms. She is totally dependent on him as he himself was once totally dependent on her. As the film progresses, the son carries his mother on a long journey from her sickbed to her deathbed. It is a circular motion which travels a long walk through a dreamlike landscape in the countryside, along winding dirt roads. At each of their brief stops on the journey is a moment of contemplation, caresses, and tender murmurs. These soft murmurs tell of the mother's love for her son when she was nurturing him and of the son's love for his mother as he opens for her the mysterious path to her death. They progress under the leaden and luminous sky of the Baltic, in totally isolated landscapes. From time to time, there is a far away train or a sail on the sea, emphasizing further their isolation from the rest of the world. They return to the house. The son tenderly lowers his mother into her bed that now seems to resemble a coffin. Although he tries to reassure her to the contrary they both know that the end is coming. He leaves her and goes for a long solitary walk. When he returns he weeps for his mother who's died.

Answer the following question: Given the following context:  Conquistadors often wore steel armour that included chainmail and helmets. The Spanish were sufficiently impressed by the quilted cotton armour of their Maya enemies that they adopted it in preference to their own steel armour. Maya weaponry was not sufficiently powerful to justify the discomfort of wearing European armour. Quilted cotton armour, although still uncomfortably hot, was flexible and weighed much less. The Maya armour was adapted by the Spanish, who used knee-length quilted cotton tunics and Spanish-style caps. Horsemen wore long quilted cotton leg protectors; their horses were also protected with padded cotton armour. After the final push to the Petén lakes in early 1697, the Spanish recorded that they left with their garrison over 50 Dutch- and French-made muskets, three 1-pound (0.45 kg) calibre light cannons (piezas) cast from iron and mounted on carriages, four iron and two bronze pedreros (2-chambered stone-launchers) and six of at least eight bronze light cannons (known as esmiriles).  answer the following question:  Who had six of at least eight bronze cannons?

Given the below context:  Drilling fluids are necessary for borehole stability in deep cores, and can also be used to circulate cuttings away from the bit.  Fluids used include water, ethanol/water and water/ethylene glycol mixtures, petroleum fuels, non-aromatic hydrocarbons, and n-butyl acetate. Water is the cheapest and cleanest option; it may be present on the glacial surface or may be created by thermal drilling.  In cold ice some form of antifreeze is necessary, or heat must be reapplied by reaming the hole periodically. Ethanol and water.  Ethanol acts as an anti-freeze in water; at sufficient concentrations it can reduce the freezing temperature of the mixture to well below any temperature likely to be encountered in ice drilling.  The concentration must be chosen to prevent the liquid freezing and also to maintain the borehole against the ice overburden pressure.  Because the density of the mixture decreases with lower temperatures, vertical convection will develop in boreholes where temperatures decrease with depth, as the lighter mixture rises.  This causes slush to form in the borehole, though successful drilling is still possible.  Ethanol is one of the cheapest options for a drilling fluid, and requires less storage space than other options because in use it is diluted with water.  A Soviet expedition left an 800 m borehole in Antarctica filled with ethanol and water at an ice temperature of −53 °C; after 11 months the borehole remained open and drilling was resumed with no problems.  A problem with this option is that the mixture will penetrate cores that have cracks. Ethylene glycol and water was used at Camp Century in 1966 in the lower part of the hole to dissolve the cuttings. Petroleum fuels.  This includes diesel, jet fuel, and kerosene.

It is the 14th largest city in the European Union. It is also the historical capital of Bohemia. Situated in the north-west of the country on the Vltava river, the city is home to about 1.26 million people, while its larger urban zone is estimated to have a population of nearly 2 million. The city has a temperate climate, with warm summers and chilly winters.  - A libertine is one devoid of most moral or sexual restraints, which are seen as unnecessary or undesirable, especially one who ignores or even spurns accepted morals and forms of behaviour sanctified by the larger society. Libertinism is described as an extreme form of hedonism. Libertines put value on physical pleasures, meaning those experienced through the senses. As a philosophy, libertinism gained new-found adherents in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, particularly in France and Great Britain. Notable among these were John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, and the Marquis de Sade.  - Don Giovanni (K. 527; complete title: , literally \\"The Rake Punished, namely Don Giovanni\\" or \\"The Libertine Punished\\") is an opera in two acts with music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Italian libretto by Lorenzo Da Ponte. It is based on the legends of Don Juan, a fictional libertine and seducer. It was premiered by the Prague Italian opera at the National Theater (of Bohemia), now called the Estates Theatre, on 29 October 1787. Da Ponte's libretto was billed as a \\"dramma giocoso\\", a common designation of its time that denotes a mixing of serious and comic action. Mozart entered the work into his catalogue as an \\"opera buffa\\". Although sometimes classified as comic, it blends comedy, melodrama and supernatural elements.  - Mariano Padilla y Ramos ( 1842 -- 21 November 1906 ) was a Spanish operatic baritone who excelled in the title role of Mozart 's Don Giovanni .  - Don Juan (Spanish), Don Giovanni (Italian) is a legendary, fictional libertine. The first written version of the \\"Don Juan\\" legend was written by the Spanish dramatist Tirso de Molina (\\"nom de plume\\" of Gabriel Téllez). His play, \\"El burlador de Sevilla y convidado de piedra\\" (\\"The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest\\"), was set in the fourteenth century and published in Spain around 1630. The name \\"Don Juan\\" is a common metaphor for a \\"womanizer\\".  - Dramma giocoso (Italian, literally: drama with jokes; plural: \\"drammi giocosi\\") is a genre of opera common in the mid-18th century. The term is a contraction of \\"dramma giocoso per musica\\" and describes the opera's libretto (text). The genre developed in the Neapolitan opera tradition, mainly through the work of the playwright Carlo Goldoni in Venice. A \\"dramma giocoso\\" characteristically used a grand \\"buffo\\" (comic or farce) scene as a dramatic climax at the end of an act. Goldoni's texts always consisted of two long acts with extended finales, followed by a short third act. Composers Baldassare Galuppi, Niccolò Piccinni, and Joseph Haydn set Goldoni's texts to music.  - Lorenzo Da Ponte (10 March 174917 August 1838) was an Italian, later American opera librettist, poet and Roman Catholic priest. He wrote the libretti for 28 operas by 11 composers, including three of Mozart's greatest operas, \\"Don Giovanni\\", \\"The Marriage of Figaro\\" and \\"Così fan tutte\\".  - The Estates Theatre or Stavovské divadlo is a historic theatre in Prague, Czech Republic. The Estates Theatre was annexed to the National Theatre in 1948 and currently draws on three artistic ensembles, opera, ballet, and drama, which perform at the Estates Theatre, the National Theatre, and the (separate building, Kolowrat Palace).

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Planet Neptune is not only very cold but also farther from the Sun than the Earth. In fact, it is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. On the other hand, the Earth enjoys a close proximity to the Sun. Only Mercury and Venus are closer to the Sun than the Earth.  Which planet would travel longer distance, Neptune or Earth?  Hint: According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: A:","output":"To determine which planet, Neptune or Earth, would travel a longer distance, we must first consider the factors that affect their orbits, distances, and speeds, as mentioned in the question. Neptune, being the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system, is situated at an average distance of 30.1 astronomical units (AU) where 1 AU is the average distance between Earth and Sun (approximately 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers). Earth, on the other hand, is positioned at an average 1 AU from the Sun. It's important to note that both planets have elliptical orbits, causing variations in their distances from the Sun throughout their respective years. Since the planets in our solar system all revolve around the Sun in a counterclockwise direction, as seen from above the Sun's north pole, they share the same orbital path. However, their orbital periods, or the time it takes for one revolution around the Sun, vary depending on their distances from the Sun. The farther a planet is from the Sun, the longer its sidereal period (year) and the slower its speed due to weaker gravitational influence from the Sun. Neptune's sidereal period is approximately 164.8 Earth years, while Earth's sidereal period is simply 1 Earth year. The orbits are not perfectly circular; thus, the planets experience varying distances from the Sun as they travel along their orbits. The closest approach is called perihelion (periastron for planets outside our solar system), and the farthest separation is called aphelion (apastron for planets outside our solar system). As a planet approaches perihelion, it speeds up, exchanging gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy. Conversely, it slows down as it approaches aphelion. Now to answer the question: which planet would travel a longer distance, Neptune or Earth? Let's calculate the circumference of their orbits using the average distance from the Sun as the radius. C = 2 * π * radius C_Earth = 2 * π * (1 AU) ≈ 6.283 AU C_Neptune = 2 * π * (30.1 AU) ≈ 189.3 AU Comparing the two results, it becomes evident that Neptune travels a significantly longer distance compared to Earth due to its much larger orbit. In one Neptunian year (164.8 Earth years), Neptune covers a distance of about 189.3 AU, while Earth covers approximately 6.283 AU in one Earth year.  To summarize, Neptune travels a longer distance in its orbit around the Sun compared to Earth, due to its greater distance from the Sun and larger orbital circumference. The slow speed at which Neptune travels is a result of being less affected by the Sun's gravity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: Information:  - An oxide is a chemical compound that contains at least one oxygen atom and one other element in its chemical formula. \\"Oxide\\" itself is the dianion of oxygen, an O atom. Metal oxides thus typically contain an anion of oxygen in the oxidation state of 2. Most of the Earth's crust consists of solid oxides, the result of elements being oxidized by the oxygen in air or in water. Hydrocarbon combustion affords the two principal carbon oxides: carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Even materials considered pure elements often develop an oxide coating. For example, aluminium foil develops a thin skin of AlO (called a passivation layer) that protects the foil from further corrosion. Individual elements can often form multiple oxides, each containing different amounts of the element and oxygen. In some cases these are distinguished by specifying the number of atoms as in carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, and in other cases by specifying the element's oxidation number, as in iron(II) oxide and iron(III) oxide. Certain elements can form many different oxides, such those of nitrogen.  - Koskullskulle is a locality situated in Gällivare Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden with 874 inhabitants in 2010.  - Magnetite is a mineral and one of the main iron ores. With the chemical formula FeO, it is one of the oxides of iron. Magnetite is ferrimagnetic; it is attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a permanent magnet itself. It is the most magnetic of all the naturally-occurring minerals on Earth. Naturally-magnetized pieces of magnetite, called lodestone, will attract small pieces of iron, which is how ancient peoples first discovered the property of magnetism. Today it is mined as iron ore.  - The polar night occurs when the night lasts for more than 24 hours. This occurs only inside the polar circles. The opposite phenomenon, the polar day, or midnight sun, occurs when the Sun stays above the horizon for more than 24 hours. \\"Night\\" is understood as the center of the Sun being below a free horizon. Since the atmosphere bends the rays of the Sun, the polar day is longer than the polar night, and the area that is affected by polar night is somewhat smaller than the area of midnight sun. The polar circle is located at a latitude between these two areas, at the latitude of approximately 66.5 degrees. In the most northern city of Sweden, Kiruna, at 67°51'N, the polar night lasts for around 28 twenty-four-hour periods, while the midnight sun lasts around 50 twenty-four-hour periods.  - Hematite, also spelled as haematite, is the mineral form of iron(III) oxide (FeO), one of several iron oxides. Hematite crystallizes in the rhombohedral lattice system, and it has the same crystal structure as ilmenite and corundum. Hematite and ilmenite form a complete solid solution at temperatures above .  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.  - Luleå (Lule Sami \\"Luleju\\") is a city on the coast of northern Sweden, and the capital of Norrbotten County, the northernmost county in Sweden. Luleå has about 75,000 inhabitants and is the seat of Luleå Municipality (with a total population of 75,921).  - Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (72.4% Fe), hematite (69.9% Fe), goethite (62.9% Fe), limonite or siderite (48.2% Fe).  - Luleå Municipality is a municipality in Norrbotten County in northern Sweden. Its seat is located in Luleå, which is also the county seat of Norrbotten County.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - The Main Line Through Upper Norrland is a long railway line between Bräcke, Jämtland County and Boden, Norrbotten County in Sweden. For military and regional policy reasons, it was built in very sparsely populated areas, far away from the more densely populated coast. The line has several branches to settlements on the coast, the ones to Umeå and Luleå being considered part of the line itself. Today the three largest settlements along the line are Boden (pop 18800), Älvsbyn (pop 5500) and Vännäs (pop 4100).  - Iore, often stylized IORE, is a class of 34 electric locomotives built by Adtranz and its successor Bombardier Transportation for the Swedish mining company LKAB's railway division Malmtrafik. The class is a variation of Adtranz's Octeon modular product platform, thus related to Bombardier's later TRAXX platform. The locomotives haul iron ore freight trains on the Iron Ore Line and Ofoten Line in Sweden and Norway, respectively. The 68-car trains are hauled by two single-ended CoCo locomotives, each with a power output of . Each operates with tractive effort and has a maximum speed of . Delivery of the first series of 18 locomotives was made from 2000 to 2004, and they replaced some of the aging Dm3 and El 15 units. In 2007, eight more vehicles (4 double units) were ordered, with production to be completed by 2011, by which time, another four double units were ordered. These units are scheduled to be delivered from 2013 to 2014.  - Iron is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from ) and atomic number 26. It is a metal in the first transition series. It is by mass the most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust. Its abundance in rocky planets like Earth is due to its abundant production by fusion in high-mass stars, where it is the last element to be produced with release of energy before the violent collapse of a supernova, which scatters the iron into space.  - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - A mineral is a naturally occurring chemical compound, usually of crystalline form and abiogenic in origin. A mineral has one specific chemical composition, whereas a rock can be an aggregate of different minerals or mineraloids. The study of minerals is called mineralogy.  - Northern or North Sami (disapproved exonym Lappish or Lapp), sometimes also simply referred to as Sami, is the most widely spoken of all Sami languages. The area where Northern Sami is spoken covers the northern parts of Norway, Sweden and Finland. The number of Northern Sami speakers is estimated to be somewhere between 15,000 and 25,000. About 2,000 of these live in Finland and between 5,000 and 6,000 in Sweden.  - The Sami people (also Sámi or Saami, traditionally known in English as Lapps or Laplanders) are an indigenous Finno-Ugric people inhabiting the Arctic area of Sápmi, which today encompasses parts of far northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Kola Peninsula of Russia. The Sami are the only indigenous people of Scandinavia recognized and protected under the international conventions of indigenous peoples, and are hence the northernmost indigenous people of Europe. Sami ancestral lands are not well-defined. Their traditional languages are the Sami languages and are classified as a branch of the Uralic language family.  - Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag (LKAB) is a Swedish mining company. The company mines iron ore at Kiruna and at Malmberget in northern Sweden. The company was established in 1890, and has been 100% state-owned since the 1950s. The iron ore is processed to pellets and sinter fines, which are transported by Iore trains (Malmbanan) to the harbours at Narvik and Luleå and to the steelmill at Luleå (SSAB).   - Svappavaara is a locality situated in Kiruna Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden with 417 inhabitants in 2010. It is a mining village. Mining was started around 1650. Large scale iron mining started in 1965. The mine was closed in 1983, but enrichment of iron ore from the mine at Kiruna is still going on. The mine is owned by LKAB, and there is an ongoing project to open it again for production around year 2015.  - Narvik is located on the shores of the Ofotfjorden. The municipality is part of the traditional district of Ofoten of Northern Norway, inside the Arctic Circle. The municipality of Narvik borders the municipality of Ballangen to the southwest, Evenes to the northwest, Bardu, Gratangen, Lavangen and Skånland (in Troms county) to the north, and Norrbotten County (Lapland) in Sweden to the south and east.  - Limonite is an iron ore consisting of a mixture of hydrated iron(III) oxide-hydroxides in varying composition. The generic formula is frequently written as FeO(OH)·nHO, although this is not entirely accurate as the ratio of oxide to hydroxide can vary quite widely. Limonite is one of the two principal iron ores, the other being hematite, and has been mined for the production of iron since at least 2500 BCE.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - Goethite (FeO(OH)), named after the German polymath and poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (17491832), an iron bearing hydroxide mineral of the diaspore group, is found in soil and other low-temperature environments. Goethite has been well known since ancient times for its use as a pigment (brown ochre). Evidence has been found of its use in paint pigment samples taken from the caves of Lascaux in France. It was first described in 1806 based on samples found in the Hollertszug Mine in Herdorf, Germany.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Kiirunavaara ( Northern Sami : Gironvárri or Kierunavaara ) is a mountain in Kiruna , Sweden that contains one of the largest and richest bodies of iron ore in the world . The presence of iron in the area was known already in the mid- 17th century , but at this early time communication lines to this northerly region were quite insufficient to permit any major exploitation . Only with the construction of a railway , the Iron Ore Line and the ports of Narvik and Luleå at the end of the 19th century did commercial mining become a realistic proposition . The Swedish mining company LKAB ( Luossavaara - Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag ) has been mining the mountain since the beginning of the 20th century .

The largest shareholders are Industrivärden and the Government of Finland.  - An ore is a type of rock that contains sufficient minerals with important elements including metals that can be economically extracted from the rock. The ores are extracted from the earth through mining; they are then refined (often via smelting) to extract the valuable element, or elements.  - A metal (from Greek  \\"métallon\\", \\"mine, quarry, metal\\") is a material (an element, compound, or alloy) that is typically hard, opaque, shiny, and has good electrical and thermal conductivity. Metals are generally malleable  that is, they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking  as well as fusible (able to be fused or melted) and ductile (able to be drawn out into a thin wire). About 91 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals, the others are nonmetals or metalloids. Some elements appear in both metallic and non-metallic forms.  - Luossavaara (Northern Sami: \\"Luossavárri\\") is a mountain in Kiruna, Sweden. It is the site of a now-inactive iron ore mine formerly operated by the Swedish mining company LKAB.

All together, there are sixteen known iron oxides and oxyhydroxides.  - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region.

It runs from the Port of Narvik to Riksgränsen on the NorwaySweden border, where the line continues as the Ore Line via Kiruna and Gällivare to Luleå. The Ofoten Line is single track, electrified at and has seven stations. The line only connects to the rest of the Norwegian railway network via Sweden. The main traffic is up to twelve daily freight trains operated by Malmtrafik that haul iron ore from Sweden to Narvik. In addition, CargoNet operates container trains, branded as the Arctic Rail Express (ARE), and SJ operates passenger trains, including a night train to Stockholm. The Ofoten Line is also part of the Northern East West Freight Corridor, which hauls containers from China and India to North America.  - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages.  - The city's vicinity shares a long history with the indigenous Sami people, with evidence of at least 6000 years of settlement. The city of Kiruna was founded in 1900 and quickly became a major centre of iron ore extraction and mining industry. During World War II, large quantities of iron were transported from Kiruna by rail to the east coast, and further down to be sold to Germany. Due to Kiruna's position north of the Arctic Circle the city experiences both midnight sun and polar night throughout the year as well as a very cold climate, even by Scandinavian standards.  - Siderite is a mineral composed of iron(II) carbonate (FeCO). It takes its name from the Greek word  \\"sideros,\\" iron. It is a valuable iron mineral, since it is 48% iron and contains no sulfur or phosphorus. Zinc, magnesium and manganese commonly substitute for the iron resulting in the siderite-smithsonite, siderite-magnesite and siderite-rhodochrosite solid solution series.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia. However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition.  - Sami is a group of Uralic languages spoken by the Sami people in Northern Europe (in parts of northern Finland, Norway, Sweden and extreme northwestern Russia). There are, depending on the nature and terms of division, ten or more Sami languages. Several names are used for the Sami languages: \\"Saami\\", \\"Sámi\\", \\"Saame\\", \\"Samic\\", \\"kukhulas\\", as well as the exonyms \\"Lappish\\" and \\"Lappic\\". The last two, along with the term \\"Lapp\\", are now often considered derogatory.  - Gällivare (or ) is a locality and the seat of Gällivare Municipality in Norrbotten County, province of Lapland, Sweden with 8,449 inhabitants in 2010. The town was founded in the 17th century. Together with nearby towns Malmberget and Koskullskulle it forms a conurbation with some 15,000 inhabitants. This conurbation is the second northernmost significant urban area of Sweden after Kiruna.  - The midnight sun is a natural phenomenon that occurs in the summer months in places north of the Arctic Circle or south of the Antarctic Circle, when the sun remains visible at the local midnight. Around the summer solstice (approximately 21 June in the Northern Hemisphere and 22 December in the Southern Hemisphere) the sun is visible for the full 24 hours, given fair weather. The number of days per year with potential midnight sun increases the farther towards either pole one goes. Although approximately defined by the polar circles, in practice the midnight sun can be seen as much as 55 miles (90 km) outside the polar circle, as described below, and the exact latitudes of the farthest reaches of midnight sun depend on topography and vary slightly year-to-year.  - Malmberget (\\"The Ore Mountain\\") is a locality and mining town situated in Gällivare Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden with 5,590 inhabitants in 2010. It is situated 5 kilometres from the municipal seat Gällivare.  - The Iron Ore Line is a long railway line between Riksgränsen and Boden in Norrbotten County, Sweden. The line contains two branches, from Kiruna to Svappavaara and from Gällivare to Koskullskulle. The term is often colloquially used to also include the Ofoten Line, from Riksgränsen to Narvik in Norway, and the northernmost part of the Main Line Through Upper Norrland from Boden to Luleå. The railway from Narvik to Luleå is long.  - Norrbotten County (\\"Norrbottens län\\") is the northernmost county or \\"län\\" of Sweden.

Article: In several nations, rulers welcomed leaders of the Enlightenment at court and asked them to help design laws and programs to reform the system, typically to build stronger national states. These rulers are called \\"enlightened despots\\" by historians. They included Frederick the Great of Prussia, Catherine the Great of Russia, Leopold II of Tuscany, and Joseph II of Austria. Joseph was over-enthusiastic, announcing so many reforms that had so little support that revolts broke out and his regime became a comedy of errors and nearly all his programs were reversed. Senior ministers Pombal in Portugal and Struensee in Denmark also governed according to Enlightenment ideals. In Poland, the model constitution of 1791 expressed Enlightenment ideals, but was in effect for only one year as the nation was partitioned among its neighbors.

Answer the question...steps for stopping a break in the vascular system??","output":"Okay little buddy, let's talk about how to stop a break in the blood vessels, which are like tiny tubes for carrying blood in our body.  1. Pressure: We should put some pressure on the cut carefully with a clean cloth or our hand. This helps to close the break and stop the blood from coming out. 2. Elevation: Lift the part that's bleeding, like an arm or leg, higher than the heart. This makes it a bit harder for the blood to flow to the cut, and slows down the blood flow. 3. Bandage: After the blood has stopped coming out, we should put a clean bandage or plaster on the cut. This keeps dirt and germs away and helps the skin to heal. 4. Rest: Stay calm and relax, don't run around. This helps our body to focus on fixing the break in the blood vessels. 5. Doctor or Nurse: If the cut is big, or it doesn't stop bleeding, we should go and see a doctor or nurse. They will know what to do to make it better.

The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. It is the seat of the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government. Tokyo is in the Kant region on the southeastern side of the main island Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Formerly known as Edo, it has been the de facto seat of government since 1603 when Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters. It officially became the capital after Emperor Meiji moved his seat to the city from the old capital of Kyoto in 1868; at that time Edo was renamed Tokyo. Tokyo Metropolis was formed in 1943 from the merger of the former and the .  - Etymology. The city's name was historically written as  or  (both read as \\"Nagoya\\"). One possible origin is the adjective , meaning 'peaceful'.   - Trade, or commerce, involves the transfer of goods and/or services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. A network that allows trade is called a market.  - Yokohama Pidgin Japanese , Yokohamese or Japanese Ports Lingo was a Japanese - based pidgin spoken in the Yokohama area during the late 19th century for communication between Japanese and foreigners . Most information on Yokohama Pidgin comes from Exercises in the Yokohama Dialect , a humorous pamphlet published in 1879 by Hoffman Atkinson .  - Historically a merchant city, Osaka has also been known as the and served as a center for the rice trade during the Edo period.  - The earliest written records regarding the region come from the \\"Nihon Shoki\\", which describes the founding of the Ikuta Shrine by Empress Jing in AD 201. For most of its history, the area was never a single political entity, even during the Tokugawa Period, when the port was controlled directly by the Tokugawa Shogunate. Kobe did not exist in its current form until its founding in 1889. Its name comes from , an archaic title for supporters of the city's Ikuta Shrine. Kobe became one of Japan's 17 designated cities in 1956.  - Yokohama's population of 3.7 million makes it Japan's largest city after the Special Wards of Tokyo. Yokohama developed rapidly as Japan's prominent port city following the end of Japan's relative isolation in the mid-19th century, and is today one of its major ports along with Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya, Hakata, Tokyo, and Chiba.  - A pidgin , or pidgin language, is a grammatically simplified means of communication that develops between two or more groups that do not have a language in common: typically, a mixture of simplified languages or a simplified primary language with other languages' elements included. It is most commonly employed in situations such as trade, or where both groups speak languages different from the language of the country in which they reside (but where there is no common language between the groups). Fundamentally, a pidgin is a simplified means of linguistic communication, as it is constructed impromptu, or by convention, between individuals or groups of people. A pidgin is not the native language of any speech community, but is instead learned as a second language. A pidgin may be built from words, sounds, or body language from multiple other languages and cultures. They allow people who have no common language to communicate with each other.

Here is an article: Opinions expressed in USA TODAY's editorials are decided by its Editorial Board, a demographically and ideologically diverse group that is separate from USA TODAY's news staff. Most editorials are accompanied by an opposing view  a unique USA TODAY feature that allows readers to reach conclusions based on both sides of an argument rather than just the Editorial Board's point of view. Over the past 20 years, the Internet has grown and flourished without burdensome federal regulations, becoming an integral part of American society. Internet-related innovation, strengthened by the free market, has spurred the development of new businesses, fueled job creation and has become a major part of Americans' day-to-day lives. This could soon change because of new regulations issued on a 3-2 vote by the Democratic members of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). This unelected group of government regulators has given itself broad new authority to intervene in the area of Internet development and accessibility. With their action, the FCC establishes itself as a turnstile through which companies seeking to offer new services must pass. The message the FCC has sent with this action is unmistakable: Innovate at your own risk because the FCC can impose sanctions. So, how would an innovator avoid sanctions? By seeking prior approval. The delay and loss of proprietary protection will surely slow down new product development. While on its face \\"net neutrality\\" sounds like a laudable goal, as with most government regulations, the devil is in the details. For instance, if a provider notices that a small number of users are routinely sharing large files that lead to major congestion on the network, it should have the right to relieve the congestion for the overwhelming majority of its users. Under the FCC's new regulations, government regulators may determine the provider's action is \\"unreasonable\\" and impose fines. This diminishes providers' flexibility in managing their own networks and creates uncertainty about permissible management activities. The FCC's argument for these rules is to ensure that Internet customers are not blocked by service providers from viewing or sending content of their choice. But this is already the reality of today's open Internet. Broadband providers currently support consumers accessing the content of their choice and using myriad of devices and applications they desire. We must preserve the openness of the Internet without an unnecessary government intervention. A recent Rasmussen Poll found that 54% of American voters polled object to this regulation; only 21% approve. The strongest objections came from those who use the Internet. Case closed. Sen.

He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders.  - Historical regions (or historical countries) are delimitations of geographic areas for studying and analysing social development of period-specific cultures without any reference to contemporary political, economic or social organisations. The fundamental principle underlying this view is that older political and mental structures exist which exercise greater influence on the spatial-social identity of individuals than is understood by the contemporary world, bound to and often blinded by its own worldview - e.g. the focus on the nation-state. Definitions of regions vary, and regions can include macroregions such as Europe, territories of traditional states, or smaller microregional areas. A geographic proximity is the often required precondition for emergence of a regional identity. In Europe the regional identities are often derived from the Migration Period, but for the contemporary perspective are related to the 1918-1920 time of territorial transformation, and another in the post-Cold War period.  - Basileus is a Greek term and title that has signified various types of monarchs in history. In the English-speaking world it is perhaps most widely understood to mean \\"king\\" or \\"emperor\\".

Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - Gedrosia ( / ddro / ; Greek :  ) is the Hellenized name of the part of coastal Baluchistan that roughly corresponds to today 's Makran . The area which is named Gedrosia , in books about Alexander the Great and his successors , runs from the Indus River to the southern edge of the Strait of Hormuz . It is directly to the south of the countries of Bactria , Arachosia and Drangiana , to the east of the country of Carmania and due west of the Indus River which formed a natural boundary between it and Western India . The native name of Gedrosia might have been Gwadar as there are two towns by that name and a bay ( Gwadar Bay ) in central Makran . The Gedrosians are known to have successfully defeated the Indian Mauryans capturing the western-most parts of their state . Following his army 's refusal to continue marching east at the Hyphasis River in 326 BC , Alexander the Great crossed the area after sailing south to the coast of the Indian Ocean on his way back to Babylon . Upon reaching the Ocean , Alexander the Great divided his forces in half , sending half back by sea to Susa under the command of Nearchus . The other half of his army was to accompany him on a march through the Gedrosian desert , inland from the ocean . Throughout the 60 day march through the desert , Alexander lost at least 12,000 soldiers , in addition to countless livestock , camp followers , and most of his baggage train . Some historians say he lost three - quarters of his army to the harsh desert conditions along the way . However , this figure was likely based on exaggerated numbers in his forces prior to the march , which were likely in the range of no fewer than 30,000 soldiers . There are two competing theories for the purpose of Alexander the Great 's decision to march through the desert rather than along the more hospitable coast . The first argues that this was an attempt to punish his men for their refusal to continue eastward at the Hyphasis River . The other argues that Alexander was attempting to imitate and succeed in the...  - Ariana, the Latinized form of the Ancient Greek \\"Ar(e)ian\\" (inhabitants: \\"\\"; \\"Ar(e)ianoi\\"), was a general geographical term used by some Greek and Roman authors of the ancient period for a district of wide extent between Central Asia and the Indus River, comprehending the eastern provinces of the Achaemenid Empire that covered the whole country of modern day Afghanistan, and a few parts of Pakistan, Tajikistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.  - Gwadar Bay is located in the Gulf of Oman on the maritime border of Pakistan and Iran.

It rises in the Hazarajat country north-west of Ghazni, and flows south-west falls into the Helmand below Girishk. In its lower course it is much used for irrigation, under the control of the Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority, and the valley is cultivated and populous; yet the water is said to be somewhat brackish. It is doubtful whether the ancient Arachotus is to be identified with the Arghandab or with its chief confluent the Tarnak, which joins it on the left out SW of Kandahar. The Tarnak, which flows south of Kandahar, is much shorter (length about 320 km or 200 miles) and less copious. The ruins at Ulan Robat, supposed to represent the city Arachosia, are in its basin; and the lake known as Ab-i-Istada, the most probable representative of Lake Arachotus, is near the head of the Tarnak, though not communicating with it. The Tarnak is dammed for irrigation at intervals, and in the hot season almost dries up.  - The Indus River, also called Darya-e-Sindh or Sindh River or Absn, is a major south-flowing river in South Asia.

Complex Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Duality\\" Genre: Sci-Fi, Drama Plot: In 1996, a brilliant scientist named Dr. Elizabeth Carter discovers a revolutionary scientific breakthrough: the existence of an alternate universe that runs parallel to our own. The movie begins with Dr. Carter explaining her complex new theory at a conference, captivating an audience of her peers. The film follows Dr. Carter as she embarks on a journey to create a bridge between these two universes in an attempt to solve the critical problems facing mankind. However, she is met with opposition from the government, who are skeptical of her ideas and consider them a threat to national security. Undeterred, Dr. Carter finds support from an eccentric billionaire named Arthur Sinclair, who shares her passion for discovery and funds an underground lab for her to carry out her experiments. Together, they assemble a team of devoted scientists and engineers. As they work tirelessly on the project, the team faces multiple obstacles, including the technical challenges of traversal between universes, espionage from competing nations, and internal betrayals. The plot weaves a complex web of relationships, each character slowly revealing their true nature and intentions. Eventually, Dr. Carter and her team succeed in breaching the barrier between dimensions and uncover a dystopian version of Earth, where the line between human and machine has been blurred. Society in this parallel world has advanced in terms of technology, but fallen morally, creating numerous social and ethical dilemmas. Faced with this stark contrast to their own world, the protagonists must grapple with the question of how to proceed. They realize that the possibilities opened up by the dimensional bridge are vast and complex, with the potential to affect humanity's future for better or worse. As parallels and differences emerge between the two worlds, one of the central themes becomes the concepts of simplicity and complexity; the simplicity of the past in the primary universe, and the complexity of the breakthrough's consequences as well as the intricacies of the alternate universe. The movie culminates in a thrilling climax where the characters must choose whether to continue their pursuit of knowledge or accept the simpler, albeit flawed, reality in which they live. Ultimately, the decision lies with Dr. Carter, whose ethical and scientific principles will either light the path to a better future or doom humanity to darkness. \\"Duality\\" is a complex, character-driven film that explores humanity's infinite capacity for discovery and the possible consequences of unrestrained ambition. At its core, the story delves into the limits of ambition, the concept of ethical progress, and the age-old question of whether humanity should pursue a simple or complex future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What albums did the original lead guitarist for the band that had a member die in August 1992 perform lead vocals on?, using the article: Lukather is the original lead guitarist for Toto, serving in that capacity for the band's entire history, as well as a lead and backing vocalist and composer. Lukather won three of his five Grammy Awards for work with Toto, twice as an artist and once as a producer. David Paich led the band's songwriting efforts during the development of 1978's Toto—he penned all but two of the album's tracks, including all four of its singles. Lukather also credits Jeff Porcaro for his leadership within the band during that period. However, Lukather's role in Toto evolved over time owing to the changing needs of the band. In August 1992, Jeff Porcaro collapsed while doing yard work at home and subsequently died of heart failure. The death profoundly affected Toto and Lukather in particular, who felt that he needed to step up and make sure the band kept going. Thus, he began taking more of a leadership role. Toto went through several lead vocalists over the years, including Bobby Kimball, Fergie Frederiksen, and Joseph Williams. After the 1990 dismissal of their fourth vocalist, Jean-Michel Byron, Toto was without a lead singer until around 1997; Lukather assumed most of the vocal duties for the band during that time. He performed lead vocals for every track on 1992's Kingdom of Desire and 1995's Tambu except for two instrumental tracks. The Tambu single \\"I Will Remember\\", co-written by Lukather and Stan Lynch, reached number 64 on UK charts. Some Tambu reviewers contrasted Lukather's vocals with those of former singers Kimball and Williams (and indeed, heavily criticized the entire album), some concert reviewers noted that he struggled vocally on certain songs, and a number of backup singers and guest vocalists accompanied the band's live shows during that period. It was not until Toto brought back Williams and Kimball to collaborate on 1998's Toto XX that Lukather returned predominantly to the role of backup vocalist.Lukather's songwriting contributions grew from a smattering of tracks on early Toto albums to co-writing..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The answer would be that Steve Lukather, the original lead guitarist for Toto, performed lead vocals on two albums: 1992's \\"Kingdom of Desire\\" and 1995's \\"Tambu.\\" This took place after Jeff Porcaro, a member of the band, passed away in August 1992. During that time, Toto was without a lead singer until around 1997, resulting in Lukather assuming most of the vocal duties for the band."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In McKinlay's words, the camp provided \\"substantial and comfortable houses on which we could rely for shelter for a long time.\\" Stores were plentiful, and the party was able to eat well. Much of the time in the first days of the camp was spent preparing and adjusting clothing and sleeping gear, in readiness for the forthcoming march to Wrangel Island.

The State Council has organized an investigation team to probe   into what caused the disaster in the city of Linfen, North China's Shanxi Province. Preliminary  investigations show the illegal mining of an unauthorized seam , and the number of miners who had been sent down the shaft far exceeded its capacity. This mine was found to have long ignored the rules to steal state coal, and did not have a list of miners employed to check the number of miners missing after the accident. How did such a coal mine get all the necessary licenses for production? How did it pass the three safety inspections the local government organized last month? In response to this disaster, the Shanxi governor promised to set up hotlines for people to report illegal coal mines and rewards as high as 100,000 yuan for _  We appreciate the action this governor has taken to solving the coal mining problems, and we believe that the reporting scheme will help to stop the existence of illegal coal mines. But at the same time we have reason to question how governments at various levels supervise these mines. The sad fact that such a mine with serious safety problems could pass three consecutive  local government safety inspections in a month is enough to tell us how ineffective the safety inspections were. What if these inspections were just a formality ? What if the inspectors were bribed by the mine owners to turn a blind eye to the safety dangers?

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: The Internet has greatly changed the way people communicate. But some teachers think the changes are not all for the better. Eleanor Johnson, an English professor, thinks that text messaging has made students believe that it is far more acceptable than it actually is to just make terrible spelling and grammatical errors. And she says her students over the past several years have increasingly used less formal English in their writing. Words and phrases like \\"guy\\" and \\"you know\\" now appear in research papers. Professor Johnson supposes there is a strong relationship between the rise of informal online communication and an increase in writing mistakes. But she says there may not be much scientific information, at least not yet. David Crystal, a British linguist , says the actively changing nature of the Internet makes it difficult to keep up-to-date in studying its effects. But he believes its influence on language is small. The main effect of the Internet on language is the way it has added to the expressive richness of language, providing language with a new set of communicative tools that haven't existed in the past. Erin Jansen is founder of NetLingo.com, an online dictionary of the Internet and text messaging terms. She says the new technology has not changed existing language but has greatly added to its vocabulary. Basically it's freedom of expression. And what about those teachers who find these new kinds of mistakes in spelling and grammar in their students' work? What is her message to them? Erin Jansen said, \\"I am always on the students' side and won't get angry or upset about that. If it's helping the kids write more or communicate more, that's great. That's what teachers and educators want--to get kids communicating.\\" But Erin Jansen and David Crystal agree with Eleanor Johnson on at least one thing. Teachers need to make sure students understand the uses and rules of language. Question: The author wants to tell us that   _  .

At the moment, he is trying to bring down his former partner Gabriel Callahan, who has become a drug kingpin. Callahan is trying to, and slowly succeeding at, taking over the New Orleans underworld. Stowe botches a sting operation against Callahan, resulting in the death of fellow cop Maria Ronson, whose fiancée, fellow cop Van Huffel, nearly comes to blows with him over it. Chief Mac Baylor has a very blunt chat with Stowe, who is dismissive. Stowe is approached by fellow cop Walter Curry to help his nephew beat a drug-dealing charge; he instead turns Curry over to Baylor, who fires him. After barricading himself in the station bathroom, Walter confronts an unrepentant Stowe and condemns him for betraying his fellow officers. That night Stowe meets with his estranged wife, Valerie, who tells him that she's pregnant, but that he's not the father. Valerie, whose marriage with Stowe is close to collapse, has been seeing a man named Mark Rossini, the gym teacher at the school she is principal of. But he may not be the father either. Stowe brashly accuses Valerie of being impregnated by Callahan, and she tells him she never wants to see him again. The only thing keeping Stowe from total collapse is his dogged pursuit of Callahan.

Usually I start my day with a cup of tea, and then I might have a glass of water with my lunch and one with dinner, that's about a liter of liquid in 24 hours. It feels like plenty, but apparently it's not nearly enough. After years of suffering headaches and poor digestion I spoke to a neurologist about my regular headaches and a nutritionist about my poor digestion, and both told me I should be drinking up to three liters of liquid a day for my body to function at its best. I decided to conduct an experiment. What would happen if I drank the recommended amount every day for a month? The photograph of me taken the day I started this trial demonstrates perfectly and rather frighteningly what a lack of hydration does to a face. I am 42, but have to admit I look more like 52 in this picture, which is shocking. There are dark shadows under and around my eyes, which make me look exhausted, a profusion of wrinkles and strange reddish blotches, and my skin lacks any luster . It looks dead. Even my lips look shriveled . This is all classic evidence of poor hydration, apparently. Every system and function in our body depends on water. It flushes toxins from the vital organs, carries nutrients to cells, provides a moist environment for ear, nose and throat tissues, and eliminates waste. Not drinking enough means all these functions becomes damaged. So I decided to see how I would look and feel if I drank three liters of water every day for 28 days. The results were astonishing. Question: Why did the author decide to drink the recommended amount of water? Options: A: Because she was very fond of doing experiments.

For breakfast, we had delicious, regional delicacies (among other things). They looked similar to crepes, but all I know is that it had a German name that I can’t remember. After we got situated in our hotel, we immediately headed off for the Mozart Plaza/Park. My family and I also visited other monuments that day: By the end of the day, our legs were worn out. We had rode so many trolleys and walked so much that I’m pretty sure that any longer and we would’ve collapsed on the spot. The bed never felt so good.

Question: suppose having more animals near the water happens, how will it affect there are more cans to be shredded.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"C: No effect The presence of more animals near the water has no direct impact on the number of aluminum cans being shredded for recycling. Although an increase in animals around water sources might lead to a higher human interest in preserving water ecosystems and possibly more waste management initiatives, the process of recycling aluminum cans remains independent of these factors. The recycling process consists of several steps: aluminum cans are collected, transported, shredded, heated, poured into molds, and rolled into sheets to be reused. Each step is systematically organized and highly controlled. However, it is important to address that a higher number of animals around water systems could indirectly trigger efforts to adopt more sustainable, eco-friendly practices in the waste management sector. This would depend on the increased public awareness regarding the environmental impact of waste on water ecosystems and the importance of keeping these habitats clean for the wildlife thriving in them. Therefore, such a situation could boost recycling rates and campaigns that aim at reducing waste in nature. In conclusion, the process of recycling aluminum cans, specifically the shredding step, will not be directly affected by an increase in the number of animals around water sources. The recycling process and its steps are not influenced by changes in the surrounding ecosystems. However, it may trigger a broader movement towards sustainability, eco-friendliness, and waste reduction, potentially leading to more cans being recycled indirectly. Thus, the overall effect of more animals near the water on the process of recycling aluminum cans is negligible, and option C – \\"No Effect\\" – seems to be the most accurate choice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It’s especially useful because the bottle acts a receptacle for the ash, so you can just throw your ash away with the bottle after you’re finished. Make sure you’re done with your beverage so you don’t end up drinking ash, which could have dangerous health effects. In this grip you’re firmly holding it at the filter but not forcefully enough where the filter becomes crushed. Hold the cigarette upright as the ash will easily fall down if it’s pointed downwards. Be careful that the tip of the cigarette is hovering over the bottle so the ash falls straight into the bottle. Keep the bottle stationary as well to ensure the ash doesn’t fall anywhere else. Flick the bottom of the filter with the fingernail on your middle finger. This will cause the tip of the cigarette to hit the inside of bottle, causing the ash to fall inside the bottle. Flicking the cigarette over for too long while cause it to burn more quickly. It might take a few times to get the ash in the bottle, so make sure to flick the cigarette with enough force to loosen the ash up in a couple tries.

(May 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Major Charles 'Copper' Carrington (David Niven), who has a distinguished World War II record and was awarded the Victoria Cross, is arrested for embezzling Â£125 from his unit's safe. Other charges include leaving the base and entertaining a woman officer in his room, this being forbidden by the base commander Colonel Henniker (Allan Cuthbertson). Appearing in his own defence, Carrington's case at his court-martial is that he took the money openly because of back pay owed him. The Army Paymaster had failed to pay him for expenses during postings in the Far East and his wife Valerie (Margaret Leighton) was pressuring him for money. She lives in another part of the country, and has become ill and suicidal as a result of financial worries. Carrington claims he told his superior, Colonel Henniker, about his decision to remove the money. He transferred Â£100 of it to his wife's account to give her relief from her financial problems. He then left the base to compete in a major horse race in which he betted the rest of the money on himself, hoping to be able to pay back the cash taken. When he fell from his horse, his friend Captain Alison Graham (Noelle Middleton) tried to return the money, but was denied access to the safe. As for the incident in his room, it is established that Carrington was bed-ridden from his fall and that Graham was visiting him to discuss the embezzlement. She was fully dressed and sitting on a chair when Colonel Henniker stormed in, reminding them that it was against regulations for male and female officers to be together in private quarters.

He also voiced concern that political considerations are driving U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in to compromise joint security for more false denuclearization promises from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “I am rather pessimistic about whether this negotiation will work out well or not. The only means for North Korea to maintain its regime is its nuclear program. The moment that North Korea gives up its nuclear program, and the moment it opens up to reform, the Kim Jong Un regime will collapse,” said Hong Joon-pyo, the chairman of the Liberty Korea Party. On June 12, Trump and Kim will meet in Singapore to try to reach an agreement to end the North’s threatening nuclear weapons program in exchange for economic incentives and security guarantees that could include a formal peace treaty to replace the armistice that has been enforced since the end of the Korean War in 1953. Many South Korean conservatives had voiced strong support for Trump’s “maximum pressure” polices to force Pyongyang to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons through tough international sanctions in place that ban 90 percent of the country’s trade, and the threat of military action. But they have been troubled by recent statements coming from the Trump administration indicating the United States may be willing to soften its demands for the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement (CVID) of the North’s nuclear program before offering any sanctions relief. Hong is worried that Trump may seek a deal that would quickly end the North’s intercontinental ballistic missile program that directly threatens the U.S., and leave the regional nuclear threat to be resolved later. Trump seems overly intent to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough, Hong said, to shift the media focus away from the ongoing special prosecutor investigation he is facing over Russia’s...

Question: Background: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  Paragraph: Roger and Samantha are brother and sister. Both of them perform roughly the same amount of physical activity on a day-to-day basis. Roger, however, eats a lot more food relative to the amount he needs given his activity levels.

He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.

In 1993, Brooks, who had criticized music stores selling used CDs since it led to a loss in proper royalty payments, persuaded Capitol Records to not ship his 1993 album, In Pieces, to stores which engaged in this practice. This led to several anti-trust lawsuits against the record label, ending with Capitol shipping the albums to the stores anyway.  Despite the delay in shipping, In Pieces was another success, peaking at No. 1 on both the Billboard 200 and Top Country Albums charts, and selling a total of nearly 10 million copies. After a delay in its worldwide release, the album also peaked at No. 2 on the United Kingdom Albums Chart. That same year, \\"The Red Strokes\\" became Brooks' first single to make the UK Singles Chart, reaching a high of No. 13; it was followed by \\"Standing Outside the Fire\\", which reached No. 23. Previous albums No Fences, Ropin' the Wind and The Chase also remained in the top 30 in the UK Albums Chart.  Brooks' first world tour began in 1993, reaching the UK after many domestic concerts. Brooks sold out venues such as Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre and London's Wembley Arena, a feat never accomplished by an American country music artist. He also began the London radio station, Country 1035. Despite the disdain of the British media, Brooks' overall popularity in the country was evident, with a top disc jockey, Nick Barraclough, referring to Brooks as Garth Vader (a play on Darth Vader) for his \\"invasion\\" of the charts and his success in the country genre. Unlike Alan Jackson, who refused to return to the UK after being treated in a similar negative manner by the press, Brooks would later return in 1996 for more performances.

German:","output":"Die Funktion \\"Maximale Via-Anzahl\\" wird verwendet, um die maximale Anzahl der Vias pro Leiterbahnen festzulegen. Justification for the translation: 1. \\"The Maximum Via Count function\\" -> \\"Die Funktion \\"Maximale Via-Anzahl\\"\\". In this case, \\"Maximum Via Count\\" can be translated to \\"Maximale Via-Anzahl\\" as it represents the maximum amount of vias. The term \\"function\\" is translated to \\"Funktion\\" in German. 2. \\"is used to\\" -> \\"wird verwendet, um\\". We use the passive voice in the German translation as well, to clarify the function's purpose. 3. \\"set the\\" -> \\"festzulegen\\". The verb \\"set\\" in the context of establishing a value can be translated to \\"festlegen\\" in German. 4. \\"maximum\\" -> \\"maximale\\". We keep the adjective \\"maximum\\" consistent with the earlier translation in this sentence. 5. \\"number of\\" -> \\"Anzahl der\\". In German, \\"number of\\" can be translated to \\"Anzahl der\\" to demonstrate the quantity. 6. \\"vias\\" -> \\"Vias\\". We keep the word \\"vias\\" the same since it is a technical term used in circuit design. 7. \\"per\\" -> \\"pro\\". The preposition \\"per\\" can be translated to \\"pro\\" in German to indicate the relationship between the number of vias and circuit trace. 8. \\"circuit trace\\" -> \\"Leiterbahnen\\".

Answer:","output":"From the given bio of Juan Bautista Pastene (Giovanni Battista Pastene), we can gather several details about his life: 1. Birth year and death year: Juan Bautista Pastene was born in 1507 and died in 1580. 2. Nationality: He was of Genoese origin, which is an Italian ethnicity originating from the city of Genoa. 3. Occupation: Juan Bautista Pastene was a maritime explorer, which means his primary occupation was to explore and navigate the seas, discovering new lands, routes, and resources. 4. Employer: He was in the service of the Spanish Crown, which implies that his explorations and voyages were funded and supported by the monarchs of Spain at that time. This also indicates that his discoveries would have been made on behalf of, and for the benefit of, the Spanish Empire. 5. Areas of exploration: During his maritime career, Juan Bautista Pastene explored the coasts of Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Chile. The bio also specifically mentions that he traveled as far as the archipelago of Chiloé, which is located in the southern part of Chile. 6. Contribution to maritime exploration: Juan Bautista Pastene's role as a maritime explorer is significant because his discoveries allowed Spain to acquire knowledge about the various coastal regions of South America. This information would have been vital in their efforts to expand their empire, establish trade routes, and exert control over those territories. In summary, the bio of Juan Bautista Pastene provides us with key insights into his life, career, and lasting impact on the Spanish Empire's exploration of South America during the 16th century.

Questions: Where are you if you're buying whiskey, grain, and saddles at the general store? Options: - salt - checkers - shopping mall - old west - meat store The answer is:","output":"Old West The option in line with common sense to answer the question \\"Where are you if you're buying whiskey, grain, and saddles at the general store?\\" is the Old West. The Old West (also known as the Wild West or American frontier) is a period in American history when westward expansion occurred, and it was characterized by the settlement of the Western United States during the late 19th century. This era is often romanticized in literature, films, and other media, known for its pioneering spirit, cowboys, Native American encounters, and gold rushes.  During this time, general stores were a common sight in the growing settlements of the Old West. These stores were essential for providing settlers with a variety of goods necessary for their survival, as well as a few luxuries from time to time. They functioned as the center of commerce in small towns and were often the first business established in these frontier communities.  The items mentioned in the question - whiskey, grain, and saddles - are all items that people living in the Old West would have likely needed or wanted. Whiskey was a popular drink at the time, consumed both for leisure and sometimes for medicinal purposes. Grain was a staple food and essential for feeding both people and livestock, playing an important role in sustaining life on the frontier. Saddles, of course, were necessary for riding horses, which were the primary mode of transportation in the Old West. The other options - salt, checkers, shopping mall, and meat store - do not quite fit the context of the question. Salt is a mineral and not a location, while checkers is a game and also not a location. Shopping malls did not exist in the time period of the Old West; they became more widespread in the 20th century as urbanization and consumer culture expanded. Finally, a meat store, although a place where people can buy various items, would not typically stock all the products mentioned. The focus of a meat store is primarily on the sale of animal-based foodstuffs, so it is not the most logical location where one would find whiskey, grain, and saddles together. Thus, based on the given options, the Old West is the choice that most closely aligns with common sense in answering the question about where you would be if you're buying whiskey, grain, and saddles at a general store."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Pageant with prizes of holidays and money ran from early 60s to 1983. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: A Look Back at the Coal Queen Pageant: Beauty and Pride in the Heart of Mining Communities Introduction: From the early 1960s to 1983, the Coal Queen Pageant was a significant event in coal mining communities across the country. The pageant celebrated the beauty and resilience of the women in these communities, giving them a platform to shine while offering a much-needed break from the hardships of their everyday lives. This article will explore the history of the pageant, the experiences of its participants, and the legacy it left behind. Step 1: Establish context and historical background The Coal Queen Pageant began during a time when coal mining was at its peak, providing employment and resources to numerous families. It was a difficult and demanding profession, with miners often spending long hours underground in harsh conditions. The women in these communities, often daughters, wives, and sisters of miners, took on the responsibility of providing for their families while the men worked in the mines. Step 2: Describe the purpose and significance of the Coal Queen Pageant The pageant provided an opportunity for these women to come together, showcase their beauty, and celebrate their strength and resilience. The prizes, which included holidays and cash, represented a chance for them to enjoy some of the luxuries they may not have otherwise experienced. The Coal Queen Pageant became a symbol of pride within mining communities, as women vied for the title. Step 3: Share stories and experiences of the participants Through interviews and archival material, the voices of the women who participated in the Coal Queen Pageant can be heard, painting a vivid picture of what this event meant to them. They describe the excitement and anticipation of the pageant, the camaraderie they formed with their fellow contestants, and the impact winning the title had on their lives. It's important to highlight the emotions and experiences of these women, demonstrating the positive and empowering aspects of the pageant and celebrating their achievements. Step 4: Discuss the eventual end of the Coal Queen Pageant As the coal mining industry began to decline in the 1980s, so too did the pageant. By 1983, the Coal Queen Pageant held its final contest. This section will explore the reasons behind the end of the pageant, including changes in societal attitudes towards beauty contests, a shift in focus to environmental and health concerns surrounding coal mining, and the general decline in the industry Conclusion: Although the Coal Queen Pageant came to an end in 1983, its legacy lives on. The pageant remains an important chapter in the history of mining communities, offering a unique glimpse into the lives of the women who courageously supported their families through difficult times. The Coal Queen Pageant not only celebrated beauty and resilience but also fostered a sense of pride and unity among the women who participated, leaving a lasting impact on all those involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Trivia question: Which famous actress provided the voice of Maggie in “The Simpsons” when she uttered her first word? And the answer is?","output":"The famous actress who provided the voice of Maggie Simpson when she uttered her first word is Elizabeth Taylor. Elizabeth Taylor was an iconic British-American actress known for her striking beauty and diverse acting skills. She started her career as a child actress and rose to fame in Hollywood with memorable roles in films such as \\"National Velvet,\\" \\"Cleopatra,\\" and \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\". In \\"The Simpsons,\\" Maggie Simpson is the youngest and generally silent member of the Simpson family. However, her first spoken word came during the episode titled \\"Lisa's First Word,\\" which originally aired on December 3, 1992, as part of the show's fourth season. In this particular episode, the Simpson family is reminiscing about Lisa's early years while Marge is pregnant with their third child, Bart's soon-to-be younger sister, Maggie. The majority of the episode is a flashback that covers the family's time in their first home, as well as Bart and Lisa's special bond. Throughout the series, Maggie is depicted as a humorous, resourceful, and intelligent baby who is surprisingly aware of her surroundings, despite being non-verbal. Towards the end of the episode, when the family is gathered around Maggie and after they all left the room, Maggie utters her first word, \\"Daddy,\\" directed towards her father, Homer Simpson. Elizabeth Taylor provided the voice for this single, pivotal word. This was a surprising and memorable moment in the show's history, and the inclusion of such a legendary actress as Elizabeth Taylor made it even more notable. Having such an influential actress voice this particular moment in the long-running series added an extra layer of significance to Maggie's first word and further solidified \\"The Simpsons\\" as a groundbreaking and culturally impactful television show."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Botany: Plants and various other groups of photosynthetic eukaryotes collectively known as \\"algae\\" have unique organelles known as chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are thought to be descended from cyanobacteria that formed endosymbiotic relationships with ancient plant and algal ancestors. Chloroplasts and cyanobacteria contain the blue-green pigment chlorophyll a. Chlorophyll a (as well as its plant and green algal-specific cousin chlorophyll b)[a] absorbs light in the blue-violet and orange/red parts of the spectrum while reflecting and transmitting the green light that we see as the characteristic colour of these organisms. The energy in the red and blue light that these pigments absorb is used by chloroplasts to make energy-rich carbon compounds from carbon dioxide and water by oxygenic photosynthesis, a process that generates molecular oxygen (O2) as a by-product. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\".

It aims to prevent such incidents from happening in the future and to ensure that the bereaved families receive the appropriate support and services. The inquiry was initiated in response to the harrowing experiences of several bereaved parents, who were denied the chance to receive their babies' ashes due to crematoria mismanagement or inadequate procedures. This revelation has brought attention to the need for clearer regulations and oversight to guarantee that crematoriums provide a reliable and understanding service in a time of immense grief. By implementing a national inspector, crematoriums will be subject to regular and rigorous assessments, ensuring that sufficient protocols and guidelines are followed. The inspector would also be responsible for reviewing current policies, identifying areas that need improvement, and recommending best practices to maintain the highest standards in the industry. Some of the key issues addressed by the inquiry include the lack of standardized processes for handling infant cremations, the absence of sufficient training and qualifications for crematorium staff, and the need for better communication with bereaved families. The establishment of a national inspector would serve to outline clear and consistent guidelines for these aspects, thereby reducing the chances of such heartbreaking incidents from repeating. Additionally, the national inspector would play a crucial role in providing support to bereaved families and ensuring that they are informed of their rights and options during the cremation process. This would include offering guidance on the availability of financial assistance, the legal procedures surrounding the collection and disposal of ashes, and the opportunity for families to express their specific wishes. In conclusion, the creation of a national inspector for crematoriums is a necessary step towards safeguarding the interests of grieving families and ensuring that they receive the transparent, supportive, and efficient service they deserve during such a difficult time. This move will also serve to improve the overall standards in the cremation industry, ultimately benefiting the public as a whole. Now is the time for government bodies to take action and ensure that no parent ever has to experience the heartbreak of being unable to collect their child's ashes due to inadequate cremation services."},{"instruction":"Question: how did apollo creed die?

Tweet: Watching the titanic, babysitting, alone, and no one to talk to  Predict the sentiment of this tweet.","output":"To predict the sentiment of this tweet, we will need to analyze the text thoroughly, taking into consideration the context, wording, and the general emotional tone of the message. Here's a breakdown of the tweet: 1. Watching the Titanic: The Titanic movie is known for its dramatic and emotional storyline, revolving around the infamous sinking of the ship and the tragic love story of the main characters. Generally, watching such a film indicates a mood leaning towards sadness or melancholy. 2. Babysitting: This activity typically means that the person is responsible for taking care of someone else's child for a period of time, which can be a neutral or a slightly positive aspect, depending on personal preferences. For some, babysitting can be a joyful experience, while for others, it may be more of a chore. 3. Alone: Being alone often signifies loneliness or a lack of companionship. In this context, it seems that the tweeter would have preferred to have someone around to talk to and share their feelings or thoughts with, indicating a somewhat negative sentiment. 4. No one to talk to: This portion of the tweet again highlights the tweeter's loneliness and desire for companionship or conversation, which, in this instance, is unfulfilled. This generally evokes a negative sentiment. Based on this analysis, we can deduce that the overall sentiment of this tweet is a mix of emotions, leaning towards a negative sentiment. The viewer is watching an emotionally heavy movie, carries a responsibility in babysitting, and feels alone, wishing there was someone to talk to. Although babysitting can be seen as a neutral factor in some cases, given the context, it is not providing a positive counterbalance to the other sentiments mentioned in the tweet. Therefore, the sentiment of the tweet can be predicted as predominantly negative or melancholic, with the tweeter longing for companionship or someone to talk to while performing their babysitting duties and watching an emotionally intense movie."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I read this background article the other day: There must be more to this story than just gas exchange with the environment. To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis.  I am facing a new situation today: Bob is a biologist. Today, he has four samples of organisms to test, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B. Next, he classified sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would sample D make their own glucose or acquire it from other organisms?","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation with Bob's experiment, we can determine the glucose acquisition process of the organism in sample D. The background article explains that organisms are classified into two categories based on how they obtain their energy: 1. Heterotrophic organisms - These organisms acquire glucose by consuming other organisms. 2. Autotrophic organisms - These organisms produce their own glucose, primarily through the process of photosynthesis. In the new situation described, Bob classifies sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic. Since sample D is identified as an autotrophic organism, it will produce its own glucose, mainly through the process of photosynthesis, and not acquire it from other organisms. This is the primary distinction between autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms in terms of their energy metabolism and glucose acquisition."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Plus, the only cool character gets killed off in the middle of the movie. Ok, so the plot wasn't very good but at least there was some good kung-fu right? Wrong. The fights were very short and few and far between. Granted the different styles were all pretty cool but I wish the fights were longer. I kept hoping to see the Lizard run and do some crazy ish on the walls but it never happened. I was hoping to see the Centipede do some tight speedy ish but it never happened. I was hoping to see the Scorpion in the movie for more than 7 total minutes but it never happened. In short, not much happens. The fighting is all pretty routine. Don't be fooled just becuase this movie has a plot, it does not mean it's a good one. Now, what is this review like? pick from the following. -- negative -- positive","output":"This review is negative. The person who wrote it was not happy with the movie because they found the plot predictable, and they were disappointed with the short and few fight scenes.

And I was wondering What will happen to Robin? Answer:","output":"It is wonderful to hear that Robin enjoyed watching their partner Alex perform in a play. As for what may happen to Robin, a number of possibilities come to mind, given that this is a rather open-ended question with limited context provided. Here are several potential scenarios that could unfold for Robin in the future: 1. Strengthened Relationship: Watching Alex perform in the play and thoroughly enjoying it can bring Robin and Alex closer together as a couple. Robin's support of Alex's passion for acting not only indicates their interest in their partner's hobbies but also serves as an opportunity to deepen their emotional connection. 2. Shared Interests: Robin's enjoyment of the play suggests that they might have an affinity for theatre and performing arts. This shared interest could lead them to explore other plays, performances, and events in the future together, broadening their cultural horizons and fostering more common ground within their relationship. 3. Inspiration: Witnessing their partner's talent and enthusiasm for acting might inspire Robin to discover and pursue their own passions and creative insights. Perhaps Robin could explore other facets of the performing arts, such as writing, directing, or designing sets and costumes. By doing so, Robin may find a newfound sense of purpose and personal fulfillment. 4. Support System: As Alex continues to pursue their acting career, Robin might play a crucial role in supporting and encouraging their endeavors. This support could manifest in various ways, such as attending future performances, providing emotional reassurance during challenging times, or offering constructive critique when needed. 5. Networking Opportunities: Attending the play might expose Robin to a community of like-minded individuals who share a love for theatre and performing arts. As a result, they may form new friendships and connections, further expanding their social circle. 6. Learning and Growth: Through conversations with Alex about the play and the intricacies of performance, Robin could deepen their knowledge and understanding of the performing arts. This newfound appreciation might lead them to engage in further research, attend workshops or classes, or become more involved in local theatre groups. Ultimately, life is unpredictable, and it is impossible to determine precisely what will happen to Robin in the future. However, based on their positive experience watching Alex perform in a play, one can envision several scenarios that point towards a deepened connection in their relationship, personal growth, and creative exploration both individually and together as a couple."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He received honorary doctorates from five English universities and was a fellow of both the Royal Academy of Music (1920) and the Royal College of Music (1923). Jacobs lists 26 compositions dedicated to Wood, including, in addition to the Vaughan Williams Serenade to Music, works by Elgar, Delius, Bax, Marcel Dupré and Walton. The Poet Laureate, John Masefield, composed a poem of six verses in his honour, entitled \\"Sir Henry Wood\\", often referred to by its first line, \\"Where does the uttered music go?\\". Walton set it to music as an anthem for mixed choir; it received its first performance on 26 April 1946 at St Sepulchre's, on the occasion of a ceremony unveiling a memorial stained-glass window in Wood's honour.Wood is commemorated in the name of the Henry Wood Hall, the deconsecrated Holy Trinity Church in Southwark, which was converted to a rehearsal and recording venue in 1975. His bust stands upstage centre in the Royal Albert Hall during the whole of each Prom season, decorated by a chaplet on the Last Night of the Proms. His collection of 2,800 orchestral scores and 1,920 sets of parts is now in the library of the Royal Academy of Music. For the Academy he also established the Henry Wood Fund, giving financial aid to students. The University of Strathclyde named a building at its Jordanhill campus after him. His best-known memorial is the Proms, officially \\"the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", but universally referred to by the informal short version.His biographer Arthur Jacobs wrote of Wood: His orchestral players affectionately nicknamed him \\"Timber\\" – more than a play on his name, since it seemed to represent his reliability too.

Tokugawa Takes All: When Hideyoshi died in 1598, he hoped to have his five-year-old son continue his \\"dynasty,\\" initially under the tutelage of five regents. But one of the regents was Ieyasu Tokugawa, who had been biding his time at Edo for 12 years, nurturing dynastic ambitions of his own. Of the cunning, ruthless triumvirate that came out on top at the end of the country's century of civil war, Tokugawa was without doubt the most patient, the most prudent — and most treacherous. He moved quickly to eliminate his strongest rivals, crushing them in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara (near modern Nagoya). During its subsequent two and a half centuries of rule from the new capital established at Edo, the Tokugawa organized a tightly controlled coalition of some 260 daimyo in strategic strongholds throughout the country. The allegiance of this highly privileged and prestigious group was ensured by cementing their ethical principles in the code of bushido, \\"The way of the warrior\\": loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations. Loyalty was further enforced by holding the vassals' wives and children hostage in Edo. All roads into Edo, the most famous being the Tokaido Highway, had checkpoints for guns coming in and for wives going out. One of the most effective ways of keeping a tight rein on the country was to cut it off from the outside world, to keep Japan Japanese. At first, Ieyasu Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade. He wanted silk and encouraged the Dutch and British as good, nonproselytizing Protestants just interested in trade. But he didn't like the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries, who he felt were undermining traditional Japanese values. He banned their activities in 1612 and two years later ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts. Executions and torture followed. Converts were forced to renounce their faith by trampling crucifixes and effigies of Jesus and Mary. The Catholic Church has counted 3,125 martyrs in Japan from 1597 (beginning under Hideyoshi) to 1660. In 1635 the Japanese were forbidden, on pain of death, to attempt to travel abroad, and Japanese citizens already overseas were prevented from returning, in case they brought back subversive Christian doctrines. Western books were banned, as were Chinese books that mentioned Christianity.  Question: \\"Contrast Tokugawa's attitude toward the British and Dutch traders and the Portuguese and Spanish missionaries.\\" Answer: \\"He banned the British and the Dutch first, then the Portugese and Spanish\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, the answer is incorrect. The correct answer would be: \\"Tokugawa had a positive attitude towards British and Dutch traders as he saw them as non-proselytizing Protestants interested in trade. However, he disliked Portuguese and Spanish missionaries, believing they were undermining traditional Japanese values, which led to him banning their activities and eventually expelling them from Japan.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Thirty years old and single, Pauline \\"Poppy\\" Cross shares a London flat with her best friend Zoe, a fellow teacher. Poppy is free-minded, high-spirited and kind-hearted. The film opens with Poppy trying to engage a shop employee in conversation. He ignores her, yet his icy demeanour does not bother her. She maintains her good mood even when she discovers her bicycle has been stolen. Her main concern is not getting a new one or finding the bicycle, but that she did not get a chance to say goodbye to it. This prompts her to decide to learn how to drive. When Poppy takes driving lessons for the first time, her positive attitude contrasts starkly with her gloomy, intolerant and cynical driving instructor, Scott. He is emotionally repressed, has anger problems and becomes extremely agitated by Poppy's casual attitude towards driving. As Poppy gets to know him, it becomes evident that Scott believes in conspiracy theories. His beliefs are partly attributable to his racist and misogynistic views, which make it hard for him to get along with others. Scott seems to be angered by Poppy's sunny personality and what he perceives as a lack of responsibility and concern for driving safety. Scott is exceptionally irritated by Poppy's choice of footwear (a pair of high-heeled boots), which he feels compromises her ability to drive. From the outset, he feels Poppy does not take her lessons seriously and is careless. Poppy, however, does have the capacity to be responsible. At school, Poppy observes one of her pupils bullying one of his classmates. Rather than becoming angry, she worries about him and takes the appropriate action. After speaking with her student, she comes to the correct conclusion that her student is being abused at home. A social worker, Tim, is brought in to handle the boy's case.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"Yes, both questions are essentially asking the same thing. They are inquiring about the differences between email as a communication method and Gmail as a specific email service.  To address the core inquiry, let us first understand the difference between email and Gmail:  Email is a digital communication method that enables users to transmit messages and files over the Internet to recipients. It is a general term for electronic mail, independent of any particular platform or service. Email communication uses specific protocols, such as Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), to facilitate sending, receiving, and accessing messages across various devices. On the other hand, Gmail is a specific email service that is developed and managed by Google. It is a web-based platform known for its user-friendly interface, advanced search, and message filtering features. Launched in 2004, Gmail has become a widely popular email service and is now an integral part of the Google Suite, enhancing its integration with other Google services such as Google Drive, Google Calendar, and Google Photos. With these definitions in mind, let's delve into the differences between email and Gmail: 1. General term vs. specific service: Email is a general term used to describe electronic mail, while Gmail is a specific email service offered by Google, just one of many email services available to users. 2. Infrastructure and protocols: Email operates using multiple protocols, including SMTP, IMAP, or Post Office Protocol (POP3), to ensure proper message transmission across different platforms and devices. Gmail, as a service, also utilizes these protocols but incorporates its additional features and infrastructure provided by Google. 3. Customizability and integration: Gmail offers seamless integration with other Google services, like Google Drive, Google Calendar, and Google Photos, which may not be available with other email services or platforms. Moreover, due to its large user base and popularity, many third-party applications offer easy integration with Gmail specifically. 4. Storage capacity: Email storage capacity varies depending on the email service provider. Gmail currently offers its users 15GB of free storage shared across all Google services, such as Google Drive and Google Photos. While other email providers may offer more or less storage, it's crucial to compare and contrast available options based on individual needs. 5. User interface and features: Gmail stands out from other email services due to its advanced search capabilities, intelligent filtering of messages into categories, and a vast range of features like snoozing emails, smart replies, and even built-in chat functionalities. Although these features are specific to Gmail, it is essential to recognize that other email services may have their unique features. 6. Privacy concerns: Gmail has faced certain privacy concerns as Google scans user emails for targeted advertising purposes. While Google announced in 2017 that it would no longer use email content for ad personalization, some users might still feel more comfortable with other email providers that prioritize privacy. 7. Cost: Gmail offers its basic services for free, including an email account and access to the suite of Google services. Businesses can also subscribe to Google Workspace (formerly known as G Suite) for additional features and greater storage. However, this is a paid service with different pricing tiers depending on the organization's size and requirements. The cost structures and plans for other email providers may differ from Gmail. In conclusion, it's essential to understand that email is a general term referring to electronic mail that can be provided by various email services, including Gmail, Yahoo, Microsoft Outlook, and others. Gmail is a specific email service developed by Google that offers additional features and integrations with other Google applications. Though the questions posed are the same, it's important to choose an email service that meets your preferences and requirements, keeping in mind the differences among various email service providers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Use evidence from the fact that humans moving into an environment usually causes native species to lose their habitats to answer the following question.

The creature which originally lived there is most likely to\\" Choose from: - share their space; - sell that space; - lose their space; - fight for space;","output":"The creature which originally lived in the portion of forested area is most likely to lose their space when a group of bipeds begin to make their own homes in that space. The evidence supporting this statement comes from numerous examples throughout history where human expansion and encroachment into new environments have resulted in native species losing their habitats. When humans move into an area, they often need to clear land for housing, agriculture, and other purposes, which can lead to the destruction of the natural habitats of various species that originally occupied the region. One example of human encroachment leading to habitat loss is the deforestation of rainforests in the Amazon region. The Amazon rainforest is home to millions of species of plants, animals, and microorganisms, many of which are endemic to the region and not found anywhere else. As humans have made their way into the rainforest and cleared it for purposes like agriculture and logging, numerous species have lost their habitats, and some have become extinct altogether. This process has accelerated in recent years due to the growing global demand for products like palm oil, soy, and beef, which are produced at the expense of forested land. Another example is the case of urban sprawl in cities around the world. As cities expand and new developments are constructed, natural habitats are often decimated, leading to a loss of biodiversity. Wetlands, forests, and grasslands are replaced by buildings, roads, and other man-made structures, forcing native species to either adapt to the new environment or (most likely) lose their space, finding their populations in decline or ultimately becoming extinct. Furthermore, the introduction of invasive species by humans can also contribute to the loss of native species’ habitats. Invasive species often outcompete native species for resources like food, water, and shelter, which can result in the decline or even total loss of native species populations. Although there are instances where native species may temporarily share space or attempt to fight for space, it generally appears that, ultimately, the original creature is most likely to lose their space. The pressures put on native species by human encroachment, habitat destruction, and the introduction of invasive species often lead to a decline in their populations, and, in some cases, even extinctions. To avoid this outcome, it is essential that humans attempt to mitigate the effects of their actions on natural habitats and work towards coexisting with native species by implementing sustainable development practices and conservation efforts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: New sexual harassment and racial discrimination lawsuits are rocking the already scandal riddled Fox News Channel. Three new lawsuits were filed Monday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Two allege racial harassment at Fox News, while a third alleges sexual harassment at Fox News Radio. The cases increase to 23 the number of past or present Fox employees represented by attorney Doug Wigdor, the majority having cases alleging racial hostility by a since-fired financial executive. Fox said Monday that the lawsuits have no legal basis. Kathleen Lee, a Fox News Radio employee of more than 10 years, alleges that radio anchor Ron Flatter subjected her to “unrelenting sexual harassment” after the network hired him in 2013. A former Fox employee, Adasa Blanco, said she alerted Fox executives about racially hostile behavior on the part of former Fox controller Judith Slater more than eight years before the executive was let go. Slater has denied charges of racially hostile conduct. Blanco, who is Hispanic, said that Slater made fun of her accent. In the lawsuit, Wigdor said Fox “knowingly harbored and protected” a racist employee for more than eight years and misrepresented to the public that it fired Slater quickly upon learning of her behavior. Naima Farrow, another former Fox employee who worked for Slater, said she was fired without warning or explanation in 2015, less than three days after telling superiors she was pregnant. Farrow, who is black, said Slater mockingly referred to her as “girlfriend.” Fox News said in a statement that it is committed to a diverse workplace free from discrimination, and takes any complaint seriously. In these cases, Fox “took prompt, effective and, when necessary, strong remedial action,” the network said. “We believe these latest claims are without legal basis and look forward to proving that the company at all times has acted appropriately, and lawfully, in connection with these matters.” The new legal claims come as Fox News is battling a series of...

Measure the outline of the body of a wire hanger and cut two pieces of silky material slightly larger than that. Sew the two pieces together, leaving an opening at the top, and slide the hanger inside. Stuff the inside of the material with loose cotton or pieces of foam, and sew the opening shut. Use wire clippers to cut the bottom part of the hanger in half. Bend the two bottom halves of wire down to narrow the shape (approximately 3-4 inches, or 7-10 cm, apart). Twist each wire end upwards to meet the bottom of the hanger hook, and twist the ends into a circular shape to cover the sharp points. Place shoes, toe-side up, over each circular part of the hanger to hang them easily in your closet. Start with a finished piece of wood and attach 3 to 6 screws to the board, depending on its size and your preferences, halfway in and evenly spaced. Cut the same number of wire hooks from old coat hangers using wire cutters. Using pliers, twist the end of each hook around a screw until it is firmly attached.  If you wish to paint or decorate the coat rack, do so before attaching the hooks to make things easier. Be sure to attach the coat rack firmly to the wall before hanging anything on it. You can reuse wire hangers without making any modifications to them by rethinking their purpose. By hanging a hanger off a bathroom door cabinet, for instance, you can make a simple magazine or newspaper holder. You can also hang up hangers on the wall to hold a collection of eyeglasses, scarves, ties, bras, or other accessories.","output":"The article provides detailed instructions on how to transform old wire hangers into upgraded, padded clothes hangers, while also offering multiple creative uses and repurposing ideas for wire hangers, including making a coat rack, a newspaper holder, and storage solutions for accessories."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this \\"A teenager has been reunited with a message in a bottle she sent as a toddler, which washed ashore in Russia.\\"","output":"Title: A Serendipitous Voyage: From Toddler to Teenager, a Message in a Bottle, and the Great Russian Adventure Introduction In a world consumed by rapid communication through email, social media and instant messaging, there's something undeniably romantic and nostalgic about the very notion of a message in a bottle. A story of a lonely bottle drifting on the vast ocean while carrying a hopeful message from a curious soul feels like a tale from a different era. For one British teenager, it became a part of her personal story, as she was recently reunited with a message in a bottle she had sent almost fifteen years ago as an excited young toddler. The unexpected return of her note from Russia kicked off an extraordinary adventure that captured the imagination of people across the world. A Toddler's Dream At just three years old, the little British girl, accompanied by her family, took a trip to the beach. Full of excitement, she scribbled a handwritten note, rolled it into a small strip, and sealed it within a glass bottle before watching it drift into the unknown ocean. It might have appeared to be a simple childhood amusement, but unbeknownst to her, the message would embark on a remarkable journey, covering thousands of miles before being fatefully picked up on a remote Russian shore fifteen years later. From Skegness to Arkhangelsk A construction worker from Russia stumbled upon the bottle while walking along the beach in the city of Arkhangelsk, situated along the Northern Dvina River delta. Intrigued by the idea that this peculiar object, nestled amongst rocks and seaweed, might contain a long-lost message from across the globe, he opened it with curiosity. To his delight, he found the rudimentary note within, tattered and smudged by the ravages of time, but still legible enough to read. From the short, childish scribblings, he was able to decipher the girl's name and her address in the UK. The girl, now a teenager, was thrilled when she received a letter from Russia containing both a reproduction of her original message and photographs of the bottle as it lay on the Arctic coast. The sheer magnitude of her message's incredible journey became apparent, as the bottled note had traveled over 2000 miles from the shores of Skegness in the United Kingdom to the chilly coastlines of Arkhangelsk, Russia. Bridging Cultures and Stories Struck by the overwhelming sense of unity and serendipity, both the teenager and the construction worker exchanged messages and shared their respective stories. The girl informed the Russian worker of her childhood beach visit in the UK and elaborated on the simple yet enchanting moment of sending that message out at sea. In turn, the worker revealed his life in Russia and the chance encounter that led him to retrieve the floating relic of her past. The news of their newfound friendship circulated through both British and Russian media, warming the hearts of many who heard their tale. The teenager's story soared beyond her local community, serving as a testament to the unyielding power of human connection. It highlighted that, despite thousands of miles between people and the progression of time, communication and shared experiences sew a captivating narrative that transcends borders and languages. A Timeless Tale in the Digital Age While this story has captured the imaginations of many, it also serves as a poignant reminder to appreciate our world's interconnected nature and cherish the simple connections we forge throughout our lives. In an era where virtual instant communication is commonplace and the world often seems smaller, the almost ancient charm of a message in a bottle retains its power to spark wonder and bring people together across vast distances. It forces us to confront that there is still so much of the world to explore and brings to light the possibility of unexpected and beautiful connections just waiting to be discovered. Conclusion The unusual journey of this bottle, seemingly adrift in space and time, was the catalyst for two strangers from opposite ends of the earth to form a lasting bond. The discovery of the teenager's message on the Russian shore serves as a reminder of life's unpredictability, the beauty of human connections, and that even the smallest, most innocent actions can have profound and lasting effects. The story of a message in a bottle captures our hearts because it offers a glimpse into our complex world, where the unknown awaits to be uncovered, and the simple act of reaching out can result in powerful connections that surpass borders and touch souls."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the background: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color.  and the situation: David is an environmental scientist. Last summer he visited the tropical forest in Brazil. He labeled that part of his study as forest A. To understand the differences between forests he then visited the temperate forest in Germany. He labeled that part of his study as forest B. He found significant differences in these two types of forests.  Answer the following question: Which forest would get more insolation, forest A or forest B?","output":"Based on the given background information and the locations of the two forests, forest A (tropical forest in Brazil) would receive more insolation than forest B (temperate forest in Germany). Tropical forests, such as the one in Brazil, are characterized by their relatively constant and high levels of insolation throughout the year. Insolation, or the amount of sunlight received on Earth's surface, is an important factor influencing the climate and overall conditions of an ecosystem. Tropical forests are located near the equator, and as a result, experience a higher angle of sunlight and a more consistent day-to-day amount of sunlight throughout the year. Due to Earth's axial tilt and orbital characteristics, sunlight directly strikes the equator, resulting in a more concentrated solar energy input for these locations. Temperate forests, such as the one in Germany, on the other hand, experience more varied seasonal changes in insolation levels. These forests are located at higher latitudes, away from the equator, which means sunlight strikes the surface at a lower angle, leading to less concentrated and less direct sunlight exposure. Additionally, temperate forests experience distinct seasonal variations in insolation due to changes in the amount of daylight hours caused by Earth's axial tilt. This leads to fluctuations in energy input and, as a result, less overall insolation compared to tropical forests. In conclusion, forest A (the tropical forest in Brazil) would get more insolation than forest B (the temperate forest in Germany). This greater amount of insolation contributes to the differences in climate, biomass production, and soil characteristics between the two types of forests, which would have been observed by David, the environmental scientist, during his comparative study."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me.

I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower. While in the shower it occurred to him something might not be right. He came back to the table where I was struggling to lift myself from the chair. I put my hands on the table to lift my body and my left hand kept sliding off the edge. He finally got behind me and tried to lift me under my arms and I crumbled to the floor.

Complete the next sentence: A man is sitting on a black mat in a gym. he","output":"has decided to take control of his health and fitness by incorporating a well-rounded workout routine into his daily life. After spending months researching different types of exercise and consulting with fitness professionals, he has come up with a plan that includes a mix of strength training, cardiovascular activities, and flexibility exercises. As he sits on the black mat, he mentally prepares himself for the upcoming workout session. He starts by visualizing his goals and the improvements that he wants to see in terms of his strength, stamina, and physique. He understands that these changes won't happen overnight, but he is committed to making a sustained effort and remaining consistent with his workout schedule. Once he feels mentally ready, the man begins his warm-up routine, which is crucial for preventing injuries and preparing the muscles for more intense activities. He starts with some light stretching, focusing on the major muscle groups such as the hamstrings, quads, and upper body. After spending some time gently stretching the muscles, he transitions into a series of dynamic warm-up movements, including jumping jacks, high knees, and butt kicks to elevate his heart rate and enhance blood circulation. Now that his body is primed for action, the man begins his strength training workout, targeting various muscle groups to ensure a balanced approach. He performs a combination of compound and isolation exercises such as squats, deadlifts, chest presses, and bicep curls, carefully tracking the number of sets and repetitions to monitor his progress. While engaging in these exercises, the man is mindful of proper form and technique to maximize results and minimize the risk of injury. Between sets, he uses the black mat to perform core-strengthening exercises like planks and bicycle crunches, aiming to tighten his abdominal muscles and increase stability. He knows that a strong core is the foundation of a well-functioning and injury-resistant body. After completing his strength training, the man transitions into a cardiovascular workout. He alternates between running on the treadmill, cycling on a stationary bike, and climbing on the stair-master. These activities increase his heart rate, improve his stamina, and burn calories, contributing to overall weight loss and a healthier heart. Finally, as the man concludes his workout, he returns to the black mat to perform a series of cool-down stretches. These help to gradually reduce his heart rate, relieve muscle tension, and enhance flexibility. He takes his time stretching each muscle group thoroughly, reflecting on his achievements during the workout and feeling proud of the dedication and commitment he has shown towards enhancing his overall well-being. Over time, the man begins to see noticeable changes in his body composition, strength, and endurance. He feels energized, confident, and motivated to continue his fitness journey. The gym has become a sanctuary of both physical and mental transformation, where he can escape the stresses of daily life and focus solely on nurturing his mind and body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jimmy runs a modest family-owned hardware store, a business passed down through generations. The tranquility of the town is suddenly disrupted by the unexpected arrival of Vincent (antagonist), a mysterious man with a dark past. Act 2: Jimmy and Vincent had once been childhood friends, but a terrible incident in their teenage years tore them apart. Vincent was exiled from the town, and Jimmy was warned to never speak of him again. After two decades of silence, Vincent's sudden return has Jimmy on edge, as he's plagued by the suspicion that Vincent has come back to exact revenge and kill him. As Vincent starts integrating himself into the town, he instigates a series of seemingly unrelated accidents, causing Jimmy to become paranoid. Jimmy, unable to take the pressure, confides in his trusted friend, Mark, a retired law enforcement officer. Mark advises Jimmy to keep a close eye on Vincent while he investigates further. Act 3: Jimmy's paranoia reaches new heights when he discovers Mark brutally murdered in his home. Convinced that Vincent is behind Mark's death, Jimmy starts to unravel secrets from the past that he had long forgotten. He struggles with the guilt and torment of the hidden truth while trying to keep his family safe. As Jimmy confronts Vincent, memories of their past come flooding back to the surface, revealing Vincent's true motive for returning. All those years ago, Jimmy had betrayed Vincent to save himself from a crime they had both committed. Vincent's revenge isn't only aimed at killing Jimmy, but also exposing Jimmy's dark secret to his family and community, tarnishing his reputation forever. Act 4: In a pulse-pounding climax, Vincent kidnaps Angela and their children, forcing Jimmy into a desperate chase to save them. As his family's lives hang in the balance, Jimmy must confront Vincent and make a life-altering decision - to confess and face his demons or to protect the image he's worked so hard to maintain.

The rule came to light Thursday after a bird-watcher was barred from visiting a falconry display. Married dad of three Matthew Richards, 54, was turned away at the gate after staff said they didn't admit single adults on child protection grounds. \\"I almost feel discriminated against. I could understand it if it was for the attractions that young children only enjoy, but the falconry is of interest to all,\\" he told the Western Daily Press.

Plot title: Clockstoppers Movie plot: The NSA-funded QT (Quantum Tech) Corporation has slated a project to develop Hypertime, a technology which allows the user's molecules to speed up to the point where the world appears to be standing still. After realizing that such technology, contained within a wristwatch frame, could also be used against the USA, the NSA orders the project stopped. However, the research is farther along than the NSA expected and QT's leader Henry Gates plans on using the technology to control the leader of the NSA and dominate the world. He uses the prototype to stretch the weekend in order to give the brilliant lead scientist Earl Dopler time to fix the remaining glitch in the technology after his henchmen Richard and Jay prevent Earl's incognito departure at the airport. However, the disadvantage of Earl being in Hypertime for too long was him aging rapidly in real time, as his molecular age continued at the same rate despite time slowing down. However, initially unknown to Gates, Dopler had sent a prototype to a former colleague of his named Dr. George Gibbs. His son Zak discovers the watch accidentally and initially uses it for fun, much to the amusement of Francesca, the new girl at school who just moved to the U.S. from Venezuela and on whom Zak has a crush. Once Gates finds out about the leaked prototype, he attempts to retrieve it. He sends his henchmen after Zak who break into his house and search for evidence. Upon learning about the ulterior motive of QT Corporation, Zak sets out to warn his father of the danger he could be in. A chase sequence ensues, with Zak crashing the car into the river and thus damaging the watch. He awakes in the hospital with a broken watch and only by a stroke of luck manages to avoid Jay and Richard again. He then goes in search of somewhere safe to hide in the meantime, after having been accused of stealing a van by the police. In a bid to retrieve the watch, QT Corporation enlists the help of national security agencies and portray Zak and his father as fugitives wanted by the law.... My question: Who ends up keeping the watch? Answer:","output":"In the movie Clockstoppers, Zak Gibbs, the protagonist, ultimately retains possession of the watch.

Given the below context:  Article 2 of Brazil's Constitution defined the roles of both the Emperor and the Assembleia Geral (General Assembly or Parliament), which in 1824 was composed of 50 senators and 102 general deputies, as the nation's representatives. The Constitution endowed the Assembly with both status and authority, and created legislative, moderating, executive and judicial branches as \\"delegations of the nation\\" with the separation of those powers envisaged as providing balances in support of the Constitution and the rights it enshrined.The prerogatives and authority granted to the legislature within the Constitution meant that it could and would play a major and indispensable role in the functioning of the government—it was not just a rubber stamp. The General Assembly alone could enact, revoke, interpret and suspend laws under Article 13 of the Constitution. The legislature also held the power of the purse and was required to annually authorize expenditures and taxes. It alone approved and exercised oversight of government loans and debts. Other responsibilities entrusted to the Assembly included setting the size of the military's forces, the creation of offices within the government, monitoring the national welfare and ensuring that the government was being run in conformity to the Constitution. This last provision allowed the legislature wide authority to examine and debate government policy and conduct. Regarding matters of foreign policy, the Constitution (under Article 102) required that the General Assembly be consulted about declarations of war, treaties and the conduct of international relations. A determined legislator could exploit these Constitutional provisions to block or limit government decisions, influence appointments and force reconsideration of policies.During its annual four-month sessions the Assembly conducted public debates. These were widely reported and formed a national forum for the expression of public concerns from all parts of the country. It was frequently a venue for expressing opposition...

Possible answers: found a good reporter, acquired a good transcriptionist, acquired a good lawyer Answer:","output":"Before going to trial, Robin has already made some important decisions by hiring a good lawyer and a private investigator. While these are essential steps, there are a few more key actions Robin needs to take in order to ensure the best possible outcome at the trial. 1. Develop a strong case strategy: Robin, along with the lawyer and the private investigator, needs to devise a well-thought-out strategy for presenting the facts and evidence at the trial. This includes brainstorming arguments, anticipating counterarguments, gathering information and documents to support the case, and having clear objectives. 2. Gather evidence and prepare witnesses: The private investigator's role is crucial in gathering any additional evidence or information relating to the case. Any eyewitnesses or expert witnesses should be identified and interviewed by the lawyer and the private investigator. These witnesses should be prepared to testify in court to support Robin's case. 3. Obtain necessary legal documents and filings: Robin's lawyer will need to secure and file all required legal documents, such as pleadings, motions, and discovery requests. This paperwork is essential to properly present the case in court and may have critical deadlines for submission. 4. Conduct discovery: The discovery process is when both parties in the case exchange information and evidence formally. Robin's lawyer will need to conduct depositions, request documents from the opposing party, and answer any discovery requests made by the opposing counsel. 5. Prepare for trial: Robin and the lawyer should review the facts and evidence of the case together, determine the best order of presentation, practice opening and closing statements, and anticipate cross-examinations by the opposing counsel. Proper trial preparation is essential to ensure a smooth case presentation and increase the chances of a favorable outcome. 6. Acquire a good transcriptionist: While this task does not necessarily need to be completed personally by Robin, it is still an important component of a successful trial. The transcriptionist will create a written record of everything said during the trial, which is vital for appeals or other post-trial matters. 7. Maintain open communication: Throughout the entire process, Robin should maintain open communication with the lawyer and the private investigator to share information and updates on the case. This collaboration can help to make strategic decisions and improve the overall case presentation at trial. In summary, Robin needs to work closely with the lawyer and private investigator to create a strong case strategy, gather evidence, prepare witnesses, file necessary legal documents, conduct discovery, and prepare for trial. Acquiring a good transcriptionist would also be beneficial for accurate record-keeping during the trial. By actively participating in these processes and maintaining open communication, Robin increases the chances of a successful outcome at trial."},{"instruction":"Choose from:  *Yes  *No Given those answer options, answer the question: Sydney accomplished Tracy's objectives.

Els is battling for a tournament win but also to clinch his place in the lucrative FedEx Cup playoffs which start next week. He is currently 126th in the standings, with only the top 125 to qualify so three birdies in five holes on his back nine on the way to a 66 helped his cause. \\"I've got quite a large goal for me this week, and you know, I'm feeling like, fine, my game is turning around a little bit,\\" Els told the official PGA Tour website.

Now, let's examine whether the premise can provide any insight into the validity of the hypothesis. The premise details a situation where a house is being repaired in hot and sunny weather. This information contradicts the existence of rain, as rain typically implies the presence of cloud cover and cooler temperatures compared to a hot, sunny day. However, it is important to note that the premise does not provide information about time or location.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The human body has hundreds of muscles. The three types are skeletal  muscles, smooth muscles and cardiac, or heart muscles. Each kind of muscle has a special job to do. The skeletal muscles are attached to the bones; they actually hold the skeleton together. Strong cords, called tendons , help connect these muscles to the bones. Skeletal muscles give us strength and allow us to move in many ways. If you look at skeletal muscles through a microscope, you will see that it has bands of fibers that look like stripes . These stripes are called striations. Skeletal muscles usually move because the brain has sent a conscious message to them telling them what to do. This is called voluntary movement. Another type of muscle is smooth muscle. Unlike skeletal muscle, smooth muscle does not have striations. This is found in organs such as the stomach, the bladder , the lungs and the eyes. Smooth muscles are smaller than the skeletal muscles and they move involuntarily. The brain tells these muscles what to do, but we aren't even aware of it. For example, we don't have to think about breathing or digesting food. The smooth muscles just do their jobs automatically. For this reason smooth muscles are sometimes called involuntary muscles. Like smooth muscle, cardiac muscle also works involuntarily. It is a very thick muscle that is found only in the walls of the heart. Its job is to pump blood out of the heart and into blood vessels called arteries . The arteries help carry the blood to all parts of the body. When the cardiac muscles relax, they let blood back into the heart. Cardiac muscles have striations, just like skeletal muscles do. Question: Skeletal muscles and heart muscles are alike because  _  . Options: A: both can move voluntarily B: both are thick muscles C: both are bigger than smooth muscles D: both have stripes called striations The answer to this question is:","output":"D: both have stripes called striations Step 1: Read and analyze the article.

A: The article specifies that skeletal muscles move voluntarily, while cardiac muscles work involuntarily. B: No comparison is made regarding the thickness of these muscles in the article. C: The size comparison is made between smooth muscles and skeletal muscles, but not with cardiac muscles. D: As established in step 2, both skeletal muscles and cardiac muscles have striations.

Thor Heyerdahl (Norwegian pronunciation: [tu:r 'haei@da:l]; October 6, 1914 - April 18, 2002) was a Norwegian adventurer and ethnographer with a background in zoology, botany, and geography. He became notable for his Kon-Tiki expedition in 1947, in which he sailed 8,000 km (5,000 mi) across the Pacific Ocean in a hand-built raft from South America to the Tuamotu Islands. The expedition was designed to demonstrate that ancient people could have made long sea voyages, creating contacts between separate cultures. This was linked to a diffusionist model of cultural development. In 1947, Heyerdahl and five fellow adventurers sailed from Peru to the Tuamotu Islands, French Polynesia in a pae-pae raft that they had constructed from balsa wood and other native materials, christened the Kon-Tiki. The Kon-Tiki expedition was inspired by old reports and drawings made by the Spanish Conquistadors of Inca rafts, and by native legends and archaeological evidence suggesting contact between South America and Polynesia. The Kon-Tiki smashed into the reef at Raroia in the Tuamotus on August 7, 1947, after a 101-day, 4,300-nautical-mile (5,000-mile or 8,000 km) journey across the Pacific Ocean. Heyerdahl had nearly drowned at least twice in childhood and did not take easily to water; he said later that there were times in each of his raft voyages when he feared for his life.  Kon-Tiki demonstrated that it was possible for a primitive raft to sail the Pacific with relative ease and safety, especially to the west (with the trade winds). The raft proved to be highly manoeuvrable, and fish congregated between the nine balsa logs in such numbers that ancient sailors could have possibly relied on fish for hydration in the absence of other sources of fresh water. Other rafts have repeated the voyage, inspired by Kon-Tiki. Heyerdahl's book about The Kon-Tiki Expedition: By Raft Across the South Seas has been translated into 70 languages. The documentary film of the expedition entitled Kon-Tiki won an Academy Award in 1951. A dramatised version was released in 2012, also called Kon-Tiki, and was nominated for both the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards and a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 70th Golden Globe Awards. It was the first time that a Norwegian film was nominated for both an Oscar and a Golden Globe.  Anthropologists continue to believe that Polynesia was settled from west to east, based on linguistic, physical, and genetic evidence, migration having begun from the Asian mainland. There are controversial indications, though, of some sort of South American/Polynesian contact, most notably in the fact that the South American sweet potato is served as a dietary staple throughout much of Polynesia. Blood samples taken in 1971 and 2008 from Easter Islanders without any European or other external descent were analysed in a 2011 study, which concluded that the evidence supported some aspects of Heyerdahl's hypothesis. This result has been questioned because of the possibility of contamination by South Americans after European contact with the islands. However, more recent DNA work (after Heyerdahl's death) contradicts the post-European-contact contamination hypothesis, finding the South American DNA sequences to be far older than that. Heyerdahl had attempted to counter the linguistic argument with the analogy that he would prefer to believe that African-Americans came from Africa, judging from their skin colour, and not from England, judging from their speech.

They catch the eye of another person, meaning that they grab their attention or make eye contact. 2. \\"eye\\" - The word \\"eye\\" is crucial because it represents the focal point of the interaction or connection formed between the two individuals involved in this scenario. Specifically, eye contact is used as a non-verbal communication tool, indicating interest, emotion, or acknowledgment. 3. \\"turns\\" - The verb \\"turns\\" is another important action word within the sentence, as it describes the physical movement of the first individual (someone) in response to establishing eye contact with the second individual. Turning is a way to further engage or respond to the initial connection made through eye contact. 4. \\"face\\" - This term is noteworthy because it indicates the body part or direction the first individual turns toward, which in this case is directly facing the second individual. This act conveys engagement, communication, and potential interaction as the two people are now facing each other. 5. \\"them\\" - The word \\"them\\" refers to the second person in the situation and is significant because it provides information about the individual to whom the first person's actions are directed. By turning to face \\"them,\\" the sentence clarifies that the connection and following interaction are specifically directed towards that second individual.

Betty in turn looks up to Ida, much to Beasleyâs dismay, and Ida promises to keep the insects under check. Later that night, she examines the new insect, which she fondly names âMickâ, and informs her friend Max of the creature. Meanwhile, âMickâ escapes from his tank and attacks Beasleyâs pet dog, consuming the animal. The next day, Ida asks Misty out. They go on a date, and Misty asks if they can watch a movie about âTexas Pixiesâ on Ida's DVD player, which Ida accepts. Misty is introduced to Betty and the apartment, though Ida keeps her away from the bedroom where all her insects are hidden. The two get closer until interrupted by Max.

In other words, the first boards should run into the second, with the post sticking on the outside rather than the inside. Continue around the square until all the boards are joined. Once you've done that, measure across the square diagonally to make sure it's all square. If it's not, adjust the square by moving it slightly.  Add the other stakes. Hammer them into the ground up against the middle of each wall on the outside, then use deck screws to attach them to the wall. Finally, add in soil. Another option is raised rows. Raised rows are like raised beds, but they aren't structured like raised beds. Instead, you create them with just the soil.  When the soil is dry, spread biodegradable material on top of it, such as compost or rotting hay or grass. With a garden rake or rototiller, work it into the soil until the soil is loose and crumbly. Stake out how you want your rows to go. You want them to be about 4 feet wide or a little shorter if you can't reach to the middle. Between the rows, you need space to walk. If you want room for a wheelbarrow, make the in-between part at least a foot to two feet wide. Create raised beds by moving the soil from the paths into the raised beds. A rake is good for this purpose. You may need to use a shovel near the end. To keep the paths from growing anything, line them with newspaper (5 pieces thick). You can also use cardboard. Put mulch or wood chips on top. You can find soil kits at your local gardening store, or you can take a soil sample into your county extension office for testing. Your soil should be at between 6 and 6.8 pH.  You may need to adjust the pH of the soil. If you need to make it more acidic (down towards 6.8), you'll add powdered sulfur, aluminum sulfate, or iron sulfate. To up the pH (make it slightly more alkaline), add lime.  If you need help deciding how much, use a pH kit from your local university agriculture extension office, which will give you detailed instructions about what to add. Find your local extension at http://nifa.usda.gov/partners-and-extension-map?state=All&type=Extension. Onions need nitrogen to grow well. Therefore, always add nitrogen to the soil before planting. You can also work nitrogen in the soil in the fall to help for the next spring. The easiest way to add nitrogen is to use a fertilizer rich in nitrogen. Good sources of nitrogen include fertilizers, composted manure, blood meal, and other composted organic materials. Summary:","output":"Plant onions in a sunny location and use raised beds or raised rows with the right soil pH and added nitrogen for better growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The band consists of vocalist Dolores O'Riordan, guitarist Noel Hogan, bassist Mike Hogan and drummer Fergal Lawler. Although widely associated with alternative rock, the band's sound also incorporates indie pop, post-punk, Irish folk and pop rock elements.  - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - The iPod Touch (stylized and marketed as iPod touch) is an iOS-based all-purpose handheld PC designed and marketed by Apple Inc. with a user interface that is touchscreen-based. It can be used as a music and video player, digital camera, handheld game device, and personal digital assistant (PDA). It connects to the Internet only through Wi-Fi base stations, does not use cellular network data, and is therefore not a smartphone, though it has a similar design to the iPhone and is often referred to as the \\"iPhone without a phone\\". Furthermore, it does not fit in Apple's iPhone accessories such as their leather cases. As of May 2013, 100 million iPod Touch units had been sold. It is also the most popular iPod model.  - Electronica is an umbrella term that encompasses a broad group of electronic-based styles such as techno, house, ambient, drum and bass, jungle, and industrial dance, among others. It has been used to describe the rise of electronic music styles intended not just for dancing but also concentrated listening.  - Mono Band is Noel Hogan 's side project from The Cranberries . The Remixes EP was released on iTunes and various other online music stores .  - macOS (pronounced ; previously Mac OS X, then simply OS X) is the current series of Unix-based graphical operating systems developed and marketed by Apple Inc. designed to run on Apple's Macintosh computers, having been preinstalled on all Macs since 2002.

It is used to play, download, and organize digital downloads of music and video (as well as other types of media available on the iTunes Store) on personal computers running the macOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems. The iTunes Store is also available on the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.  - Mono Band is an Irish rock/electronica band. Mono Band has a rather unusual approach in utilising a different lead vocalist for almost every song. The group first appeared when Noel Hogan's website announced the name of his new project on 9 October 2004. Mono Band's first gig was 13 March 2005 at Dolan's in Limerick.

The iTunes Store's revenues in the first quarter of 2011 totalled nearly US1.4 billion; by May 28, 2014, the store had sold 35 billion songs worldwide.   - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music.  - iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc.

Q: What are two common weather characteristics of hurricanes?   A: Choose your answer from:  - low winds and sandstorms  - high winds and snowfall  - small winds and rainfall  - high winds and rainfall Answer:","output":"Based on the given options, the answer is: - high winds and rainfall Hurricanes are characterized by high winds and heavy rainfall, as they develop over warm tropical waters. A hurricane is a type of tropical cyclone, a rapidly rotating storm system with a low-pressure center, spiral rainbands, and powerful winds. These storms draw their energy from the warm ocean waters, causing convection and ultimately leading to the formation and strengthening of the hurricane. High winds in a hurricane are one of its most dangerous features, as they can cause extensive damage to structures, trees, and power lines. Depending on the severity of the storm, wind speeds in a hurricane can range from 74 mph (119 kph) to over 155 mph (249 kph). It is important to note that hurricanes are categorized based on their sustained wind speeds, with the highest category being a Category 5 storm. The second characteristic of hurricanes is the rainfall they bring. The warm, moist air at the center of the storm rises and cools, leading to the formation of clouds and precipitation. As a result, hurricanes are notorious for producing heavy rainfall, which often leads to flooding and landslides, particularly in areas with poor infrastructure or drainage systems. Rainfall amounts vary from storm to storm, but it is not uncommon for a hurricane to dump several inches to over a foot of rain in a short period, which can be detrimental to communities in its path. In summary, the two common weather characteristics of hurricanes are high winds and heavy rainfall. These aspects make hurricanes extremely dangerous and capable of causing significant damage, making it crucial for people living in hurricane-prone regions to closely monitor and prepare for these powerful storms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the following passage  \\"An earlier draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, titled Go Set a Watchman, was controversially released on July 14, 2015. This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed. Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \\"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\\" This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\".

They were exposed to water and that lead to karst lanscapes, caves, blue holes, stalactites and stalagmites.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which of the two mountains had fewer karst landscapes? The answer to this question is:","output":"The Berg mountains in Berg county. I reached this conclusion by analyzing the information provided step-by-step: 1. The Berg mountains are of volcanic nature, which means they are formed from solidified lava or volcanic ash, and they have few caves. 2. The Gorge mountains are made of sedimentary rocks, predominantly limestone. This type of rock is more easily eroded by water, which can create karst landscapes. 3. The Gorge mountains have been exposed to water, leading to the formation of karst landscapes, caves, blue holes, stalactites, and stalagmites. 4. Because the Berg mountains have fewer caves and are made of volcanic rocks, they are less likely to have karst landscapes compared to the Gorge mountains, which have experienced more erosion and cave formation due to their limestone composition and exposure to water.

Those who oppose the communist government are represented in part by the Cuban-American lobby, which supports the U.S. embargo against Cuba and presses the communist government for political change. Other Cuban-American groups, some of which are anti-Communist, advocate different policies, opposing the embargo and favoring more cultural and economic engagement. Most prominent of these groups are the Brigada Antonio Maceo, Alianza Martiana, Miami Coalition Against the Embargo of Cuba, Alianza de Trabajadores de la Comunidad Cubana, Cuban American Defense League and Rescate Cultural AfroCubano. The Cuban government accuses Miami-based exiles of organizing over 700 armed incursions against Cuba over the past 40 years such as  machine-gun attacks on the Guitart Cayo Coco Hotel by Alpha 66 in 1994 and 1995. The Cuban government has long contended that some South Florida Spanish-language journalists are paid by the U.S. government. On September 8, 2006, it was revealed that at least ten South Florida journalists,  veteran reporters and a freelancer including some associated with the El Nuevo Herald, received payments totaling thousands of dollars over several years from the U.S. government for programs on Radio Martí and TV Martí, broadcasts aimed at undermining the Cuban state.

One, Lieutenant Drake, from a middle-class background, is extremely eager to fit in while the other, Lieutenant Millington, the son of a general, is keen to get out as soon as possible and deliberately antagonizes his fellow officers. The two newcomers learn the traditions of the regiment, one of which is a mess game in which they chase a wooden pig on wheels, attempting to pierce its anus with their swords. Mrs Scarlett, the flirtatious and attractive widow of a captain who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, is a constant presence in the regiment.  One night at a mess dance, Millington gets drunk and tries to seduce Mrs Scarlett in the garden. She repels him, but moments later runs back into the mess wounded and in shock, claiming the culprit was Millington. An informal court martial -more a mock trial than anything else- is organized with Drake ordered to be Millington's defending officer. Although Drake is pressured by his superior officer to plead guilty for Millington and close the case quickly, he begins to challenge the orders in order to give the defendant a fair trial. Drake learns from an Indian servant that another widow suffered a similar attack with a sword six months earlier, before he and Millington joined. After irrefutable evidence, Mrs Scarlett finally admits it was not Millington who attacked her but will not say who the culprit is. Millington, now indisputably proved innocent, is welcomed back by his brother officers; but Drake, disgusted by the truth he's uncovered, resigns. One officer knows who the culprit is and, hiding Drake in the shadows so he may witness what is to take place, confronts the guilty man privately in the final scene. contains an answer for the question: What is the rank of the man accused of attacking the widow?, what is it ?

Reconstruction played out against an economy in ruin. The Confederacy in 1861 had 297 towns and cities with a total population of 835,000 people; of these 162 with 681,000 people were at one point occupied by Union forces. Eleven were destroyed or severely damaged by war action, including Atlanta (with an 1860 population of 9,600), Charleston, Columbia, and Richmond (with prewar populations of 40,500, 8,100, and 37,900, respectively); the eleven contained 115,900 people in the 1860 census, or 14% of the urban South. The number of people who lived in the destroyed towns represented just over 1% of the Confederacys combined urban and rural populations. The rate of damage in smaller towns was much lower—only 45 courthouses were burned out of a total of 830. Based on the above article, answer a question.

Game developers have to think about the limits of the console and the goal of the game, but...I played about 4 hours of it and thought this game [...stunk]. Boring gameplay, virtually no feeling of freedom (2-D), and that irritating nonsensical language. I do have the odd feeling, though, that if you like anime, that you might like this game.

To that end, he devised an experiment in which he used three components, comp A, comp B, and comp C. Comp A was a machine that applied force over a shorter distance. Comp B was also a machine, but it applied force over a longer distance. Comp C was not a machine.  Would comp A increase or not increase the force applied compared to comp B? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let's go through the process step by step. 1. Understand the given information: - John wants to invent a machine. - He is using three components: comp A, comp B, and comp C. - Comp A: machine that applies force over a shorter distance. - Comp B: machine that applies force over a longer distance. - Comp C: not a machine. 2. Analyze the relationship between force, distance, and work: - The work done by a machine can be calculated using the following formula:   Work = Force × Distance - For a machine, if the input work is constant, the output work will also be constant. This implies that:   Input work = Output work   Input force × Input distance = Output force × Output distance 3. Compare comp A and comp B: - Since input work is constant for both machines, we can compare output force for both machines by comparing their output distances. 4. Analyze distances: - Comp A applies force over a shorter distance, while comp B applies force over a longer distance. - Based on the relationship between force and distance (Output force × Output distance = constant), if the output distance is shorter, the output force must be greater to maintain the constant work. Conversely, if the output distance is longer, the output force must be smaller to maintain the constant work. 5. Conclusion: - Comp A, which applies force over a shorter distance, would increase the force applied compared to comp B, which applies force over a longer distance."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: - residence is anchorage , kentucky    - death place is louisville , kentucky , u.s.a.    - title is mayor of louisville    - term is 1921 -- 1925    - death cause is heart disease    - successor is arthur a. will    - party is republican party    - death date is 14 august 1938    - predecessor is george weissinger smith      - birth date is 4 august 1876      - birth place is anchorage , kentucky , u.s.a.    - occupation is attorney , politician , executive    Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Answer based on context: Although nominally part of the Ottoman Empire, Yemen and the sahil  came progressively under the control of Muhammad Ali, ruler of Egypt, between 1821 and 1841. After the Egyptians withdrew from the Yemeni seaboard in 1841, Haj Ali Shermerki, a successful and ambitious Somali merchant, purchased from them executive rights over Zeila. Shermerki's governorship had an instant effect on the city, as he manoeuvred to monopolize as much of the regional trade as possible, with his sights set as far as Harar and the Ogaden. Shermerki was later succeeded as Governor of Zeila by Abu Bakr Pasha, a local Afar statesman. In 1874-75, the Egyptians obtained a firman from the Ottomans by which they secured claims over the city. At the same time, the Egyptians received British recognition of their nominal jurisdiction as far east as Cape Guardafui. In actuality, however, Egypt had little authority over the interior and their period of rule on the coast was brief, lasting only a few years . The British Somaliland protectorate was subsequently established in the late 1880s, after the ruling Somali authorities signed a series of protection treaties granting the British access to their territories on the northwestern coast. Among the Somali signatories were the Gadabuursi , Habar Awal , and Warsangali. When the Egyptian garrison in Harar was eventually evacuated in 1885, Zeila became caught up in the competition between the Tadjoura-based French and the British for control of the strategic Gulf of Aden littoral. By the end of 1885, the two powers were on the brink of armed confrontation, but opted instead to turn negotiations. They later signed a convention on 1 February 1888 defining the border between French Somaliland and British Somaliland. How many years after the Egyptians withdrew from the Yemeni seaboard did the Egyptians obtain a firman from the Ottomans which secured their claims over the city?","output":"After the Egyptians withdrew from the Yemeni seaboard in 1841, it took them about 33 years to obtain a firman from the Ottomans, which secured their claims over the city in 1874-75."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - An animal eats a lot of food to fatten up - The animal finds or builds a suitable place to hibernate where they can stay warm and protected - The animal moves into their den - Their heart rate and breathing slow down to conserve energy - They emerge from the den when the weather is warming up again.  Question: suppose Taking better care of your health happens, how will it affect animal is protected for hibernation.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","output":"If an individual focuses on taking better care of their health, it may have various indirect effects on how an animal is protected during hibernation. Here, we will discuss three potential scenarios: more protection, less protection, and no effect. A: More Protection It is possible that if someone takes better care of their own health, they would become more conscious of their environment and the creatures that inhabit it. By adopting healthier habits, they may start to have a broader concern for the well-being of both themselves and other living beings. This newfound interest might lead them to participate in conservation programs or support organizations that work to protect hibernating animals. Furthermore, healthier individuals may invest time in learning about hibernating animals to educate themselves or others about how to protect these creatures during their vulnerable state. B: Less Protection On the other hand, taking better care of one's health could potentially have a negative effect on the protection of animals during hibernation. If an individual is preoccupied with their health and well-being, they may become more self-centric and less focused on the environment or other species. This might result in carelessness when it comes to preserving habitats or taking precautions to minimize disruptions to hibernating animals' environments. Additionally, a focus on one's own health might lead someone to prioritize personal comfort and convenience, which could inadvertently harm the environment and the animals within it. C: No Effect There is also a scenario in which taking better care of one's health has no direct impact on the protection of hibernating animals. Many factors contribute to the well-being of these creatures, such as habitat conservation efforts, climate change, and other environmental factors. An individual focusing on their health may not have any significant influence on these larger issues that determine hibernating animals' safety. In this case, personal health choices may neither help nor harm the animals. In conclusion, the impact of taking better care of one's health on the protection of hibernating animals can vary, depending on the individual's level of involvement and concern for the environment and other living beings. It could lead to more protection if the person becomes more mindful and engaged in conservation efforts, it could be less protective if the individual's focus on personal health results in environmental neglect or carelessness, or it could have no effect at all if other factors outside the person's control continue to play the most significant role in determining the animals' safety. Ultimately, it is essential for individuals striving to improve their health and well-being to also consider the broader implications of their actions and choices, and how these may impact the environment and other species."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: The essay was due in just a few days and it was time to prepare so Quinn read an article.

Wilson, is a diplomat who most recently has served as a U.S. ambassador to Gabon, Sao Tome and Principe. Due to his extensive background, Wilson is approached by Plame's CIA colleagues to travel to Niger and glean information as to whether yellowcake uranium is being procured by Iraq for use in the construction of nuclear weasons. Wilson determines to his own satisfaction that it is not.After military action is taken by George W. Bush, who justifies it in a 2003 State of the Union address by alluding to the uranium's use in building weapons of mass destruction, Wilson submits an op-ed piece to the New York Times claiming these reports to be categorically untrue.Plame's status as a CIA agent is subsequently revealed in the media, the leak possibly coming from White House officials including the Vice President's chief of staff and national security adviser, Scooter Libby, in part to discredit her husband's allegation that the Bush administration had manipulated intelligence to justify the invasion of Iraq. As a result, Plame is instantly dismissed from the agency, leaving several of her delicate operations in limbo and creating a rift in her marriage.Plame leaves her husband, further angered by his granting of television and print interviews, which expose them both to public condemnation and death threats.

Search for publicly available stories, articles, or anecdotes on the internet related to karma. 2. Look for testimonies shared by people or social experiments revealing the consequences of actions that are in line with the concept of karma. 3. Verify the credibility and source of these stories to ensure their authenticity. After some research, I found a few examples that seem to be instances of karma in real life: 1. A man who stole a wallet from an old lady in China was captured by the police after he got stuck in an elevator, giving the authorities enough time to apprehend him. 2. A driver who excessively tailgated another vehicle ended up crashing their own vehicle after attempting to overtake in a poorly judged maneuver. 3.

This act of kindness unexpectedly started a chain reaction of 378 people paying for someone else's coffee.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Libyan Rebels Report Gains in Misrata Fighting TRIPOLI, Libya -- Rebels battled Muammar Qaddafi's troops Thursday for control of central Misrata, driving dozens of snipers from tall buildings in hours of urban warfare and gaining a tactical advantage in the only major city held by the opposition in western Libya, witnesses said. The Libyan government, meanwhile, ramped up its rhetoric against NATO, warning that \\"it will be hell\\" for the alliance if it sends in ground troops, even though Britain's prime minister said the Western nations were not moving toward such a deployment. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said President Barack Obama has approved the use of armed Predator drones in Libya. The drones allow for low-level precision attacks and are uniquely suited for urban areas such as Misrata, where NATO airpower has been unable to protect civilians when Qaddafi's forces are operating inside the city. Also Thursday, rebels captured a Libyan border crossing into Tunisia, forcing government soldiers to flee over the frontier and possibly opening a new channel for opposition forces in Qaddafi's bastion in western part of the country. At least seven people were killed in Thursday's fighting for the main Misrata thoroughfare of Tripoli Street, bringing to 20 the number slain in three days in Libya's third-largest city. Misrata has been besieged by government forces for nearly two months, with human rights groups estimating hundreds of people killed. Tripoli Street is the site where two Western photojournalists were killed Wednesday as the rebels tried to dislodge the snipers loyal to Qaddafi perched on rooftops. The street, which stretches from the heart of Misrata to a major highway southwest of the city of 300,000 people, has become a front line for the rebels and Qaddafi's forces. The rebels took over several buildings along parts of the street, enabling them to cut off supplies to a Qaddafi unit and dozens of rooftop snipers who have terrorized civilians and kept them trapped in their homes, said a doctor who identified himself only as Ayman for fear of retaliation. \\"This battle cost us lots of blood and martyrs,\\" the doctor said. Residents celebrated and chanted \\"God is great\\" after the snipers left a battle-scarred insurance building that is the highest point in central Misrata, according to a witness who identified himself only as Sohaib. \\"Thanks to God, the snipers fled, leaving nothing behind at the insurance building after they were cut off from supplies -- ammunition, food and water -- for days,\\" added another resident, Abdel Salam. He called it \\"a major victory\\" because the structure gave the pro-Qaddafi forces a commanding view of the city. In Tripoli, government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim claimed Qaddafi forces control more than 80 percent of the city and the rebels hold \\"the seaport and the area surrounding it.\\" Residents said that at the beginning of the battle for Misrata, the government deployed tanks and shelled the city indiscriminately, forcing residents to flee their homes and businesses, which were taken over by Qaddafi's forces. NATO commanders have admitted their airpower was limited in being able to protect civilians in cities like Misrata, which was the main mission of the international air campaign. Abdel Salam, who asked to be identified only by his given name for fear of retribution, said Qaddafi's forces were using tanks and rocket-propelled grenades. \\"Col. Qaddafi's troops continue their vicious attacks, including the siege of Misrata,\\" Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said in Washington. \\"There are even reports that Qaddafi forces may have used cluster bombs against their own people.\\" Libyan officials have persistently denied the use of cluster bombs, which indiscriminately spray small bomblets over a wide area and are particularly lethal in residential areas. However, Human Rights Watch has said it found evidence of cluster bombs being used by government forces in Misrata. Earlier this week, Britain, Italy and France said they were sending military officers to advise the rebels, prompting speculation that this was a step toward sending in ground forces at a time when NATO airstrikes were failing to break the battlefield stalemate or protect civilians in Misrata. Ibrahim, the government spokesman, warned that NATO would find itself entangled in fighting ordinary Libyans if its soldiers were to set foot on Libyan soil. \\"We are arming the whole population, not to fight the rebels, by the way, because the rebels are very easy -- they are not a challenge for us,\\" Ibrahim said. \\"What we are fighting is NATO now.\\" Ibrahim said the Qaddafi regime is ready to observe an immediate cease-fire and negotiate the terms of political transition. Rebels have said Qaddafi must step down before such talks can begin. \\"We are ready and accepting peace ... but we are also ready for war,\\" Ibrahim said. \\"If NATO comes, it will be hell.\\" But British Prime Minister David Cameron insisted NATO isn't edging toward deploying ground troops in Libya. Italy, France and Britain are sending experienced combat advisers to help train and organize Libya's opposition forces dislodge Qaddafi after four decades in power. Ministers have insisted the officers won't play any role in offensives against Qaddafi's troops -- and have repeatedly said NATO and allies won't overstep boundaries set out in the United Nations resolution authorizing action in Libya. \\"We're not allowed, rightly, to have an invading army, or an occupying army,\\" Cameron told BBC Scotland radio. \\"That's not what we want, that's not what the Libyans want, that's not what the world wants.\\" The capture of the border crossing with Tunisia in western Libya followed three days of intense fighting outside the desert town of Nalut, about 140 miles (240 kilometers) southwest of Tripoli, said a rebel leader, Shaban Abu Sitta. The area was briefly in hands of anti-government forces last month before Libyan troops moved in. Holding the Dhuheiba border crossing could open important supply routes for anti-Qaddafi forces and give the rebels another foothold in western Libya. After taking control of the crossing early Thursday, rebels raised the pre-Qaddafi tricolor flag. In recent weeks, more than 10,000 Libyans from the border region had crossed into Tunisia, and 1,200 found shelter in a tent camp near the village of Dhuheiba, a few miles from the border. When people in the camp learned of the takeover of the crossing, they chanted, \\"The rebels brought freedom to their town.\\" By afternoon, hundreds of Libyan refugees had assembled at the crossing, waiting to return home. Also Thursday, the Greek passenger ferry Ionian Spirit carried more than 1,000 people fleeing Misrata to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi in eastern Libya, where 30 ambulances were waiting. The ship's passengers included dozens of wounded and shell-shocked Libyans, hundreds of migrant workers from Africa, as well as smaller groups from Pakistan, Nigeria and the Philippines. Four of the injured were seriously hurt It also carried the bodies of two photojournalists killed in Misrata on Wednesday: Chris Hondros, a New York-based photographer for Getty Images, and British-born Tim Hetherington, co-director of the 2010 Afghanistan war documentary \\"Restrepo\\" that was nominated for an Academy Award. Also aboard was the body of a Ukrainian doctor who was killed by an artillery blast in Misrata. Several banners were hung to greet the ferry. One said: \\"U.K. and U.S., your blood was mixed with ours in Misrata.\\"","output":"The article talks about the battle between Libyan rebels and forces loyal to Muammar Qaddafi in central Misrata. The rebels managed to take control after hours of fighting and managed to drive away enemy snipers from tall buildings, gaining a strategic advantage. Despite this, the Libyan government escalated its warning against NATO, threatening severe consequences if ground troops were deployed. However, British authorities maintained that they were not planning such a deployment. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates confirmed that President Obama approved the use of armed Predator drones in Libya, specifically due to their suitability for low-level precision attacks in urban areas.  The rebels also secured a significant win by capturing a Libyan border crossing into Tunisia, pushing government opposing forces back over the frontier. This victory may allow the rebels to open up a new channel in their fight against Qaddafi in the western part of the country. Despite these developments, the cost was high with at least seven people killed in the fighting, bringing the total death toll in three days to 20 in Libya's third-largest city. Misrata has been under siege by government forces for nearly two months. Government forces denied using cluster bombs against civilians which was contradicted by Human Rights Watch, who found evidence of their usage. There's also an update on the status of foreign involvement in Libya - Britain, Italy, France are sending military officers to provide advisory roles to the rebels. They clarify that these officers will not participate directly in offensives against Qaddafi's forces.  Moreover, the rebels took control of Dhuheiba border crossing, which may lead to important supply routes for the opposition forces. The article concludes with the news of a Greek passenger ferry carrying over 1000 people, including injured and shell-shocked Libyans and migrant workers, from Misrata to Benghazi in eastern Libya. The ferry also transported the bodies of two slain photojournalists."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

WHITE HOUSE — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, the House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations as well as other issues that have divided the country’s major political parties. The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Mystery: Archaeologist Dr Jacqui Wood has found dozens of witch pits including one believed to be from the 1970s. A secret coven of Cornish witches first formed in the 1640s has been digging pits lined with animal skins, bird carcasses and feathers as recently as the 1970s as part of a fertility ritual, it was revealed today. Archaeologist Jacqui Wood has discovered dozens of shallow rectangular holes near the hamlet of Saveock near Truro since 2003. Locals believe that two spinsters from the village, who died in the 1980s, were members of a coven of local witches who may have links to the pits and passed on their secrets. The freshest hole contains animal bones wrapped in a synthetic twine only used in Cornwall since the 1970s, which means the witch or witches who dug it are very likely to be alive, she says. Dr Wood's theory is that generations of local women have slaughtered and skinned animals and birds to help them fall pregnant. The earliest witch pit dates back to the 1640s and is lined with a slaughtered swan turned inside-out, claws from other birds and a small pile of stones. In ancient folklore the swan is a symbol of fertility and new life. Others were lined with the skins of animals like cats and dogs, and many have large numbers of birds eggs buried as the chicks were about to hatch. Remarkably the pits often contain a pile of  pebbles only found at Swanpool beach near Falmouth, which is 15 miles away from Saveock. Dr Wood believes that the pits may be an offering to St Brigid of Kildare in Ireland, the patron saint of newborn babies, dug by women who were struggling to get pregnant. Other theories involve witches who wanted to marry and have children. She told MailOnline: 'It is a faith system dating back at least 350 years and I believe it is linked to witchcraft. It is all still a secret, probably passed down from mother to daughter. Grim: The pits contain animal carcasses or in this case the wing of a swan and a set of egg. Swans are linked to folklore as symbols of rejuvenation and fertility. Symbols: Many of the holes contain eggs from a variety of birds all with chicks that were about the hatch while others contain the skins of animals and birds feathers, right. 'We know that one pit must have been dug in the 1970s. It contained orange baler twine invented in the 1960s and we know this was not used in Cornwall until the 1970s. Carbon dating of another pit shows that it was dug after the 1950s. 'There is an unbroken line from the 1640s to today. I think the people doing it now must still be alive. 'What's amazing is that these people must believe it works otherwise they would not still be doing it. And it is still being kept a secret after all these years. 'My own theory is that maybe if you got married and did not get pregnant in the first year, you might make an offering to St Bride of a feather pit. If you finally got pregnant you had to go back to the pit and take out the contents and burn them and set the spirit of the swan free. If you never got pregnant then the pit remained untouched'. The 40-or-so pits have been found by Dr Wood and her students in areas where there were reeds. The first one was found by accident in 2003 during the excavation of a neolithic platform. Theory: The tiny hamlet of Saveock, pictured, is near Truro and locals claim two spinsters who died in the 1980s were witches who may have links to the holes and passed the secrets on. At first they believed the hole was a failed attempt to plant a tree but then more digging found several more all roughly measuring 42cm long by 35cm wide and 17cm deep. Dr Wood believes because the land used is often wet it has helped people dig the holes quickly and hide the reeds allowed them to hide the pits easily. 'Every pit is very different but also remarkably similar. It is always involving fur and feather and often birds eggs where the chicks were ready to be born. There is also a small pile of stones, taken from by the sea 15 miles away', she said. Some have contained bones and the heads of goats or pigs. One had a scrap of newspaper containing the word Mussolini, who rose to power in the 1920s and was executed in 1945. The people who dug the pits would also have known they were breaking the law. The killing of swans has been illegal since the 11th century and witchcraft laws were only scrapped in 1951. Dr Wood said: 'We finally got a radio carbon date for one of the pits which was around 1640’s. That was the time of the Civil War and a dangerous thing to be doing when Cromwell’s army came to Cornwall as any sort of pagan worship was classed as witchcraft and punishable by death'. For centuries paganism and witchcraft was part of everyday life in Cornwall and peaked in the 19th century. The majority of communities had their own white witch who was seen as a form of public servant. These witches, also known as pellars, would protect families, get rid of curses and also cure illnesses. Commonly they would also bury offerings on behalf of people, like the pits found in Saveock. The most famous of these was Tamsin Blight, right, who lived from 1798 to 1856 in West Cornwall, and was known to have extraordinary powers to heal sick humans and animals. It was said that she once went to a graveyard and raised the spirit of a recently deceased woman for a male relative who wanted to know about his inheritance. The folk tale known as the 'The Ghost of Stythians' says she used a charmed ring and chanted incantations for some time before people heard a great crashing noise, screams of pain and felt a gust of wind before the woman's spirit rose from the grave and was questioned. One of Cornwall's main tourist attractions is the Museum of Witchcraft in Boscastle, which contains tales of witchcraft and artefacts. Its website sets out various spells and rituals that were used in the county and explained in stories and poems. One called the 'the hand of a suicide' explains how some believed the sick could be cured if they put their hands on the body of a man who had killed themselves. Others believed that touching the body of a person who was recently hanged had the same effect. Another ritual commonly used would involve someone who was ill walking over burning wood from a fire to cure terminal illnesses. One tradition involved the burning of ivy leaves or rushes to find out the future. A couple who wanted to know if they would marry would throw rushes on the fire. If the rushes burned together they would have a happy marriage, but if they split then that would be their fate,. Others used two ivy leaves, burying then in ashes, and used the number of cracks that appeared in woman's leaf to predict how many children they would have. The one that burned the longest would live the longest. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"An archaeologist named Dr. Jacqui Wood found many strange holes, called witch pits, near a small village called Saveock.

Dr. Wood found that the pits are very old, some dating back to the 1640s, but some were made more recently, even in the 1970s. This means that the people who made them might still be alive.

He discovers that pot A has particles with a very high average kinetic energy, while pot B's particles have a low average kinetic energy. Step 3: Analyze the situation and draw a conclusion Since boiling refers to the point where the temperature is high enough for the liquid to turn into vapor, we can compare the average kinetic energy of particles in both pots to determine which one is closer to boiling. As per the information provided, pot A has a higher average kinetic energy, which means its particles have a higher temperature compared to pot B. Therefore, pot A is closer to boiling than pot B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

When their baby tripped over the baby walker, Cynthia laughed as Katrina helped the baby so grandmother gave","output":"Cynthia a disapproving look. It was difficult for Cynthia to hold back her laughter, but she understood that her mother-in-law, Marjorie, took these situations quite seriously. Katrina, being the doting and caring mother, knew exactly how to balance between ensuring safety and fostering an environment where their baby could learn and grow.  The baby, only being 10 months old, was now attempting to take more steps forward. Despite tripping a few times, he would always get back up with determination and curiosity in his eyes. It was a heartwarming sight for Cynthia and Katrina, who saw it as a symbol of their baby's resilience and eagerness to explore the world. Marjorie, the experienced grandmother, had raised four children herself and had seen it all. She was well aware of the potential dangers lurking in the household, and whenever a minor accident occurred, she felt it her duty to remain watchful and ensure the well-being of her grandchild. Sitting next to Marjorie, Cynthia couldn't help but exchange a knowing smile with Katrina. She admired her wife's patience, understanding, and unwavering support. They had been through many challenges as a couple, and becoming parents was a new and exciting chapter in their lives. As the baby stumbled and giggled, navigating the obstacles of the baby-proofed living room, the household's attention was drawn to him. Marjorie, although concerned, managed to find joy in the baby's antics and soon, they were all laughing together. The air of tension within the room dissipated and soon, there was nothing but happiness and warmth as they cheered on their little explorer. Cynthia and Katrina took this opportunity to ask Marjorie for her advice on raising children, knowing that her wisdom and guidance would be an invaluable resource in their journey as parents. Marjorie, with a smile of pride on her face, began sharing her experiences and the lessons she had learned throughout the years. As the conversation continued, they spoke about the importance of setting boundaries without stifling creativity, encouragement without putting too much pressure, and the significance of quality time with their baby. The discussion then touched on various parenting styles and finding a balance that suited the family's values and needs. The day had unexpectedly turned into a bonding experience for all three generations, with the baby continuing to amuse and charm them while they shared stories, laughter, and love. Cynthia, Katrina, and Marjorie knew that the journey ahead would bring its own set of challenges, but they felt confident and united as a family navigating this new phase in their lives. Throughout the evening, they continued their heartfelt conversations, trading anecdotes and ideas to help Cynthia and Katrina become the best parents they could be. And, in the background of that loving, supportive environment, the baby continued his shaky attempts at walking – taking slow, steady steps into the beautiful unknown, secure in the knowledge that his mothers and grandmother would guide and catch him, no matter where life's journey would lead."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Which of the following people did not praise Burke: Gladstone, Cobden or Milton? Context: The 19th-century Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone considered Burke \\"a magazine of wisdom on Ireland and America\\" and in his diary recorded: \\"Made many extracts from Burke—sometimes almost divine\\". The Radical MP and anti-Corn Law activist Richard Cobden often praised Burke's Thoughts and Details on Scarcity. The Liberal historian Lord Acton considered Burke one of the three greatest Liberals, along with William Gladstone and Thomas Babington Macaulay. Lord Macaulay recorded in his diary: \\"I have now finished reading again most of Burke's works. Admirable! The greatest man since Milton\\". The Gladstonian Liberal MP John Morley published two books on Burke (including a biography) and was influenced by Burke, including his views on prejudice. The Cobdenite Radical Francis Hirst thought Burke deserved \\"a place among English libertarians, even though of all lovers of liberty and of all reformers he was the most conservative, the least abstract, always anxious to preserve and renovate rather than to innovate. In politics he resembled the modern architect who would restore an old house instead of pulling it down to construct a new one on the site\\". Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France was controversial at the time of its publication, but after his death, it was to become his best known and most influential work, and a manifesto for Conservative thinking. The answer to this question is:","output":"Milton. Step-by-step justification: 1. The context mentions that Gladstone considered Burke \\"a magazine of wisdom on Ireland and America,\\" which indicates that Gladstone praised Burke. 2. The context also mentions that Cobden often praised Burke's Thoughts and Details on Scarcity, which implies that Cobden praised Burke. 3. Milton is not mentioned in the context as praising Burke. However, Lord Macaulay is quoted as saying, \\"The greatest man since Milton,\\" indicating that Milton is not included in the list of people who praised Burke. 4. So, the person who did not praise Burke from the given options (Gladstone, Cobden, or Milton) is Milton."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Evil Dead II Movie plot: The film begins with a simplified recap of the events of the first film. Ash Williams and his girlfriend Linda take a romantic vacation to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods. While in the cabin, Ash plays a tape of an archaeology Professor Knowby, the cabin's previous inhabitant, reciting passages from the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (or Book of the Dead), which he has discovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force that kills and later possesses Linda. Ash is then forced to decapitate his girlfriend with a shovel in self-defense, and buries her near the cabin. The film then picks up where the first film left off, where a spirit is seen hunting for Ash. Ash becomes briefly possessed by the demon, but when day breaks the spirit is gone, and Ash returns to normal. Ash finds little chance of safety, however, as the bridge leading to the cabin is destroyed. Linda's revived head attacks Ash by biting his hand. Ash brings Linda's severed head to the shed, where her headless body attacks him with a chainsaw. Ash gains the upper hand and slashes the relentless zombified Linda to death, killing her a second and final time. Later, Ash is forced to sever his bitten right hand, which has become possessed. While Ash deals with this force, the professor's daughter, Annie, and her research partner, Ed Getley, return from the dig with more pages of the Necronomicon in tow, only to find the destroyed bridge. They enlist the help of Jake and Bobby Joe to guide them along an alternate trail to the cabin. The four of them find an embattled Ash, who is, seemingly, slowly being driven insane due to his encounter with the demon, such as hallucinating that the room comes to life and begins laughing hysterically at him. At first, he is mistaken for a murderer by the four people because he shoots at them through the door (mistaking them as the Evil Force), but they find out the truth after listening to a recording of Annie's father, Professor Knowby, that talked about how his wife Henrietta...

Why do they not have a laminator ?","output":"Based on the provided article, it is not explicitly stated why the individual does not have a laminator. However, we can infer several possible reasons that may explain the absence of a laminator in their possession: 1. Cost: One primary reason could be the cost of purchasing a laminator. Laminators, especially high-quality ones, can be expensive, and the individual might not have the budget to invest in one. As they mentioned charging 5 for their work, they might be starting their business on a limited budget, making the purchase of a laminator unaffordable at the moment. 2. Prioritization: Even if the individual has a budget for their business, they might have chosen to prioritize other equipment or resources. They mentioned that they are \\"mainly going to do badges,\\" which could suggest that they have invested in other tools or materials required for creating badges. The decision not to buy a laminator could have been a strategic choice based on their business priorities and available resources. 3. Limited Use: A laminator might not be deemed necessary for the individual's work at this time. If the focus is primarily on making badges, lamination may not be seen as a crucial step in the process. This could also mean that the individual has weighed the benefits of laminating their work against the cost of purchasing a laminator and determined that it is not worth it at this stage. 4. Lack of Knowledge: It is also possible that the individual is unaware of the potential benefits of lamination or is unsure how to go about purchasing and using a laminator. In this case, they may have decided not to make any investment in a laminator simply because they do not recognize its value. 5. Future considerations: The individual might be considering purchasing a laminator in the future as their business grows or when they have enough funds. They might want to see how their work is received and whether there is a demand for laminated badges before committing to the investment. In summary, although it is not explicitly mentioned why this individual does not have a laminator, potential reasons could include cost, prioritization of resources, limited use for their business, lack of knowledge about laminators, or plans to consider purchasing one in the future when their business expands or when they have more funds available."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Kendall was a dog trainer and taught Alex's dog to sit.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you’re talking to someone and they seem judgmental or like they’re prying into your personal life, just say that you’re doing fine. You don’t have to share anything you don’t want to. People who are nosy don’t necessarily need to know what’s going on in your life. It’s perfectly fine to pretend that you’re doing great. For example, if you go to family gatherings and get pestered by older family members, say things are great, even if they’re not. Even if you’re sad about things, pretend like life is going okay and don’t say much beyond that. If someone is talking about something  you’re uncomfortable with, change the topic of conversation. Excuse yourself for a moment and come back in a bit. Shift the subject of the conversation away to something else without feeling too abrupt.  If someone asks how you’re doing and you’re not prepared to say how you really feel, shift the subject by saying, “I’m really happy to see that the sun is out today.” If someone asks, “How are you and your spouse?” and you’d rather not talk about your marital difficulties, change the subject. Say, “We’re doing fine. Did I tell you about my son’s recent karate match?” Avoid saying too much or getting into detailed stories. The point is to say as little as possible and perhaps even duck out of the conversation. This will help to shut down the conversation or move on to another topic to talk about. For example, if someone asks about your love life and you’d rather not get into it, say, “Great, thanks for asking.” If you can’t keep up your pretenses, end the conversation.

Spain, Germany, France, even Italy, have taken over as the destinations of choice for the world class footballer. Jose Mourinho was proved right after the World Cup with some brilliant business.","output":"Title: The Fading Supremacy of the English Premier League: A New Reality Awakens Introduction The English Premier League has long been acclaimed as the best football league in the world. The unpredictability, passion, and frenzied matches have seen the league dominate both on and off the field. Nonetheless, recent developments tell a different tale as the lure of other European leagues and the inconsistencies of native talents question the league's supremacy and global status. Steven Gerrard, Liverpool Legend Shatters the Myth A recent glaring example of this can be found in the words of Steven Gerrard, the legendary Liverpool captain, who single-handedly exposed the delusional notion of the Premier League's global supremacy. In a conversation with former teammate Luis Suarez, Gerrard exclaimed that the Uruguayan striker was 'too good' to join Arsenal, an English Premier League team. Gerrard's sentiments reflect a broader issue within the league, whose competition and standards have been increasingly questioned. The Musical Chairs of Native English Footballers When it comes to nurturing homegrown talents, many have criticized the Premier League for not elevating their potential. Indeed, the league has witnessed an all too familiar shuffle of local footballers among their own teams. The likes of Jack Wilshere, Adam Lallana, Danny Welbeck, and Jordan Henderson, although touted as future stars, have somewhat underperformed at both club and national levels. Their mediocre performance in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil is a testament to this argument.  Once considered indispensable figures in their respective clubs, these English youngsters have failed to match the meteoric rise of their European counterparts. The decline in their performance highlights a crucial problem with the Premier League, given the hefty investments made in the development and progression of these promising talents. Europe Rises: The Direct Flight to Spain, Germany, France, and Italy In sharp contrast to the Premier League's slump, football powerhouses such as Spain, Germany, France, and Italy have emerged as the ultimate destinations for world-class players. Boasting competitive and tactical leagues, these countries have successfully retained and further augmented their squad of exceptional players. Europe's best talents now flock to these leagues to ply their trade, leaving the once-coveted Premier League behind in the race for global football supremacy. Jose Mourinho and the Battle of European Perception The shrewd eye of José Mourinho, the former Chelsea manager, captured the Premier League's imminent decline in his post-World Cup statements. Mourinho cleverly recognized that the league needed to refocus their priorities on developing fresh talent and purchased brilliant European assets like Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa. The celebrated manager correctly identified that the Premier League had to alter their approach and invest in players who could challenge for the top spots on the global stage. Conclusion The fading supremacy of the English Premier League presents significant questions about its shifting status in the world of football. With other European leagues strengthening their position as preferred destinations for top-tier players and native English footballers underachieving, the Premier League's illusion of grandeur has come under significant scrutiny. The league must learn from its continental counterparts, like Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, to rekindle its erstwhile dominance and reshape its perception as the world's greatest football competition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Pang lived alone, apart from the six maid who cooked and cleaned for him, and the chauffeur  who drove his Rolls-Royce.  Suddenly, the room seemed to begin spinning around him. Then there was a flash of light and a puff of smoke, and before him Pang saw an old man dressed in traditional Chinese clothes. Pang looked at his brandy glass, and looked again at the old man. He was so frightened he couldn't speak. \\"Come with me,\\" said the old man, \\"I'm going to show you something.\\" He took Pang's hand, and immediately the room disappeared, and Pang was standing in a field outside a village in Guangdong Province.

Here is a goal: How can you survive an encounter with a Wild Mountain Lion? Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To survive an encounter with a wild mountain lion, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Stay calm and assess Justify: When encountering a mountain lion, it is crucial to remain calm and assess the situation. Panicking may lead the mountain lion to view you as prey. Step 2: Make yourself appear larger Justify: Mountain lions are less likely to attack if they perceive you as a potential threat rather than easy prey. Making yourself appear larger by raising your arms or standing on your tiptoes can help deter the animal. Step 3: Maintain eye contact Justify: Keeping eye contact with the mountain lion asserts dominance and shows the animal that you are aware of its presence, potentially preventing it from taking a more offensive approach. Step 4: Make loud noises Justify: Making noise can help intimidate the mountain lion, as it may startle them or make them think twice about approaching you. Shouting, clapping, or yelling can be effective. Step 5: Slowly back away Justify: Slowly backing away without turning your back to the mountain lion allows you to maintain eye contact and continue to assert your dominance while creating more distance between you and the animal. Step 6: Do not run Justify: Running may trigger the mountain lion's predatory instincts and provoke an attack. It is best to back away slowly and steadily, as mentioned in step 5. Step 7: If attacked, fight back Justify: If the mountain lion does initiate an attack, it is crucial to fight back with whatever tools or weapons you have available. Striking the animal's face, eyes, and nose can help increase your chances of surviving the encounter. These steps provide a strategy for survivng an encounter with a wild mountain lion, using a combination of psychological and physical deterrence tactics."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Possible answers: + Put the salmon fillets in a large plastic bag, add the sauce you want, seal the bag, turn it over to coat both sides, then place in fridge for at least 2 hours. + Put the salmon fillets in a large plastic bag, add the sauce you want, cut the bag, turn it over to coat both sides, then place in fridge for at least 2 hours.","output":"To marinate the fillets for easy baked salmon, you should follow these step-by-step instructions and justify each step: 1. Choose the marinade: Select a sauce or marinade that you would like to flavor your salmon with, such as a combination of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and herbs. This will ensure the salmon is flavorful and moist when it's baked. 2. Prepare the plastic bag: Get a large Ziploc or resealable plastic bag, which will be used to hold the salmon fillets and marinade. Using a plastic bag makes it easier to ensure an even coating of the marinade on the fillets and allows for easy clean-up afterwards. 3. Place the salmon fillets in the bag: Put the salmon fillets into the plastic bag. Ensure that they are properly arranged and not overlapping, so they marinate evenly and efficiently. 4. Add the marinade: Pour the sauce or marinade you have chosen into the plastic bag with the salmon fillets. Now, for the best option between the provided answers, we have: Option 1: Seal the bag, turn it over to coat both sides, then place in fridge for at least 2 hours. Option 2: Cut the bag, turn it over to coat both sides, then place in fridge for at least 2 hours. To proceed, you'd want to choose option 1, as cutting the bag in option 2 could create a mess from leaking marinade: 5. Seal the bag: Close the plastic bag, taking care to remove any excess air. Doing this prevents the marinade from leaking out and enhances the contact between the fillets and the marinade. 6. Coat both sides of the fillets: Gently turn the plastic bag over several times to ensure the marinade coats both sides of the salmon fillets evenly. 7. Marinate the salmon: Place the bag with the salmon fillets in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. Marinating the salmon for this amount of time will allow the flavors from the marinade to penetrate the fish, resulting in a more flavorful dish. 8. Bake the salmon: After marinating, remove the salmon from the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature for about 10-15 minutes. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C), place the salmon on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and bake for 12-15 minutes or until the salmon flakes easily with a fork. By following these steps, you will have successfully marinated and baked flavorful salmon fillets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Frank Wiecek (Richard Conte) and another man are quickly arrested, and are later sentenced to serve 99 years' imprisonment each for the killing. Eleven years later, Wiecek's mother (Kasia Orzazewski) puts an ad in the newspaper offering a 5,000 reward for information about the true killers of the police officer.

This is quickly followed by political pressure from the state capital, where politicians are anxious to end a story that might prove embarrassing to the administration.

Question: I can use this background: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.  Now, I have a new situation: John was trying to reenact Le Chatelier's principle. To that end, he conducted four tests, test A, test B, test C, and test D. In test A, he didn't input any stress to a chemical system in equilibrium. But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction.  Answer this question please: Which test saw higher concentrations of the products, test C or test D? Answer:","output":"Test C saw higher concentrations of the products. In test C, the forward reaction was favored, which means the concentrations of the products increased and the concentrations of the reactants decreased. In test D, the reverse reaction was favored, causing the concentrations of the products to decrease and the concentrations of the reactants to increase."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Some species of wood-decay fungi attack dead wood, such as brown rot, and some, such as Armillaria (honey fungus), are parasitic and colonize living trees. Excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood is required for fungal colonization and proliferation.[1] Fungi that not only grow on wood but permeate its fibrous structure and actually cause decay, are called lignicolous fungi. In nature, this process causes the breakdown of complex molecules and leads to the return of nutrients to the soil.[2] Various lignicolous fungi consume wood in various ways; for example, some attack the carbohydrates in wood and some others decay lignin. The rate of decay of wooden materials in various climates can be estimated by empirical models.[3]  and the situation: The mycologist wanted to move to a rural area, to further his research, and found these two villages situated 10 miles from each other.

The","output":"reason was multifaceted, stemming from a combination of procrastination, lack of concentration, and inadequate planning on his part. Moreover, the subject matter of his homework appeared to be more challenging than he initially anticipated, leading to increased frustration and anxiety.  To begin with, James had a tendency to procrastinate when faced with tasks that he deemed tedious or difficult. This bad habit often led him to postpone important assignments until the very last minute, resulting in subpar quality and limited time for completion. In this specific instance, James wasted precious minutes scrolling through social media and engaging in other distractions, significantly reducing the time available for him to concentrate on his homework. Additionally, James struggled with maintaining his focus and concentration on the task at hand. His mind frequently wandered to unrelated thoughts, making it challenging for him to fully grasp and apply the concepts he was learning. Moreover, his immediate environment did not facilitate productivity, as it was filled with distractions such as his phone, video games, and even loud noises from outside his window. These factors greatly impeded his ability to work efficiently and make the most of the limited time that his mom was away. Another contributing factor to James's predicament was his inadequate planning and organization skills. Instead of breaking down the assignment into smaller, more manageable tasks and setting clear goals, he approached it haphazardly, attempting to tackle multiple questions simultaneously without a clear plan. Consequently, this approach resulted in considerable confusion and disorganization, which further added to his sense of being overwhelmed and slowed down his progress. Lastly, the subject matter of James's homework itself presented a significant challenge. He was confronted with concepts that were either completely new or that he had not grasped fully in class, resulting in confusion and frustration. As an added stressor, he could not seek immediate assistance from his mom since she was outside, which intensified his feelings of anxiety and helplessness. In conclusion, James's inability to complete his homework within the time frame that his mom was outside resulted from a combination of his procrastination, lack of concentration, poor planning and organization skills, and difficulty understanding the subject matter. In order to overcome these challenges, James must work on improving his time management skills, developing strategies to maintain focus, and seeking assistance when confronted with difficult concepts. By addressing these areas of personal growth, James will be better equipped to successfully complete his homework within the allotted time, avoiding last-minute stress and frustration."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Misnomers often arise because the thing received its name long before its true nature was known, or because the nature of an earlier form is no longer the norm. A misnomer may also be simply a word that is used incorrectly or misleadingly. \\"Misnomer\\" does not mean \\"misunderstanding\\" or \\"popular misconception\\", and many misnomers remain in legitimate use (that is, being a misnomer does not always make a name incorrect).  - Hotch Potchi is a Japanese boy band group . The band was formed in 2005 . Many of the original members quit , including lead singer Yousuke . They were replaced by new members .  - The Osmonds are an American family music group with a long and varied career  a career that took them from singing barbershop music as children to achieving success as teen-music idols, from producing a hit television show to continued success as solo and group performers. The Osmonds are devout members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and their religious values have influenced their careers.  - The Monkees are an American-British pop rock band originally active between 1965 and 1971, with subsequent reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed. They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the American television series \\"The Monkees\\", which aired from 1966 to 1968. The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork and British actor and singer Davy Jones. The band's music was initially supervised by producer Don Kirshner.  - A boy band (or boyband) is loosely defined as a vocal group consisting of young male singers, usually in their teenage years or in their twenties at the time of formation. The first boy bands consisted of the Beatles, Jackson 5, the Monkees, and the Osmonds singing love songs marketed towards young females. Being vocal groups, most boy band members do not play musical instruments, either in recording sessions or on stage, making the term something of a misnomer. However, exceptions do exist.

However, an unexpected twist casts doubt on whether she is truly turning 15 or if she's still just 14. This uncertainty sets her on a thrilling journey filled with adventure and self-discovery as she tries to uncover the truth. Plot: Nadia's life has always been a bit of a mystery. Her mother passed away when she was very young, and her father never spoke much about her past. As her birthday approaches, Nadia eagerly dusts off her mother's old journal to learn more about her family history. She finds an old letter, in which her mother suggests that Nadia might not be the age she believes herself to be. Confused and determined to uncover the truth, Nadia sets out on a quest with her faithful best friends, Maya and Finn, to search for answers. As they dig deeper into her past, they come across her mother's long-lost sister, Aunt Regina, living in a remote cabin in the woods. Regina is eccentric and initially dismissive, but she eventually reveals a shocking family secret: Nadia was switched at birth with another child at the hospital, causing confusion about her true date of birth. Faced with this revelation, Nadia decides that she needs to find the other girl who was switched to better understand her own identity. Together, the friends embark on a cross-country adventure, using clues from the letter and her mother's journal to track down her true birth parents. As the trio journeys further from home, they encounter numerous obstacles and make unexpected allies, and Nadia begins to learn more about her own strengths and talents.

Experts estimate  that about 200 million workers face a potential danger of occupational diseases and work-related injuries. The majority of them are farmers-turned-workers who are working in small or medium-sized firms. One of the most serious workplace diseases on the Chinese mainland is pneumoconiosis, a lung disease that is caused by breathing in too much dust of coal, silicon, and cerement. It causes serious breathing difficulties and can be fatal . The disease killed 966 people in the country last year, according to an official report released by the Ministry of Health yesterday. From the early 1950s until the end of last year, 607,570 people were diagnosed with pneumoconiosis. Among the number, 137,481 people died from the disease.

I played it a zillion times during Spring 1993 with my friend Andrew. I used to play Axel or Blaze and he would be Adam and no matter how often we played it we never seemed to get bored. Then Streets of Rage 2 came out. And we quickly forgot that this one even existed. You play as ex-cops Axel Stone, Adam or Blaze Fielding, who have quit the force in order to take on the bad guys in their own way. There are 8 levels to work thru in a run-down and corrupt city led by the evil Mr X. Beating up all the bad guys and the end-of-level boss is much fun. Level 4 (The Bridge) was my fave because you could chuck baddies down the holes into the river. You even have the chance to become Mr. X's right hand man at the end of the game (at a price). This leads to the 'bad ending' in which you become the the boss of the syndicate. Exactly how this is possible is a mystery since you destroy the syndicate on your way to Mr. X, but never mind. Streets of Rage also has truly fantastic music. The composer Yuzo Koshiro did absolute miracles with the limited technology of the Sega Genesis. The main theme, Level One, Level 4 and Final Boss are standout tunes.  As a Wii owner I am proud to have this forever on my console. But with Streets of Rage 2 also available, it does kind of render the first one somewhat obsolete. Pros: Average graphics but nice backgrounds represented in a comic-book like panel progression that fits the tone of the game. Great tunes. Easy to get into and hard to put down. Cons: Vastly inferior to the infinitely more complex Streets of Rage 2. Poor enemy AI. Baddies often walk away from you instead of engaging in combat.

I read this background article the other day: One reason radiation is dangerous is that it can’t be detected with the senses. You normally can’t see it, smell it, hear it, or feel it. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one in Figure below , has a tube that contains atoms of a gas. If radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms to ions that carry electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation. You can see a video about the Geiger counter and how it was invented at the URL below.  I am facing a new situation today: Robert and Thomas are visiting an abandoned amusement park in Russia that is rumored to emit radiation due to the materials used in the rides.  Robert visits the Ferris wheel and his Geiger counter clicks slowly. Thomas visits the merry go round and his Geiger counter begins to click rapidly.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person's Geiger count has less current running through it? Answer:","output":"To answer this question correctly, we should evaluate the information given in both the background article and the situation involving Robert and Thomas. Let's break it down step-by-step: 1. From the background article, we learn that a Geiger counter detects radiation through a tube which contains gas atoms. When radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms into ions that carry electric current. The current then causes the Geiger counter to click. 2. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation (and hence, the higher the electric current). 3. In the new situation, Robert's Geiger counter clicks slowly at the Ferris wheel, while Thomas' Geiger counter clicks rapidly at the merry-go-round. 4. Based on the information from the background article, we can infer that the higher the click rate, the higher the electric current running through the Geiger counter. 5. Since Thomas' Geiger counter clicks more rapidly, it indicates a higher level of radiation and thus a higher electric current. Therefore, the correct answer is that Robert's Geiger count has less current running through it compared to Thomas' Geiger count."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First write out the pH equation. Next, identify the values you have by writing them directly below your equation. For example, if you know the pH is a value of 10.1, write it on the paper below the pH equation. Rearranging the equation will require a strong understanding of algebra. To calculate concentration from pH, you must understand that the inverse of log10 is \\"10 to the power of ...\\" Start by shifting the minus sign over from the log side to the pH side. Then raise 10 to the power of (each side). \\"10 to the power of\\" and log10 are inverses of each other and cancels out. For example, pH = -log10[H3O+] will mold into [H3O+] = 10-pH.  pH can then be filled in as 10.1 When working with inverse log, the calculator process is unique. Remember that log is a type of multiplication by 10. To enter your equation, key in 10. Next, hit the “EXP” exponent button. Key in the negative sign followed by the value. Hit solve. For example, take a pH value of 10.1. Key in “10” followed by “EXP.” Now key in “-/+” to have our value be negative. Finally, key in the pH of “10.1”. Hit solve. You should get about 7.943ᴇ-11, or 7.943*10-11. This means our concentration is 7.943*10-11 M. A neutral pH of 7 equates to a hydronium ion concentration of 10-7 M. A solution with a pH of 10.1 is basic, so it will have less hydronium ions than that. If we look at our answer, 7.943*10-11, we do indeed see that this number is way smaller than 10-7, so our answer does make sense.","output":"To calculate concentration from pH, rearrange the pH equation using algebra, apply the inverse log function and input the known pH value into a calculator; a pH of 10.1 corresponds to a hydronium ion concentration of approximately 7.943*10^-11 M, indicating a basic solution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The New York Times But for families across the country that have cut back spending, a 17.3 percent jump in gasoline prices in June further pinched pocketbooks. A retail sales report on Tuesday said that clothing and food spending stayed mostly flat last month. Minutes from the June 23-24 meeting of Federal Reserve officials, released Wednesday, also showed that policy makers were concerned about the short-lived impact of the 787 billion federal stimulus package and feared that consumer spending would continue to decline. Families are also saving more of their income in uncertain times and thwarting efforts at consumer stimulus. The officials projected that unemployment would reach 10 percent by the end of 2010 and would remain high for several years. The gross domestic product for 2009 is also expected to shrink by up to 1.5 percent. At the least, the price data soothed worries that the economy might be slipping into a deflationary trap — when unemployment, wages, aggregate demand and shelf prices spiral downward — such as what happened to Japan during its “lost decade” after an asset bubble collapse in the early 1990s. Mr. Levy, the Bank of America economist, said that prices had held up surprisingly well despite the severity and length of the recession. “I expect core C.P.I. to drift lower but not outright decline,” he said. Compared with a year ago, the Consumer Price Index has fallen 1.4 percent, the steepest decline since 1950, as the prolonged downturn takes its toll on demand in the economy. A report on Tuesday said that the Producer Price Index, a measure of prices at the wholesale level, surged 1.8 percent in June, as manufacturers also feel squeezed by higher energy costs. Since hitting a high this year of 72.68 a barrel on June 11, crude oil prices have held steady around 60 a barrel so far this month. Economists expect gas prices to ease. The Labor Department said that energy prices in general rose 7.6 percent in June. The average cost of gasoline in June was 2.63 a gallon, according to the Energy Information Administration.

But that circuit's insulation was damaged.  and a hint : For example, if a circuit has a potential difference of 100 volts and it is intended for the circuit to contain a 100 ohm resistance, then the wires carrying the current for this circuit will be designed for 1.0 amp. If that 100 ohm resistance is suddenly cut out of the circuit and only 0.10 ohm resistance remains, then the voltage will push 1000 amps of current through the circuit. This current overheats the wires and may damage the circuits or start a fire in the walls or the appliance. There are many possible causes of a short circuit, one possible cause could be something overheating, melting wires, and thereby fusing the circuit closed, bypassing the resistance. Another cause might be something damaging the insulation of a wire, allowing the incoming and grounds wires to touch. In any case, once the resistance is lost, the voltage pushes a huge amount of charge through the wires causing them to overheat.  Please answer this question : Which circuit would have higher temperature, circuit A or circuit B? Answer:","output":"Circuit B would have a higher temperature. This is because when the resistance is lowered in circuit B, a larger amount of current will flow through the circuit. This increased current can cause the wires to overheat, leading to a higher temperature in circuit B compared to circuit A, which has adequate resistance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As an example of the origin of this mechanism, the internal microscopic dipoles contributing to the dielectric constant cannot move instantly, and so as frequency of an applied alternating voltage increases, the dipole response is limited and the dielectric constant diminishes.

Still untaken are several steps that required goodwill from local bar associations and others who had opposed the combination. \\"[I am] not a fan of Neal's,\\" admitted John Peck, a former board member of the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley program and a Pasadena Bar Association board member.

An observer familiar with the reconfiguration debate who requested anonymity wondered why Dudovitz had not spent more time mending fences. \\"He ought to be bending over backwards for reconciliation, but if you want to do impact work and people in the San Gabriel Valley want direct services, you have to accommodate that or change your approach,\\" the observer said. \\"Neal would never consider doing that.\\" More than a year after he officially incorporated the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley, Dudovitz had not placed a local resident on the board of Neighborhood Legal Services or made the rounds of the private legal community to recruit the volunteer lawyers. \\"Our emphasis has been on having our potential clients know about us and deliver services to them,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"We have done that spectacularly.\\" He did not hire any of the old program's nine lawyers and has yet to permanently place any of his 18 new hires in the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley. The lack of a legal aid presence in Pomona prompted the bar association and court officials to start their own once-monthly family law clinic. After learning of the effort, Dudovitz sent personnel to staff the clinic for three hours per week and is helping to write a grant application to fund a self-help kiosk for Pomona patterned on the center he pioneered in Van Nuys.

This method is slower than touch typing, where all fingers are utilized, and typists have a general knowledge of the keyboard layout. Step 3: Explain the metaphorical connection The term 'Hunt-and-Peck' is a metaphor for this typing method because it resembles the actions of a bird pecking at food. Just as a bird hunts for food and pecks at it using its beak, a 'Hunt-and-Peck' typist searches for each key on the keyboard and presses it with a single finger.

An abandoned subway terminal in New York City is being pitched for redevelopment into a sunlit, subterranean park -- replete with 60,000 square feet of flowers, ponds and trees. Located in Manhattan's trendy Lower East Side, the vast underground space -- which is about the size of a football field -- has remained untouched since the terminal was discontinued back in 1948. Now, a group of entrepreneurs are proposing an elaborate green makeover, in which sunlight would be \\"harvested\\" above ground and channeled into the vaults below via a network of fiber-optic cables -- creating an environment apparently filled with natural light and, in theory, ripe for growing all the foliage of a typical city park. \\"Effectively, we'd gather an image of the sky and sun at street level and distribute it underground,\\" said James Ramsey, former NASA satellite engineer-turned-architect and the brains behind the idea. Ramsey began developing the Delancey Underground project (named after the old New York street under which the park is planned) after persuading the local transport authorities to give him, and co-founder Dan Barasch, a guided tour of its derelict carriage terminal. \\"Sixty years of accumulated filth aside, I was struck by the beautiful historic qualities of the space -- with its cobblestone floors, original footway tiles and high-vaulted arched ceiling,\\" recalled Ramsey. \\"These are all features we'd love to see carried through, but with the futuristic addition of a fully functioning community park.\\" Read related: Could 'Earthscraper' really turn architecture on its head? Ramsey and Barasch's romantic vision includes a polished, undulating ceiling plane from which the \\"remote skylights\\" -- developed by Ramsay to filter out harmful ultraviolet and infrared light frequencies -- will flood the park with sunrays all year-round, night and day. According to Ramsey, the technology is \\"like a cross between a  telescope and an endoscope\\" -- capturing light from the sun and then transporting it through fiber-optic cables onto a relatively small focal point. \\"Of course the lighting will be supplemented with an electric supply at night and during cloudy periods ... and we'll also need additional energy for a ventilation system,\\" said Ramsey. \\"But for both cost and environmental purposes, any additional energy use will be as green and efficient as possible,\\" he added. Comment:  Would you give them your support? Is the \\"Delancey Underground\\" project a feasible and much needed innovation or a pretty but impractical pipe dream? Tell us you thoughts in the comments section below. Despite the possibility of this additional energy consumption, Barasch -- who also works for an NGO promoting socially innovative applications of technology -- is resolute about the park's eco-credentials. \\"This will be a distinctive testament to the varied applications and incredible promise of solar power,\\" he said. \\"It would also bring a slice of nature into one of New York's least green areas, and encourage people to think about their relationship with the environment.\\" The plans have drawn comparisons with the popular High Line -- another park built along an old railway way line -- in this case high above the city streets in New York's Lower West Side. \\"Rather than demolish what was there and replace it with shiny new office blocks or expensive apartments, the existing structure has been re-imagined to become a sustainable space for everyone to enjoy ... and we have very similar aims in that respect,\\" said Ramsey. The terminal is currently under the control of the transport authority, and they have agreed to listen to the duo's pitch -- but made it clear they will not submit any funding for the construction of the park. \\"In the end, we will have to compete with other proposals, which will no doubt offer compelling commercial arguments for things like a car-parking lot or shopping mall,\\" said Ramsey, who plans to finance the entire initiative through private funding and donations. The duo say it's too early to put a price on how much the park will cost to build and run, but they are currently in the process of raising 400,000 for a full-scale demonstration of the \\"skylight\\" technology and a thorough feasibility study regarding the structural and ventilation conditions of the terminal. Barasch says that after a recent spate of community meetings, they also have the enthusiastic support of the locals. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

Please answer the following question: This article: In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, \\"Ars Gallica\\", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members. As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first \\"poème symphonique\\" was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune (\\"The Yellow Princess\\"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils. The marriage was not a success.

His empire includes a range of financial, political, and criminal operations. The nearby city of Springfort, however, is a thorn in his side, home to a rival gang: The Crimson Syndicate. After a series of skirmishes with The Crimson Syndicate, Pa Danby decides that he has had enough - it is time to launch an all-out assault to take over Springfort. But, to ensure victory, he believes that he needs the help of his most trusted army - his extended family. The movie introduces the audience to Pa Danby's eclectic family, consisting of aunts, uncles, cousins, in-laws, and distant relatives, each possessing unique skills and eccentric personalities. Among them are Amelia, an expert safecracker; Cousin Eddie, an illegal arms dealer; Aunt Gertrude, a surprisingly skilled computer hacker; and twins Orlando and Owen, daredevil getaway drivers. Act 2: Planning the Assault The Danby family gathers at Pa Danby's countryside mansion to discuss the plan and prepare for the biggest heist of their lives. Several mini-skirmishes break out as personalities clash, but beneath it all, there is a reluctant respect and loyalty for the family patriarch. Pa Danby's sons, Carter and Stanley, are a constant driving force, pushing everyone to their limits. As the family plans the elaborate assault on Springfort, they realize they must gain control of the city's key infrastructure (local media, law enforcement, and political offices) to effectively dismantle The Crimson Syndicate. Doing so will force the rival gang's leader, Victor Morozov, and his right-hand man, Koslov, into a final confrontation. Act 3: Executing the Plan Pa Danby's army springs into action, with each family member taking on a critical role in the highly synchronized assault. One by one, they manage to take control of key locations and shut down The Crimson Syndicate's operations throughout the city. The Crimson Syndicate is completely caught off-guard by this random assortment of relatives. However, as the Danby family gets closer to completing their takeover, they find that Morozov has devious countermeasures in place. This forces the Danby family to think quickly and adapt their plans as they go. Morozov kidnaps Carter's wife, Sarah, to bargain his escape. Carter, realizing his love for his family is stronger than his loyalty to his father, organizes a rescue operation, culminating in a final showdown between the Danby's and Morozov's forces. Act 4: Redemption and Resolution During the final standoff, Pa Danby is grievously injured, leading the Danby family to work together more efficiently than ever before to defeat The Crimson Syndicate. Carter and Morozov fight, with Carter ultimately emerging victorious. However, instead of killing Morozov, he hands him over to the authorities, proving that the Danbys, despite their line of work and criminal activities, are united by an innate sense of loyalty and justice. Pa Danby, recovering in the hospital, reflects on his life and realizes the importance of family unity. He relinquishes control of the criminal empire to Carter and Stanley, who vow to run it with a newfound sense of responsibility and honor. \\"Danby's Unseen Army\\" is a thrilling action-comedy that combines intense action sequences, hilarious character dynamics, and a heartwarming story of family loyalty, trust, and redemption."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Input: Context: Physical activity is beneficial for cancer survivors, but exercise participation is low in this population. It is therefore important to understand the psychological factors underlying exercise uptake so that more effective interventions can be developed. Social-cognitive theory constructs such as outcome expectancies predict exercise behavior, but self-report measures have several limitations. We examined the associations between implicit (automatic) cognitions and exercise behavior and self-efficacy in endometrial cancer survivors.', 'This was a longitudinal study to examine predictors of exercise behavior in female endometrial cancer survivors who all received an exercise intervention. Participants (N = 100, mean age of 57.0) completed questionnaires to assess self-report exercise-related measures (outcome expectancy and attitudes about and identification with exercise) and reaction time (RT) tasks to assess implicit exercise cognitions (expectancy accessibility, implicit attitudes about exercise, and implicit self-identification with exercise) at baseline and at 2, 4, and 6 months at follow-up. Exercise behavior was measured using accelerometers and self-report. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models.', 'Expectancy accessibility was associated with exercise duration independent of the corresponding self-report measure. Exercise implicit attitudes and self-identification were prospectively associated with exercise self-efficacy only after adjustment for the corresponding self-report measures and baseline self-efficacy. Self-report measures were also associated with study outcomes. Answer: Both self-reported cognitions and implicit cognitions may be useful to identify individuals at risk of failing to exercise. Individuals so identified might be provided with a different or more intensive intervention. The data also suggest cognitive targets for intervention.

The evening had been set up to showcase the new limited edition Christmas make-up collection and also promote the huge sale that the store had on. There were some amazing deals! We were welcomed with prosecco and nibbles and then had a few minutes to browse the store and take some photos. I received a great demonstration of the new make-up products which includes a funky black eyeliner pen with a star stamp on one end which EVERYONE tried out! I always really love The Body Shop® Christmas make-up collections, and I think it’s a shame that it’s a brand that is sometimes forgotten when it comes to make-up. Then everyone was treated to a hand spa and massage using some of the Spa Of The World products. They’re truly luxurious, I recently reviewed the new Firming Ritual collection recently and absolutely loved it. I then had a look round some of the offers that the store was promoting, a lot of the Shower Gels and Body Butters were on sale (I just LOVE The Body Shop® Body Butters) and there were lots of gift sets too. It was a great opportunity to chat with the staff too, to ask questions about new products and find out what their favourites are. I also spent a lot of time looking at the 2017 beauty advent calendars. This year The Body Shop® are offering 3 different advent calendars starting from just £45.

French and British Ties and Occupation: The daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella married the son and heir of the Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian of Hapsburg. The Spanish crown duly passed to the Hapsburgs, and Spain remained in their hands until the feeble-minded Carlos II died in 1700, leaving no heir. France seized the chance to install the young grandson of Louis XIV on the Spanish throne. A rival Hapsburg claimant was supported by Austria and Britain, who saw a powerful Spanish-French alliance as a major threat. In the subsequent War of the Spanish Succession (1702 –1713) most of the old kingdom of Aragón, including the Balearics, backed the Hapsburgs. Britain seized Gibraltar — in the name of the Hapsburg claimant — and retained it when the war was over. In 1708 Britain captured Menorca, and the magnificent harbor of Mahón (Maó), for the Royal Navy. England clung to it even when Bourbon forces captured Mallorca at the end of the war. Menorca changed hands between Britain, France, and Spain five more times in less than a century. Britain finally ceded the island to Spain in the year 1802, under the terms of the Treaty of Amiens. By 1805, Spain was once more aligned with France, and Spanish ships fought alongside the French against Nelson at Trafalgar. Napoleon came to distrust his Spanish ally and forcibly replaced the king of Spain with his own brother, Joseph Bonaparte. A French army marched in to subdue the country. The Spanish resisted and, aided by British troops commanded by the Duke of Wellington, drove the French out. What British historians call the Peninsular War (1808–1814) is known in Spain as the War of Independence. In the 19th century, practically all of Spain’s possessions in the Americas broke away in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars, and the few that remained were lost at the end of the 19th century. The Balearics, further neglected, were beset with poverty and outbreaks of disease. However, toward the 20th century, things began to improve on the islands, with Mallorca reaping the rewards of successful agricultural crops and Menorca launching an export shoe industry.

He worked at ground zero for 11 days beside his colleagues -- many of them, including Hilaire, not wearing a mask. He was later assigned to a landfill in Staten Island, where debris from the World Trade Center was dumped.  For about 60 days between 2001 and 2002, the New York police officer was surrounded by dust.  In 2005, Hilaire was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. He underwent surgery and radiation. Just months later his doctor told him he also had multiple myeloma, a blood cancer that multiplies the body's plasma cells to dangerous levels.  It's a cancer that usually strikes much later in life. Hilaire was 34.  More than 1,100 people who worked or lived near the World Trade Center on 9/11 have been diagnosed with cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  A few months ago Hilaire received a letter from the CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, officially offering him medical insurance under the World Trade Center Health Program. About 1,140 people have been certified to receive cancer treatment under the WTC Health Program, a representative told CNN.  These are the first numbers released since the program was expanded a year ago.

Answer:","output":"The best answer choice in the given options is \\"radiator.\\" Radiators are a common component of heating systems in buildings, particularly those that rely on central heating. They serve as a means to transfer heat throughout the building, making the space more comfortable for inhabitants. While it is true that energy is used for heating a building and that oil can be used as the energy source, it is important to distinguish between the source of the energy and the method by which the energy is distributed throughout the building. Radiators provide the means by which the heat generated by the energy source (in this case, oil) is dispersed, making them the most appropriate answer choice. It is worth noting that some of the other answer choices can provide heating or insulation benefits in different contexts. For example, insulation is an important component of a building's construction to improve its energy efficiency by reducing heat loss. Body heat and clothing can provide personal warmth in the absence of a mechanical heating system.

Combine the like terms: Since -226*f and 220*f are both terms containing the variable f, I will combine them. -226*f + 220*f = -6*f So, the equation becomes: -6*f + 12 = 0 Step 2. Isolate f: To isolate f, I'll first move the constant term to the other side of the equation. -6*f + 12 - 12 = 0 - 12 This simplifies to: -6*f = -12 Step 3. Solve for f: To find the value of f, I'll divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of f, which is -6. -6*f / -6 = -12 / -6 This simplifies to: f = 2 So, the solution for the given equation, -226*f + 220*f + 12 = 0, is f = 2."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The French defender's move aims to bolster the strength of Marseille's defense while also providing Amavi new challenges and growth opportunities to prove his worth at a higher level. Step 1: Introducing Jordan Amavi Jordan Amavi, a talented 27-year-old French left-back, first caught attention with his performances for OGC Nice before making a move to English side Aston Villa in 2015. Despite showing glimpses of his potential, Amavi struggled with injuries during his time at Villa Park, which hampered his growth as a player. Eager to prove himself, Amavi's move to Marseille offers him a fresh start and a chance to rediscover the form that brought him prominence. Step 2: Providing context for the transfer As Aston Villa continues its rebuilding process after a string of disappointing seasons, the sale of Amavi was seen as a practical move for the club. The funds generated from the potential permanent transfer could be used to strengthen other areas, while clearing the path for younger talent to come through the ranks. Marseille, conversely, sought to bolster its defensive options, and Amavi's acquisition provides depth and competition in the left-back position. With his knowledge of Ligue 1 after playing for Nice, Amavi brings valuable experience and a familiar style of play to the table which will ease his adaptation. Step 3: Discussing the terms of the loan and permanent deal The loan agreement between Aston Villa and Marseille includes an option for the French giants to turn the move into a permanent one at the end of the season. Should Amavi impress during his stint, Marseille will likely pursue a full transfer, enabling Aston Villa to cash in on the player and Marseille to invest in a long-term defensive solution. Step 4: Analyzing the impact on both clubs Aston Villa's decision to loan out Amavi will open the door for younger players to make a case for the first-team left-back spot. The potential permanent sale could also provide the club with much-needed funds to reinvest into the squad, assisting in their quest for promotion back to the Premier League. For Marseille, the addition of Amavi elevates their selection choices and adds a dynamic, attack-minded option on the left flank. By showcasing his skillset in France and beyond, the move has the potential to be a significant win for both the player and the club. Conclusion: Jordan Amavi's loan move to Marseille highlights an exciting new chapter for both Aston Villa and the French defender. With promising prospects for each party in turning the loan into a permanent transfer, the footballing world is eager to see if Amavi can seize this new opportunity and make a substantial impact in Ligue 1, paving the way for a long and prosperous career with Marseille."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists.

Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - Popular music is music with wide appeal that is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry. These forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no musical training. It stands in contrast to both art music and traditional or \\"folk\\" music. Art music was historically disseminated through the performances of written music, although since the beginning of the recording industry, it is also disseminated through recordings. Traditional music forms such as early blues songs or hymns were passed along orally, or to smaller, local audiences.  - Exile on Main St. is a double album by English rock band the Rolling Stones. It was released on 12 May 1972 by Rolling Stones Records and was the band's tenth studio album released in the United Kingdom. The record's music incorporates rock and roll, blues, soul, country, and gospel genres. Although it originally received mixed reviews, \\"Exile on Main St.\\" has since been considered to be the Rolling Stones' best work while being ranked on various lists as one of the greatest albums of all time.  - Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.    What entity does 'some girls ' has the relation 'performer' with?

Write a question about the following article: Austria-Hungary precipitated the Bosnian crisis of 1908-1909 by officially annexing the former Ottoman territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which it had occupied since 1878. This angered the Kingdom of Serbia and its patron, the Pan-Slavic and Orthodox Russian Empire. Russian political manoeuvring in the region destabilised peace accords that were already fracturing in the Balkans, which came to be known as the \\"powder keg of Europe.\\" In 1912 and 1913, the First Balkan War was fought between the Balkan League and the fracturing Ottoman Empire. The resulting Treaty of London further shrank the Ottoman Empire, creating an independent Albanian state while enlarging the territorial holdings of Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece. When Bulgaria attacked Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913, it lost most of Macedonia to Serbia and Greece, and Southern Dobruja to Romania in the 33-day Second Balkan War, further destabilising the region. The Great Powers were able to keep these Balkan conflicts contained, but the next one would spread throughout Europe and beyond.","output":"What happened when Austria-Hungary took over Bosnia and Herzegovina, and how did it lead to problems and fights in a place called the \\"powder keg of Europe\\"?"},{"instruction":"Given the background: Chlamydia may cause a burning feeling during urination.

Although Gladys never married or had children, she had a strong fondness for them and wished to help them in any way she could. This love for children became apparent when she brought a toy bear to her friend's daughter during her hospital stay. This one act eventually turned into multiple visits to the hospital, where Gladys would bring toy bears for the young patients. Consequently, people began to call her the \\"Toy Bear Lady,\\" a testament to her enduring compassion for children. Despite her consistent generosity, nobody knew that Gladys had accumulated such immense wealth. She lived a humble life in a small house outside of Chicago and never flaunted her riches.

He shakes the hands of the pigs and tells them that he's joining up with the band. He pulls out his trumpet from his coat, and begins playing out of tune, much to the dismay of the pigs. The pigs throw him out through the emergency exit. The wolf tries to barge back in, but to no avail. As a result, he vows to \\"huff and puff and blow the house down\\". He does this by blasting his trumpet, causing all the straw that surrounded the nightclub to be blown away.The pigs then travel to their next gig, the \\"Dew Drop Inn\\", also known as the house of sticks, and as usual, all goes well. The wolf, again, comes in, sits down on the stage, pulls out his trumpet and begins to play.

In anger, and like in the original story, he blows the the place down with his trumpet, causing the sticks to collapse on the pigs and patrons. The three pigs then conjure up a plan to keep the wolf from ruining their future gigs, saying that their next place will be made of bricks.Cross-fading into the next scene, we see the \\"house of bricks\\" (built in 1776).

Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds.

Most animals must live in a group, and even a plant grows close together with others of the same kind. Sometimes one living thing kills another, one eats and the other is eaten. Each kind of life eats another kind of life in order to live, and together they create a food chain  . Some food chains are simple, while others are not. But all food chains begin with the sun, and all food chains become broken up if one of the links   disappears. All life needs sunlight to live on. But only plants can use sunlight directly. Plants are 'factories'. They make food from sunlight, water and things in the soil   and air. Plants feed all other living things. Animals can only use the sun's energy after it has been changed into food by plants. Some animals feed directly on plants, others eat smaller animals. Meat-eating animals are only eating plants indirectly. What about humans? We are members of many food chains. We eat rice, vegetables, and fruits and so on. We also eat meat and drink milk. But we often break up the food chains. We kill wild animals and also make rivers, lakes and seas polluted. When these rivers, lakes and seas are polluted, the fish in them can not be eaten. If we eat the fish, we will get strange illnesses. Each form of life is linked   to all others. Breaking the links puts all life in danger. Which living things can use the sun's energy directly? A) Animals. B) Plants. C) Animals and plants. D) All living things. A:","output":"B) Plants. All living things on Earth rely on each other in some way or form to survive. This interdependence creates various food chains, which are sequences of organisms where each organism feeds on the one below it. A crucial aspect of these food chains is the sun, as it provides the necessary energy for life to exist. However, not all living things can directly use the sun's energy. Plants have the unique ability to harness sunlight directly and convert it into food through a process called photosynthesis. In this process, plants use sunlight, water, and substances from the soil and air to produce glucose, which serves as a source of energy and building blocks for growth. This makes plants the primary producers in food chains, as they form the base of the chain by creating food from sunlight. Animals, on the other hand, cannot directly use the sun's energy. Instead, they rely on the food produced by plants, either by consuming the plants themselves (herbivores) or by eating other animals that have fed on plants (carnivores). This makes animals secondary consumers in the food chain. Thus, while animals do depend on the sun's energy for survival, they obtain it indirectly through their consumption of plants or other animals. In summary, it is plants that can directly use the sun's energy to produce food, making them the correct answer to the question (option B)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Community assets in England must all be kept on a list by councils who give local groups first refusal if they are sold. But ministers want to develop an approach \\"better suited\\" to Wales. Critics say they cannot understand the decision. Under the Localism Act, councils in England keep a register of \\"assets of community value\\". These could include libraries, playing fields and shops. If they come up for sale, community groups or parish councils are given a six month window to put together a bid to buy them on behalf of local people. There is a scheme in Scotland too. The Welsh government's communities minister had been considering enacting the legislation in Wales but last month she decided against the idea because she wants to spend time developing \\"an approach which is better suited to the Welsh context\\". In a statement, Lesley Griffiths told the BBC Sunday Politics Wales that the resource requirements could not be underestimated \\"including the need for adequate provision for monitoring and evaluation\\". Ms Griffiths also said she was mindful \\"of the legislative time pressures on the Welsh government currently\\" and she's concerned there could be \\"unrealistic expectations public funding will be provided to enable community organisations to purchase assets\\". Tim Hartley, a director of Supporters Direct, has been helping community groups in England to have sports grounds and stadia listed as assets of community value since the Localism Act came into force. Mr Hartley told the BBC Sunday Politics Wales: \\"This is not expensive, it's not a hassle. \\"I don't understand why the Welsh government won't bring in these elements of the Localism Act which will allow communities across Wales not only to safeguard but also to take ownership of these assets which they've been playing on for years and years.\\" Mr Hartley said listing sports grounds and pitches as community assets  made \\"absolute sense\\" when councils were cutting back on their budgets. Mick Antoniw, Labour AM for Pontypridd said he was disappointed but had received some assurance from the minister that she was going to look at a \\"more effective and better way of supporting community trusts\\". Ms Griffiths said the government \\"greatly values the contribution key community facilities\\" but conceded it was unlikely any new approach will be implemented before the next Assembly elections in 2016.

As U.S. political candidates make their final appeals, voters in 35 states will decide policy issues Tuesday that include legalizing recreational use of marijuana and restricting access to guns and ammunition, voting yes or no on nearly 160 state ballot initiatives. California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have abolished or overturned capital punishment on the grounds that it is unequally applied to minority populations and that innocent people are sometimes convicted. South Dakotans will decide whether to make statewide offices nonpartisan and create a citizens commission to redraw voting districts after each 10-year national census, removing the task from legislators,...

Single/multi-select question: Does the sentence \\"In the 1970s, job losses due to industrial restructuring caused New York City to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"In what decade was there a significant decline in industrial jobs?\\" Options are: - yes; - no;","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"In the 1970s, job losses due to industrial restructuring caused New York City to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates.\\" provides a valid answer to the question \\"In what decade was there a significant decline in industrial jobs?\\" The sentence directly mentions the 1970s as the decade when job losses occurred due to industrial restructuring. This indicates that there was a significant decline in industrial jobs during that period. Additionally, the sentence highlights the effects of these job losses on New York City, such as economic problems and rising crime rates, further emphasizing the importance of this issue in the given decade. The phrase \\"industrial restructuring\\" refers to the process by which industries undergo significant changes in their organization, technology, and production methods. This can lead to a reduction in the number of industrial jobs available, as companies may outsource jobs, adopt new technologies that reduce the need for human labor, or shift their focus to more profitable industries. In the case of New York City in the 1970s, industrial restructuring had widespread consequences. Many manufacturing jobs were lost as companies moved their operations to other countries with lower labor costs or transitioned to service-based industries. The loss of these jobs had a negative impact on the city's economy, as well as on the lives of the workers who were left without employment. The combination of economic issues and high unemployment rates contributed to a rise in crime during this time. With fewer job opportunities and a struggling economy, many individuals may have turned to criminal activities as a way to make ends meet. As a result, crime rates increased, further exacerbating the city's problems. In conclusion, the provided statement offers a valid answer to the question about the decade when there was a significant decline in industrial jobs. The 1970s were marked by industrial restructuring that led to job losses, economic problems, and rising crime rates in New York City, illustrating the far-reaching impact of such changes on both the city and its residents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Choose from options, is the following sentence linguistically acceptable? Were you surprised that he stole the watch? Pick your answer from: 1). unacceptable; 2). acceptable;","output":"The sentence \\"Were you surprised that he stole the watch?\\" is linguistically acceptable.  Let's break down the sentence in order to understand its linguistic acceptability. The sentence is a combination of an interrogative clause and a declarative noun clause.  1. Interrogative clause: \\"Were you surprised\\" The interrogative clause begins with the auxiliary verb \\"were,\\" which is the past tense of the verb \\"to be.\\" This is followed by the subject \\"you\\" and the main verb \\"surprised,\\" which is an adjective in this context. It is important to note that the interrogative form is correct, as the sentence begins with an auxiliary verb, followed by the subject and then the adjective. Therefore, this portion of the sentence is linguistically acceptable. 2. Declarative noun clause: \\"that he stole the watch\\" The declarative noun clause starts with the conjunction \\"that,\\" which introduces the clause and connects it to the main interrogative clause. It is followed by the subject \\"he,\\" the main verb \\"stole\\" (past tense of \\"steal\\"), and the direct object \\"the watch.\\" This noun clause functions as the object of the verb \\"surprised\\" in the main clause, providing further detail about the cause of the surprise. The structure of this clause is linguistically correct, as it follows the subject-verb-object pattern. Consequently, this part of the sentence is also acceptable. In summary, the sentence \\"Were you surprised that he stole the watch?\\" is linguistically acceptable, as both the interrogative clause and the declarative noun clause are structurally correct and adhere to the appropriate syntax rules of English grammar. The sentence effectively communicates the meaning, and it follows the standard of fluency and coherence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize: Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem, an American-born Muslim convert, was sentenced to 30 years for what a judge called an \\"extraordinarily serious\\" crime. His two friends were shot dead after opening fire at an event that featured cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. A security guard was wounded but no-one else was injured in the attack. Kareem is the second person in the US to be convicted of charges supporting the so-called Islamic State (IS) group. Gunmen killed at Prophet Muhammad cartoons event IS claims US Prophet cartoon attack Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi were killed in a police shoot-out outside the conference in Garland, Texas, a suburb of Dallas, two years ago. The event, organised by a group critical of Islam, included a contest for drawings of the Prophet Muhammad - such pictorial depictions are considered forbidden by many Muslims. Prosecutors said Kareem had watched jihadist videos depicting violence with Simpson and Soofi, encouraged them to plot an attack to support the terrorist group and researched travel to the Middle East to join IS fighters. Kareem told Judge Susan Bolton he \\"had nothing to do with this crime\\". He said he did not know his friends had been planning to attack the conference and only found out about the shooting after they were killed. He also told jurors at his trial last year that he did not approve of Simpson using his laptop to watch al-Qaeda promotional videos. But prosecutor Kristen Brook argued Kareem had played an active role in helping attempt mass murder. \\"That just doesn't make him an outside participant or fringe guy,\\" she said. He was convicted of conspiring to support a foreign terrorist organisation and interstate transportation of firearms, among other charges. Authorities also claim he inquired about explosives to blow up the Arizona stadium, which is where the Super Bowl was held that year, before deciding on the cartoon event. Earlier this week, ex-convict Joseph Schreiber was sentenced to 30 years in prison for setting fire to a mosque that the Orlando nightclub shooter had occasionally attended. Schreiber pleaded no contest and was also ordered to pay 10,000 (Â£7,986).  in compensation, despite damages to the mosque exceeding 100,000.

Summarize this article: Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump: I would certainly apologise if you would like me to do that      US President Donald Trump has said he is prepared to apologise for retweeting posts from a British far-right group.      In an interview with ITV's Piers Morgan, Mr Trump said he knew \\"nothing\\" about Britain First before sharing three of its videos in November.      \\"If you are telling me they're horrible people, horrible, racist people, I would certainly apologise if you'd like me to do that,\\" he told Morgan.      The interview, held in Davos, will be broadcast on 28 January at 22:00 GMT.      The president's sharing of the controversial videos to his 40 million followers sparked a Twitter row with the UK prime minister, who criticised the move.      \\"I'm very clear that retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do,\\" Mrs May said, prompting Mr Trump to instruct the PM to focus on \\"terrorism\\" in the UK instead.      'Good relationship'      Asked if he regretted the tweets, Mr Trump said, \\"it was done because I am a big believer in fighting radical Islamic terror\\".      But he insisted he knew \\"nothing about\\" Britain First before sharing posts by the group's deputy leader Jayda Fransen - who is facing a trial in April, accused of using threatening, abusive or insulting words at a protest in Belfast last year.      \\"I know nothing about them, I don't want to be involved with people [like that],\\" Mr Trump told Morgan.      One of the videos retweeted by Mr Trump shows unverified footage of a \\"Muslim migrant\\" attacking a young Dutch man on crutches, with another showing a man smashing a statue of the Virgin Mary.      The third video, originating from riots that took place in Egypt in 2013, shows a man being pushed from the top of a building.      Mr Trump told Morgan: \\"Here's what's fair - if you're telling me they're horrible people, horrible racist people, I would certainly apologise if you'd like me to do that.\\"      He also said the controversy was not a big story in the US.      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption May: We're not afraid to say when US has got it wrong      Britain First, which was set up in 2011 by former members of the far-right British National Party (BNP), uses social media to gain attention for what it calls the \\"Islamification of the UK\\".      Responding to Mr Trump's interview, Ms Fransen said she believed he had been \\"railroaded\\" into offering to apologise.      She said: \\"The fact is Donald Trump retweeted those because they are a matter of national and worldwide security.      \\"Islamic terrorism is affecting us all and he's been railroaded into saying he would offer an apology.\\"      Ms Fransen said if she was really a \\"horrible, nasty racist\\" the US president \\"would condemn me\\".      But she added: \\"It's not true.\\"      'Significant climbdown'      Speaking to ITV after the interview, Morgan said it was \\"right and proper\\" that Mr Trump should apologise, adding: \\"I think this is a significant climbdown by the president\\".      The pair have been amiable since Morgan, who has described the president as a \\"good friend\\", won the US reality show Celebrity Apprentice in 2008 - which was judged by Mr Trump.      Brendan Cox, whose wife Jo Cox was murdered by an extremist who shouted \\"Britain First\\" as he fired his gun, praised Morgan for pushing for an apology.      \\"Not many have succeeded in getting one,\\" said Mr Cox, who was among those who rebuked Mr Trump for promoting the far-right group.      During the interview, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, Mr Trump also told Morgan that he did not want to \\"cause any difficulty for your country\\".      He spoke of his \\"love\\" for the UK and for Scotland in particular, which he described as a \\"very special place\\", despite cancelling a planned visit to the UK in February.      Asked about whether some people were opposed to a UK visit, Mr Trump said: \\"I hadn't heard about banning, I think a lot of the people in your country like what I stand for, [including] tough borders.\\"      Mr Trump added that he had a \\"very good relationship\\" with the UK prime minister, who he met in Davos shortly before the interview on Thursday.      \\"A lot of people think we don't,\\" he said.      In an earlier exchange with the PM in Davos, Switzerland, President Trump told Mrs May: \\"We love your country.\\"      He also said the US and UK were \\"joined at the hip\\" on military matters, while Mrs May said they stood \\"shoulder to shoulder\\" in facing shared threats. ||||| U.S. President Donald Trump arrives during the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Friday, Jan. 26, 2018.

The fact of overlapping could be convenient from the point of view of the receiver design, but on the other hand raises the issues of inter-system interference, especially within E1 and E2 bands, which are allocated for Galileo's publicly regulated service. However, under International Telecommunication Union (ITU) policies, the first nation to start broadcasting in a specific frequency will have priority to that frequency, and any subsequent users will be required to obtain permission prior to using that frequency, and otherwise ensure that their broadcasts do not interfere with the original nation's broadcasts.

If you build a campfire, you start with a large stack of sticks and logs. As the fire burns, the stack slowly shrinks. By the end of the evening, all that is left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way. What do you think happened? The truth is that the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes, but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Although matter was changed, it was not created or destroyed. Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved. You may wonder how it can be conserved if something is now missing? Assume you had measured the mass of the wood before you burned it. Assume you had also trapped the gases released by the burning wood and measured their mass and the mass of the ashes. What would you find? The ashes and gases combined have the same mass as the wood you started with. This example illustrates the law of conservation of mass.

Context: From 1789 to 1815, members of Congress received only a daily payment of 6 while in session. Members received an annual salary of 1,500 per year from 1815 to 1817, then a per diem salary of 8 from 1818 to 1855; since then they have received an annual salary, first pegged in 1855 at 3,000. In 1907, salaries were raised to 7,500 per year, the equivalent of 173,000 in 2010. In 2006, members of Congress received a yearly salary of 165,200. Congressional leaders were paid 183,500 per year. The Speaker of the House of Representatives earns 212,100 annually. The salary of the President pro tempore of the United States Senate for 2006 was 183,500, equal to that of the Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives and Party leaders of the United States Senate. Privileges include having an office and paid staff. In 2008, non-officer members of Congress earned 169,300 annually. Some critics complain congressional pay is high compared with a median American Household income in the United States of 45,113 for men and 35,102 for women. Others have countered that congressional pay is consistent with other branches of government. Another criticism is that members of Congress have access to free or low-cost medical care in the Washington D.C. area.  The petition, \\"Remove health-care subsidies for Members of Congress and their families\\", has already gathered over 1,076,000 signatures on the website Change.org.  In January 2014, it was reported that for the first time over half of the members of Congress were millionaires. Congress has been criticized for trying to conceal pay raises by slipping them into a large bill at the last minute. Others have criticized the wealth of members of Congress. Representative Jim Cooper of Tennessee told Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig that a chief problem with Congress was that members focused on lucrative careers as lobbyists after serving––that Congress was a \\"Farm team for K Street (Washington, D.C.)\\"––instead of on public service.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Jim and Greg are brothers who both run their own farms, but they rarely see each other due to them living in different states. Greg runs a farm in Texas where he rarely sees rain so he spends much of his day watering his crops. Jim lives in Illinois where it rains much more regularly so he has more time to spend dealing with his farm animals instead of watering his plants. Both men intentionally purchased their farms next to lakes since they have always loved fishing during their free time. The brothers are currently planning a fishing trip together, but they are just debating which lake to travel to.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Will Greg's lake have more or less carbon dioxide than Jim's?  Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.","output":"Based on the information provided, it is likely that Greg's lake will have more carbon dioxide than Jim's lake. The reason behind this conclusion lies in the fact that Jim's farm is located in Illinois, where it rains more regularly. This regular rain causes fertilizer to dissolve in the soil and create runoff, which then carries the dissolved fertilizer to nearby bodies of water, such as the lake adjacent to Jim's farm. When the nitrogen-rich fertilizer enters the water, it promotes the rapid growth of algae. Algae are photosynthetic organisms that consume carbon dioxide in the water. As algae thrive thanks to the presence of nitrogen, they use up more carbon dioxide in Jim's lake compared to its levels in Greg's lake. After the algae have died, decomposers break down the dead tissue and consume oxygen in the process. This process may eventually lead to the creation of a dead zone in Jim's lake, an area with very low oxygen levels where little can grow or thrive. On the other hand, Greg's farm in Texas doesn't experience much rain, leading to less dissolved fertilizer and subsequent runoff in his adjacent lake. This results in lower levels of nitrogen entering the water and fewer algae in Greg's lake. Consequently, Greg's lake will have higher concentrations of carbon dioxide since the algae do not grow as much due to the absence of nitrogen-rich water. In conclusion, it is more likely that Greg's lake will have more carbon dioxide than Jim's lake, owing to the differing rainfall patterns and their effects on the presence of nitrogen and growth of algae in the water bodies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In order to provide a detailed and long answer, let's discuss the context and importance of voting in general, as well as the significance of punctuality in the voting process. Voting is an essential mechanism in a democratic society, giving people the power to make decisions on various issues and to select representatives or leaders in their government. It is a way for citizens to participate in the political process and voice their opinions on matters that impact their lives and the well-being of their community. In many countries, voting is organized and scheduled during specific hours, aiming to accommodate the majority of the population. Ensuring that the voting process is accessible to as many people as possible allows for a more representative outcome, reflecting the collective will of the people. In the given context, this voting event is scheduled for 5:30 PM, which is likely designed to accommodate those who have work or other commitments during the day. Punctuality in voting is crucial, as the voting time window may only last for several hours, and in some cases, even shorter. Missing the deadline might result in someone's voice not being counted, which could have an impact on the final decision. It is essential that citizens make sure they are aware of the voting times and locations, and plan ahead to ensure they can make an informed vote during the allocated time. Moreover, being well-prepared and educated in the issues to be voted on is essential, as it can influence how well a person's vote truly reflects their values and interests. Sometimes, the materials and information provided during the voting process can be overwhelming; doing some research and seeking expert insights before the voting event will enable voters to make better choices for themselves and their communities. Thus, the voting taking place at 5:30 PM today holds significant importance not only for the people participating but also for the community at large. The event demonstrates the democratic values practiced in the society, emphasizing the importance of individual opinions and the collective decision-making process."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mr. Peabody is a gifted anthropomorphic dog who lives in a penthouse in New York City and raises his adopted human son, 7-year-old Sherman, and tutors him travelling throughout history using the WABAC, a time machine. They visit Marie Antoinette in Versailles during the French Revolution in 1789. Getting caught in the Reign of Terror, Peabody is nearly sent to the guillotine to be executed by Maximilien Robespierre, but escapes with Sherman through the Paris sewers. In the present day, Sherman attends the Susan B. Anthony School on his first day of school. His knowledge of the apocryphal nature of the George Washington cherry-tree anecdote leads to a fight with one of his classmates, a girl named Penny Peterson, in the cafeteria where she treats him like a dog and puts him in a choke hold, humiliating him. Peabody is called in by Principal Purdy as Sherman had bit Penny in retaliation, and also confronted by Ms. Grunion, a Child Protective Services agent, who suspects that Sherman's behavior is due to being raised by a dog and plans to visit to their home to investigate whether he is an unfit parent. Peabody then invites Penny and her parents, Paul and Patty over for dinner to reconcile before Ms. Grunion arrives. Penny calls Sherman a liar for claiming first-hand knowledge of history. Despite Peabody's contrary instructions, Sherman shows Penny the WABAC to show proof and takes her into the past, where she stays in Ancient Egypt in 1332 BCE to marry King Tut. Sherman returns to get Mr. Peabody's help. Peabody hypnotises the Petersons and manages to retrieve Penny.

Flowering Shrubs and Trees: This is a general term that refers to any shrub or tree that has the capacity to produce flowers. Some examples could include magnolia trees, azalea shrubs, lilac trees, camellia shrubs, and so on. These are highly sought after in gardening due to their aesthetic appeal and their ability to attract wildlife such as bees and butterflies. 2. Heather: This word in the context of gardening refers to the \\"heather\\" plant. Heather (Calluna vulgaris) is a small, evergreen shrub native to Europe, Asia and North America that is known for its vibrant, feather-like flowers that bloom in late summer and can come in colors ranging from white to pink to purple. It is often found in moorlands, bogs, and even some forest environments. Heather is low maintenance and highly resistant to drought, making it a great choice for beginner gardeners or those looking for low-effort plants. 3. Daphne Photo: This could be referring to a photo of a Daphne plant. Daphne is a genus of between 50 and 95 species of deciduous and evergreen shrubs. They are noted for their scented flowers and often brightly colored berries. Different species of Daphne bloom at different times, making it possible to have a Daphne in flower at almost any season. 4. Cultivation and Maintenance: These terms generally refer to the activities involved in taking care of plants to ensure they grow and thrive. Cultivation involves tasks such as planting, watering, fertilizing, and pruning. Maintenance may include activities such as weeding, preventing or controlling pests and diseases, and ensuring the plants have suitable growing conditions in terms of light, temperature, humidity, and soil type. 5. Planting and Watering: These are two key elements of plant care. Planting refers to the act of putting a plant into the ground or into a pot so that it can grow, whereas watering refers to providing the plant with the necessary water it needs to survive and grow. 6. Characteristics and Description: These words suggest a detailed overview or account of a plant's features. This might include information about a plant's size, the color of its foliage and flowers, its growth habit and rate, its preferred growing conditions, its uses in landscaping or gardening, and any unique or notable features. 7. Seedlings: Seedlings refer to young plants that have recently germinated from a seed. These plants are usually very small and delicate, and require careful handling to prevent damage. Seedlings must be gradually exposed to their new growing conditions in a process known as hardening off, so they can acclimate to changes in temperature, light, and humidity. Seedlings maybe grown in special seed trays or pots before they are transplanted to their permanent growing positions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: The 60s decade was a time of major social and cultural change, and the trends of the 1960s reflected that. People were embracing a bohemian lifestyle and the Hippie Movement was born.  To get the look that the hippies created, start thinking about theatrical costumes, recycled clothing, ethnic fashions, Indian prints, bright colors and mismatched patterns. Check out your nearest resale shop to look for vintage clothes and other items that you can repurpose, just like hippies did. Paisley prints and psychedelic prints are also great choices. You can’t go wrong by pairing those two elements together.  Jeans came in all colors of the rainbow and often featured embroidery or appliqued designs. Keep an eye out for those details or add them yourself.  Look for blouses with long and flowy \\"bubble\\" sleeves. Gauzy fabrics work great, too. Wear a simple chiffon baby-doll dress with spaghetti-straps for a feminine look. Hippies frequently went barefoot, but sandals and flip-flops were also popular. If you have boots or clogs, those will also work perfectly. You could have fun with fresh flowers, but fake ones will work. Daisies were especially popular and they were often worn instead of jewelry. Weave the flowers flowers into your hair and secure them with bobby pins. Try a simple braid adorned with flowers or weave them into a wreath to wear on your head like a crown. Gypsy scarves, flower headbands, and leather moccasins are all great options. Peace sign pendants, beaded jewelry, large rings, and chain belts will also work. You could also try stacked silver bangles, woven leather bracelets, and hooped earrings. Thrift stores will be gold mines for these items. There was a wide variety of hairstyles in the 1960s, the most iconic being the very long, natural looking style that the hippies wore. Part it down the middle and allow it to hang loose and free. If you don’t have long hair, check out wigs at your local costume shop. The beehive hairstyle was also very stylish. The hippies usually went for a natural look and wore very little makeup. They did use face paint, however, especially for special events and festivals.

Hippie fashion involved theatrical costumes, recycled clothing, ethnic styles, Indian prints, bright colors, and mismatched patterns. Vintage clothes and repurposed items could be found at resale shops, and paisley and psychedelic prints were popular choices. Jeans in various colors often featured embroidery or appliqued designs. Blouses with long, flowy \\"bubble\\" sleeves were fashionable, as were chiffon baby-doll dresses with spaghetti straps. Footwear ranged from going barefoot to sandals, flip-flops, boots, and clogs. Accessories included fresh or fake flowers, often used in place of jewelry, woven into the hair, or fashioned into wreaths and headbands. Other accessories included gypsy scarves, leather moccasins, peace sign pendants, beaded jewelry, large rings, chain belts, silver bangles, woven leather bracelets, and hooped earrings, many of which could be found at thrift stores. Hairstyles in the 1960s varied, with the most iconic being the long, natural look sported by hippies, either loose or parted down the middle. For those without long hair, wigs from costume shops were an option. Other popular hairstyles included the beehive, which was considered stylish. Hippies typically preferred a natural look with minimal makeup but were known to use face paint for special events and festivals, depicting daisies, rainbows, and peace signs.

Four stars for meeting my expectations based on other yelpers.......  We were not extremely hungry. I ordered the chicken Tandoori tiki, (hope I got that right... as I don't have my handy-dandy Asian Indian food guide close by...) and my wife, ordered the okra, which comes with basmati rice. We also ordered garlic nan, and for a specialty beverage, the mango lassi; a mango-yogurt drink. I'll say up front; \\"Everything was very good, and the mango drink was very much like what we drink, Brasilian style, mixing papaya, mango or passion fruit, with various forms of yogurt, ice cream, or condensed milk.   I bet I've passed this place twenty five times over the past few years when in Vegas on business. The building is old looking, near the bus stop at the front of an older strip center, and in an older section of West Vegas. But once you walk inside, see a relatively nice interior, and see the many regulars we saw, you're probably going to have the same high level of confidence we had.  While service is stereotypical-etchnic restaurant-slow and spotty......... the food does deliver. It will never be as good as homemade, if you cook Indian at home, but then, as a Brasilian family, we rarely find stateside restaurants that meet our standards. That's to be expected. But having enjoyed Indian cuisine over the years, I'm comfortable recommending this restaurant.     I've added Mt. Everest to my \\"black book\\" of off-strip restaurants. If it's good enough for the many Indian clients I saw there tonight, then I'm sure it'll be good enough for you. Remember that Indian clients could go anywhere in town, but there was a good number of couples and foursomes dining in tonight.

The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery.

Chooses to use paper as a metaphor for 'life and art'","output":"Title: Asya Kozina's Artful Paper Creations: Breathing New Life into Classic Mongolian Wedding Gowns Introduction: Imagine walking down the aisle donning a wedding gown inspired by the rich heritage of Mongolian culture, meticulously crafted with the most humble of all mediums—paper. This is the innovative and imaginative world of Asya Kozina, an artist who has turned the concept of traditional wedding attire on its head. Step 1: Introduce Asya Kozina Asya Kozina is a talented artist known for her unique approach to fashion, seamlessly blending historical inspiration with modern design. Her creations celebrate the beauty and intricacy of Mongolian culture, and her willingness to push boundaries has garnered her significant attention in the art and fashion worlds. Step 2: Discuss her inspiration from historical illustrations and sepia photos Kozina's journey into the world of Mongolian-inspired wedding gowns began with an exploration of historical illustrations and sepia-toned photographs. These sources provided a glimpse into the complex designs, patterns, and symbolism found in traditional Mongolian attire, which she then adapted to create her own stunning wedding gowns. Step 3: Elaborate on her decision to use paper as a medium By choosing to work with paper as her primary medium, Kozina transforms a seemingly ordinary material into a remarkable representation of 'life and art.' Paper, both delicate and strong, alludes to the many facets of human experience, reflecting the complexities that we face in our individual and shared journeys. Step 4: Discuss the metaphor of 'life and art' in her creations In Kozina's hands, paper serves as a reminder of the impermanence and beauty of life, making it the ideal medium for representing the love and dedication that a wedding signifies. The delicate and intricate nature of paper artistry symbolizes the fragility of relationships and the need for constant nurturing and care, echoing the importance of communication and compromise in a successful marriage. Step 5: Describe the details of her Mongolian-inspired wedding gowns Kozina's wedding gowns embody the rich traditions of Mongolian culture through the intricate patterns and designs she has incorporated into each piece. She pays homage to the classic Mongolian dress with its bold patterns and elaborate ornamentation while imprinting her own unique artistic vision onto each gown. Conclusion: Asya Kozina's paper wedding gowns are not only visually arresting and enchanting but also serve as thought-provoking conversation pieces, inviting us to reconsider the importance of tradition, heritage, and the beauty found in the artistry of everyday materials. These gowns remind us that, like paper, life is delicate, yet full of the potential to create something truly extraordinary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Roberto Mangabeira Unger (; born 24 March 1947) is a philosopher and politician. He has developed his views and positions across many fields, including social, political, and economic theory. In legal theory, he is best known by his work in the 1970s and 80s while at Harvard Law School as part of the Critical Legal Studies movement, which is held to have helped disrupt the methodological consensus in American law schools. His political activity helped the transition to democracy in Brazil in the aftermath of the military regime, and culminated with his appointment as Brazil's Minister of Strategic Affairs in 2007 and again in 2015. Unger's critique of economics begins with the identification of a key moment in economic history, when the analysis of production and exchange turned away from social theory and engaged in a quest for scientific objectivity. In Unger's analysis, classical economics focused on the causal relations among social activities, which were connected with the production and distribution of wealth. Classical economists asked questions about the true basis of value, activities that contributed to national wealth, systems of rights, or about the forms of government under which people grow rich. In the late-nineteenth century, in response to attacks from socialist ideas and debates about how society works, and as a means to escape the conundrums of value theory and to answer how values could become prices, marginalist economics arose. This movement in economics disengaged economics from prescriptive and normative commitments to withdraw the study of economies from debates about how society worked and what kind of society we wanted to live in. For Unger, this moment in the history of economics robbed it of any analytical or practical value.  Unger's critique of Marginalism begins with Walras' equilibrium theory, which attempted to achieve a certainty of economic analysis by putting aside normative controversies of social organization. Unger finds three weaknesses that crippled the theory: foremost, the theory claimed that equilibrium would be spontaneously generated in a market economy. In reality, a self-adjusting equilibrium fails to occur. Second, the theory puts forth a determinate image of the market. Historically, however, the market has been shown to be indeterminate with different market arrangements. Third, the polemical use of efficiency fails to account for the differences of distribution among individuals, classes, and generations.  The consequences of the marginalist movement were profound for the study of economics, Unger says. The most immediate problem is that under this generalizing tendency of economics, there is no means by which to incorporate empirical evidence and thus to re-imagine the world and develop new theories and new directions. In this way, the discipline is always self-referential and theoretical. Furthermore, the lack of a normative view of the world curtails the ability to propose anything more than a policy prescription, which by definition always assumes a given context. The discipline can only rationalize the world and support a status quo. Lastly, Unger finds that this turn in economics ended up universalizing debates in macroeconomics and leaving the discipline without any historical perspective. A consequence, for example, was that Keynes' solution to a particular historical crisis was turned into a general theory when it should only be understood as a response to a particular situation. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: how did he identify this key moment","output":"Roberto Mangabeira Unger identified the key moment in economic history as the point when the analysis of production and exchange turned away from social theory and engaged in a quest for scientific objectivity.

Given the question: Given the background: The Mercator projection is best within 15 degrees north or south of the equator. Landmasses or countries outside that zone get stretched out of shape. The further the feature is from the equator, the more out of shape it is stretched. For example, if you look at Greenland on a globe, you see it is a relatively small country near the North Pole. Yet, on a Mercator projection, Greenland looks almost as big the United States. Because Greenland is closer to the pole, the continent's shape and size are greatly increased. The United States is closer to its true dimensions.  and the situation: Stef is a young girl interested in the geography of the world. For her birthday, she got two different representations of the Earth. Her grandparents gave her a map that uses the Mercator projection and her uncle gave her a globe. She is comparing how certain countries look differently on the two gifts and trying to figure out why that is. She is specifically looking at Norway, a country near the North Pole, and Mexico, a country close to the equator.  Answer the following question: Will Norway be less accurately represented on the globe or the map? The answer is:","output":"Norway will be less accurately represented on the map. The reason for this is Norway's high latitude. The further a country is from the equator, the more distorted it becomes on a Mercator projection map. This distortion involves an exaggeration of the size and a change in the shape of the country. In this case, Norway, being located near the North Pole, will appear much larger and more stretched out on the Mercator map than it truly is. Conversely, a globe represents all countries at their actual proportions and angles because it's a 3D model unaffected by the distortion caused by flattening the spherical Earth onto a 2D surface like a map. Thus, the representation of Norway on the globe would be a lot more accurate than on the Mercator map. Mexico, nearer to the equator, would look more or less the same on both the map and the globe due to the Mercator projection's properties of minimal distortions around the equator."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the best known non-vocal piece by Massenet?  Massenet was a fluent and skilful orchestrator, and willingly provided ballet episodes for his operas, incidental music for plays, and a one-act stand-alone ballet for Vienna (Le carillon, 1892). Macdonald remarks that Massenet's orchestral style resembled that of Delibes, \\"with its graceful movement and bewitching colour\\", which was highly suited to classical French ballet. The Méditation for solo violin and orchestra, from Thaïs, is possibly the best known non-vocal piece by Massenet, and appears on many recordings. Another popular stand-alone orchestral piece from the operas is Le dernier sommeil de la Vierge from La Vierge, which has featured on numerous discs since the middle of the 20th century.A Parisian critic, after seeing La grand' tante, declared that Massenet was a symphonist rather than a theatre composer. At the time of the British premiere of Manon in 1885, the critic in The Manchester Guardian, reviewing the work enthusiastically, nevertheless echoed his French confrère's view that the composer was really a symphonist, whose music was at its best when purely orchestral.  Massenet took a wholly opposite view of his talents. He was temperamentally unsuited to writing symphonically: the constraints of sonata form bored him. He wrote, in the early 1870s, \\"What I have to say, musically, I have to say rapidly, forcefully, concisely; my discourse is tight and nervous, and if I wanted to express myself otherwise I would not be myself.\\" His efforts in the concertante field made little mark, but his orchestral suites, colourful and picturesque according to Grove, have survived on the fringes of the repertoire.  Other works for orchestra are a symphonic poem, Visions (1891), an Ouverture de Concert (1863) and Ouverture de Phèdre (1873). After early attempts at chamber music as a student, he wrote little more in the genre. Most of his early chamber pieces are now lost; three pieces for cello and piano survive.

Imagine we have a basket, and we take out 37 candies and then put back 37 candies. Now, let's see what happens: We start with this equation: 0 = -l + 37 - 37 First, we notice that there is a \\"+37\\" and a \\"-37\\". Adding 37 and then subtracting 37 doesn't change anything, like taking out 37 candies and then putting them back. So, we can ignore those two numbers: 0 = -l Now, we're left with the equation without the 37 candies. We need to find the value of \\"l\\". Currently, \\"l\\" is being multiplied by -1 (that's what the \\"-\\" sign means). To solve for \\"l\\", we need to do the opposite. Instead of multiplying by -1, we need to divide by -1: 0 ÷ -1 = l And you know what? Zero divided by any number (even -1) is still zero. So our answer is: l = 0 We found out that \\"l\\" equals zero, which is like having an empty basket."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Three-week-old Eliza was found dead after being abducted. Her mother, father and uncle were shot at a home in Long Beach. Article:","output":"Title: 25,000 Reward Established by County Board for Information in Long Beach Tragedy In a recent move to encourage community involvement and expedite closure for a grieving family, the County Board has announced the establishment of a 25,000 reward for any information that leads to the conviction of the individual or individuals responsible for a horrific crime in Long Beach. Three weeks ago, the unimaginable happened when three-week-old baby Eliza was abducted from her family home, only to be found dead some hours later. Her mother, father, and uncle were also shot in a merciless and senseless act of violence that has shaken the community to the core. Though the tragic event has triggered an outpouring of condolences and support for the devastated family, the culprits behind these heinous crimes remain unpunished. The 25,000 reward, now being offered by the County Board, represents a significant measure to encourage potential witnesses or individuals with knowledge of the crime to come forward and provide information that could aid the investigation. The belief is that someone in the community may hold the key to revealing the perpetrators and helping bring justice for baby Eliza and her heartbroken family. The Long Beach Police Department has been working diligently to uncover any possible leads they can use to help identify and apprehend the criminals behind this terrible tragedy. Law enforcement is appealing to the public and urging anyone who may have witnessed any suspicious activity in the vicinity of the crime or has any relevant information to come forward, even if they think their information is insignificant. The magnitude of this tragedy has prompted a large-scale community response, with people assembling in support of the family and in pursuit of justice for the innocent lives lost. Residents of Long Beach have come together in candlelight vigils, prayer gatherings, and community meetings in an atmosphere of unity and resilience. The shared goal is to ensure that baby Eliza, her mother, father, and uncle did not die in vain. While no family should ever have to endure such heartache, the immense public response has shone a light of hope amidst the darkness. The determination to advocate for justice, to stand up against senseless violence, and to support those who have been affected by such crimes is a testament to the strength and character of the Long Beach community. As the investigation continues, it is essential that the community remains vigilant and steadfast in its commitment to seeking answers and justice. The County Board's decision to offer a substantial reward for information is a powerful show of support for the family, as well as a clear message to those responsible for these despicable acts that they cannot evade justice forever. By coming together, the people of Long Beach are sending an unequivocal signal: their community will not be defeated by violence and tragedy. The determination to bring those responsible to justice, and to heal as a community, serves as a beacon of hope for a brighter, stronger future. Anyone with information regarding this case can contact the Long Beach Police Department or report their tip anonymously through the designated crime hotline. The County Board remains committed to supporting the family and the broader community as the investigation unfolds, and authorities hope that the 25,000 reward will be the catalyst that brings forth vital information in solving this heart-wrenching case."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"To determine the category for \\"A Date with Jimmy Smith Volume Two,\\" let's analyze the title step-by-step and justify our decision. 1. First, let's look at the words in the title. It mentions a specific person named Jimmy Smith, and it is associated with Volume Two. This could imply that it is part of a series or collection. 2. Now, let's rule out some categories that don't fit this title. It is unlikely to be a company, educational institution, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, or film (given it's a volume). 3. With the remaining categories - artist, album, and written work - we can make a more informed decision. Knowing that Jimmy Smith was a famous jazz musician, it is highly possible that \\"A Date with Jimmy Smith Volume Two\\" is related to his work. 4. Since it mentions \\"Volume Two\\" in the title, it is less likely to be an artist category as it implies a continuation or collection of works. Therefore, we are left with album and written work. 5. Jazz musicians typically release albums instead of written works. Thus, considering Jimmy Smith's profession and the title's format, it is highly likely that \\"A Date with Jimmy Smith Volume Two\\" belongs to the category of album.

At this time in the early 1960s, Feynman exhausted himself by working on multiple major projects at the same time, including a request, while at Caltech, to \\"spruce up\\" the teaching of undergraduates. After three years devoted to the task, he produced a series of lectures that eventually became The Feynman Lectures on Physics. He wanted a picture of a drumhead sprinkled with powder to show the modes of vibration at the beginning of the book. Concerned over the connections to drugs and rock and roll that could be made from the image, the publishers changed the cover to plain red, though they included a picture of him playing drums in the foreword. The Feynman Lectures on Physics occupied two physicists, Robert B. Leighton and Matthew Sands, as part-time co-authors for several years. Even though the books were not adopted by most universities as textbooks, they continue to sell well because they provide a deep understanding of physics. Many of his lectures and miscellaneous talks were turned into other books, including The Character of Physical Law, QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter, Statistical Mechanics, Lectures on Gravitation, and the Feynman Lectures on Computation.

And, in addition to them, Charles Butterworth (a very enjoyable supporting actor) was in this film,...so why didn't I particularly enjoy it?! Well, despite a good cast, this is one of the poorest written and most clichéd \\"A pictures\\" I have ever seen. Given the talent and money spent to make this film, it is shocking how slip-shod the writing was. I knew the film would be tedious when time after time early in the film I found myself predicting EXACTLY what would happen next--and I was always right! And this isn't because I am some sort of \\"movie savant\\", but was because almost no imagination or effort went into it. In fact, it seemed almost as if the film was just a long string of clichés all strung together! Also, I found it a bit irritating that Fred mistreated Carole so bad throughout the film and yet, true to convention, she came running to him in the end. Uggh! There is MORE suspense in a Lassie film (\\"will he bring people to rescue Timmy or will the rope he is dangling from break?\\"). Despite the very, very tired and clichéd script, there were a few positives about the film. It was pretty cool seeing Fred look like a broken lush at the end of the film--it was pretty believable and he looked like he hadn't eaten, shaved or slept in days. Also, Charles Butterworth's \\"prattle\\" did provide a few mildly humorous moments. But all this just wasn't enough to make this film look any different than a \\"B movie\\".

A few positive aspects are mentioned (e.g., a believable performance and occasional humorous moments) but these are outweighed by the overall negative tone and dissatisfaction of the reviewer.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. John William Money (8 July 1921 - 7 July 2006) was a psychologist, sexologist and author, specializing in research into sexual identity and biology of gender. He was one of the first scientists to study the psychology of sexual fluidity and how the societal constructs of \\"gender\\" affect an individual. More recent academic studies have criticized Money's work in many respects, particularly in regards to his involvement with the sex-reassignment of David Reimer and his eventual suicide. Money's writing has been translated into many languages, and includes around 2,000 articles, books, chapters and reviews. In this book (Oxford 1988: 116), Money develops a conception of 'bodymind,' as a way for scientists, in developing a science about sexuality, to move on from the platitudes of dichotomy between nature versus nurture, innate versus the acquired, biological versus the social, and psychological versus the physiological. He suggests that all of these capitalize on the ancient, pre-Platonic, pre-biblical conception of body versus the mind, and the physical versus the spiritual. In coining the term \\"bodymind\\", in this sense, Money wishes to move beyond these very ingrained principles of our folk or vernacular psychology.  Money also develops here (Oxford 1988: 114-119) a view of \\"Concepts of Determinism,\\" which, transcultural, transhistorical, and universal, all people have in common, sexologically or otherwise. These include pairbondage, troopbondage, abidance, ycleptance, foredoomance, with these coping strategies: adhibition (engagement), inhibition, explication.  Money suggests that the concept of threshold (Oxford 1988: 115) - the release or inhibition of sexual (or other) behavior - is most useful for sex research as a substitute for any concept of motivation. Moreover, it confers the distinct advantage of having continuity and unity to what would otherwise be a highly disparate and varied field of research. It also allows for the classification of sexual behavior. For Money, the concept of threshold has great value because of the wide spectrum to which it applies. \\"It allows one to think developmentally or longitudinally, in terms of stages or experiences that are programmed serially, or hierarchically, or cybernetically (i.e. regulated by mutual feedback).\\" (Oxford 1988: 116) Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What is the book about?","output":"The book is about the author's John Money's approach to understanding sexual identity and gender biology. Money introduces a new conception known as 'bodymind,' which he uses as a way of moving beyond traditional dichotomies in the science of sexuality such as nature versus nurture, biological versus social, and psychological versus the physiological. He uses the term bodymind to \\"move beyond these very ingrained principles of our folk or vernacular psychology.\\" The book also introduces Money's view of \\"Concepts of Determinism,\\" which are common to all people. Furthermore, he advocates for the use of the concept of 'threshold' in sex research as it brings continuity and unity to the otherwise varied field of research. The quote from the article that best summarises the theme of the book is: \\"Money develops a conception of 'bodymind,' as a way for scientists, in developing a science about sexuality, to move on from the platitudes of dichotomy between nature versus nurture, innate versus the acquired, biological versus the social, and psychological versus the physiological.\\""},{"instruction":"OPTIONS: 1.

Given the question: Process:  - Food leaves the esophagus and enters the stomach - The stomach churns the food - With the aid of stomach acids - The food becomes a thick liquid - Is then passed to the small intestine.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose A balance in nutrition is made happens, how will it affect more food will be digested.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation, which implies a balance in nutrition, can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of digestion. A well-balanced diet provides the body with the essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals required for optimal functioning, as well as the energy needed for numerous biochemical reactions, including those involved in digestion. Direct Effects: 1. Improved enzymatic reactions: A balanced diet ensures that the body receives adequate amounts of nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, which act as cofactors for various enzymes involved in digestion. For instance, the presence of sufficient amounts of magnesium is crucial for the proper functioning of enzymes that break down carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. Enhanced enzymatic reactions allow for more efficient breaking down of food, thereby promoting better digestion. 2. Adequate production of stomach acids: A well-nourished diet ensures the body has the necessary components to produce stomach acids, such as hydrochloric acid, which play a crucial role in breaking down food in the stomach. Balanced nutrition can lead to the appropriate production of stomach acids, resulting in optimal digestion and absorption of nutrients. 3. Proper peristalsis: A balanced diet provides adequate amounts of dietary fiber, which is essential for maintaining proper bowel movement and peristalsis—the involuntary muscle contractions that move food through the digestive system. A well-functioning peristaltic mechanism makes digestion more efficient as it ensures that food moves effectively through the digestive tract. Indirect Effects: 1. Stronger immune system: A balanced diet strengthens the immune system, enabling it to better combat pathogens and prevent infections. Since the digestive system is susceptible to infections by bacteria, viruses, or parasites, a stronger immune system can help maintain the overall health of the gastrointestinal tract, thus indirectly improving digestion. 2. Optimal gut microbiome: A well-balanced diet promotes a healthy gut microbiome that contributes to digestion. The gut microbiome comprises diverse bacterial populations that aid in the breakdown of complex carbohydrates, synthesizing vitamins, and fermenting dietary fiber. These beneficial microorganisms also play a role in modulating the immune system and maintaining gut health, which indirectly affects the efficiency of digestion. 3. Enhanced energy production: A balanced diet ensures that the body has adequate fuel to generate energy. In turn, this energy supports the numerous biochemical reactions, including the process of digestion. When the body has enough energy, it can allocate resources to digestion, enhancing its efficiency and allowing for better absorption and utilization of nutrients. 4. Reduced inflammation and better gut health: Consuming a balanced diet that includes adequate portions of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains supplies the body with essential antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds that can help combat inflammation. Lower inflammation levels lead to improved gut health, which fosters a conducive environment for digestion and nutrient absorption. In conclusion, the perturbation brought about by a balanced diet can have both direct and indirect effects on the digestive process. By promoting the proper functioning of enzymes, enhancing stomach acid production, maintaining an optimal gut microbiome, and supporting overall energy and immune function, a well-balanced diet contributes to more efficient digestion and absorption of nutrients."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve -280*y - 2744 = 138*y - 40*y - 98 for y.","output":"To solve the equation -280*y - 2744 = 138*y - 40*y - 98 for the variable y, follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify both sides of the equation First, simplify the equation by combining the terms with the variable y on each side: The right side of the equation has two y terms: 138*y and -40*y. Combine these to get 138*y - 40*y = 98*y. Our simplified equation is: -280*y - 2744 = 98*y - 98 Step 2: Get all the y terms on one side of the equation To do this, add 280*y to both sides of the equation to move the -280*y term to the right side: -280*y + 280*y - 2744 = 98*y + 280*y - 98 This simplifies to: -2744 = 378*y - 98 Step 3: Move the constant terms to the left side of the equation Add 98 to both sides to move the -98 term to the left side: -2744 + 98 = 378*y - 98 + 98 This simplifies to: -2646 = 378*y Step 4: Solve for y To solve for y, divide both sides of the equation by 378: -2646 / 378 = 378*y / 378 This simplifies to: y = -7 So the solution to the equation -280*y - 2744 = 138*y - 40*y - 98 is y = -7."},{"instruction":"Is this product review positive? Title: sex plus fantasy Review: I had no idea that LUNA was a Harlequin imprint. If I had, I would've had other expectations. Now, I like a well-written romance novel, but this really was not. I bought it expecting a fantasy novel, not wild sex in a thin wrapping of a fantasy world. This book started out quite promisingly, with some interesting world-building. Then it went downhill from there with two-dimensional characters, who seemed to be either purely good or purely evil. The sex scenes were overblown and without any fun or tenderness. Bleah. The ending was rushed and contrived (and not a surprise at all). The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is due to the interesting socities that the author has devised. I won't buy the sequel.

Plymouth: The redevelopment of the city was planned by Sir Patrick Abercrombie in his 1943 Plan for Plymouth whilst simultaneously working on the reconstruction plan for London. Between 1951 and 1957 over 1000 homes were completed every year mostly using innovative prefabricated systems of just three main types; by 1964 over 20,000 new homes had been built transforming the dense overcrowded and unsanitary slums of the pre-war city into a low density, dispersed suburbia. Most of the city centre shops had been destroyed and those that remained were cleared to enable a zoned reconstruction according to his plan. In 1962 the modernist high rise of the Civic Centre was constructed, an architecturally significant example of mid twentieth century civic slab-and-tower set piece allowed to fall into disrepair by its owner Plymouth City Council but recently grade II listed by English Heritage to prevent its demolition.

I disagree that it can press more than one clove at a time. I guess it can if they're little and skinny, but it will only hold one plump clove at a time. I don't have any trouble pressing one clove, but if I try to overload it, I do not have the strength to squeeze.

Make sure to do this regularly, because time makes all the difference when trying to prevent mold growth. If leaks are present, contact a plumber to repair them or take matters into your own hands by fixing them yourself. Shampoo, conditioner, body wash, washcloths and similar items can give mold a potential place to hide. Wipe these items dry or squeeze all of the water out after each use and store them in a towel closet or somewhere else dry between showers. After each shower, go over the walls of the shower in a vertical swiping motion with a squeegee so that you can quickly and easily get leftover water into the drain instead of allowing it to cling to the walls. Keeping shower walls dry contributes greatly to creating a low level of moisture in the bathroom. Apply a standard grout sealer to the spaces between your bathroom tiles each year to waterproof them. If at any point you have a particularly difficult time keeping your grout mold-free, you can also scrub it with bleach and a toothbrush or replace it completely by scraping it out with a flat screwdriver.

The Samsung Galaxy S IV will be unveiled March 14 at a New York event, the company announced Monday. The release will mark the latest assault in what's rapidly become a two-phone race for supremacy on the mobile landscape. Samsung confirmed the plans at Mobile World Congress, the massive tech show currently under way in Barcelona, Spain. Samsung unveiled a new tablet there but, taking a page from Apple's playbook, opted not to roll out its flagship phone during the crowded event where many rival products are clamoring for attention.

Article: You know how much your telephone has changed over the past 10 years? Your car will change even more than that in the next 10 years. One of the biggest changes is that cars will drive themselves. \\"We certainly have the technology for it now.\\"says Andrew Poliak of automotive technology supplier QNX.\\"We expect self-driving cars to be a mainstream thing between 2020 and 2025.\\" The American company Google has been working on self-driving cars for years. These cars are already on the roads in the United States and are truly self-driving. They have to steering wheels or pedals . Last week, the police ordered one of Google's cars to stop for driving too slowly on a public road. The car was not breaking any law, so no one was punished. Another American company, Tesla, added an \\"Autopilot\\" feature to its cars last month. With the Autopilot turned on, the vehicle drives itself. The car will speed up, slow down, _ and drive by itself. You can take over driving any time by turning the steering wheel or touching a pedal. The car uses sensors to know when driveway changing is safe and whether it should speed up or slow down. Tesla Autopilot is made for cross-country driving. It keeps you in the driveway and helps you avoid hitting other cars. It does not work well on local roads, for it will not stop at a red light or stop sign. Reporter Carolyn Nicander Mohr tried the Autopilot feature of a Tesla earlier this month. She had a hard time trusting the car to do what it should do. She thought about disabling the Autopilot feature many times during her trip. She wanted to take control at every bend in the road and hit the brake when the car in front of her slowed down.

What can I do to not feel depressed and like a stagnant human being when and in the hours after I wake up? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"The two questions you asked are related but they do not share the same meaning. I'll address each of them separately and provide some suggestions on how to handle the issues you have raised. 1. Feeling like falling over and experiencing blurry vision It is not normal to feel like falling over or have blurry vision when you wake up and walk to the hallway. These symptoms could be caused by various factors, some of which are: a. Orthostatic Hypotension: This is characterized by a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing up. It can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and even blurred vision. It's essential to get up gradually from a lying to a standing position to give your body time to adjust to the change in posture. b. Dehydration: Dehydration can lead to dizziness and blurry vision because it affects the overall balance of fluids in your body, including blood flow to the brain and the proper functioning of the eyes. c. Sleep deprivation or poor sleep quality: Inadequate sleep can have a detrimental effect on your body and mind, including dizziness and impaired vision upon waking up. To resolve these issues, consider the following: - Stand up slowly when getting out of bed. - Ensure you are properly hydrated by drinking enough water throughout the day. - Aim for seven to nine hours of quality sleep per night. - Keep a consistent sleep schedule. - Consult a healthcare professional if the symptoms persist. 2. Feeling depressed and like a stagnant human being during and after waking up The factors contributing to this feeling might include poor sleep quality, an unhealthy lifestyle, or even a clinical case of depression, among others. Here are some suggestions on how to address these feelings: a. Create a morning routine: Having a consistent and healthy morning routine can help start your day on a positive note. Try activities like stretching, meditation, or journaling to establish a more fulfilling start to the day. b. Engage in physical activity: Exercise is known to boost mood, energy levels, and overall mental health. Incorporate exercise into your daily routine, ideally in the morning, to improve your mood and well-being. c. Eat a healthy breakfast: Consuming a nutritious meal in the morning can improve cognitive function and sustain energy levels throughout the day. d. Connect with others: Socializing with friends or family members can elevate your mood and help you feel more engaged in life. e. Seek professional help: If your feelings of depression are persistent, it might be advisable to consult a mental health professional to explore various therapeutic options. In summary, these two questions address different aspects of your well-being. The first deals with potential physical causes of dizziness and blurry vision upon waking up, while the second discusses feelings of depression and stagnation in the morning hours. It is important to address both issues by adopting healthy lifestyle habits and consulting professionals if necessary to improve your overall health and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - hydrogen  - gas  - water  - mercury  A:","output":"The only metal that is liquid at room temperature is mercury. Among the given choices, hydrogen is an element, but it is a gas at room temperature and not a metal. Gas refers to a state of matter and is not an element itself. Lastly, water is a liquid at room temperature, but it is a compound made of hydrogen and oxygen, not a metal. Mercury, with the chemical symbol Hg and atomic number 80, is a unique metal in that it is a liquid at room temperature (about 20-25 degrees Celsius or 68-77 degrees Fahrenheit). This property is due to its relatively weak bonds between atoms. Mercury has a melting point of -38.83 degrees Celsius (-37.89 degrees Fahrenheit) and a boiling point of 356.73 degrees Celsius (674.11 degrees Fahrenheit). Mercury is a fascinating element with a range of applications. It is most well-known for its use in older thermometers due to its ability to expand and contract uniformly as the temperature changes. However, in recent years, the use of mercury for measuring temperature has diminished because of its harmful effects on human health and the environment. Mercury is highly toxic, and extended exposure can lead to health problems such as kidney damage, respiratory failure, and negative neurological effects. Beyond thermometers, mercury has been used in other applications, including barometers to measure atmospheric pressure, various types of electrical switches, and dental amalgams for filling cavities. Additionally, mercury's high density has made it a choice material for liquid mirror telescopes. Despite its numerous uses, there is a growing concern regarding mercury's impact on both human health and the environment. Many countries have introduced or strengthened regulations to limit the emission of mercury and phase out its usage in consumer products. The Minamata Convention on Mercury, a global treaty adopted in 2013, embodies the international effort to protect human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds. In conclusion, mercury is the only metal that is liquid at room temperature, setting it apart from other metals with its unique properties and diverse applications. However, due to its toxicity and environmental concerns, efforts are being made to reduce the use of mercury in everyday life and implement safer alternatives wherever possible."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: Is Saints QB Drew Brees worth two first-round draft picks? NFL teams can begin placing the franchise tag on potential free agents Feb. 20. The mechanism has historically been a very effective way to restrict movement since another club must not only make an enticing contract offer to pry a tagged player loose, it must surrender two first-round picks to the player's original team if it chooses not to match the offer. Only three franchised players have switched teams at that cost, and none since 1998. (Teams have negotiated different terms, such as QB Matt Cassel's move from New England to Kansas City in 2009 for one second-round pick.) But wouldn't Saints QB Drew Brees be worth two first-rounders? Let's couch this hypothetical upfront: Brees could re-sign with the Saints before Monday, allowing the team to potentially tag all-pro G Carl Nicks or WR Marques Colston instead; if Brees is tagged, he could also get hit with the exclusive version of the tag, which doesn't allow other teams to even negotiate with him. Brees also said prior to the Super Bowl that he expected to be re-signed soon and should be a Saint for the rest of his career. But let's say, for argument's sake, New Orleans tagged Brees but let other teams talk to him. Brees, twice the offensive player of the year since 2008, just turned 33 and comes off a season where he set single-season records for passing yards (5,476), completion rate (71.2%) and total completions (468). His 2011 campaign aside, Brees' run in New Orleans has produced the most prolific six-year stretch for passing yards (28,394) by one player in league history. (Though you could argue that his symbiosis with the Saints and HC Sean Payton is otherworldly and wouldn't translate in another city.) Since suffering the shoulder injury that led to his departure from the Chargers after the 2005 season, Brees hasn't missed a game due to injury and has only been sacked an average of 19.3 times per season with New Orleans, a remarkable figure given his number of dropbacks. He's also a workout warrior in the offseason. But put aside the stats. Brees may be even more renowned for his locker room leadership, not to mention his community service. Two first-round picks (and maybe a contract that averages roughly 18 million annually, same as Tom Brady and Peyton Manning received in recent years) for a player in a league now largely defined by its quarterbacks seems a veritable bargain, no? What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article is discussing whether Saints quarterback Drew Brees is worth two first-round draft picks in the NFL. Brees has impressive stats, strong leadership, and dedication to community service. He could re-sign with the Saints before Monday, which may affect who the team tags. However, the article suggests that two first-round picks and possibly an 18 million annual contract for a player like Brees could be a good deal in a league that values quarterbacks highly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: This article: Born at Podolskaya Street in Saint Petersburg, Russia, Shostakovich was the second of three children of Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich and Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina. Shostakovich's paternal grandfather, originally surnamed Szostakowicz, was of Polish Roman Catholic descent (his family roots trace to the region of the town of Vileyka in today's Belarus), but his immediate forebears came from Siberia. A Polish revolutionary in the January Uprising of 1863–4, Bolesław Szostakowicz would be exiled to Narym (near Tomsk) in 1866 in the crackdown that followed Dmitri Karakozov's assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II. When his term of exile ended, Szostakowicz decided to remain in Siberia. He eventually became a successful banker in Irkutsk and raised a large family. His son Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich, the composer's father, was born in exile in Narim in 1875 and studied physics and mathematics in Saint Petersburg University, graduating in 1899. He then went to work as an engineer under Dmitri Mendeleev at the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Saint Petersburg. In 1903 he married another Siberian transplant to the capital, Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina, one of six children born to a Russian Siberian native.Their son, Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich, displayed significant musical talent after he began piano lessons with his mother at the age of nine. On several occasions he displayed a remarkable ability to remember what his mother had played at the previous lesson, and would get \\"caught in the act\\" of playing the previous lesson's music while pretending to read different music placed in front of him. In 1918 he wrote a funeral march in memory of two leaders of the Kadet party, murdered by Bolshevik sailors.In 1919, at the age of 13, he was admitted to the Petrograd Conservatory, then headed by Alexander Glazunov, who monitored Shostakovich's progress closely and promoted him.

In New York City, 1934, jazz singer Dot Clark and her shady gangster boyfriend, Louie The Lug (\\"An Earful of Music\\"), are introduced. After having an affair with the deceased Professor Edward Wilson, Dot is now technically his common-law wife and heiress to 77 million. She has to go to Egypt to claim the money, and sets off with Louie in hopes of getting the cash. Former assistant to Edward Wilson, Gerald Lane, informs the law offices of Benton, Loring, and Slade of Professor Wilson's death and the fact that Edward's son, Eddie Wilson, Jr, is the rightful heir to the money. Mr. Slade, the lawyer, goes to a barge in Brooklyn where Eddie is living with his adopted father, Pops, an old stevedore, and his three sons, Oscar, Adolph, and Herman, who roughhouse Eddie. However, Eddie is managing to live a nice life nonetheless, with his girlfriend, Nora 'Toots', and his care for all the kids on the barge. He dreams of the day when he will have enough money to live his own life outside of the dirty barge (\\"When My Ship Comes In\\"). Moments later, Eddie is informed that he has inherited the 77 million and boards a ship bound for Egypt to claim the money.
