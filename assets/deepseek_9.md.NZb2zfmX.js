Article: Scientists are closely concerned with the structure of buildings and with the quality of building materials. The World health Organization (WHO) observes that the introduction of air conditioning and energy conservation   measures have been accompanied by growing problems of indoor air quality. Some pollutants arise from insulation   products, some from moving cars, and others from modern housing materials. As many Europeans spend up to 90% of their lives in buildings, the health effects of the indoor climate are very important.   Some construction materials, including fiberboard, insulation foams and certain glues for man-made wood floor boards, for example, give out organic products such as formaldehyde  . Heat and humidity increase the release of formaldehyde and the gas seriously harms the eyes. Paint, lacquer, etc. can also release dangerous gas into indoor air.   Construction materials can cause serious damage, especially when they contain asbestos . Asbestos is naturally present in rock formations worldwide. It belongs to a family of mineral substances made up of solid, non-combustible  fiber. These properties make asbestos a highly sought-after construction material. As early as 1931, however, public health officers in the prefix = st1 /United Kingdomrevealed the connection between breathing in asbestos dust and such diseases as lung cancer.   The land on which a building is sited may also contribute to pollution. Some kinds of granite or similar rocks contain traces of radium. As it breaks down, this naturally radioactive element produces some kind of radioactive gas that goes through tiny cracks in walls, floors and building materials, and makes its way into the building and the rooms. The better the homes are insulated, the more is the dangerous gas in indoor air. The main effect of this dangerous gas on health is to increase the risk of lung cancer. Question: Why is asbestos a sought-after building material? Options: A: It is a kind of insulation foam. B: Asbestos will not give out dangerous gas. C: This material is not easy to catch fire. D: It is rarely present in rock formations.","output":"C: This material is not easy to catch fire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Interviews are being carried out by Portuguese officers with Scotland Yard detectives present. Mr Malinka and the other suspect left the central police station in Faro after they were interviewed. The Russian-born computer expert, who has Portuguese nationality, is likely to face more questioning on Wednesday. A third person, who is said to be suffering from severe schizophrenia, remained in the police headquarters after the other two had left. It is not clear when the fourth individual will be interviewed. All of those being questioned are Portuguese citizens. They have all been summoned to be interviewed; there have been no arrests. The status of arguidos in the Portuguese judicial system refers to individuals whom police may reasonably suspect are linked to a crime. Local Briton Robert Murat - who was himself named as an arguido in the case before being cleared of any involvement - said it was \\"ridiculous\\" that Mr Malinka had been questioned as a suspect. Mr Murat had worked with Mr Malinka in 2006 and 2007 setting up a property website. He told the BBC: \\"It's absolutely ridiculous.

As children they play together, sell sexually explicit pictures cut from a magazine, and wonder if a South Korean Olympic swimmer could outrace a sea turtle. Jung-ho also showed the rest of them a VCR that his mother had, and this film he found on it.

He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? felt like an answer to irvine welsh 's book trainspotting","output":"The given review indicates a positive opinion of the movie. The reviewer states that the movie \\"felt like an answer to Irvine Welsh's book Trainspotting.\\" This comparison suggests that the movie is similar to or a continuation of the themes and stories that Welsh explores in his novel, which is generally considered as a work of high quality. By associating the movie with the book, the reviewer is implying that the film exhibits the same level of complexity, emotional depth, or narrative resonance as Trainspotting. To understand better why this review is positive, it's important to give some context about the book 'Trainspotting.' Published in 1993, Trainspotting is a Scottish black comedy novel by Irvine Welsh, which follows a group of heroin addicts in the late 1980s and their adventures as they drift through life. The novel has been praised for its distinct voice, realistic approach to drug use, and the portrayal of urban decay, poverty, and disenfranchisement experienced by a lost generation of young people. Since the reviewer draws a connection between the movie and Welsh's Trainspotting, they seem to imply that the film might share similar qualities, such as strong character development, a gritty storyline, or exploration of dark yet authentic themes. By making this association, the reviewer likely appreciates these aspects in the film under consideration. Additionally, it's worth noting that the comparison to Trainspotting not only implies that the movie is of high quality but also may suggest that it speaks to a specific audience of viewers who enjoy raw, candid, and unsanitized stories that tackle uncompromising realities. Given the strong impact of Trainspotting, the reviewer's reference to the book would serve to intrigue or attract individuals who appreciate the profound themes handled in Welsh's novel. To sum up, although the review is brief and doesn't explicitly express a positive sentiment, its comparison indicates a positive opinion of the movie. The reviewer's parallel between the film and Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting suggests that the movie is engaging, thought-provoking, and shares qualities with a highly regarded novel, which could potentially pique interest among viewers who appreciate unflinching and compelling storytelling."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Begin by simplifying the equation -273*a = -7791 + 4492 - 11443. We start by simplifying the expression on the right side of the equation: Right side: -7791 + 4492 - 11443 First, let's add -7791 and 4492: -7791 + 4492 = -3299 Now, let's subtract -3299 and 11443: -3299 - 11443 = -14742 So, the simplified equation is: -273*a = -14742 2. To solve for a, we need to isolate the variable a on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -273: -273*a / -273 = -14742 / -273 Now, let's simplify the division: a = -14742 / -273 = 54 So, the value of a is: a = 54"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who built the worthless copper mines that the exclusive railroad of Colorado invested in?  In 2016, the United States is in a sustained economic depression. Industrial disasters, resource shortages, and gasoline prices at 37 per gallon have made railroads the primary mode of transportation, but even they are in disrepair. After a major accident on the Rio Norte line of the Taggart Transcontinental railroad, CEO James Taggart shirks responsibility. His sister Dagny Taggart, Vice-President in Charge of Operations, defies him by replacing the aging track with new rails made of Rearden Metal, which is claimed to be lighter yet stronger than steel. Dagny meets with its inventor, Hank Rearden, and they negotiate a deal they both admit serves their respective self-interests. Politician Wesley Mouch—nominally Rearden's lobbyist in Washington, D.C.—is part of a crowd that views heads of industry as persons who must be broken or tamed. James Taggart uses political influence to ensure that Taggart Transcontinental is designated the exclusive railroad for the state of Colorado. Dagny is confronted by Ellis Wyatt, a Colorado oil man angry to be forced to do business with Taggart Transcontinental. Dagny promises him that he will get the service he needs. Dagny encounters former lover Francisco d'Anconia, who presents a façade of a playboy grown bored with the pursuit of money. He reveals that a series of copper mines he built are worthless, costing his investors (including the Taggart railroad) millions. Rearden lives in a magnificent home with a wife and a brother who are happy to live off his effort, though they overtly disrespect it.

Wasn't the Fedorov Avtomat the first assault rifle instead of the StG 44? Determine whether the sequence an = (1^3) /(n^4) +(2^3) /(n^4) +⋯+(n^3) /(n^4) converges or diverges. If it converges, what is the limit? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Choices:  1). no;  2). yes;","output":"First, let's address the question about the Fedorov Avtomat and StG 44: The Fedorov Avtomat, designed in 1916 by Russian engineer Vladimir Grigoryevich Fedorov, can be considered a precursor to modern assault rifles, but not the first true assault rifle. The StG 44, designed by Germany during World War II, is widely considered the first proper assault rifle. The distinction lies in their technical specifications, such as the intermediate cartridge used in the StG 44. Now, let's address the second question about the sequence: We want to determine if the sequence a_n = (1^3)/(n^4) + (2^3)/(n^4) + ... + (n^3)/(n^4) converges or diverges. If it converges, we want to determine the limit. To do this, we can use the ratio test.  First, let's rewrite the sequence as a series: Σ[(k^3)/(n^4)] from k = 1 to n Now, we want to find the limit as n goes to infinity: lim(n→∞) [Σ[(k^3)/(n^4)] from k = 1 to n] = lim(n→∞) [Σ[k^3/n^4] from k = 1 to n] We can take n^4 out of the summation since it remains constant for all k: lim(n→∞) [1/n^4 * Σ[k^3] from k = 1 to n] The sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers can be expressed as: Σ[k^3]  from k = 1 to n = (n*(n + 1)/2)^2 Now we have: lim(n→∞) [1/n^4 * (n*(n + 1)/2)^2] We can simplify this and take the limit as n goes to infinity: lim(n→∞) [(n^2 * (n^2 + 2n + 1))/(4 * n^4)] lim(n→∞) [(n^4 + 2n^3 + n^2)/(4 * n^4)] As n goes to infinity, the highest power of n dominates, so we simply take the coefficients of the highest power terms: lim = 1/4 The sequence converges, and the limit is 1/4. Now, let's determine if these questions are the same. The first question is about the history and classification of firearms, specifically the Fedorov Avtomat and StG 44. The second question is a mathematical problem, determining the convergence or divergence of a particular sequence. In conclusion, the answer is: 1). no;"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer?","output":"The collision between a KLM 747 and a Pan Am 747 occurred on March 27, 1977, at Los Rodeos Airport (now known as Tenerife North Airport) on the Spanish island of Tenerife, which is part of the Canary Islands. This tragic event, known as the Tenerife Airport Disaster, remains the deadliest aviation accident in history, resulting in a total of 583 fatalities. On that day, both aircraft, the KLM Boeing 747-206B (KLM Flight 4805) and the Pan American World Airways Boeing 747-121 (Pan Am Flight 1736), were scheduled to arrive at Gran Canaria International Airport, also located in the Canary Islands. However, due to the presence of a terrorist bombing at Gran Canaria, several flights, including these two, were diverted to Los Rodeos Airport. The situation at Los Rodeos was chaotic, as the small airport struggled to accommodate multiple large aircraft, including the KLM and Pan Am 747s. While waiting for clearance to depart for Gran Canaria after the threat at their original destination had been resolved, both aircraft were instructed to backtaxi (taxi in the opposite direction of takeoff) on the only runway available at the time. The KLM 4805 moved to the start of the runway and prepared to turn around for takeoff, while the Pan Am 1736 was still taxiing on the same runway, looking for an appropriate exit to taxiway C3, that would allow it to clear the runway. The thick fog that had settled over the airport made visibility extremely low, which further exacerbated the situation. Miscommunication between the pilots, air traffic control, and the ambiguous standard phrases used at the time contributed to the confusion that led up to the disaster. The KLM 4805 commenced its takeoff roll without proper clearance from the air traffic controller, believing that it had been granted permission. At the same moment, the Pan Am 1736 was still on the runway heading towards the exit at taxiway C3. By the time the pilots of both aircraft realized their potentially catastrophic situation, it was too late. Despite attempting evasive maneuvers, the KLM 747 crashed into the top of the Pan Am 747, causing a massive explosion and fire that engulfed both planes. As a result of this tragic accident, 248 people on the KLM flight and 335 people on the Pan Am flight lost their lives. Only 61 of the Pan Am passengers and crew survived. The Tenerife Airport Disaster led to widespread changes and improvements in aviation communication and air traffic control procedures, including the implementation of standardized phrases and terminology in pilot-controller communications, and the introduction of crew resource management in order to improve decision-making and teamwork in the cockpit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The place of worship in Nome, North Dakota, was recently purchased by Craig Cobb, who tried to set up a whites-only enclave in another part of the state. The blaze was reported on Wednesday afternoon and the structure was razed by the time fire crews arrived after nearly an hour. Cobb said the fire at the former Zion Lutheran church was \\"100% arson\\". He told WDAY-TV, a Fargo-based news station, that he is offering a reward of 2,000 (Â£1,600) to anyone with any information related to the incident, which he said was a direct attack on his life. Local residents said that it appeared Cobb had not yet moved in the 108-year-old building. He says the gas and electric utilities had not been hooked up, so the fire could not have been accidental. The blaze occurred on the same day that news of the sale appeared on the front page of the Fargo Forum newspaper. The North Dakota State Fire Marshal's Office is helping with the investigation. Cobb told WDAY-TV that he is considering several options about what to do next. He says he might open a new church called \\"the President Donald J Trump Church of Rome\\", not Nome, the town located about 70 miles (112km) southwest of Fargo. Cobb is one of the best known white supremacists in North America, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups.

By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

Question: Given the background: In common everyday speech, speed of sound refers to the speed of sound waves in air. However, the speed of sound varies from substance to substance: sound travels most slowly in gases; it travels faster in liquids; and faster still in solids. For example, (as noted above), sound travels at 343 m/s in air; it travels at 1,480 m/s in water (4.3 times as fast as in air); and at 5,120 m/s in iron (about 15 times as fast as in air). In an exceptionally stiff material such as diamond, sound travels at 12,000 metres per second (27,000 mph);[1] (about 35 times as fast as in air) which is around the maximum speed that sound will travel under normal conditions.  and the situation: John and Keith are neighbors.

She has coached the U.S. since 2007, and when she says ''we'' these days she doesn't mean Sweden. ''For me, it's not Sweden. It's just a team,'' Sundhage said. ''It's a World Cup, and I hope we do very well in the World Cup so I can stay another year so I can win the Olympics again. That's all that matters.'' Avoiding Brazil could play a big part in how well the Americans do at this World Cup. Led by Marta, the five-time FIFA player of the year, the Brazilians were runners-up to the U.S. at the last two Olympics and again to Germany at the 2007 World Cup. After winning their first two games, they need only a draw against World Cup newcomer Equatorial Guinea to win Group D. The Group C runner-up, either Sweden or the U.S., has to play the Group D winner while whoever wins Group C gets the second-place team in Group D, likely Australia or Norway. ''Doesn't matter. We're prepared for whomever,'' Abby Wambach insisted. ''We can't control any of that. Right now, we're focused on Sweden. We want to get a good result against Sweden, we want to play well. That's the thing. We want to keep playing well, performing to our potential because we're going to continue to get better as the tournament goes on and hopefully we'll be, come the championship game, playing our best.'' Whether Wambach is even playing against Sweden remains in question. The striker, who is third on the all-time U.S. scoring list, is bothered by chronic tendinitis in her right Achilles and did not practice either Monday or Tuesday. Heather O'Reilly, who scored the first goal against Colombia on Saturday, also sat out practice with a sore groin. Sweden will be without captain Caroline Seger, who is suspended after picking up her second yellow card Saturday against North Korea. But Seger played down the impact of her absence. ''There is nothing new or anything that's going to surprise the U.S.,'' she said. ''We know each other very well.'' The two teams do play quite regularly, with the U.S. holding an 18-4-7 advantage, including 3-0 at the World Cup. But Sweden beat the Americans for the first time in almost seven years in January in the opener of the Four Nations tournament. The U.S. went on to win the tournament, but the defeat was one of three in a five-month span after the team had gone more than two years without losing a game. ''Of course when you beat another team, you always have good confidence,'' Sweden coach Thomas Dennerby said. ''But, it's a new game and it's a game in a (major) tournament. That is not exactly the same as a game in a training tournament. I think the U.S. will be so much better. So will the Swedish team.'' With both teams assured of spots in the quarterfinals, much of the pre-game attention has centered around Sundhage. She scored 71 goals in her 22-year international career, and remains the face of women's soccer in Sweden. Though she knows the Americans better, obviously, she had a hand in shaping Sweden's team, too, coaching some of the players on the country's youth squads from 1990 to 2001. Sundhage remains so celebrated in her home country that there were as many Swedish reporters at the U.S. practice Tuesday as there were at Sweden's. Her name was even floated as a possible coach of the men's team after it failed to qualify for the 2010 World Cup. ''Of course I know a lot about the way she wants football to be played,'' Dennerby said. ''But I don't think that's going to be a big deal in the game. We are still good friends and talk a lot when we see each other. I hope it's going to stay that way, after the game.'' What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses the upcoming match between the United States and Sweden in the first-round finale of the Women's World Cup. Despite Pia Sundhage being Sweden's greatest player and having led her native country to numerous victories, she has been coaching the U.S. team since 2007 and has no split loyalties. Both teams have secured spots in the quarterfinals, and the United States needs only a tie to win Group C and potentially avoid a matchup with Brazil in the next round. The two teams have a long history of playing against each other, with the U.S. having an 18-4-7 advantage, including a 3-0 record at the World Cup. However, Sweden beat the U.S. for the first time in almost seven years in January during the Four Nations tournament. The match has drawn attention to Sundhage, who remains celebrated in her home country and coached some of the Swedish players on youth squads from 1990 to 2001."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: We send our children to school to prepare them for the time when they will be big and will have to work for themselves.They learn their own language so that they will be able to tell others clearly what they want and what they know,and understand what others tell them.They learn foreign languages in order to be able to understand the people from other countries and make themselves understood.They learn history to know something about human beings they meet every day.What they learn at school is,of course,quite useful,but is that the only reason  why they go to school? No.There is more in education than just learning facts.We go to school,above all,to learn how to learn,so that when we have left school,we can continue to learn.A man who really knows how to learn will always be successful,because whenever he has to do something new,he will quickly teach himself how to do it in the best way.The uneducated person,on the other hand,is either unable to do something new,or does it badly.So the purpose of school is not just to teach the students these useful subjects but teach the way to learn. Question: The main idea of the text is that  _  .

The overall objectives include investigating Mars' habitability, studying its climate and geology, and collecting data for a manned mission to Mars. The rover carries a variety of scientific instruments designed by an international team.  - Arizona State University (commonly referred to as ASU or Arizona State) is a public metropolitan research university on five campuses across the Phoenix, Arizona, metropolitan area, and four regional learning centers throughout Arizona. The 2016 university ratings by \\"U.S. News & World Report\\" rank ASU No. 1 among the Most Innovative Schools in America for the second year in a row.  - Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole.  - Physical cosmology is the study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the Universe and is concerned with fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate. Cosmology as a science originated with the Copernican principle, which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on Earth, and Newtonian mechanics, which first allowed us to understand those physical laws. Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond our own Milky Way; then, work by Vesto Slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding. These advances made it possible to speculate about the origin of the universe, and allowed the establishment of the Big Bang Theory, by Georges Lemaitre, as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful of alternative cosmologies; however, most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory explains the observations better.  - Louis Dill Friedman (born July 7, 1941) is an American astronautics engineer and space spokesperson. He was born in New York and raised in the Bronx. Dr. Friedman was a co-founder of The Planetary Society with Carl Sagan and Bruce C. Murray.  - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.  - Lockheed Martin is an American global aerospace, defense, security and advanced technologies company with worldwide interests. It was formed by the merger of Lockheed Corporation with Martin Marietta in March 1995. It is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, in the Washington, DC, area. Lockheed Martin employs 126,000 people worldwide. Marillyn Hewson is the current President and Chief Executive Officer.  - James ( Jim ) F.

Dr. Bell 's active research has involved the NASA Mars Pathfinder , Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous ( NEAR ) , Comet Nucleus Tour ( CONTOUR ) , 2001 Mars Odyssey , Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter , and the Mars Science Laboratory missions . His book Postcards from Mars includes many images taken by the Mars rovers . Dr. Bell is currently an editor of the space science journal Icarus and president of The Planetary Society . He has served as the lead scientist in charge of the Panoramic camera ( Pancam ) color imaging system on Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity .  - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.  - The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is a federally funded research and development center and NASA field center located in La Cañada Flintridge, California and Pasadena, California, United States.  - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.  - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.  - Mars Pathfinder (MESUR Pathfinder) is an American robotic spacecraft that landed a base station with a roving probe on Mars in 1997. It consisted of a lander, renamed the Carl Sagan Memorial Station, and a lightweight (10.6 kg/23 lb) wheeled robotic Mars rover named \\"Sojourner\\", which became the first rover to operate outside  the Earth-Moon system.  - Arizona (O'odham: \\"Al onak\\" [ai onak]) is a state in the southwestern region of the United States. It is also part of the Western United States and the Mountain West states. It is the sixth largest and the 14th most populous of the 50 states. Its capital and largest city is Phoenix. Arizona is one of the Four Corners states. It has borders with New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, California, and Mexico, and one point in common with the southwestern corner of Colorado. Arizona's border with Mexico is 389 miles (626 km) long, on the northern border of the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California.  - A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to evolve gasses, a process called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.  - A robot is a machineespecially one programmable by a computercapable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. Robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within. Robots may be constructed to take on human form but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with no regard to how they look.  - The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA ) is an independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government responsible for the civilian space program as well as aeronautics and aerospace research.  - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances.  - Aeronautics (from the ancient Greek words  \\"r\\", which means \\"air\\", and  \\"nautik\\" which means \\"navigation\\", i.e. \\"navigation into the air\\") is the science or art involved with the study, design, and manufacturing of air flight capable machines, and the techniques of operating aircraft and rockets within the atmosphere. The British Royal Aeronautical Society identifies the aspects of \\"aeronautical Art, Science and Engineering\\" and \\"the profession of Aeronautics (which expression includes Astronautics).\\"   - Aerospace is the human effort in science, engineering and business to fly in the atmosphere of Earth (aeronautics) and surrounding space (astronautics). Aerospace organisations research, design, manufacture, operate, or maintain aircraft and/or spacecraft. Aerospace activity is very diverse, with a multitude of commercial, industrial and military applications.  - The Planetary Society is an American internationally active non-governmental, nonprofit foundation. It is involved in research, public outreach, and political advocacy for engineering projects related to astronomy, planetary science, and space exploration. It was founded in 1980 by Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Louis Friedman, and has over 40,000 members from more than one hundred countries around the world.  - Carl Edward Sagan (November 9, 1934  December 20, 1996) was an American astronomer, cosmologist, astrophysicist, astrobiologist, author, science popularizer, and science communicator in astronomy and other natural sciences. He is best known for his work as a science popularizer and communicator. His best known scientific contribution is research on extraterrestrial life, including experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids from basic chemicals by radiation. Sagan assembled the first physical messages sent into space: the Pioneer plaque and the Voyager Golden Record, universal messages that could potentially be understood by any extraterrestrial intelligence that might find them. Sagan argued the now accepted hypothesis that the high surface temperatures of Venus can be attributed to and calculated using the greenhouse effect.  - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion.  - Sir Arthur Charles Clarke, CBE, FRAS (16 December 1917  19 March 2008) was a British science fiction writer, science writer and futurist, inventor, undersea explorer, and television series host.  - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking.   - Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) is a multipurpose spacecraft designed to conduct reconnaissance and exploration of Mars from orbit. The spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin under the supervision of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The mission is managed by the California Institute of Technology, at the JPL, in La Cañada Flintridge, California, for the NASA Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. It was launched August 12, 2005, and attained Martian orbit on March 10, 2006. In November 2006, after five months of aerobraking, it entered its final science orbit and began its primary science phase. As MRO entered orbit, it joined five other active spacecraft that were either in orbit or on the planet's surface: \\"Mars Global Surveyor\\", \\"Mars Express\\", \\"2001 Mars Odyssey\\", and the two Mars Exploration Rovers (\\"Spirit\\" and \\"Opportunity\\"); at the time, this set a record for the most operational spacecraft in the immediate vicinity of Mars. \\"Mars Global Surveyor\\" and the \\"Spirit\\" rover have since ceased to function; the remainder remain operational as of September 2016.  - A robotic spacecraft is an uncrewed spacecraft, usually under telerobotic control. A robotic spacecraft designed to make scientific research measurements is often called a space probe. Many space missions are more suited to telerobotic rather than crewed operation, due to lower cost and lower risk factors. In addition, some planetary destinations such as Venus or the vicinity of Jupiter are too hostile for human survival, given current technology. Outer planets such as Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are too distant to reach with current crewed spaceflight technology, so telerobotic probes are the only way to explore them.  - Natural science is a branch of science concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of natural phenomena, based on observational and empirical evidence. Mechanisms such as peer review and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances.  - In physics, a wave is an oscillation accompanied by a transfer of energy that travels through a medium (space or mass). Frequency refers to the addition of time. \\"Wave motion\\" transfers energy from one point to another, which displace particles of the transmission mediumthat is, with little or no associated mass transport. Waves consist, instead, of oscillations or vibrations (of a physical quantity), around almost fixed locations.  - 2001 Mars Odyssey is a robotic spacecraft orbiting the planet Mars. The project was developed by NASA, and contracted out to Lockheed Martin, with an expected cost for the entire mission of US297 million. Its mission is to use spectrometers and a thermal imager to detect evidence of past or present water and ice, as well as study the planet's geology and radiation environment. It is hoped that the data Odyssey obtains will help answer the question of whether life has ever existed on Mars and create a risk-assessment of the radiation future astronauts on Mars might experience. It also acts as a relay for communications between the Mars Exploration Rovers, Mars Science Laboratory, and previously the Phoenix lander to Earth. The mission was named as a tribute to Arthur C. Clarke, evoking the name of \\"\\".    What object entity has the relation of 'occupation' with the subject 'james f. bell'?

Read this and answer the question The first scientific and literary journals were established during the Enlightenment. The first journal, the Parisian Journal des Sçavans, appeared in 1665. However, it was not until 1682 that periodicals began to be more widely produced. French and Latin were the dominant languages of publication, but there was also a steady demand for material in German and Dutch. There was generally low demand for English publications on the Continent, which was echoed by England's similar lack of desire for French works. Languages commanding less of an international market – such as Danish, Spanish and Portuguese – found journal success more difficult, and more often than not, a more international language was used instead. French slowly took over Latin's status as the lingua franca of learned circles. This in turn gave precedence to the publishing industry in Holland, where the vast majority of these French language periodicals were produced.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Request donations for things like running your website, using print media, and hosting educational events. You can put a donation area on your website and ask for donations at events to help increase the reach of your campaign.  It helps put people's minds at ease if you set up a nonprofit organization. However, you might not be at that stage yet. If you get money from donations, consider doing a mail-out campaign. Once you start making a name for yourself, you can ask to speak at local events. Many companies and organizations are happy to have occasional speakers, so call around to organizations you think would be relevant. That is, know who you're presenting your message to and how they may or may not perceive it. For instance, if you're creating a campaign for better education in local schools, your message to a group of teachers is going to be different than your message to the general public or local officials. Think about each group you're going to be presenting your message to.  If you know a group will support you, keep your message brief, such as explaining your main goals and asking for support. Be specific--and creative--about the range of things they can do, looking for what is easy or fulfilling. If your asking them to pass the message on to others, share arguments they can use as well as materials, web-links, etc. If the group you're presenting your message to is neutral or even antagonistic towards your message, you'll need to actually present an argument about why they should support your organization. Ask local experts to speak about your cause, and host the event. Check with local businesses, your local library, your school, or even your company to see if they're willing to host speakers. Since education is one of your primary goals, using experts to speak about the issue can only help. Know that donations will only take you so far. At some point, you're going to have to raise money yourself. Host events that both raise awareness of the cause and raise money. You can draw on your group of supporters to volunteer and run the event. For instance, if you're raising money for education, consider running a lock-in at the school for kids and parents. You could have games, food, and movies. Charge a small fee at the door, and sell tickets for some games and food. You can use all forms of media to promote events.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: I had the meanest mother in the whole world. While other kids ate candy for breakfast, I had to have cereal, eggs or toast. While others had Cokes and candy for lunch, I had to eat a sandwich. As you can guess, my supper was different from the other kids' too. But at least, I wasn't alone in my sufferings. My sister and two brothers had the same mean mother as I did. My mother insisted upon knowing where we were at all times. She had to know who our friends were and where we were going. She insisted if we said we'd be gone an hour, then we should be gone one hour or less -- not one hour and one minute. And she always insisted upon us telling the truth. Now you can see how mean she was. The worst is yet to come. We had to be in bed by nine each night and up at eight the next morning. We couldn't sleep till noon like our friends. So while they slept - my mother actually had the courage to break the Child Labor Law. She made us work. We had to wash dishes, make beds, and learn to cook. We had to wear clean clothes and take a bath every day. The other kids always wore their clothes for days. We reached the height of disgrace because she made our clothes herself, just to save money. I believe she laid awake at night thinking up mean things to do to us. Through the years, things didn't improve a bit. We could not lie in bed \\"sick\\" like our friends did, and miss school. Our marks in school had to live up to expectations. Our friends' report cards had beautiful colors on them, black for passing, red for failing. My mother, being as different as she was, would be satisfied with nothing less than ugly black marks. As the years rolled by, first one and then the other of us was put to shame. We graduated from high school. With our mother behind us, talking, hitting and demanding respect, none of us was allowed the pleasure of being a drop-out. My mother was a complete failure as a mother. Out of four children, a couple of us attained some higher education. None of us have ever been arrested or divorced. Each of my...

Paragraph: In short, the United States has to help defeat an ideology, not just a group of people, and we must do so under difficult circumstances. How can the United States and its friends help moderate Muslims combat the extremist ideas? Recommendation: The U.S. government must define what the message is, what it stands for. We should offer an example of moral leadership in the world, committed to treat people humanely, abide by the rule of law, and be generous and caring to our neighbors. America and Muslim friends can agree on respect for human dignity and opportunity. To Muslim parents, terrorists like  Bin Laden have nothing to offer their children but visions of violence and death. America and its friends have a crucial advantage-we can offer these parents a vision that might give their children a better future. If we heed the views of thoughtful leaders in the Arab and Muslim world, a moderate consensus can be found. That vision of the future should stress life over death: individual educational and economic opportunity. This vision includes widespread political participation and contempt for indiscriminate violence. It includes respect for the rule of law, openness in discussing differences, and tolerance for opposing points of view. Recommendation: Where Muslim governments, even those who are friends, do not respect these principles, the United States must stand for a better future. One of the lessons of the long Cold War was that short-term gains in cooperating with the most repressive and brutal governments were too often outweighed by long-term setbacks for America's stature and interests. American foreign policy is part of the message. America's policy choices have consequences. Right or wrong, it is simply a fact that American policy regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and American actions in Iraq are dominant staples of popular commentary across the Arab and Muslim world. That does not mean U.S. choices have been wrong. It means those choices must be integrated with America's message of opportunity to the Arab and Muslim world.

(Photo: Scott Eklund, Red Box Pictures, for USA TODAY) Story Highlights \\"I really, really want this to not be just about what happened to me.\\"      On the Kercher family: \\"I've always been afraid of just upsetting them.\\"      \\"I had nightmares. I had panic attacks.\\"      Excerpts from Amanda Knox's interview with USA TODAY's Susan Page about why she wrote her book, Waiting to be Heard, what could bring her closure and how she's been changed by her sensational murder trial and four years in an Italian prison.      On hoping her book will convince readers she is innocent: 'I am living in this world'      \\"I am living in this world, and if this world already has a certain prejudice of me and an idea of me, then it's really hard for me to go through it. An example of that is simply how people would confront me in prison. ... Most people came to the prison already thinking they knew who I was, and that changed the way I could ever interact with them. So I want to challenge those sorts of perceptions of me that are incorrect. ...      \\"And it does hurt a lot to have people think that that's me and that's what, that's the kind of person I am. It doesn't affect me in the day to day. I haven't had people come up and threaten me or denounce me. But it does affect me — me, and the peace that I have inside. And I think that a lot of people in my family feel like: Don't admit that. Don't admit that because they'll just do it more ... the people who won't give up on the things that the prosecution claims and continues to claim no matter how their theory has fallen apart and imploded upon itself. And so it does affect me. ...      \\"I've wanted, really, to share what I think is valuable about the experience and could be helpful to other people in just confronting really difficult situations and the fact of expressing an experience and someone can recognize some form of that inside themselves. I mean, prison is a classic metaphor. It just happened to be literal. ...      \\"I really, really want this to not be just about what happened to me, but about what one can do in a bad place. And I'd love for it to open a discussion about some of the problems that surrounded my case — for instance, the idea of a public identity. The idea of trying to find the familiar in the completely unfamiliar. This existential crisis of things happening to you that you don't understand.\\"      KNOX: 'I have a life that I want to live'      COURTS: Legal case against Amanda Knox not closed      WISH LIST: What Amanda Knox wrote in her journal      BOOK LIST: Various takes on the Amanda Knox case      TIMELINE: Key moments in the case      On wanting to visit Meredith's grave: 'I wasn't allowed to grieve'      \\"I really hope that the Kerchers (parents of her slain roommate, Meredith) read my book. And they don't have to believe me. I have no right to demand anything of anyone. But I hope they try.\\"      (Have you contacted them?)      \\"It's really hard. I've always been afraid of just upsetting them. And I feel like as long as there's question of my involvement in Meredith's death, I don't want to impose myself on them. And I really think that, at least from what I've read, that nothing I could say would make them feel better. ...      \\"I mean, the ideal situation in my mind is that they could show me Meredith's grave. Because it was like, I wasn't allowed to grieve, either. And that, that would mean a lot to me. But you know what? It's all about what means to them. And if that never happens, then, then that's OK. Because ultimately it's about them. ...      \\"This trial (ordered by the Italian Supreme Court last month) has been a barrier to that. It's this, this, this field of barbed wire that I'm having to crawl through so I can finally get to the side where, 'OK, we're finally on the same side!' And I can't hail at them when I'm in the middle of the barbed wire.\\"      On considering suicide in prison: 'The thing that I was scared of'      \\"I have a great amount of respect for life, and I always think that, no matter how bad situations get, you can always make something out of it. You can always do something that can make you feel good about your life despite what you're going through. So for me to arrive at the mind-set that there was nothing good that could come out of my life and nothing good that I could make of it — because it's not about what you get, it's about what you are able to make of what you get — and so to ever come to that point is really, it's not about an intellectual failing. It's about an emotional failing.      \\"Really, like, to get to that point I think you just have to be so, so sad that you don't even want to try. And that is the thing that I was scared of: That I knew that I would know intellectually that there's something to glean out of life but that I would be so broken that I wouldn't care. I just wouldn't want to fight any more. It's not worth it to me.      \\"But there's always the fact that I'm not alone. No matter how alone I am in the prison, I have a family to think about. And so I think that it would have to be a really, really, really, really drastic situation for me to go and do that. ... But I did write it down (as a possibility) because it was something that I thought about a lot.\\"      Amanda Knox attends an appeal hearing at Perugia's Court of Appeal on Sept. 5, 2011. Her 2009 conviction in her roommate's murder would be overturned the next month. (Photo: FIle photo by Giuseppe Bellini, Getty Images)      On adjusting to home: 'I had nightmares'      \\"I had nightmares. I had panic attacks. I had all of those. There were times when I'd just be walking down the street and I'd see someone who immediately in my mind triggered what I was afraid of in prison. They might not even look remotely like them, but it's just this this panic, this panic instinct that had been ingrained in me. Or this instinct of, I'm alone. Like, everyone around me is potentially against me and so I'm alone, and so there's this tense survival instinct that is hard to get out of.      \\"And indeed my mom, all my friends and ... my family were worried that I was suffering from post-traumatic stress. I kept thinking I was fine. I kept telling myself: 'I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. It's not too bad. It's just residual thing. it's OK.'      \\"They recommended once that I see a counselor. Again, one of those residual reasons why it's so difficult coming back. But I went to this counselor, and he was very nice. Not at all invasive. Just sat back and said, 'Talk to me about anything you want. It doesn't even have to be what you went through. Just talk to me about anything you want.'      \\"And I started talking about the here and now, about the things that I went through, just the things that I was struggling with. Like I was disappointing the people I loved because I wasn't the same person anymore. And I worried and I feared that I disappointing them by not coming back quite the same. And in the process of talking about this very hesitantly — it was a very slow thing, and then all of a sudden it just crashed. I crashed in on myself. And I had to stop, and I was weeping uncontrollably and I just had to leave. I just felt that I was trapped, and I just had to leave, and I called my boyfriend. He picked me up. And then I went home and cried a lot. ... And I never went back.\\"      On becoming a different person: 'A gravity to everything'      \\"So I went to Perugia very carefree, hopeful, and also, I needed to gain a sense of self-confidence in myself, because I was still young and I was still figuring out who I was and what I wanted to do with my life. So that was something that very much characterized me and my personality at the time. So I'm a little unsure about everything. I'm just a kid who's, who's, who's doing the best I can.      \\"And coming out of it, I'd say I've gained that sense of confidence in myself that I hadn't had before. I've gained a seriousness that has to do with a certain perspective, a gratitude for being able to see the importance of things. And that lends itself a gravity to everything. And that is something that I sort of carry as a weight but a good weight inside of me.      \\"And I guess the only thing that maybe is not as great, I'm much more timid than before about being around people. If only before, believe it or not, the one thing I wasn't self-conscious about was being around people and feeling good about being around people, and 'Who are you; who are you?' And 'I am me, I am me.'      And now I'm much more self-conscious when I'm around people, because there's the factor that maybe they know who I am. But more than that I know what it is to have been judged, and how devastating that is. And that has sort of stuck with me in a way that I wouldn't like it to. I'd like to be able to be a little looser, if I could. But I'm still a little tense. And I hope that that will relieve itself in time. And it definitely has gotten better over this year and a half that I've been back. Because when I got back, in the immediacy I really struggled.      \\"I wasn't used to talking to anyone for more than an hour at a time, twice a week. And it was just very hard for me to relate to people because I was so used to being trapped inside. So this sort of slow creeping out from that — I feel like I'm a snail that has really retreated back in that (shell), so slowly coming back out.\\"      On returning to Italy for the retrial: 'I'm thinking about a lot'      \\"My lawyers have said that I don't have to and that I don't need to. I'm still considering it, to be honest. My family is like, No! Tina (Andreadis, her book publicist) is like, No! But I've thought about it, because it's not like I feel I'm far away from it. And so I could — I'd go back just to show that it means something to me.      \\"But that's something I really have to think very hard about. So I can't say for sure if I am or I'm not. But it is something that I'm thinking about a lot. And it's scary, the thought. But it's also important for me to say, this is not just happening far away from me and doesn't matter to me. So somehow I feel it's important for me to convey that. And if my presence is what is necessary to convey that, then I'll go. But I want to see what that involves. ...      \\"If that were a huge risk, then I wouldn't. I'm not that proud, and I'm not that brave.\\"      At home in a coffee shop in Seattle, Knox knows there are those who will never believe she is innocent, including her former roommate's family. (Photo: Scott Eklund, Red Box Pictures, for USA TODAY)      On learning about the media frenzy that had surrounded her case: 'I didn't know'      \\"So there were photographers (at the court hearings). And there was my family, the media things they were doing. And there was the very fact that I was in the media affected the way that people in prison treated me. And there was all that and yet I had no idea what extent it could be. Because it's an experience that is completely foreign to me. It's not like I ever got any attention from the media in my life beforehand, so I didn't have anything to compare it to. . . .      \\"The media is an incredibly powerful network and a machine that just chugs and there are so many different elements of it and so many different levels of it, and I had no idea. I had no idea about the media. I didn't know enough about the media to conceive what it would be like. And so, to this day, I'd say I don't even have a full understanding of the media and how it's played – like what every aspect of the media has done. There are always things that surprise me. . . .      \\"No, I didn't know, and I did not expect the helicopters when I got back home to the airport and I did not expect the paparazzi who were ferociously chasing us through red lights and snapping pictures in our faces going: 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry' – and no, you're really not sorry. If you were you would stop doing it.      \\"So it's this huge thing that is so powerful and I'm only learning now really how big it is and what it is. Because as I was writing my book I was focused on that and I didn't want to be influenced by other things. I really wanted to be true to what I had experienced before. And I was so, so careful. And I also just couldn't deal with it for the longest time. I just couldn't. I couldn't watch things that were about me and my case, I just couldn't. I just couldn't. But now I'm able to.\\"      On coping: 'I was lost'      \\"One of the things that I somewhat realized, especially right after I was convicted, was that sometimes really, really horrible things happen for no reason. . . I'm not Nelson Mandela. I'm not a Holocuast survivor or non-survivor. I'm not. But sometimes bad things really do just happen, and people are wrong about things, and that is so true about humanity, and for that reason — I was sad about it. I was angry about it. I was desperate. I was lost — like I didn't know how to understand that that could be me, that I could be a small, small speck in that spectrum of, like, crap. . . .      \\"It's still this struggle that I cry about and I get angry about when I'm alone, and that is frustrating and that's incomprehensible in a lot of ways. But at the moment, being angry about it and being sad about it, again, doesn't help me. So I have to really just try to be patient enough to work my way through it.\\" ||||| In a medieval college town in Italy, two young women, Meredith Kercher and Amanda Knox, arrived for a year abroad, seeking new horizons.

He didn't know who sent him that surprisingly enigmatic message. And he doesn't know to this day. A pity, because thanks to that person he reached his current status and number 67 on the list of the wealthiest Poles. Back then, during that beautiful, rusty white Christmas Eve night, Przekosniak, who was rudely kicked out from a social network for utopian fanatics of extreme phobias (www.ilovefobia.pl) just a few days earlier, got an idea. It was a quite good idea too, and the next SMS (\\"All at cart by unintentionally only honest lamb\\") convinced him it was the best idea of his life. Slawek Przekosniak, together with a friend from ilovefobia.pl - Czesiek Ciag, decided to set up an on-line service, through which one could send SMS greetings to mobile phones. And the most important feature of the service was that texts of the wishes were not going to be predetermined and there would be no set list of pre-selected options. Messages would be created by a special software program from random words provided by a customer. Such a system would allow for truly unique greetings, and after all, nobody said they had to be comprehensible. Czesiek took care of the development of the software, which for now they named \\"John of the Disc\\". Czesiek had suitable experience in the matter. While on the forum for (select as appropriate) phobics he designed an application, which created slogans for street protests. The application, even though it produced phrases completely illogical and nonsensical, became quite popular, and some of its most unique catchphrases you could have seen on TV - \\"Out With There Harm Out!\\" or \\"To Them Bag Away Now Now!\\" Two future men of success got to work and the SMS greeting portal bestbestbest.pl went live just before Easter.

They also started studying Venus' atmosphere. They were fascinated by the subject and learned a lot. Team A studied Earth, team B studied planet Venus.  Hint: Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury.

She has moved into an apartment after living in a house built next to a scenic lake in a secluded countryside area. She writes a letter to the next tenant asking that they forward any mail, and that the paw prints and the box in the attic have always been there. The tenant Alex Wyler reads the letter, but finds no paw prints, no box and no sign of life within the last 5 years, so disregards the letter until a few days later when he is redoing the paint on the handrails and a stray dog, whom Alex takes in and names Jack although the dog is female, trots through the brown paint and leaves its paw prints all the way to the front door. He writes to Kate asking more about these incidents and leaves the letter in the mail box.On Valentine's Day 2006, Kate visits the Lake House after having a gentleman die in her arms after being hit by a bus, but finds the Mail Box Flag is up. She reads Alex's letter and states her current address, also stating it is 2006, not 2004 from which Alex's letter arrives from. Alex attends her 'current address' but finds a construction site that won't be finished for another 18 months, and they both slowly realize they are communicating from two years apart, with only the Mailbox to communicate from.As Kate and Alex continue to correspond through the mailbox, they find themselves falling in love. Because Kate is in the future, she can tell Alex specific places to look for her in 2004. On one occasion, she asks Alex to bring her back something important (a gift from her father; her favorite novel by Jane Austen called Persuasion), which she left two years ago during a train station meeting with her then-beau, Morgan. Alex goes to the station and finds the item and sees Kate with long hair. Even though he has the item, he does not place it in the mailbox to return it to her. Instead, he says that he will return it to her personally, \\"one way or the other.\\" Alex sends her a personalized map of Chicago and takes her on a walking tour...

The premise is: \\"The pretty hillside town of Villefranche-sur-Mer is a good base for exploring the area, particularly for families with children.\\" The hypothesis is: \\"There are many museums and performances specifically for little kids in Villefranche-sur-Mer.\\" Step 2: Examine the premise and its relation to the hypothesis. The premise tells us that Villefranche-sur-Mer is a town suitable for families with children to explore the area. It is important to consider what factors may make a location suitable for families with children. Step 3: Analyze if the premise entails the hypothesis. While the suitability of a location for families with children may include factors like safety and comfort, it doesn't necessarily mean there are many museums and performances specifically for little kids. A town being a good base for exploring the surrounding area could be attributed to factors such as its central location, easy transportation, affordability, or various family-friendly activities and amenities. Step 4: Conclusion. The premise \\"The pretty hillside town of Villefranche-sur-Mer is a good base for exploring the area, particularly for families with children,\\" does not entail the hypothesis \\"There are many museums and performances specifically for little kids in Villefranche-sur-Mer.\\" It is possible that the town is an excellent base for families with children for various reasons, but that doesn't guarantee the presence of many museums and performances specifically designed for little kids."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey","output":"The phrase 's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey' would generally be considered negative in sentiment. This interpretation is based on a few key points: 1. The use of \\"sad\\": The word \\"sad\\" usually conveys a negative emotion, signaling something unfortunate or disappointing. In this phrase, the speaker expresses that it is sad how much effort people put into the subject of discussion. 2. \\"So many people\\": This phrase implies that the issue being discussed is widespread and applies to a large number of people, contributing to a sense of negativity due to the collective effort being expended. 3. \\"So much time and energy\\": This part of the phrase highlights the considerable amount of effort devoted to the subject. Indicating that this is an issue worth analyzing because of its impact on people's time and energy. 4. \\"This turkey\\": The term \\"turkey\\" in this context is used informally as slang to refer to something that is thought to be a failure, unsuccessful, or of poor quality. Calling the subject a turkey showcases the speaker's negative opinion of it. Putting all the components together, the phrase communicates that the speaker finds it regretful that a large number of people have invested a significant amount of time and energy into something they consider to be a failure or of low quality.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the date Halo 3's soundtrack was released? , can you please find it?   Martin O'Donnell confirmed Halo 3's soundtrack would see a commercial release in a Bungie podcast. O'Donnell also stressed that the soundtrack would not be released at or near the release date of the game on September 25, 2007. The soundtrack was officially announced on October 17, 2007. The score to the game was used extensively for marketing purposes, even before the release of the game. The first piece heard was entitled \\"Finish the Fight\\", and was used in the announcement trailer for Halo 3 at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2006. This piece was accented with O'Donnell's well-known Halo theme, which now included a trumpet fanfare and heavy brass section; O'Donnell stated \\"I want the viewer to have a feeling of anticipation and wonder for the first fifty seconds or so, up until Master Chief is revealed and they realize that it's Cortana trying to tell them something.\\" The track opens with a piano section written by Matt Daspit, uncharacteristic for the series at that point; O'Donnell suspected \\"no [other announcement at E3] would start with a piano\\", thus grabbing attention. O'Donnell designed the opening to lull the listener into a sense of suspense, then wonder; \\"I want them to feel pride and longing the moment Master Chief walks out of the smoke.\\" he said. \\"I want them to be left with that, 'I can hardly wait to play this game' feeling\\". Another reworked theme from Halo was used as the background music for the Halo 3 E3 2007 trailer; O'Donnell later offered this track for free online.In addition to the music composed by O'Donnell and Salvatori, the announcement of the Halo 3 Soundtrack was followed with a call for entries to all artists or bands to submit their own original song to be included on the final CD. The submissions were judged by O'Donnell, producer Nile Rodgers, and other artists including Steve Vai.

Q:Process:  - Oil is gathered through mining operations - The oil is transported to stores - Oil is purchased by homeowners - Oil is placed into a stove in the house - The oil is lit on fire, and burns for a long time - The warm air off of the oil travels through the house -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the price of oil increases happens, how will it affect more oil is available.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"If the price of oil increases, it may lead to multiple direct and indirect effects on the process mentioned. Here's how it could potentially affect the process: 1. Oil gathering and mining operations: An increase in the price of oil may encourage more companies to invest in oil exploration and extraction, leading to a potential increase in available oil. However, this might not be guaranteed, as factors like operational costs, regulations, and available resources also play a significant role in oil production. 2. Transport to stores: Higher oil prices may result in increased transportation costs (as fuel prices can be linked to oil prices), which in turn could affect the supply chain and overall pricing of oil to the end consumer. 3. Oil purchasing by homeowners: If oil prices continue to rise, homeowners might consider alternative heating options (like natural gas or electric heating systems) or becoming more energy-efficient to reduce their dependency on oil. This could lead to a decrease in demand for oil. 4. Oil usage in the house: Higher oil prices may lead to more conservative use of oil in households, with homeowners potentially using less oil or using it more efficiently to keep their heating costs under control. 5. Warm air distribution: The efficiency of the heat distribution process within the house may not be directly impacted by the higher oil prices, but indirectly, homeowners could invest in better insulation or heating systems to reduce oil consumption. In summary, the perturbation of increased oil prices can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of using oil for heating at home. It may potentially increase the oil availability by encouraging more oil production, but it will also likely lead to a decrease in demand as homeowners search for alternative heating options or ways to use oil more efficiently. This effect on the demand could ultimately impact the overall oil consumption and process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Roku Stick — Resembles a flash drive (memory stick). Comes with at least one power cable. All HDTVs have at least one HDMI port; the HDMI port resembles a trapezoid, and can often be found on the back of the TV (though some TVs have the HDMI port(s) on the side). Depending on your Roku type, this process will vary slightly:   Roku Player — Plug one end of the HDMI cable into the back of the Roku Player's box, then plug the other end into the HDMI port on the back or side of your TV.  Roku Stick — Plug the HDMI connector on the end of your Roku Stick into the HDMI port on the back or side of your TV. Most HDTVs have more than one HDMI port. If your TV doesn't have an HDMI port, you cannot use a Roku Stick with your TV; you may be able to buy an HDMI to Component adapter if your TV has component (e.g., red, white, and yellow) ports. On TVs which have more than one HDMI port, you'll see a number next to the port into which you plugged the Roku. This number may be written as \\"HDMI 1\\", HDMI 2\\", and so on. Your TV may also just have the ports labeled with individual numbers (e.g., \\"1\\", \\"2\\", etc.). Both the Roku Player and the Roku Stick require connection to a power source (e.g., an electrical outlet):   Roku Player — Plug one end of the included power cable into the back of the player box, then plug the other end into an electrical outlet.  Streaming Stick (model 3800 and down) — Plug one end of the included power cable into the back of the stick, then plug the other end into an electrical outlet.

Many aspects of this vibrant industry continue to captivate audiences worldwide, one of them being its ability to effortlessly juggle between comedy, romance, and tragedy. In a recent statement, Oscar-winning director Oliver Stone expressed his affection for the Indian cinema, praising its ability to transition between contrasting themes simultaneously. Stone, known for his thought-provoking movies such as \\"Platoon,\\" \\"Born on the Fourth of July,\\" and \\"Wall Street,\\" applauds the ability of Indian movies to seamlessly thread together various storylines and emotional arcs. In this article, we will delve into why the Indian film industry excels in this particular aspect and how it has managed to create its unique identity on the global stage. The Roots of Indian Cinema's Versatility As the birthplace of cinema legends like Satyajit Ray, Guru Dutt, and Raj Kapoor, Indian cinema's foundation is rooted in the works of many visionary directors who have contributed to its growth and evolution. Their vision was to celebrate the myriad shades of human emotions, from humor, joy, and love to sadness, sorrow, and despair. Indian cinema is reflective of the diversity and intricacies of the Indian culture. The country's rich heritage and history have also shaped its storytelling mechanisms, embracing mythology, folklore, and epics to create cinematic masterpieces, transcending the boundaries of time and genres. This intrinsic connection between history, culture, and storytelling makes Indian cinema more than just entertainment; it's a representation of the Indian ethos. The Art of Emotional Storytelling One of the most striking aspects of Indian cinema is its ability to immerse viewers into an emotional, often melodramatic journey that stays with them long after the movie has ended. This is made possible by seamlessly transitioning between genres, particularly comedy, romance, and tragedy, which helps the audience identify as well as empathize with the characters. Indian filmmakers and writers weave emotions into a tapestry of interconnected lives and events, making for compelling narratives that resonate with diverse audiences. Moreover, the subtleness and poise of situational comedy in Indian movies are utterly relatable, endearing viewers of different backgrounds to the films. Music as the Binding Force In Indian cinema, music plays an integral role in expressing the emotions and themes of a movie. With powerful scores, lyrical depth, and soulful melodies, it is not uncommon for music to guide the transition between genres. Indian filmmakers rely on music and dance to build a bridge between joy and sorrow, allowing viewers to delve into the protagonist's world. Iconic songs from classic Indian movies, like the ones in \\"Mughal-e-Azam\\" and \\"Sholay,\\" have left an everlasting impact on popular culture and continue to be celebrated as magnificent pieces of art. Undoubtedly, music remains an essential key that unlocks the charm of Indian cinema. Finding a Global Audience Given the versatility and emotional depth that Indian movies offer, it's no surprise that the global arena has also embraced the enchanting world of Bollywood and regional cinema. Collaborations between Hollywood and Indian filmmakers have led to an increased interest in the latter's vibrant storytelling techniques and daring experiments with genres. The international reach and success of movies like \\"Slumdog Millionaire,\\" \\"Lion,\\" and \\"Life of Pi\\" only go to show the formidable power of stories originating from the heart of India. Conclusion Indian cinema, with its unique ability to seamlessly transition between genres like comedy, romance, and tragedy, has managed to carve a distinct space for itself on the international stage. Praised by renowned filmmakers like Oliver Stone, it is evident that the rich and diverse Indian storytelling mechanisms continue to resonate and captivate audiences worldwide. By embracing traditions and culture while pushing boundaries with innovative narratives, Indian cinema serves as an inspiration to filmmakers globally. With its ever-evolving nature, we can only imagine what new offerings lie ahead in this alluring world of Indian cinema."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person Holly was asked to check on? from the following article ?  In Santa Monica, California, a pair of Mormon missionaries—by-the-book Elder Farrell, and his soon-to-leave companion, Elder Lozano (Ignacio Serricchio)—proselytize until they are caught between a gang drive-by shooting targeting nearby thugs. The shootout kills one thug and wounds another, Carl, whom Elder Lozano saves. After being released from the hospital, Carl tracks down the two missionaries, thanking Lozano for saving his life, who gives Carl a Book of Mormon.  Later, the missionaries notice an unconscious street preacher lying behind a Dumpster. Despite Farrell's hesitation, the missionaries bring the man—later identified as Louis (Jo-sei Ikeda)—to rest in their apartment. Meanwhile, Carl, who has been reading the Bible and Book of Mormon, is eager to be baptized and begins taking lessons from the missionaries. While they do so, the missionaries ask their next-door neighbor, Holly, to check on the homeless preacher in their home. Upon their return, they have dinner with Holly and Louis and continue to do so for a few days.  In this time, the missionaries learn that Louis once was a preacher who lost his congregation due to alcoholism and that Holly—a struggling actress—acted in a few adult movies, her parents back home discovering and cutting off contact with her as a result. Elder Farrell promises that God will never stop loving her regardless of her mistakes. At a local ward luau, another missionary interviews Carl for baptism, teaching him the story of Ammon, a missionary who teaches a group of people  to give up their weapons and bury them deep in the ground, vowing never to use them again. The night before his baptism, Carl buries his weapons in the yard and Elder Lozano baptizes him the following day. The answer to this question is:","output":"The name of the person Holly was asked to check on in the article is the unconscious street preacher, Louis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How to prevent frostbite  Check the weather before you go out.  Take time to look at the weather forecast and decide what you need to wear today. Preventing frostbite is all about being as prepared as possible.","output":"Step 1: Choose the appropriate clothing Based on the weather forecast, select clothing that will adequately protect you from the cold. Ensure that your clothing is made of insulating materials like wool or fleece, and is water-resistant to keep you dry. Dress in layers to trap body heat and allow for better temperature regulation. Step 2: Protect your extremities Frostbite most commonly affects fingers, toes, ears, and nose. Wear gloves or mittens to protect your hands and consider using hand warmers for added warmth. Select warm, insulated, and waterproof footwear to keep your feet warm and dry. Wear a hat that covers your ears, or opt for earmuffs, and use a neck gaiter or scarf to cover your face. Step 3: Avoid tight clothing Make sure your clothing isn't too tight, as this can restrict blood flow and increase the risk of frostbite. Looser clothing allows for better circulation, which helps to keep extremities warm. Step 4: Stay dry Wet skin and clothing can increase the risk of frostbite. Make sure to wear moisture-wicking base layers and waterproof outer layers. If you begin to sweat, remove layers to avoid getting wet, and replace wet clothing with dry items as soon as possible. Step 5: Limit exposure to cold temperatures and wind Stay indoors or limit your time outside during extreme cold weather or when wind chill is significant. Wind can lower the temperature further and increase the risk of frostbite. Step 6: Stay physically active Keep your body moving to generate warmth and promote blood circulation when outside in cold temperatures. Avoid remaining stationary for long periods. Step 7: Know the signs of frostbite Familiarize yourself with the symptoms of frostbite, such as numbness, pale or grayish skin, and a cold or prickly feeling. If you notice these signs, seek warmth and medical attention immediately. Step 8: Plan for emergencies Carry a frostbite prevention kit when venturing outdoors for extended periods, including extra clothing layers, dry socks, hand and foot warmers, and a warm drink for hydration. Keep a charged cell phone with you in case of emergencies. By following these steps, you can reduce your risk of frostbite and ensure your safety when spending time outdoors in cold temperatures."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First, we notice that q is a common factor in each term on the left side of the equation.  Now, let's add up the coefficients (-633, -121, -350) of q to simplify the equation: -633 - 121 - 350 = -1104 . So our equation becomes: -1104*q + 40848 = 0 Next, let's isolate q to solve for it. We'll move -1104*q to the right side of the equation by adding 1104*q to both sides: 40848 = 1104*q Now we will solve for q by dividing both sides by 1104: q = 40848/1104  After performing the division we get: q = 37  So the solution to the equation is q = 37 ."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hillary Clinton and the 2016 Democrats: Mostly Liberal, Together Among seven potential Democratic presidential contenders, Hillary Clinton is the overwhelming favorite — and the third-most liberal candidate. How the other candidates are arrayed on an ideological spectrum could make her run for the White House easier than the last time out. In some ways, the cast of candidates for 2016 resembles the group from the 2008 race, with a field of stalwartly liberal politicians. Mrs. Clinton was slightly more liberal in 2008 than now, according to Crowdpac, which scores politicians on a left-right scale of -10 to 10. (Crowdpac bases this mainly on campaign contributions, but also on votes and speeches.) Her problem was that Barack Obama, who was further to the left of her — at -7.8 to her -6.9 — also had the donors who were to the left of her. He ran a better campaign, particularly in Iowa, and benefited from a surge in money from small-dollar donors. This time, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (-8.2) and Bernie Sanders (-8.3), Vermont’s independent senator, are to her left. Ms. Warren has the higher fund-raising profile of the two, with a leadership PAC that raised more than 2 million during the 2014 election cycle. But she and Mrs. Clinton (and to a lesser extent Mr. Sanders) would be competing for a similar pool of donors. During her 2012 Senate race, Ms. Warren raised more than 3.4 million from individuals who also gave to Mrs. Clinton's presidential campaign, Federal Election Commission data shows. Crowdpac ideological scores for potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidates. Crowdpac ideological scores for potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidates. The field of potential Democratic presidential candidates is ideologically cohesive. While there is room to the left of Mrs. Clinton’s Crowdpac score of -6.4, there is not a lot. The lack of distance between the Democratic hopefuls suggests that creating a wedge between someone like Ms. Warren and Mrs. Clinton would be harder among Democratic donors, and perhaps among the broader primary electorate. There are few issues where the gap between those two is significant. Gun control policy and immigration are possible points of contention, according to Crowdpac, which also generates scores for issues. On both issues, Ms. Warren is scored as much more liberal than Mrs. Clinton. The situation is different for Republicans, with considerable space available to the right of Jeb Bush (4.2) — and a lot of candidates to vie for it. There is more room to the right of Mrs. Clinton. Most of the other potential candidates fit there, including Vice President Joe Biden, who has a -4.4 score, and Jim Webb, the former Virginia senator, who is at -5.3. Those two resemble the more centrist Democratic candidates that won the nomination in previous elections. Al Gore, for instance, had a Crowdpac score of -5.1 in 2000. Bill Clinton rated a -4.45 in 1996. Crowdpac scores for Democratic presidential candidates in 2008. Crowdpac scores for Democratic presidential candidates in 2008. Mr. Obama is the most liberal Democrat elected to the presidency in the period Crowdpac has analyzed, which began in 1980. Mr. Obama was able to broaden his pool of donors beyond what earlier Democratic primary candidates managed.

Step 4: Identify the best answer - The remaining choice, condensing, matches our desired process, as it is the act of changing gas into a liquid by reducing heat energy and releasing latent heat.

Article: When thirty-two-year-old tennis player Andre Agassi made to the final of the U.S. Clay Court Championship in April 2003, he set a new world record: he became the oldest player ever to be number one in the world's tennis rankings. It was one of the greatest achievements in Agassi's long and successful career. Andre Agassi turned professional in 1986 at the age of sixteen. His career soon took off, and in 1990, Agassi was famous around the world, though never having won an important tennis championship. Many people thought he was famous more for his long blond hair and colorful tennis shirts than for his tennis skills. They wondered if he could really win an important tournament. In 1992, Agassi proved _ wrong by winning one of the greatest prizes in world tennis--the Wimbledon singles final. His first attempt to win this tournament had been in 1987, but he lost his opening game. He then refused to take part in Wimbledon for the next three years. He said his reason for not playing was that the officials refused to allow him to wear his colorful shirts, but some people said it was because he was afraid to lose. After several more championship victories, Agassi's luck began to run out. By 1997, the year of his marriage to a movie actress--- Brooke Shields, Agassi's ranking had dropped to 141stin the world. Many people thought his career was over. Agassi and Shields divorced two years later, and Agassi made a comeback with a new trainer, a new hairstyle, and new determination. In 1999, he won both the French Open and the U.S. Open and ended the year back as the world's number one. By 2003, he had earned more than 27 million in prize money, making him one of the most successful tennis players of all times. Question: How old was Agassi when he won his first championship? Yes or no, is the answer \\"twenty-two\\"?","output":"Andre Agassi won his first important tennis championship in 1992 when he claimed the Wimbledon singles title. He was born in 1970, which means that he was 22 years old when he achieved this victory. So, yes, the answer \\"twenty-two\\" is correct."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer to this question is:","output":"No, the answer you found on Google does not provide the correct information about the number of whales in the world. Instead, it talks about the Welsh national sporting teams and the colors of their uniforms. To provide you with a detailed and long answer, let's discuss the topic of whale populations. Whales, which belong to the order Cetacea, are divided into two main groups: Baleen whales (Mysticeti) and Toothed whales (Odontoceti). The estimated global populations of each species is difficult to determine precisely, as many factors such as migration patterns, human impacts, and changing ecosystems affect their numbers over time. In general, it is estimated that there are around 1.5 million individual whales worldwide, distributed across different species. The most abundant species is the Antarctic Krill-eating Minke whale, with an estimated population of 515,000. Other abundant species include: 1. Common Dolphin: Approximately 500,000 – 3,000,000 individuals 2. Humpback Whale: An estimated population of 80,000 – 100,000 3. Blue Whale: Around 10,000 – 25,000 individuals 4. Orca (Killer Whale): A population of around 50,000 5. Sperm Whale: An estimated 300,000 – 450,000 individuals It is important to note that several whale species, such as the North Atlantic Right Whale, are considered endangered or critically endangered, with populations of only a few hundred individuals. The numbers provided are estimates based on research, and may not be completely accurate due to various factors that are difficult to measure. However, the primary take-away is that the answer you found on Google is incorrect and not related to whale populations. In summary, there are around 1.5 million whales in the world, spread across various species. Many species face challenges such as habitat loss, climate change, and hunting, which impact their populations to different extents. The correct approach to understand the number of whales in the world would be to account for different species and their populations separately."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After an April 21, 1995, court hearing on the gun charges, but before McVeigh's release, federal agents took him into custody as they continued their investigation into the bombing. Rather than talk to investigators about the bombing, McVeigh demanded an attorney. Having been tipped off by the arrival of police and helicopters that a bombing suspect was inside, a restless crowd began to gather outside the jail. While McVeigh's requests for a bulletproof vest or transport by helicopter were denied, authorities did use a helicopter to transport him from Perry to Oklahoma City.Federal agents obtained a warrant to search the house of McVeigh's father, Bill, after which they broke down the door and wired the house and telephone with listening devices. FBI investigators used the resulting information gained, along with the fake address McVeigh had been using, to begin their search for the Nichols brothers, Terry and James. On April 21, 1995, Terry Nichols learned that he was being hunted, and turned himself in. Investigators discovered incriminating evidence at his home: ammonium nitrate and blasting caps, the electric drill used to drill out the locks at the quarry, books on bomb-making, a copy of Hunter (a 1989 novel by William Luther Pierce, the founder and chairman of the National Alliance, a white nationalist group) and a hand-drawn map of downtown Oklahoma City, on which the Murrah Building and the spot where McVeigh's getaway car was hidden were marked. After a nine-hour interrogation, Terry Nichols was formally held in federal custody until his trial. On April 25, 1995, James Nichols was also arrested, but he was released after 32 days due to lack of evidence. McVeigh's sister Jennifer was accused of illegally mailing bullets to McVeigh, but she was granted immunity in exchange for testifying against him.Ibrahim Ahmad, a Jordanian-American traveling from his home in Oklahoma City to visit family in Jordan on April 19, 1995, was also arrested, amid concern that Middle Eastern terrorists could have been...","output":"James"},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Burges played an important role in the renaissance of High Victorian stained glass. The provision of glass of appropriate colour and richness was central to many of his decorative themes, and he invested effort in working with the best cartoonists and manufacturers to achieve this. He also studied the history of glass production, writing in his second Art Applied to Industry lecture, \\"[a] use of antiquarian studies is to restore disused arts, and to get all the good we can out of them for our own improvement.\\" In the catalogue to the exhibition of stained glass cartoons from Cardiff Castle, Sargent pays tribute to \\"his deep knowledge of the history and techniques of glass manufacture\\" and Lawrence considers him a pioneer who, by his \\"painstaking studies, re-established the principles of medieval decoration and used this to make [his] own bold and original statements.\\" The results were outstanding; Lawrence wrote that Burges designed with \\"a vibrancy, an intensity and a brilliance which no other glass maker could match.\\" He acknowledges Burges's debt to the manufacturers and craftsmen with whom he worked, in particular, Gualbert Saunders, whose \\"technique [gave] Burges's glass its most distinctive characteristic, namely the flesh colour.

Context: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

People enjoy recreational activities and sports that involve the use of firearms, such as hunting. 2. Banning guns would negatively impact these recreational activities. 3. Most of these activities are done using rifles rather than handguns. 4. Outlawing handguns would make it harder for individuals to be inconspicuous when attempting a crime. 5. The goal is to determine if we can conclude \\"I don't think it would have a major impact on crime, though.\\" Step 1: Understand the premises The first three components are based on the notion that the use of guns in recreational activities should not be impacted by efforts to restrict firearms for the sake of crime prevention. These points are generally accepted and don't need additional analysis for the purpose of crime impact evaluation. Step 2: Evaluate the impact of outlawing handguns on crime The fourth component highlights that outlawing handguns may make it more difficult for people to carry out crimes inconspicuously. This could be true, as someone attempting to use a larger firearm like a rifle is more likely to be noticed. Step 3: Assess the overall impact on crime To determine if outlawing handguns would have a major impact on crime, we must consider a few factors, such as: a. The proportion of handgun-related crimes compared to total crimes: If a large proportion of crimes involves handguns, outlawing them could have a more significant effect on reducing crime rates. b. The substitution effect: Would potential criminals simply switch to other weapons or methods of carrying out their crimes if handguns were no longer available? c. The potential for increased black market activity: Outlawing handguns may lead to a rise in black market sales, which might not significantly reduce the availability of handguns for criminal use. Step 4: Draw a conclusion Based on the available information, we cannot definitively conclude that \\"I don't think it would have a major impact on crime, though.\\" As our analysis depends on various factors, more evidence and research may be needed to make a data-supported assertion about the overall impact of outlawing handguns on crime rates."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Rats The answer is:","output":"Title: Rat Syndicate Step 1: Introduction Introduce the main character, Willard, a downtrodden janitor working at a large corporation. Willard is constantly belittled by his boss and coworkers, leading to a life filled with bitterness and resentment. Set the scene in a big city where rats are a common sight, providing a natural connection to the animal helpers. Step 2: Discovering the Rats One day, while cleaning a dark basement storage of the corporation, Willard finds a group of unusually intelligent rats. He gradually befriends them, discovering their unique ability to quickly learn tasks and respond to his commands. Step 3: Developing the Bond As Willard spends more time with the rats, he finds solace in their company. The bond with these animals becomes stronger, providing Willard with the emotional support he's been lacking. Through training and communication, Willard's control over the rats strengthens, and he begins to view them as a powerful tool for exacting revenge on his tyrannical boss. Step 4: Planning the Heist Fueled by his newfound power, Willard meticulously plans a daring heist to steal a fortune from his boss. The plan involves using the rats' unique skills such as squeezing through tight spaces, chewing through wires, and swarming as a distraction. Willard trains the rats specifically for their roles in the heist, ensuring they perform as desired. Step 5: Executing the Heist On the night of the heist, Willard releases the rats into the corporation's headquarters, causing chaos and confusion among the employees and security personnel. While chaos ensues, Willard and a few of his most trusted rats slip into his boss's office, searching for the valuable items and documents needed for their plan.

It was placed on waters in the International Garden Expo Park, where the Yongding River passes through. The Rubber Duck exhibition was designed by Dutch artist, Florentijn Hofman. It was part of the activities of Beijing Design Week, which ran from September 26 to October 3 in 2013. The Rubber Duck stayed in the park until September 23, then moved to the Summer Palace, a famous Beijing tourist spot, where it was on display until October 26. The duck is made of over 200 pieces of rubber. It was guarded not only by staff, but also by 10 volunteers wearing yellow T-shirts and hats with a rubber duck logo. Sun Yidong, a volunteer who guided visitors to the duck, said the art brought energy to the traditional Chinese park. \\"Seeing the giant Rubber Duck makes me feel like I'm a kid again.\\" Sun said. Because of the rain on Friday, there were not too many people coming to see it. The Expo workers said they expected more people to come and visit the duck on weekends. Zhao Yan said she had been following news about the duck since 2007, when the duck began its journey. \\"I even considered going to Hong Kong to see it. It's great that the duck is in Beijing,\\" Zhao said. Before arriving in Beijing, the Rubber Duck traveled to 13 cities in nine countries. \\"The aim of the Rubber Duck is simply to bring everyone back to their childhood again,\\" said Zeng Hui, a leader of the Beijing Design Week Organizing Committee Office. \\"It can be a toy for adults.\\" ,.

After their big road win in Washington, the Eagles hosted the winless Miami Dolphins at muddy Lincoln Financial Field and won 17-7. The offenses struggled in the first quarter, and the first points would actually come via special teams in the second quarter, when Ted Ginn Jr. returned a punt 87 yards to paydirt for Miami. Later in the quarter, McNabb, who had already thrown two interceptions, was hit as he threw, spraining his ankle. David Akers came on to make a 34-yard field goal, and McNabb left the game. A. J. Feeley was spun up to play quarterback, but threw an interception of his own on his first drive. In the third quarter, Correll Buckhalter took the ball in from eight yards out for the go-ahead touchdown, making it 10-7. Feeley, after some helpful runs from running back Brian Westbrook, connected with receiver Jason Avant to increase the lead. The defense played a strong second half, and Westbrook carried seven times on the final drive, which killed the final 6:40 of the game.

Ironically, China’s wind resource is much stronger in winter, which makes the grid-access problem even more frustrating for the wind industry. Make this lower case","output":"Ironically, china's wind resource is much stronger in winter, which makes the grid-access problem even more frustrating for the wind industry. In countries like China, where the demand for renewable energy is consistently on the rise, wind power plays a crucial role in supplementing the country's energy needs. Although the potential of wind power in China is vast, the capacity of the existing power grid to integrate wind energy is a significant challenge. During the winter months, the situation gets worse due to the grid-access problems experienced by the wind industry. Wind power's strength in China during the winter months can be attributed to a combination of meteorological and geographical factors, such as variations in temperature and pressure, as well as the distribution of snow and ice. As a result, the potential for wind energy generation is greater during these colder months. However, this seasonal resource advantage is hindered by the obstacles faced during grid integration, frustrating the industry's efforts to harness the full potential of wind power. In addressing these grid access issues, the Chinese government has implemented measures to improve grid infrastructure and facilitate a more seamless integration of renewable energy resources, including wind power. Some of these initiatives include the upgrades of power grid infrastructure, enhancement of the energy storage systems, and technological advancements in wind turbine efficiency. Nevertheless, overcoming these challenges, both in the short- and long-term, requires a multifaceted approach. Here are some suggested strategies to improve the grid access situation for China's wind industry: 1. Upgrade and expand existing grid infrastructure: Enhancing China's energy grid can improve the efficiency of wind energy integration and transportation. More robust and extensive networks can be better utilized to manage and distribute the increased wind energy generated during the winter months. 2. Innovate and invest in energy storage technologies: Energy storage solutions, such as batteries, pumped hydro storage, and flywheels, can hold excess wind energy generated during times of high wind power potential. These solutions can alleviate grid access issues by providing a buffer between energy production and demand, allowing for greater flexibility and reliability. 3. Implement flexible energy markets and pricing mechanisms: Encouraging flexible and dynamic power pricing can incentivize efficient power generation and reduce grid congestion. By allowing for variable energy pricing based on supply and demand, wind power can be more easily integrated into the grid system, thus fostering a more competitive market. 4. Strengthen collaboration with neighboring countries: Developing stronger international connections can bolster China's domestic grid system by allowing for the cross-border trading of renewable energy resources. Sharing and trading excess wind energy with neighboring countries can alleviate grid-access issues and create a more efficient, interconnected regional power network. 5. Promote research and development: Continued investment in research and development can yield technological advancements in both wind power and grid infrastructure. Innovations bolster the efficiency, reliability, and capacity of the grid, resulting in improved access for wind energy during peak times. In conclusion, addressing the grid-access problem during China’s winter months is essential for harnessing its vast wind resource potential. Through a combination of infrastructure upgrades, technological advancements, and policy reforms, the Chinese wind industry can overcome these challenges and effectively contribute to the country's ambitious renewable energy goals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The man reaches down to pick up a pair of scissors, then carefully trims his mustache, ensuring that it's evenly shaped on both sides. As he does so, he reflects on the importance of maintaining a neat and tidy appearance despite the current trend of many men embracing a more rugged and unkempt look. He continues to trim the edges of his beard as well, removing any stray hairs that are detracting from the sharp and clean lines he desires. After he's satisfied with the shape of his facial hair, he sets the scissors aside and reaches for a small container of beard oil. The man carefully pours a few drops onto his palm, rubbing it between his hands to warm the oil before gently massaging it into the beard. As he works the oil throughout his facial hair, he uses a brush to evenly distribute the product, simultaneously untangling any knots and loosening the beard's coarse texture. It's a routine he's grown accustomed to over the years, developing an appreciation for the intricate art of beard maintenance. Feeling the softness of his now well-maintained beard, he takes a step back to analyze his work in the mirror. Appreciating the symmetry, he decides that it's time for the final touch and reaches for his beard wax. With the precision of an experienced artist, he applies the wax to his mustache, shaping and twisting the tips into an elegant upward curl that makes a bold statement. As the man completes his grooming routine, he admires his reflection, feeling a renewed sense of confidence and pride in his appearance. He understands that tending to his facial hair not only enhances his looks but also communicates his attention to detail and personal discipline. As the man exits the bathroom and begins preparing for the day, the time he has invested in his beard maintenance pays off. Not only does he feel more comfortable and self-assured, but he also sets a positive example for others who may be striving for a similar level of grooming excellence. In conclusion, the man's meticulous grooming ritual reveals a deeper commitment to self-care and personal presentation, ultimately contributing positively to his overall well-being and sense of self-worth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In this translation: - \\"Mi gratitud\\" means \\"my gratitude\\". - \\"es infinita\\" means \\"is boundless\\" or \\"is endless\\". - \\"por todo lo que\\" means \\"for all that\\". - \\"Él me da\\" means \\"He gives me\\". In Spanish, the pronoun \\"Él\\" is capitalized when referring to God, just as \\"He\\" is in English. - \\"y\\" means \\"and\\". - \\"se lo demuestro\\" means \\"I show Him\\". The pronouns \\"se\\" and \\"lo\\" are used to respectively indicate the recipient (to Him) and the thing being shown (the gratitude) in a more appropriate way in Spanish. - \\"de mil maneras\\" means \\"in a thousand ways\\".

The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma.  Now, I have a new situation: Two farmers are having a conversation at a bar about how their soil is doing. Jeff takes a sip of his beer and says that he just discovered that his soil is hypoxic. Brandon is trying to get the attention of the bartender so he can order another martini. Upon hearing Jeff's remark about his soil, Brandon states that the soil on his own farm is not hypoxic. Brandon is relieved when he notices the bartender is finally walking over to them.  Answer this question please: Does Jeff's soil have more or less toxic compounds than Brandon's? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, Jeff's soil, which is hypoxic, likely has more toxic compounds than Brandon's soil, which is not hypoxic. This is because anaerobic bacteria tend to produce toxic compounds in hypoxic conditions by using nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ensuring the safety and well-being of employees, subcontractors, and the general public. 2. Reducing the number of accidents, injuries, and fatalities on construction sites. 3. Minimizing the potential legal and financial risks to the company arising from health and safety-related incidents. 4.

A single mother of two sons, Morrison wrote the novel while she was teaching at Howard University . She centers the story around a young African American girl named Pecola who grows up during the years following the Great Depression in Lorain, Ohio. Due to her dark skin color, Pecola gets taunted for her appearance as the members of her community associate beauty with \\"whiteness\\". She ultimately develops an inferiority complex, which fuels her desire for blue eyes. The point of view switches between the perspective of Claudia MacTeer, the daughter of Pecola's foster parents, and multiple third-person limited viewpoints. Due to the controversial issues the book raises such as racism, incest, and child molestation, there have been numerous attempts to ban it from schools and libraries.  - Princeton University is a private Ivy League research university in Princeton, New Jersey, United States.  - Sula is a 1973 novel by Nobel Prize - winning author Toni Morrison .  - Toni Morrison (born Chloe Ardelia Wofford; February 18, 1931) is an American novelist, editor, and Professor Emeritus at Princeton University.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose text shows elements of early Pietism?  Erschallet, ihr Lieder is the third of the Weimar cantatas. It was the first composed for a feast day, Pentecost Sunday (Whit Sunday), Pentecost being a high holiday along with Christmas and Easter. The prescribed readings for the feast day are taken from the Acts of the Apostles, on the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:1–13), and from the Gospel of John, in which Jesus announces the Spirit who will teach, in his Farewell discourse (John 14:23–31). As in many Bach cantatas, the libretto is compiled from Bible text, contemporary poetry and chorale. The poetry is attributed to Salomon Franck, although the verses are not included in his printed editions. Several of Bach's early stylistic mannerisms appear here, such as a biblical quotation in a recitative second movement rather than in a first choral movement, arias following each other without a recitative in between, and dialogue in a duet.Franck's text shows elements of early Pietism: the expression of extreme feelings, for example \\"O seligste Zeiten!\\" (O most blessed times) in the opening chorus, and a \\"mystical demeanour\\", for example in the duet of the Soul and the Spirit united. In the middle section of the first movement, Franck paraphrases the Gospel text, which says in verse 23 that God wants to dwell with man, to \\"Gott will sich die Seelen zu Tempeln bereiten\\" (God Himself shall prepare our souls for His  temple, more literally: \\"God wants to prepare [our] souls to become his temples\\"). The words for the recitative are the quotation of verse 23 from the Gospel of John, \\"Wer mich liebet, der wird mein Wort halten\\" (Whoever loves Me will keep My Word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him). Movement 3 addresses the Trinity and movement 4 the Spirit that was present at the Creation. Movement 5 is a duet of the Soul and the Spirit, underlined by an instrumental quote from Martin Luther's Pentecost hymn \\"Komm, Heiliger Geist, Herre Gott\\", which is based on the Latin hymn \\"Veni Sancte Spiritus, reple tuorum corda fidelium\\"....

While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who asks Dillard to install an alarm system?  The action is set in San Francisco during the 1980s. Weslake, who was laid off from his job, is working in a low-paying position at Garvey's pawn shop. Weslake has one friend nicknamed 'Turtle' who's homeless and is seen throughout the whole film searching for something to eat. One day, Dillard, who is an amateur musician, and Ramon, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who lives with his sister Maria, come to Garvey's shop. The purpose of their visit is to buy off a guitar pawned earlier by Dillard; because both have little money they're offering the pawn shop owner a stolen car radio, but it's not enough for Garvey. Instead, he offers Dillard a deal: he wants Dillard to install an alarm system in his shop (as Dillard is an electrician). Dillard is not thrilled by the deal but Ramon convinces him, arguing that when the alarm system is installed, Garvey may have enough confidence to leave the shop (he normally stays in it, since he lives there) and they may then get an opportunity to break in and get the guitar back. Their conversation is heard by a 'Boardwalk', a pimp who was just left by his girlfriend with his small child. He tells Weslake that he should report the plans of Dillard and Ramon to Garvey, but Weslake realizes that when the new alarm system is installed, Garvey may no longer find it necessary to employ him, and he will be broke again. Because of this Weslake doesn't inform his employer of the planned robbery, and instead joins Dillard, Ramon Boardwalk and Turtle in their attempted robbery. He becomes the brain of the whole operation, designing a plan for breaking into the large safe in the pawn shop. Answer:","output":"The person who asks Dillard to install an alarm system is the pawn shop owner named Garvey.

Friends and family gathered around the metal statue Tuesday, June 25, at the National Ranching Heritage Center for what they hoped would be an opportunity to find peace and honor Miguel Martinez where he died within minutes of the accident just before 3 a.m. Saturday.      “We just need to get together and pray and be supportive,” said Brenda Garcia, a family friend.      One of two adults near Martinez in his last minutes said his death was a “pure accident.”      Marenda Podhorsky said Tuesday that she and her boyfriend took her four children and Martinez to play in the park area near the center early Saturday morning, according to the Associated Press.      Martinez was spending the night with Podhorsky’s son and the children were awake well past midnight after eating sweets to celebrate her boyfriend’s birthday.      When she heard a thump, she thought Martinez might have been knocked down by the bull’s horn during a game of hide-and-seek. Instead, Martinez suffered a chest wound. He died after being impaled by the horn.      Texas Tech police, who continued investigating the death Tuesday, released a heavily redacted copy of a police report. The redacted report shows only the date, time, location and a brief synopsis.      “He was running and ran into the horn of one of the statues,” the report states. “The boy was unresponsive and died because of his injuries.”      Garcia said she has known Martinez for years. Her daughter and Martinez were close friends who attended Cavazos Middle School together.      She described him as a good role model to their friends.      “And he was always into sports,” she said, listing basketball, football and track. “Whatever season the sports were, he was playing.”      Garcia said she would not allow her daughter out past midnight, but avoided laying blame for the accident.      “Boys are going to be boys and they’re going to be out late,” she said. “This could happen to anybody, day or night.”      Stephanie Cole, a store manager at Wells Fargo’s North University Avenue bank branch, said Martinez’s family is accepting donations through the Miguel Martinez Memorial Fund at Wells Fargo.

In March 2010 artist Spencer Tunick arranged and photographed 5,200 what in front of Sydney Opera House?","output":"In March 2010, American artist Spencer Tunick orchestrated and photographed 5,200 nude volunteers on the steps and forecourt of the world-renowned architectural masterpiece, the Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia. This ambitious art installation was titled \\"Mardi Gras: The Base.\\" Spencer Tunick is best known for his large-scale, site-specific installations, often involving thousands of nude participants. These installations are both visually striking and sociopolitically thought-provoking, as they bring attention to various social, political, and environmental issues. The artist's primary goal is to impose a temporary transformation of the space and explore the relationship between the human body and the architecture or landscape it inhabits. The staging of this provocative artwork at the Sydney Opera House was part of a collaboration with the Australian city's Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Festival, an annual LGBTQ+ celebration that aims to promote inclusion, diversity, and equality. By arranging such a significant number of nude participants in a highly public space, Tunick sought to promote self-expression, body positivity, and unity among individuals, regardless of their race, gender, or sexuality. The installation also contributed to a broader conversation around the acceptance of nudity as a form of art and self-expression. In preparation for this large-scale work, Tunick had to plan meticulously and collaborate closely with the authorities, local organizations, and festival organizers. The participants were pre-registered and carefully briefed on the artistic objectives, as well as the best methods to maintain personal comfort and safety. As a result, the installation challenged societal norms, created a sense of camaraderie among those involved, and visually captured the essence of human vulnerability and resilience. The \\"Mardi Gras: The Base\\" installation is a testament to Spencer Tunick's dedication to engaging people from all walks of life in an exploration of the connections between our bodies, the environment, and the societies in which we live. By photographing 5,200 nude volunteers in front of the iconic Sydney Opera House, Tunick invited individuals and audiences alike to engage in a critical discourse about identity, freedom, and collective strength."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You are unlikely to get everything that you ask for. However, you won’t get any concessions unless you ask for them. Ask for a lower rental rate, shorter lease term, and a broad exclusive use clause. In your counteroffer, mention that you are also negotiating with another landlord. This news might spur the landlord to give you as many concessions as possible. Most landlords will require you to personally guarantee the lease. This means that if your business can’t pay the lease, then the landlord can come after you personally to pay. If you’re a small business without much credit history, you can expect to sign a personal guarantee. Many commercial landlords will expect a security deposit and/or prepaid rent. You can expect up to two months’ of rent as a security deposit and one to three months of rent prepaid. Summary:","output":"In order to draft an effective counteroffer to the landlord's proposal, you should adopt an aggressive approach as it is unlikely that you will receive everything you ask for. Key elements to consider in your counteroffer include requesting a lower rental rate, a shorter lease term, and a broad exclusive-use clause.  Furthermore, it is beneficial to inform the landlord that you are also in negotiations with another property owner, as this may encourage them to offer more concessions. Be prepared for landlords to require a personal guarantee for the lease, especially if you are a small business with limited credit history. This means that if your business fails to meet its lease commitments, the landlord can pursue you personally for payment. Lastly, anticipate that commercial landlords will typically expect a security deposit, often up to two months' rent, and one to three months of rent prepaid.

While the use of iron started to become more widespread around 1200 BC, mainly because of interruptions in the trade routes for tin, the metal is much softer than bronze. However, very small amounts of steel, (an alloy of iron and around 1% carbon), was always a byproduct of the bloomery process. The ability to modify the hardness of steel by heat treatment had been known since 1100 BC, and the rare material was valued for the manufacture of tools and weapons. Because the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough to melt iron fully, the production of steel in decent quantities did not occur until the introduction of blister steel during the Middle Ages. This method introduced carbon by heating wrought iron in charcoal for long periods of time, but the penetration of carbon was not very deep, so the alloy was not homogeneous. In 1740, Benjamin Huntsman began melting blister steel in a crucible to even out the carbon content, creating the first process for the mass production of tool steel. Huntsman's process was used for manufacturing tool steel until the early 1900s.

Background: William Randolph Hearst Sr. (; April 29, 1863 - August 14, 1951) was an American businessman, politician, and newspaper publisher who built the nation's largest newspaper chain and media company Hearst Communications and whose flamboyant methods of yellow journalism influenced the nation's popular media by emphasizing sensationalism and human interest stories. Hearst entered the publishing business in 1887 after being given control of The San Francisco Examiner by his wealthy father. Context: Beginning in 1919, Hearst began to build Hearst Castle, which he never completed, on a 240,000 acres (97,000 hectares) ranch at San Simeon, California, which he furnished with art, antiques and entire rooms brought from the great houses of Europe. He also used the ranch for an Arabian horse breeding operation. San Simeon was also used in the 1960 film Spartacus as the estate of Marcus Licinius Crassus (played by Laurence Olivier).  He also had a property on the McCloud River in Siskiyou County, in far northern California, called Wyntoon. Wyntoon was designed by famed architect Julia Morgan, who also designed Hearst Castle and worked in collaboration with William J. Dodd on a number of other projects.  In 1947, Hearst paid 120,000 for an H-shaped Beverly Hills mansion, (located at 1011 N Beverly Dr, Beverly Hills CA 90210) on 3.7 acres three blocks from Sunset Boulevard. This home, known as Beverly House, was once perhaps the \\"most expensive\\" private home in the U.S., valued at 165 million (PS81.4 million). It has 29 bedrooms, three swimming pools, tennis courts, its own cinema and a nightclub. Lawyer and investor Leonard Ross has owned it since 1976. The estate went on the market for 95 million at the end of 2010. The property had not sold by 2012 but was then listed at a significantly increased asking price of 135 million. The Beverly House, as it has come to be known, has some cinematic connections. It was the setting for the gruesome scene in the film The Godfather depicting a horse's severed head in the bed of film-producer, Jack Woltz. The character was head of a film company called International, the name of Hearst's early film company. According to Hearst Over Hollywood, John and Jacqueline Kennedy stayed at the house for part of their honeymoon. They watched their first film together as a married couple in the mansion's cinema. It was a Hearst-produced film from the 1920s.  In the early 1890s, Hearst began building a mansion on the hills overlooking Pleasanton, California on land purchased by his father a decade earlier. Hearst's mother took over the project, hired Julia Morgan to finish it as her home, and named it Hacienda del Pozo de Verona. After her death, it served as the clubhouse for Castlewood Country Club from 1925 to 1969, when it was destroyed in a massive fire. Question: Did he have other properties?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, William Randolph Hearst had other properties besides Hearst Castle, Wyntoon, and Beverly House. One such property was a mansion in Pleasanton, California, called Hacienda del Pozo de Verona, which was initially started by Hearst but later taken over by his mother. After her death, it served as the clubhouse for Castlewood Country Club until 1969 when it was destroyed in a fire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Her relationship with Michael Hutchence was also seen as part of her departure from her earlier persona. Its lead single, \\"Better the Devil You Know\\" peaked at number two in the UK and four in her native Australia. Rhythm of Love's second and fourth single, \\"Step Back in Time\\" and \\"Shocked\\" were both a top ten hit in the UK and Australia. She then embarked on the Rhythm of Love Tour in February 1991.

Option B, \\"Sports,\\" is not applicable to this article as the content is about natural disasters, meteorological events, and their impact on people, and not about any sports event or sportspeople.

If \\"Two dogs play in the snow.\\", does this mean that \\"Two dogs are playing in a warm pool.\\"?","output":"No, the statement \\"Two dogs play in the snow.\\" does not mean that \\"Two dogs are playing in a warm pool.\\" These two sentences describe two entirely different scenarios, each involving different environments and activities. In the first sentence, \\"Two dogs play in the snow,\\" we understand that there are a couple of dogs engaged in playful activities while in the snow. This implies that the weather is likely cold, and the dogs are outdoors, possibly during winter. Snow is a form of precipitation that typically falls in colder temperatures, creating a chilly environment. Dogs might be playing by running around, catching snowballs, or jumping in the snow. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"Two dogs are playing in a warm pool,\\" presents a completely different situation. In this case, the two dogs are not in the cold snow, but rather inside a pool filled with warm water. Pools are usually filled with water, not snow, and are meant for swimming or relaxing. The warm temperature of the water contrasts with the cold environment of the snow in the first sentence. Dogs in a warm pool may be swimming, splashing, or just enjoying the water. In conclusion, these two sentences illustrate different settings, weather conditions, and experiences for the dogs. The first statement talks about dogs playing in a cold, snowy setting, while the second statement describes dogs enjoying a warm and wet environment in a pool. Therefore, the first sentence does not mean the same as the second sentence, as the conditions, activities, and environments are entirely different from each other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A: pick from the following. [i] prostate gland; [ii] ureter; [iii] fallopian tube; [iv] vas deferens; Answer:","output":"The name of the tube that carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra is the vas deferens (option [iv]). The vas deferens is a crucial part of the male reproductive system and plays a significant role in the transportation of sperm. Sperm are produced in the testes, which are situated within the scrotum. From the testes, sperm move to the epididymis, where they mature and are stored temporarily. When ejaculation occurs, the sperm travel through the vas deferens, which is a long, muscular tube that propels the sperm forward. The vas deferens extends from the epididymis and passes through the inguinal canal into the pelvic region. Here, it loops around the bladder and joins with the seminal vesicle to form the ejaculatory duct. The other options provided are not related to the transportation of sperm from the epididymis to the urethra: [i] Prostate gland: The prostate gland is a male accessory gland situated below the bladder and surrounding the urethra. It produces a significant portion of the seminal fluid, which mixes with sperm to create semen. The prostate gland plays an essential role in nourishing and protecting the sperm, but it does not transport sperm. [ii] Ureter: The ureter is a tube that transfers urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. There are two ureters, one connected to each kidney. While the ureter is involved in the urinary system, it is not responsible for transporting sperm. [iii] Fallopian tube: The fallopian tube is part of the female reproductive system. It is the pathway through which the mature ovum (egg) travels from the ovary to the uterus after ovulation. The fallopian tube is also the site where fertilization typically occurs when sperm encounters the ovum. However, the fallopian tube is not involved in sperm transportation in the male reproductive system."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The industrial complex covers about 100 acres (40 ha) on both sides of Quehanna Highway at the southeast edge of the Quehanna Wild Area. Although the industrial complex lies within the historic 16-sided polygon, it is no longer part of the wild area. After Curtiss-Wright's lease ended and it donated six of the eight buildings in the complex to the state in 1963, Pennsylvania formed the Commonwealth Industrial Research Corporation to administer and lease the Quehanna facilities, which it did until 1967. Over the years a series of tenants have occupied parts of the industrial complex. One company manufactured logging trailers there from 1967 to 1971, and another processed frozen meat from 1968 to 1970. In 1968 Piper Aircraft established a plant to make metal and plastic parts for airplanes. The complex was renamed from Quehanna to Piper, a name it retains. Piper employed up to 1,000 people, but moved its operations from Pennsylvania to Florida in 1984.The Young Adult Conservation Corps was also based at Piper from 1977 to 1982. This federally funded program employed up to 45 young people for local conservation projects in the state parks and forests and on state game lands.

She found out that her favorite band's performance was cancelled. Cristin is frustrated that she did not get to see their performance. What is a natural next sentence? Available choices:  *Cristin enjoyed seeing her favorite band that night.  *Cristin decided not to go to the festival next year.","output":"Cristin decided not to go to the festival next year. This unfortunate situation at the music festival left Cristin feeling quite disappointed. She had been looking forward to seeing her favorite band perform live and had even convinced some of her friends to join her for this much-anticipated event. As a die-hard fan, Cristin's enthusiasm prior to the festival was through the roof, so one can only imagine the extent of her frustration when the band's performance was cancelled. Admittedly, the festival organizers could not have foreseen that the band would have to cancel their performance. However, Cristin couldn't shake off a sense of having been let down. For her, as well as thousands of other fans, this was no small setback. Music festivals are typically filled with positive experiences and unforgettable memories. But in Cristin's case, this cancellation overshadowed what could have been a fantastic time. While some might argue that seeing the rest of the impressive lineup at the festival could make up for missing one band's performance, for Cristin, the entire experience was now tainted. The joy she took in discovering new artists and dancing along to old favorites was significantly dampened by the knowledge that she would not get to see her all-time favorite band. Considering the time and money Cristin had invested in attending the festival, the disappointment she now felt was palpable and, to some extent, understandable. Travel, accommodations, and festival passes can be quite expensive, and Cristin had willingly paid for it all with the expectation that she would see the band she adored. Now, with their performance cancelled, she couldn't help but feel like the entire experience had been a waste of her resources. As the festival drew to a close, Cristin and her friends spent time reflecting on the performances they had seen. While they admitted that many acts had been thrilling and had even exceeded their expectations, the absence of her favorite band had left an unmistakable void in Cristin's festival experience. Much to the dismay of her friends, she resolved not to attend the festival next year. Even though the rest of her group tried to persuade her to reconsider, Cristin had made up her mind. The sting of disappointment, coupled with the financial burden, had convinced her that passing on next year's festival was the right choice for her. Perhaps in the future, Cristin's festival experience might change for the better, but for the present moment, she was content to sit the next one out and find other ways to enjoy her favorite music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article:      Jeff Lagerquist, CTVNews.ca                  Vancouver residents looking to hire some landscaping help this fall could end up with royalty tending to their hedges and bagging up leaves.      Eric Manu, a Langley, B.C. man who was crowned chief of the Akan tribe in the village of Adansi Aboabo No. 2 in southern Ghana last year, has returned to Canada for a few months, where he is resuming his job as a landscaper.      “Sometimes we go to the (job) site and they say, ‘You are the chief. I saw you on TV. Why are you doing the landscaping?’” he told CTV News. “This is humbleness you understand. Anytime I’m in Canada, I’m proud to work for my boss.”      Manu, 32, moved to B.C. in 2012 after marrying a Canadian woman he met in Ghana. But his uncle, who had served as chief of the tribe, died two years ago, placing Manu next in line for the honour.      Hanging up his crown, even temporarily, isn’t a decision Manu takes lightly. He’s using his time in Canada to raise money to improve the health care standards for his tribe of 6,000.      Manu and his Canadian boss Susan Watson started a foundation that packed a shipping container with medical supplies, school supplies, and clothing that arrived in Ghana this spring. The To the Moon and Back Foundation hopes to continue raising money and donations to send a second shipment and improve the local medical clinic.      “The whole village was quite poor. The clinic only has a midwife and a few nurses. There is no doctor on site,” said Watson.      -With files from CTV Vancouver ||||| Last year, Eric Manu left his landscaping job in Langley to take his rightful place as the crowned chief of a West African tribe.      But now he's back in the Lower Mainland to help his Akan tribe in Ghana improve their lives by working, once again, as a landscaper and sending money back.      \\"The [Ghanaian] government wasn't really concentrating on those villages, cottages or hinterlands. Their focus was mainly in the cities. And that was really, really, really disturbing,\\" he told On The Coast host Stephen Quinn.      \\"They were having challenges with their borehole water system, electricity, telecommunications network … the hospital, poor facilities.\\"      Manu will also be looking for philanthropic gifts and partnerships while in Canada.      'I feel like I am for the people'      Manu moved to Canada in 2012, but inherited the position of chief when his uncle died at age 67 in 2015.      Eric Manu says being the chief of his tribe has made him more mature. (CBC)      He says being in the position has made him \\"serious and flexible\\": serious when administering his tribe but flexible enough to adapt to what his people need.      \\"I feel like I am for the people and I'm accountable and responsible and they look up to me,\\" he said. \\"It makes me a totally changed person.\\"      \\"I feel more mature. It gives me a broadened idea and mind to think far and accept people, irrespective of who they are. Either young or old, physically challenged or able. Everybody.\\"      Manu says he has had to be a strong advocate when dealing with the Ghanaian government. He was able to get the country's vice president to look at the conditions of the village, he says, adding it was an eye-opening experience for the politician.      He says after living in Canada, he wants to make sure everyone thrives in his community.      \\"I really want my home, my village, to be 'Second Canada,'\\" he said.

That’s the question a team of students and professors at the University of Alabama is trying to determine. In many parts of the Black Belt, homeowners are resorting to “straight pipe” systems to dispose of wastewater and sewage, rather than sewers or septic tanks because of a type of thick, clay soil and widespread poverty across isolated areas. In those instances, untreated wastewater and sewage are simply flushed out of a plain PVC pipe from the house into the woods, or even the backyard, raising concerns about tropical diseases like hookworm and other public health issues. Al.com reports University of Alabama graduate students and professors, backed by a federal grant, are joining efforts to determine just how widespread these practices are and what can be done about them. The UA team received a 15,000 grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s “People, Prosperity and the Planet,” program, a competition for students proposing a yearlong project to address an environmental or public health issue. The students will use computer models to map how widespread sanitation issues are in Alabama’s Black Belt, a region plagued with sewage and wastewater problems and reports of tropical diseases like hookworm that are associated with poor sanitation. The student project will go hand-in-hand with efforts by university researchers and state and federal agencies. University of Alabama civil engineering professor Mark Elliott, a faculty adviser for the project, said the Black Belt is being hampered by a combination of poor soil conditions where traditional septic systems don’t work, high levels of poverty, and people living in relatively isolated areas where connecting to municipal sewer lines is not an option. Elliott said the “shrink-swell clays” that make up about half the soil in the Black Belt don’t allow water to flow through, and make most septic systems “almost impossible to use.” “So in that situation, understandably, many people, especially poor people, have decided not to waste their money on a system that they know is going to fail,” Elliott said. One survey conducted by UA and the Alabama Department of Public Health found that 60 percent of homes surveyed in Wilcox County that weren’t connected to municipal sewer lines had a visible straight pipe. Though disposing of waste through a straight pipe is illegal, most of the people who resort to such methods cannot afford to install a septic system, and in large areas in the Black Belt, most septic systems would not work anyway. The Alabama Department of Public Health has decreased emphasis on fining offenders and instead is focused on finding workable solutions. In recent months, political figures including Cory Booker, Al Gore and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have attempted to draw attention to the area’s struggles, but it’s still not clear just how widespread those problems are. “There’s been publicity around this issue, particularly in Lowndes County, for a long time but the scope of the problem was never really defined,” Elliott said. “It was presented as a series of anecdotes, and that made it hard to define how much it would cost to fix the problem and what solutions would be appropriate.” The students, led by UA graduate student Aaron Blackwell, plan to construct a computer model to estimate how likely a home is to have a straight pipe, based on factors such as soil conditions, existing infrastructure, population density and property values. The students will apply their model to five of the 17 counties traditionally included in Alabama’s Black Belt: Lowndes, Wilcox, Perry, Dallas and Hale Counties. UA’s team is in the first phase of the program, and will attend the TechConnect World Innovation Conference and Expo in Boston in June to showcase its research. The team can then apply for a second-phase grant for funding up to 100,000 to further the project design. Other members of the team include Joseph Weber, UA professor of geological sciences, Sagy Cohen, UA associate professor of geological sciences, and Rebecca Greenberg, a UA graduate student studying geology. The students’ project will be part of a larger collaborative effort involving a group of state and federal health and environmental agencies, universities and elected officials to find solutions to the problems. That group, dubbed the Alabama Rural Water and Wastewater Management Consortium, continues to meet to discuss which potential solutions might work best and how to pay for those solutions. Elliott said one idea that is frequently discussed among the group is identifying clusters of houses that could be grouped together to use smaller-scale treatment systems that that would be more effective than a typical septic system but less expensive than expanding municipal sewer lines to remote areas. Output:","output":"The University of Alabama team, aided by a federal grant, is looking into the widespread use of \\"straight pipe\\" systems for waste disposal in Alabama's Black Belt region due to issues like thick clay soil and poverty, which are significant contributors to sanitation problems, including the occurrence of tropical diseases like hookworm."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What might be the first step of the process?","output":"The first step of the digestion process begins in the mouth, which is also known as the oral cavity. This initial phase is crucial for the breakdown of food and the preparation of nutrients to be utilized by the body. Here is a detailed explanation of the first step and the subsequent stages of the digestion process. 1. Ingestion and Chewing: The act of taking food into the mouth is known as ingestion. Once the food is in the oral cavity, the teeth start breaking it down into smaller pieces through a process called mastication or chewing. This action increases the food's surface area, making it easier for enzymes to act on it. 2. Saliva Secretion and Mixing: The salivary glands in the mouth secrete saliva, which mixes with the food particles. Saliva contains salivary amylase, an enzyme that breaks down carbohydrates like starch into simpler sugars. Saliva also contains mucus, which helps make the ingested food moist and soft, facilitating easier swallowing. 3. Formation of Bolus: The tongue helps in forming the chewed and moistened food into a compact mass called the bolus. Taste buds on the tongue help identify tastes like sweet, salty, bitter, and sour, which can aid in evaluating the quality of ingested food. 4. Swallowing: The bolus is then squeezed down the esophagus, a muscular tube that leads to the stomach, through a process called peristalsis. Peristalsis is the rhythmic contraction and relaxation of the muscular layers of the esophagus, which propel the bolus towards the stomach. 5. Gastric Digestion: Once the bolus reaches the stomach, gastric acid, and enzymes, such as pepsin, commence the process of breaking down proteins. The stomach's muscular churning also helps mix food with gastric juice, turning the bolus into a liquid called chyme. 6. Small Intestine Digestion and Absorption: The partially digested food is passed into the small intestine, where enzymes and fluids from the liver and pancreas continue breaking it down into smaller molecules. Nutrients are then absorbed through the villi, tiny finger-like projections on the inner lining of the small intestine, and enter the bloodstream. 7. Large Intestine and Fecal Formation: Unused materials that the small intestine didn't absorb are passed into the large intestine. Here, water and some electrolytes are absorbed, and the remaining waste materials are compacted to form fecal matter. 8. Elimination: The fecal matter is eventually expelled from the body through the rectum and anus, completing the digestion process. To summarize, the first step of the digestion process involves ingestion and chewing food in the mouth, where it is broken down into smaller pieces and mixed with saliva for easier swallowing and subsequent nutrient extraction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

John Herbert Gleason was born in 1916 at 364 Chauncey Street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. Named Herbert Walton Gleason, Jr., at birth, he was baptized John Herbert Gleason, and  grew up at 328 Chauncey (an address he later used for Ralph and Alice Kramden on The Honeymooners). His parents were Herbert Walton \\"Herb\\" Gleason, an Irish-American insurance auditor, and Mae \\"Maisie\\" (nee Kelly), originally of Farranree, Cork, Ireland. Gleason was one of two children; his brother Clement J. died of meningitis at age 14. Gleason worked his way up to a job at New York's Club 18, where insulting its patrons was the order of the day. Gleason greeted noted skater Sonja Henie by handing her an ice cube and saying, \\"Okay, now do something.\\" It was here that Jack L. Warner first saw Gleason, signing him to a film contract for 250 a week.  By age 24, Gleason was appearing in movies: first for Warner Brothers (as Jackie C. Gleason) in such films as Navy Blues (1941) with Ann Sheridan and Martha Raye and All Through the Night (1941) with Humphrey Bogart, for Columbia Pictures for the B military comedy Tramp, Tramp, Tramp (1942) and finally for Twentieth Century-Fox, where Gleason played Glenn Miller Orchestra bassist Ben Beck in Orchestra Wives (1942). He also had a small part as a soda shop clerk in Larceny, Inc. (1942), with Edward G. Robinson, and a modest part as an actor's agent in the 1942 Betty Grable-Harry James musical Springtime in the Rockies.  During World War II, Gleason was initially exempt from military service, since he was a father of two. However, in 1943 the US started drafting men with children. Gleason reported to his induction where the doctors discovered that his broken left arm had healed crooked, the area between his thumb and forefinger was nerveless and numb, a pilonidal cyst existed at the end of his coccyx, and that he was 100 pounds overweight. Gleason was therefore classified 4-F and rejected for military service.  Gleason did not make a strong impression on Hollywood at first; at the time he developed a nightclub act that included comedy and music. At the end of 1942, Gleason and Lew Parker led a large cast of entertainers in the road show production of Olsen and Johnson's New 1943 Hellzapoppin. He also became known for hosting all-night parties in his hotel suite; the hotel soundproofed his suite out of consideration for its other guests. \\"Anyone who knew Jackie Gleason in the 1940s\\", wrote CBS historian Robert Metz, \\"would tell you The Fat Man would never make it. His pals at Lindy's watched him spend money as fast as he soaked up the booze.\\"  Gleason's first significant recognition as an entertainer came on Broadway when he appeared in the hit musical Follow the Girls (1944).

Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"The maturation of more birds will have no direct effect on the production of more ice cubes. The process of making ice cubes is entirely separate and unrelated to bird populations. The supposed perturbation will not influence the production of ice cubes, so there will be no effect on the second effect mentioned."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

According to Belgian newspaper De Standaard, Buffett, the world's richest man, not only supports Inbev's offer, he is scheduled to meet Anheuser Chief Executive August Busch IV about it. InBev (other-otc: INBVF - news - people ) shares rose 1.6%, or 74 cents, to close at 48.58 in New York, while Anheuser gained 1.1%, or 67 cents, to 61.20. If Buffett, whose Berkshire-Hathaway is Aheuser's second-largest investor with 35.3 million shares, or a 5.0% stake, publicly backs InBev's offer, other investors in the American brewer are likely to be take heed, said one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity. Anheuser-Busch (nyse: BUD - news - people ) shares have never reached 65.00, which is what InBev is offering to acquire the company. The stock was trading around the 48.00 mark when Buffett first bought his stake in early 2005, and they were still trading at around that level last April, before reports about interest from InBev first emerged. \\"If you are an Anheuser shareholder, the offer looks pretty attractive,\\" said Paul Hofman, an analyst with Cheuvreux. \\"Buffett is a shareholder and he wants the best price for the shares. His backing of the bid seems logical.\\" Buffett may be interested in a cash offer or even a share swap. While Anheuser's shares have been stagnant since the billionaire's investment in 2005, InvBev's have nearly doubled. And Buffett has recently been scouring Europe for good investments in order to diversify himself out of dollar assets. (See: \\"Buffett Going Shopping In Europe\\") Last week Anheuser-Busch, which was apparently seeking to avoid the embrace of Belgian-Brazilian brewer InBev, got the cold shoulder from Mexican brewer Grupo Modelo (other-otc: GPMCF - news - people ). Just as Anheuser would prefer to remain American, Modelo said it wanted to stay Mexican, though it did not rule out the idea of being bought. (See: \\" Modelo Frosty To Anheuser-Busch\\") A deal between InBev and Anheuser would constitute the biggest ever takeover of an alcoholic beverages company and create the world's largest brewer, headquartered in Belgium. InBev itself is the result of an earlier brewing mega-merger, the 2004 amalgamation of Belgium's Interbrew and the Brazi's Ambev. Its brands include Stella Artois and Beck's. InBev Chief Executive Carlos Brito visited Capitol Hill on Tuesday to promote the takeover. He told reporters the 65 per share offer was the highest the company would bid. Some analysts have said InBev would have to raise the offer closer to 70 in order to secure the deal. When asked whether InBev has reached out to Buffett or Mexican brewer Grupo Modelo, Brito said, \\"Right now we're trying to engage with [the Anheuser-Busch] board; that's the top of the agenda.\\" Brito has said he hoped for a friendly deal with Anheuser, and would keep the company in St. Louis, Mo. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), who serves on the Senate Commerce Committee, did not have a friendly reaction. McCaskill, who served Budweiser beer to attendees of the discussion, said afterward, \\"I was very up front I explained to them that I would do everything I could to stop this sale from going through.\\" The senator said she was concerned the takeover could threaten pensions of Anheuser employees and \\"good middle-class jobs\\" the brewer has provided in her state. Reuters contributed to this article. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"A very rich man named Warren Buffett might help a company called InBev buy another company called Anheuser-Busch. Anheuser-Busch makes a famous drink called Budweiser beer. InBev wants to pay a lot of money for Anheuser-Busch, but some people don't want the company to be sold. Warren Buffett owns a part of Anheuser-Busch and if he supports the deal, it could help InBev buy the company."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given these facts, what controls anti-aging among the following options: - A computer  - air  - chemical messengers  - ice  - an electric stove  - Electrical energy  - water  - Chemical energy A:","output":"Anti-aging is predominantly controlled by chemical messengers, specifically hormones, within the human body. Hormones play a crucial role in regulating various biological processes, such as growth, metabolism, reproduction, and stress response. Growth hormone, also known as somatotropin, is a peptide hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland. It stimulates growth, cell reproduction, and regeneration in humans and animals, contributing to both physical and cellular growth throughout the body. As an anti-aging hormone, growth hormone has been shown to improve bone density, increase muscle mass, reduce body fat, enhance cardiovascular function, and improve skin elasticity. Growth hormone works in conjunction with other hormones, such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which is produced in the liver in response to growth hormone secretion. Together, these hormones play essential roles in regulating cellular growth, division, and maintenance. In addition to growth hormone, other critical hormones in anti-aging processes include: 1. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA): A steroid hormone produced by the adrenal glands, DHEA is a precursor to the production of both androgens and estrogens. DHEA levels decline with age, leading to a decrease in the production of sex hormones, which are essential for maintaining overall health and vitality. 2. Melatonin: Produced by the pineal gland in the brain, melatonin is a hormone responsible for regulating sleep patterns. Adequate and restful sleep is essential for rejuvenation and cellular repair, thus contributing to anti-aging effects. 3. Estrogen and Testosterone: These sex hormones play crucial roles in maintaining bone density, muscle mass, cardiovascular health, and cognitive function. A balance of estrogen and testosterone is essential for overall health and well-being, with imbalances leading to various aging-related symptoms. 4. Thyroid hormones (T3 and T4): These hormones regulate cellular metabolism, body temperature, and energy levels. Proper function of the thyroid gland and the maintenance of optimal T3 and T4 levels can contribute to overall health, mood, and energy levels, thus contributing to anti-aging effects. The other options listed, such as a computer, air, ice, an electric stove, electrical energy, water, and chemical energy, do not have direct control over the anti-aging process. While some of these elements (air, water, and certain types of energy) may contribute to overall health and well-being, they do not have a direct impact on the hormonal regulation of anti-aging. Instead, it is the complex interplay of hormones and chemical messengers within the body that controls the aging process and contributes to overall longevity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He was an absolute delight to work with…very solicitous of his wife all throughout, very cooperative with the staff, and very appreciative of the help we were giving the mother-to-be. The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves.

In 1962, Byrd collaborated with Stan Getz on the album \\"Jazz Samba\\", a recording which brought bossa nova into the mainstream of North American music.  - Bossa nova is a genre of Brazilian music, which developed and was popularized in the 1950s and 1960s and is today one of the best-known Brazilian music genres abroad. The phrase \\"bossa nova\\" means literally \\"new trend\\". A lyrical fusion of samba and jazz, bossa nova acquired a large following in the 1960s, initially among young musicians and college students.  - Stanley \\"Stan\\" Getz (February 2, 1927  June 6, 1991) was an American jazz saxophonist. Playing primarily the tenor saxophone, Getz was known as \\"The Sound\\" because of his warm, lyrical tone, his prime influence being the wispy, mellow timbre of his idol, Lester Young. Coming to prominence in the late 1940s with Woody Herman's big band, Getz is described by critic Scott Yanow as \\"one of the all-time great tenor saxophonists\\". Getz went on to perform in bebop and cool jazz groups, but is perhaps best known for popularizing bossa nova with the worldwide hit single \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\" (1964) performed with Astrud Gilberto, and for his work done under the influence of João Gilberto and Antônio Carlos Jobim.  - A pseudonym (and ) or alias is a name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their original or true name (orthonym). Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym.  - Jazz Samba is a bossa nova album by Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd released by Verve Records in 1962. \\"Jazz Samba\\" signaled the beginning of the bossa nova craze in America. Stan Getz was the featured soloist and the tracks were arranged by Charlie Byrd, who had first heard bossa nova during a tour of Brazil in 1961.  - Frederick Eugene John \\"Gene\\" Lees (February 8, 1928  April 22, 2010) was a Canadian music critic, biographer, lyricist, and former journalist. Lees worked as a newspaper journalist in his native Canada before moving to the United States, where he was a music critic and lyricist. His lyrics for Antonio Carlos Jobim's \\"Corcovado\\" (released as \\"Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars\\"), have been recorded by such notable singers as Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Queen Latifah, and Diana Krall. Lees married his wife Janet in 1971.  - \\"Desafinado\\", a Portuguese word (usually rendered into English as \\"Out of Tune\\", or as \\"Off Key\\"), is the title of a bossa nova song composed by Antonio Carlos Jobim with lyrics (in Portuguese) by Newton Mendonça. The English language lyrics were written by Jon Hendricks and \\"Jessie Cavanaugh\\" (a pseudonym used by The Richmond Organisation). Another English lyric, more closely based on the original Portuguese lyric (but not a translation) was written by Gene Lees, and appears on some recordings as well. The version by Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd (from the album \\"Jazz Samba\\") was a major hit in 1962, reaching number 15 and number 4 on \\"Billboard\\"s pop and easy-listening charts, respectively; their definitive rendering also reached number 11 in the UK, while Ella Fitzgerald's version made number 38. The song was voted by the Brazilian edition of \\"Rolling Stone\\" as the 14th greatest Brazilian song.  - Rolling Stone is an American biweekly magazine that focuses on popular culture. It was founded in San Francisco in 1967 by Jann Wenner, who is still the magazine's publisher, and the music critic Ralph J. Gleason.

In the 1990s, the magazine shifted focus to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors, and popular music. In recent years, it has resumed its traditional mix of content.  - Ella Jane Fitzgerald (April 25, 1917  June 15, 1996) was an American jazz singer often referred to as the First Lady of Song, Queen of Jazz and Lady Ella. She was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing and intonation, and a \\"horn-like\\" improvisational ability, particularly in her scat singing.  - Antônio Carlos Brasileiro de Almeida Jobim (January 25, 1927December 8, 1994), also known as Tom Jobim, was a Brazilian composer, pianist, songwriter, arranger and singer. He was a primary force behind the creation of the bossa nova style, and his songs have been performed by many singers and instrumentalists within Brazil and internationally.  - Jon Hendricks (born September 16, 1921) is an American jazz lyricist and singer. He is considered one of the originators of vocalese, which adds lyrics to existing instrumental songs and replaces many instruments with vocalists (such as the big-band arrangements of Duke Ellington and Count Basie). Furthermore, he is considered one of the best practitioners of scat singing, which involves vocal jazz soloing.

Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes.  Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"To improve legal facilities\\" correctly answer the question \\"Why does the Illinois Supreme Court want to raise the registration rates for Illinois lawyers?\\"? Available options:  1). no;  2). yes;","output":"2). yes; The Illinois Supreme Court wants to raise the registration rates for Illinois lawyers to improve legal facilities for the poor. The fee hikes will help support pro-bono services and generate more funds for non-profit legal aid groups, which have faced a decline in funding due to low interest rates and a struggling economy. By raising the registration fees, the court aims to address the declining revenues and help provide better legal services to those who need it most.

Read this and answer the question Czech (/ˈtʃɛk/; čeština Czech pronunciation: [ˈt͡ʃɛʃcɪna]), formerly known as Bohemian (/boʊˈhiːmiən, bə-/; lingua Bohemica in Latin), is a West Slavic language strongly influenced by Latin and German language, spoken by over 10 million people and it is the official language of the Czech Republic. Czech's closest relative is Slovak, with which it is mutually intelligible. It is closely related to other West Slavic languages, such as Silesian and Polish. Although most Czech vocabulary is based on shared roots with Slavic, Romance, and Germanic languages, many loanwords (most associated with high culture) have been adopted in recent years. What languages strongly influenced Czech?","output":"The Czech language has been strongly influenced by two main languages: Latin and German.  Latin's influence on Czech can be traced back to the Middle Ages. During this period, Latin was widely used in areas such as science, law, and religion, leading to an influx of Latin words and phrases into the Czech language. Moreover, Latin was the language of the church and the royal court, adding to its influence. The German language influence on Czech can be attributed to the historical interactions between the German-speaking and Czech-speaking populations in Central Europe. The geographic closeness of Czech lands to German-speaking regions played a considerable role in this influence. Over the centuries, the linguistic exchange has been significant. During the Habsburg rule of Czech lands, German served as the language of administration and higher education, contributing to the Germanic influence on the Czech language. Additionally, it's worth noting that Czech has also been influenced by Slavic, Romance, and other Germanic languages. The language has also assimilated many loanwords, often associated with high culture, into its vocabulary in recent years."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Background: The sloping surface of the inclined plane supports part of the weight of the object as it moves up the slope. As a result, it takes less force to move the object uphill. The trade-off is that the object must be moved over a greater distance than if it were moved straight up to the higher elevation. On the other hand, the output force is greater than the input force because it is applied over a shorter distance. Like other simple machines, the ideal mechanical advantage of an inclined plane is given by  Paragraph: Adams needs to roll a piano into his new house. The piano is very heavy and unfortunately he isn't strong enough to lift it up his front steps.  A friend of his suggests he get a ramp since it will support part of the weight allowing him to push it into his house much easier.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will Adam have an easier time lifting a heavy refrigerator into his new house or pushing it up a ramp? A:","output":"Adam will have an easier time pushing the heavy refrigerator up a ramp rather than lifting it into his new house. This is because the ramp, acting as an inclined plane, will support part of the weight of the refrigerator as it moves up the slope. The trade-off is that the refrigerator must be moved over a greater distance than if it were lifted straight up to the higher elevation, but the output force is also greater than the input force because it is applied over a shorter distance.

This indicates that a Kennedy played a key role in causing the incident, while the person who suffered as a result was not from the Kennedy family. Furthermore, the premise states that Ted Kennedy's invocation of the family curse was a clever way of papering over these differences. This suggests that the involvement of a Kennedy family member in the tragedy was downplayed by invoking the notion of a family curse, which could potentially shift he perception to indicate that the Kennedy family was also a victim in some way.

Question: The autumn storms had what effect on the North Sea by 1870? Context: The French Marines and naval infantry intended for the invasion of northern Germany were dispatched to reinforce the French Army of Châlons and fell into captivity at Sedan along with Napoleon III. A shortage of officers, following the capture of most of the professional French army at the Siege of Metz and at the Battle of Sedan, led naval officers to be sent from their ships to command hastily assembled reservists of the Garde Mobile. As the autumn storms of the North Sea forced the return of more of the French ships, the blockade of the north German ports diminished and in September 1870 the French navy abandoned the blockade for the winter. The rest of the navy retired to ports along the English Channel and remained in port for the rest of the war.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   While the numerical aperture can be used to compare resolutions of various objectives, it does not indicate how far the lens could be from the specimen. This is specified by the “working distance,” which is the distance (in mm usually) from the front lens element of the objective to the specimen, or cover glass. The higher the NA the closer the lens will be to the specimen and the more chances there are of breaking the cover slip and damaging both the specimen and the lens. The focal length of an objective lens is different than the working distance. This is because objective lenses are made of a combination of lenses and the focal length is measured from inside the barrel. The working distance is a parameter that microscopists can use more readily as it is measured from the outermost lens. The working distance decreases as the NA and magnification both increase.

First, I lived in a cottage that was in an old motel. It had a cottage in front where the landlady lived and there were ten little cottages in a half-moon configuration around it. Ours was a party place and we didn't have a phone. This was in the early 1970's. The landlady was in her 50's I'd guess. The only phone was a pay-phone outside her cottage and it was o party line with her phone. When we used it, she would try to listen, especially if we were talking to a girl. We could tell and sometimes we'd ask he to hang up, but other times we'd talk about sexy stuff and let her listen. We could hear her breathing heavy when we did. When we'd be parting, she'd come to the door wearing sexy clothes that were completely inappropriate and want to be invited in. Though we were a bunch of horny sailors, no one wanted any part of that. We never let her come in. I got married and moved into an apartment that was three rooms in a huge old house. They closed that Navy base and all of the sailors were transferred elsewhere. There were bumper-stickers that said, \\"Will the last sailor to leave, please turn out the lights.\\" In those days, Newport was a small town that leached off of sailors. My landlord said that when my wife and I were completely out and it was completely clean, he'd refund my deposit. We left the apartment immaculately clean and he wouldn't refund my deposit.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Monte Beragon, the second husband of Mildred Pierce, is shot. The police tell Mildred that the murderer is her first husband, Bert Pierce, after he is interrogated and confesses to the crime. Mildred protests that he is too kind and gentle to commit murder, and reveals her life story to the investigating officer in flashback. Mildred and Bert are unhappily married. Mildred must bake and sell pies and cakes to support the family after Bert splits with his business partner, Wally Fay. Bert bitterly accuses Mildred of favoring their daughters, especially Veda, over him. Their quarrel intensifies after a phone call from Bert's mistress, Maggie Biederhof, and they decide to separate. Mildred retains custody of her two daughters, the 16-year-old Veda, a bratty social climber and aspiring pianist, and 10-year-old Kay, a tomboy. Mildred's principal goal is to provide material possessions for Veda, who longs for a social status above that of her family and is ashamed of her mother's work as a baker. When Mildred is forced to take a job as a waitress, she tries to hide the fact from Veda, but Veda learns the truth and treats her mother with derision. Mildred meets Monte Beragon, a Pasadena society playboy and heir whose inheritance is almost depleted. Beragon owns the building that Mildred wants to purchase for a restaurant, and he pursues a romantic interest in her.

Here's why: A paraphrase is a restatement of the meaning of a text or passage using other words. The goal is to convey the same information using different words and structure while preserving the original meaning. In the first sentence, it's stated that \\"According to the United States Census Bureau, Harmony Township has a total area of, of which is land and , or 5.21%, is water.\\" The sentence features unspecified total area and land contents, but it does provide specific information about the water composition, which takes up 5.21% of the total area. The second sentence says, \\"According to the United States Census Bureau, Harmony Township has a total area of which land is and, or 5.21%, is water.\\" Like the first sentence, it does not specify the total area and land contents. It also provides specific information about the water composition, accounting for 5.21% of the total area. While these two sentences have similarities in their structure and they both reference data from the United States Census Bureau about the composition of Harmony Township, they aren't exact paraphrases of each other mainly because there are missing information in both sentences and it feels incomplete. They leave out significant facts such as the exact total land and water area, so one cannot be used to represent the other in full. Without the complete information, we are unable to accurately assess if they are genuine paraphrases.  They share some elements, however, so if the missing information were the same in both sentences, it could be possible that they would be paraphrases of each other. But in the form as they're given now, they are not exact paraphrases based on the definition and general understanding of paraphrasing. To paraphrase correctly, all the key information from the original sentence needs to be preserved, but presented differently."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Post's Lena Sun visited Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, Md., where scientists there identified a strain of bacteria resistant to the last-resort antibiotic, colistin. The bacteria was found in a Pennsylvania woman. Microbiologist Patrick McGann explains how his team identified the gene that gives the bacteria this resistance (Monica Akhtar,Lena Sun/The Washington Post)      For the first time, researchers have found a person in the United States carrying bacteria resistant to antibiotics of last resort, an alarming development that the top U.S. public health official says could mean “the end of the road” for antibiotics.      The antibiotic-resistant strain was found last month in the urine of a 49-year-old Pennsylvania woman. Defense Department researchers determined that she carried a strain of E. coli resistant to the antibiotic colistin, according to a study published Thursday in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, a publication of the American Society for Microbiology. The authors wrote that the discovery “heralds the emergence of a truly pan-drug resistant bacteria.”      [How these biomedical detectives identified the dreaded new superbug in U.S.]      Colistin is the antibiotic of last resort for particularly dangerous types of superbugs, including a family of bacteria known as CRE, which health officials have dubbed “nightmare bacteria.” In some instances, these superbugs kill up to 50 percent of patients who become infected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has called CRE among the country’s most urgent public health threats.      Health officials said the case in Pennsylvania, by itself, is not cause for panic. The strain found in the woman is still treatable with other antibiotics. But researchers worry that its colistin-resistance gene, known as mcr-1, could spread to other bacteria that can already evade other antibiotics.      [Superbug known as ‘phantom menace’ on the rise in U.S.]      It’s the first time this colistin-resistant strain has been found in a person in the United States. In November, public health officials worldwide reacted with alarm when Chinese and British researchers reported finding the colistin-resistant strain in pigs and raw pork and in a small number of people in China. The deadly strain was later discovered in Europe and elsewhere.      In this Nov. 2015 video, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Thomas Frieden said that the CDC is committed to fighting antibiotic resistance. (YouTube/CDC)      “It basically shows us that the end of the road isn’t very far away for antibiotics — that we may be in a situation where we have patients in our intensive care units, or patients getting urinary-tract infections for which we do not have antibiotics,” CDC Director Tom Frieden said in an interview Thursday.      [1 in 3 antibiotics prescribed in U.S. are unnecessary]      “I’ve been there for TB patients. I’ve cared for patients for whom there are no drugs left. It is a feeling of such horror and helplessness,” Frieden added. “This is not where we need to be.”      Separately, researchers at the Agriculture Department and the Department of Health and Human Services reported that testing of hundreds of livestock and retail meats turned up the same colistin-resistant bacteria in a sample from a pig intestine in the United States. USDA said it is working to identify the farm the pig came from.      CDC officials are working with Pennsylvania health authorities to interview the patient and family to identify how she may have contracted the bacteria, including reviewing recent hospitalizations and other health-care exposures. The CDC hopes to screen the patient and her contacts to see if others might be carrying the organism. Local and state health departments also will be collecting cultures as part of the investigation.      ['A nightmare superbug': What is it? And what are the risks?]      The woman was treated in an outpatient military facility in Pennsylvania, according to a Defense Department blog post about the findings. Samples were sent to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for initial testing. Additional testing was done by a special Defense Department system that tracks multi-drug-resistant organisms.      Thursday’s study did not disclose further details about the Pennsylvania woman or the outcome of her case. The authors could not be reached for comment. A spokesman at the Pennsylvania Department of Health was not immediately available to comment on the case.      Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolfe (D) issued a statement saying his administration immediately began working with the CDC and the Defense Department to coordinate \\"an appropriate and collaborative\\" response.      [Feds ramp up efforts to deal with antibiotic resistance]      \\"We are taking the emergence of this resistance gene very seriously,\\" he said, adding that authorities will take all necessary actions to prevent it from becoming a widespread problem with \\"potentially serious consequences.\\"      Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.) said he is concerned about the reports. In a statement, Casey said he supported legislation for and participated in hearings about antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which he said “present an urgent public health problem that we must focus on intensively.” He said he planned to get a full briefing on the case in the coming days.      Colistin is widely used in Chinese livestock, and this probably led bacteria to evolve and gain a resistance to the drug. The gene probably leaped from livestock to human microbes through food, said Yohei Doi, an infectious-disease doctor at the University of Pittsburgh who has studied the problem.      This animated video from 2013 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention highlights the key points and graphics of the \\"Antibiotic Threats in the United States\\" report. (YouTube/CDC)      \\"Food handlers may be at higher risk,\\" he said. In places like China, where live animal markets are often in close proximity to food stalls, it may be more likely for the bacteria to spread from animals to humans.      He and other experts in infectious diseases called for speedier action to curb the overuse of antibiotics in livestock worldwide.      \\"It's hard to imagine worse for public health in the United States,\\" Lance Price, director of the Antibiotic Resistance Action Center and a George Washington University professor, said Thursday in a statement about the case. \\"We may soon be facing a world where CRE infections are untreatable.\\"      Scientists rang the alarm bells about the gene in November, but not enough attention was paid. \\"Now we find that this gene has made its way into pigs and people, and people in the U.S.,\\" Price said. \\"If our leaders were waiting to act until they could see the cliff's edge -- I hope this opens their eyes to the abyss that lies before us.\\"      Scientists and public health officials have long warned that if the resistant bacteria continue to spread, treatment options could be seriously limited. Routine operations could become deadly. Minor infections could become life-threatening crises. Pneumonia could be more and more difficult to treat.      Already, doctors had been forced to rely on colistin as a last-line defense against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The drug is hardly ideal. It is more than half a century old and can seriously damage a patient’s kidneys. And yet, because doctors have run out of weapons to fight a growing number of infections that evade more-modern antibiotics, it has become a critical tool in fighting off some of the most tenacious infections.      Bacteria develop antibiotic resistance in two ways. Many acquire mutations in their own genomes that allow them to withstand antibiotics, although that ability can’t be shared with pathogens outside their own family.      [Scientists discover why pancreatic cancer resists chemotherapy drug]      Other bacteria rely on a shortcut: They get infected with something called a plasmid, a small piece of DNA, carrying a gene for antibiotic resistance. That makes resistance genes more dangerous because plasmids can make copies of themselves and transfer the genes they carry to other bugs within the same family as well as jump to other families of bacteria, which can then “catch” the resistance directly without having to develop it through evolution.      The colistin-resistant E. coli found in the Pennsylvania woman has this type of resistance gene.      Public health officials say they have been expecting this resistance gene to turn up in the United States.      “This is definitely alarming,” said David Hyun, a senior officer leading an antibiotic-resistance project at the Pew Charitable Trust. “The fact that we found it in the United States confirms our suspicions and adds urgency to actions we need to work on antibiotic stewardship and surveillance for this type of resistance.”      Late last year, as part of a broader budget deal, Congress agreed to give hundreds of millions of dollars to the federal agencies engaged in the battle against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.      The largest chunk of that money, more than 150 million, was slated to go to the CDC as part of an effort to build and strengthen capacity at state and local health departments to prevent and monitor superbug outbreaks.      Other funding went to the National Institutes of Health for research on combating antimicrobial resistance, as well as to an agency known as BARDA, which works on national preparedness for chemical and biological threats, including developing new therapies.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.      / Updated By Maggie Fox      A drug-resistant “superbug” that doctors have been dreading has shown up in the U.S. for the first time, researchers reported Thursday.      The bacteria has genetic changes that make it resistant to a last-ditch antibiotic called colistin and while it had been seen in Europe and China, no one in the U.S. had been seen with it before.      A team at the Walter Reed Army Institute for Research identified a strain of E coli from a Pennsylvania woman that carries a much-feared gene called mcr-1 that turns bacteria into \\"superbugs. Here, a lab worker tests some of the sample. Walter Reed Army Institute of Research      It doesn’t spell doom just yet.      The mutant E. coli germ was found in a Pennsylvania woman with symptoms of a urinary tract infection, but it does not appear to be spreading at epidemic proportions. And it was susceptible to other antibiotics, so the patient was not left without any hope.      What's worrying is the gene that made the E. coli drug-resistant. It's called mcr-1, and it is passed from one bacteria to another. It sits on a piece of material called a plasmid, which makes it easy for one species of bacteria to pass it along to another species of bacteria.      Scientist fear an E. coli bacteria with the mcr-1 gene could pass it to another superbug with other mutations-- creating a truly super-superbug that resists all known antibiotics.      \\"It is the end of the road for antibiotics unless we act urgently.\\"      If such a superbug spread, it would take the world back to a time when there were no antibiotics, says Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.      \\"It is the end of the road for antibiotics unless we act urgently,\\" he said.      This discovery suggests the drug-resistance gene has been here in the U.S., flying under the radar.      “This patient hadn’t traveled,” Frieden said.      Patrick McGann and colleagues at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research just outside Washington D.C. have been looking at samples from patients, keeping an eye out for bacteria with the mutation.      They reported Thursday they found one. The sample is E. coli bacteria with mcr-1.      \\"I was extremely surprised when it came up positive,\\" McGann told NBC News. It was the very first sample his lab tested in the new search for the gene.      This little stretch of DNA, which bacteria can swap easily among themselves, gives them the ability to fight off the effects of colistin.      \\"It was an old antibiotic, but it was the only one left for what I called nightmare bacteria, carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae, or CRE,\\" Frieden said.      Luckily, this particular bacteria was not also resistant to carbapenems. But it was resistant to several other classes of antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones, and the fact that it had the mcr-1 gene raises alarm bells.      “To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mcr-1 in the USA,” the Walter Reed researchers wrote in their report, published in the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy.      They’ve only been looking for this particular mutation for three weeks, so they said they’re not sure just how widespread it is.      “We know now that the more we look, the more we are going to find,” Frieden said in a speech at the National Press Club in Washington. “The more we look at drug resistance, the more concerned we become.”      Later Thursday, the health and Human Services Department said scientists had also found the mcr-1 mutation in a sample from a pig. \\"Out of 949 animal samples screened so far, one strain of colistin-resistant E. coli was found in a pig intestinal sample,\\" it said in a statement.      \\"The DNA sequence of this isolate revealed that the strain contained the mcr-1 gene on a plasmid. The scientists also determined that the mcr-1 carrying colistin-resistantE. coli is resistant to other antibiotics including ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline.\\"      CDC has been warning for years about the threat of drug-resistant bacteria. It’s been urging drug companies to develop new antibiotics, and asking people to make better use of the antibiotics now available so that more superbugs do not evolve.      “The medicine cabinet is empty for some patients,” Frieden said.      The CDC said it was working with the state health department in Pennsylvania to talk to the patient and her family to see how she may have been infected.      \\"We know now that the more we look, the more we are going to find.\\"      They’ll also test others in the area who may have been in contact to see if they are carrying the bacteria – which may not necessarily cause illness or any symptoms at all.      \\"An urgent public health response is underway to contain and prevent potential spread of mcr-1,\\" Walter Reed said in a statement.      Dr. David Hyun of the Pew Charitable Trusts, who follows the issue of drug-resistant bacteria, said details will be important. \\"I am very interested in finding out how did this patient do,\\" he told NBC News. \\"What kind of treatment did she receive?\\"      There have been reports in other countries of patients with bacteria carrying mcr-1, but not many details of how they were cared for or whether other antibiotics cured their infections.      Related: Patients Carry Superbugs on Their Hands      Colistin, used to treat carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae or CRE, is an older antibiotic with some tough side-effects such as kidney damage. That's why it's only used as a last resort.      Hyun said in several of the international cases, people have been infected with CRE that carried the mcr-1 gene. That would leave them with few, if any, option for treatment. \\"If we are finding it in other countries, chances are that it's already happened in the United States as well,\\" he said.      Bacteria develop resistance to drugs quickly. Even before penicillin was introduced in 1943, staphylococcus germs had genes that would have made them resistant to its effects.      Just nine years after tetracycline was introduced in 1950, a resistant strain of Shigella evolved. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) evolved just two years after methicillin hit the market in 1960. The last new antibiotic to be introduced was ceftaroline, in 2010. It took just a year for the first staph germ to evolve that resisted its effects.      The CDC says more than two million people are infected by drug-resistant germs each year, and 23,000 die of their infections. The biggest killer by far in the U.S. is diarrhea-causing C. difficile.      Near-untreatable cases of diarrhea, sepsis, pneumonia and gonorrhea are infecting millions more globally, the World Health Organization says. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"A strain of E.coli bacteria found in a woman from Pennsylvania is the first case of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the US. Although the strain is resistant to antibiotics such as colistin, it remains treatable by other means. The US is now at risk to the rise of untreatable bacteria, as the E.coli bacteria contains the colistin-resistant mcr-1 gene, which can spread easily to bacteria that are immune to other antibiotics, thereby making antibiotic-resistant infections more difficult to treat.

Ever wanted to know just how much Hollywood could get away with before the Hayes Code was officially put into effect? Well, unfortunately \\"Convention City\\" is lost, so well just have to watch \\"Tarzan and His Mate\\" to find out. For 1934, there is a remarkable amount of sexual innuendo and even exposed flesh. Just look at Jane's nude swim. While Tarzan is often thought of as b-adventure films made for young boys and no one else, this picture proves that the series was originally very adult. Over seventy years later, it is still as sexy as it was when it came out. In addition to the envelope pushing taboo nature, it is a superb and exciting adventure story. I've always enjoyed the jungle films that Hollywood churned out in the 30s and the 40s, but there are few from the genre I'd call great films. \\"Tarzan and His Mate\\" is by far the best film from this long gone subgenre. The sequences of the attacks on the safari by either apes or natives still manage to create tension today. Also, the animals are all too cool (espescially the apes throwing boulders). The acting won't win any major awards soon, but is certainly more than adequate for this type of picture. The film is once again stolen by Cheetah, the smartest monkey in the jungle.

Question: New evidence suggests that \\"hot spots\\" may form in response to \\"twisting\\" stresses on plates. It is theorized that these stresses may eventually result in the splitting apart of the tectonic plate in the area of the hot spot. Which of the geographic features would be affected most by the splitting of a tectonic plate? Answer:","output":"The splitting of a tectonic plate would have a significant impact on various geographic features in the area of the \\"hot spot.\\" Some of the most affected geographic features would include: 1. Mountain Ranges: When tectonic plates split apart, large chunks of the Earth's crust may be displaced, leading to the creation of new mountain ranges or the modification of existing ones. This can significantly alter the local landscape and ecology by affecting precipitation patterns, creating new ecosystems, and generating new habitats for various species. In some cases, mountain ranges can also disappear, causing major changes to regional geography. 2. Volcanoes: Volcanic activity is closely associated with tectonic plate movements, and the splitting of a plate can lead to the formation of new volcanoes or the reactivation of dormant ones. Due to the movement and interaction of magma beneath the Earth's crust, the splitting of a tectonic plate can increase the likelihood of volcanic eruptions in the affected region. This can have significant implications for local populations, who may be exposed to the hazards associated with volcanic activity, including ashfall, lahars, and pyroclastic flows. 3. Earthquakes: As tectonic plates split apart and interact with one another, stress accumulates along the boundaries between plates, leading to an increased likelihood of earthquakes. These seismic events can cause significant damage to infrastructure, disrupt transportation and communication networks, and pose a serious threat to human life. In some instances, the splitting of a tectonic plate can even trigger major earthquakes that can have devastating effects on entire regions. 4. Rift Valleys: The opening and widening of rift valleys is a direct consequence of the splitting of tectonic plates. As plates pull apart, rift valleys form and can often fill with water, creating large lakes or even seas. This can significantly impact water resources, migration patterns of species, and the overall landscape of the affected region. 5. Oceanic Trenches: The process of seafloor spreading and tectonic plate movement can cause the formation of deep trenches in the ocean floor. This occurs as one tectonic plate is pushed beneath another, resulting in the subduction of a portion of the Earth's crust. Oceanic trenches can have a significant impact on ocean circulation patterns, marine ecosystems, and the distribution of nutrients in the affected area. 6. Coastal Erosion and Creation: As tectonic plates split, continents and islands may be physically shifted or even separated, resulting in the rapid erosion or creation of coastal features like beaches, cliffs, and inlets. This can have a significant impact on local ecosystems, as well as on human settlements and infrastructure located near the coastlines. In conclusion, the splitting of a tectonic plate could lead to significant changes in the geographic features of the region surrounding the \\"hot spot.\\" Mountain ranges, volcanoes, earthquakes, rift valleys, oceanic trenches and coastal features would be the most affected by this geological process. As these features evolve, the resulting alterations to the landscape can have far-reaching consequences for both local ecosystems and human populations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Irving, was an English stage actor in the Victorian era, known as an actor-manager because he took complete responsibility (supervision of sets, lighting, direction, casting, as well as playing the leading roles) for season after season at the Lyceum Theatre, establishing himself and his company as representative of English classical theatre. In 1895 he became the first actor to be awarded a knighthood, indicating full acceptance into the higher circles of British society. Irving is widely acknowledged to be one of the inspirations for Count Dracula, the title character of the 1897 novel Dracula whose author, Bram Stoker, was business manager of the theatre. After a few years' schooling while living at Halsetown, near St Ives, Cornwall, Irving became a clerk to a firm of East India merchants in London, but he soon gave up a commercial career for acting. On 29 September 1856 he made his first appearance at Sunderland as Gaston, Duke of Orleans, in Bulwer Lytton's play, Richelieu, billed as Henry Irving. This name he eventually assumed by royal licence. When the inexperienced Irving got stage fright and was hissed off the stage the actor Samuel Johnson was among those who supported him with practical advice. Later in life Irving gave them all regular work when he formed his own Company at the Lyceum Theatre.  For 10 years, he went through an arduous training in various stock companies in Scotland and the north of England, taking more than 500 parts.  his delineations of the various characters (...) were admirably graphic, and met with repeated rounds of applause. Possesed of a fine voice, which he modulated with great taste and judgment, he was able to mark the depth or frivolity of the character he was representing with remarkable facility.  He gained recognition by degrees, and in 1866 Ruth Herbert engaged him as her leading man and sometime stage director at the St. James's Theatre, London, where she first played Doricourt in The Belle's Stratagem. One piece that he directed there was W. S. Gilbert's first successful solo play, Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack (1866) The next year he joined the company of the newly opened Queen's Theatre, where he acted with Charles Wyndham, J. L. Toole, Lionel Brough, John Clayton, Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Wigan, Ellen Terry and Nellie Farren. This was followed by short engagements at the Haymarket Theatre, Drury Lane, and the Gaiety Theatre. Finally he made his first conspicuous success as Digby Grant in James Albery's Two Roses, which was produced at the Vaudeville Theatre on 4 June 1870 and ran for a very successful 300 nights.  In 1871, Irving began his association with the Lyceum Theatre by an engagement under Bateman's management. The fortunes of the house were at a low ebb when the tide was turned by Irving's sudden success as Mathias in The Bells, a version of Erckmann-Chatrian's Le Juif polonais by Leopold Lewis, a property which Irving had found for himself. The play ran for 150 nights, established Irving at the forefront of the British drama, and would prove a popular vehicle for Irving for the rest of his professional life. With Bateman, Irving was seen in W. G. Wills' Charles I and Eugene Aram, in Richelieu, and in 1874 in Hamlet. The unconventionality of this last performance, during a run of 200 nights, aroused keen discussion and singled him out as the most interesting English actor of his day. In 1875, again with Bateman, he was seen as the title character in Macbeth; in 1876 as Othello, and as Philip in Alfred Lord Tennyson's Queen Mary; in 1877 in Richard III; and in The Lyons Mail. During this time he became lifelong friends with Bram Stoker, who praised him in his review of Hamlet and thereafter joined Irving as the manager for the company.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Background: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  Paragraph: Two groups of adults were a part of a diet experiment. Group Brown ate 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months, while group Yellow, had a normal diet. Group Brown gained a lot of weight.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group has a smaller chance of getting more health problems? A:","output":"Group Yellow Given the paragraph above, Group Yellow, which followed a normal diet, has a smaller chance of getting more health problems. This is because Group Brown consumed 3500 extra calories a day for three months, leading to significant weight gain. As mentioned in the background information, obesity (which is defined as having a BMI of 30.0 kg/m² or greater) increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Since Group Brown gained a lot of weight due to their excessive caloric intake, they are at a higher risk of developing health issues compared to Group Yellow, which maintained a normal diet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Analyze the information given - A weak immune system is assumed, so we should think about how this might affect the viral reproduction process. Step 3: Connect the weak immune system to the viral reproduction process - A weak immune system means that the body's defense mechanisms are not functioning at their optimal level, which could lead to a reduced ability to fight off infections and prevent viral replication. Step 4: Determine the impact on the number of viruses coming out of the cell - Due to the weak immune system, the body might not be able to effectively combat and limit viral replication. However, the question asks for the outcome of less viruses coming out of the cell. In this case, the weak immune system may actually result in fewer viruses being eliminated by the body's defenses, meaning that the number of viruses coming out of the cell could potentially be less than in an individual with a healthier immune system.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The highlight of Doubleday's career came after 7 February 1845 when a young man, who later admitted having spent the prior week \\"indulging in intemperance\\", smashed the Portland Vase, an example of Roman cameo glass and among the most famous glass items in the world, into hundreds of pieces. After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\". The British Museum awarded Doubleday an additional £25 (equivalent to £2,500 in 2016) for his work.At the time the restoration was termed \\"masterly\\" and Doubleday was lauded by The Gentleman's Magazine for demonstrating \\"skilful ingenuity\\" and \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\". In 2006 William Andrew Oddy, a former keeper of conservation at the museum, noted that the achievement \\"must rank him in the forefront of the craftsmen-restorers of his time.\\" Doubleday's restoration would remain for more than 100 years until the adhesive grew increasingly discoloured.

Answer the following question: You are presented with the quiz \\"what uses hearing to sense sound?\\"   But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"hearing is used for sensing sound by animals\\" and \\"cows are social animals\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? Answer:","output":"Based on the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the question \\"What uses hearing to sense sound?\\" would be \\"animals,\\" and more specifically, in the context of the hint, \\"cows\\" can be considered as an example of animals that use hearing to sense sound. Hearing is a vital sense that helps animals to perceive their environment, communicate with each other, and detect potential threats or opportunities for survival and reproduction. In the case of cows, as mentioned by the teacher, they are social animals, which implies that they use sounds to maintain communication and social order within their groups, known as herds. Cows, like many other animals, have a well-developed auditory system that enables them to detect a range of frequencies, interpret sounds, and respond accordingly. Their ears can move in different directions, allowing them to localize the source of a sound, and their highly sensitive hearing helps them stay alert to any relevant auditory cues in their surroundings. This is important for cows as they rely on effective communication to maintain their social structure, for example, when a cow is in distress, it can produce specific vocalizations that alert other cows in the herd. Furthermore, hearing plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and well-being of cows, as it allows them to be aware of potential predators or dangers in the environment. This early detection system is particularly crucial for newborn calves, who rely heavily on hearing their mother's calls to remain close to her and stay protected. In summary, the best answer to the quiz question is that animals, like cows, use hearing to sense sound. Hearing is an essential sense for these animals as it facilitates effective communication within their social groups or herds and enables them to stay vigilant to potential dangers and threats in their environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Macy Golong peeked into Mallie Mae's room and was not surprised to see her sleeping. Elmo's mother rarely stayed up past 10:00 PM, and it was nearly 11:00. She closed the door and started to go back to her room across the hall. She was halfway through a romance novel. But Hadley's delicious oatmeal raisin cookies were calling to her. She walked down the stairs to the kitchen and put a few cookies on a plate. Then she poured a glass of milk. She wondered what Elmo was doing. Was he in the Media Room with Carsie? Their Media Room? Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her. She left her milk and cookies on the kitchen counter and went down another flight of stairs, which came out in the Recreation Room. Macy could hear the sound of the TV coming from Media Room. She tiptoed to the open doorway and peeked in. There she was--that conniving slut--sitting where Macy should have been. How could Elmo have replaced her like that?

He is specifically studying three species, species A, species B, and species C. Species A is a predator; species B is the prey; and species C is a plant species that species B lives on. Mike now needs to figure out how the predator prey relationship balance the ecosystem.  But I can use this background: Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species.  What is an answer for this question: If species B population increase, would species C population increase or decrease? Answer:","output":"If species B population increases, species C population would likely decrease. This is because species B lives on species C (the plant species) and likely uses it for food or shelter.

Jaojoby's success and popularity attained new heights in 1998 with the release of E! Tiako. He was named \\"Artist of the Year\\" in Madagascar for two consecutive years (1998–1999), and the single \\"Malemilemy\\" received regular airplay across the island more than a year after the album was released. In July 1999, Jaojoby was named Goodwill Ambassador to the United Nations Population Fund and supported the United Nations' activities in Madagascar related to raising awareness of sexually transmitted diseases, unintended pregnancy, and other concerns relevant to the Malagasy youth population. The lyrics of his songs commonly address social issues, typified by a track on E! Tiako that encourages the use of condoms to avoid contracting HIV/AIDS.Aza Arianao was recorded over five days in the summer of 2000 and released the following year. In the wake of its success, Jaojoby performed at a political rally to an audience of 50,000 partisans of candidate Marc Ravalomanana less than a month before the divisive 2001 presidential elections that nearly resulted in the secession of the island's coastal provinces. Jaojoby's 2004 follow-up album Malagasy, which was recorded in semi-live conditions on the island of Réunion in a small venue before an audience of the artist's friends, featured lyrics that sought to promote optimism and national reconciliation; the artist announced that he would not involve himself in national politics in the future.

Former art school students, who became involved in the 1970s New York punk scene, Talking Heads released their debut Despite David Byrne's lack of interest in another album, Tina Weymouth, Chris Frantz, and Jerry Harrison reunited for a one-off album called No Talking, Just Head under the name The Heads in 1996. The album featured a number of vocalists, including Debbie Harry of Blondie, Johnette Napolitano of Concrete Blonde, Andy Partridge of XTC, Gordon Gano of Violent Femmes, Michael Hutchence of INXS, Ed Kowalczyk of Live, Shaun Ryder of Happy Mondays, Richard Hell, and Maria McKee. The album was accompanied by a tour, which featured Johnette Napolitano as the vocalist. Byrne took legal action against the rest of the band to prevent them using the name \\"Talking Heads\\", something he saw as \\"a pretty obvious attempt to cash in on the Talking Heads name\\". They opted to record and tour as \\"The Heads\\". Likewise, Byrne continues his solo career.  Meanwhile, Harrison became a record producer of some note - his resume includes the Violent Femmes' The Blind Leading the Naked, the Fine Young Cannibals' The Raw and the Cooked, General Public's Rub It Better, Crash Test Dummies' God Shuffled His Feet, Live's Mental Jewelry, Throwing Copper and The Distance To Here, No Doubt's song \\"New\\" from Return of Saturn, and in 2010, work by The Black and White Years and Kenny Wayne Shepherd.  Frantz and Weymouth, who married in 1977, had been recording on the side as Tom Tom Club since 1981. Tom Tom Club's self-titled debut album sold almost as well as Talking Heads themselves, leading to the band appearing in Stop Making Sense. They achieved several pop/rap hits during the dance-club cultural boom era of the early 1980s, particularly in the UK, where they still enjoy a strong fan following today. Their best-known single, \\"Genius of Love\\", has been sampled numerous times, notably on old school hip hop classic \\"It's Nasty (Genius of Love)\\" by Grandmaster Flash and on Mariah Carey's 1995 hit \\"Fantasy\\". They also have produced several artists, including Happy Mondays and Ziggy Marley. The Tom Tom Club continue to record and tour intermittently, although commercial releases have become sporadic since 1991.  The band played \\"Life During Wartime\\", \\"Psycho Killer\\", and \\"Burning Down the House\\" together on March 18, 2002, at the ceremony of their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. However, reuniting for a concert tour is unlikely. David Byrne states: \\"We did have a lot of bad blood go down. That's one reason, and another is that musically we're just miles apart.\\" Weymouth, however, has been critical of Byrne, describing him as \\"a man incapable of returning friendship\\" and saying that he doesn't \\"love\\" her, Frantz, and Harrison.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Magma crystalizes - Lava cools on the surface - Lava crystalizes - Minerals dissolved in water crystlize. Answer:","output":"The missing first step in the process you have described, which covers the formation of igneous and sedimentary rocks through crystallization, is the generation of molten material (magma or lava) from Earth's mantle. This complex process can be outlined as follows: 1. Formation of Magma or Lava: Magma is formed through the process of melting within Earth's mantle and crust. This can occur due to various factors, such as increased temperature and pressure or the addition of water and other volatiles in the mantle rocks. In some cases, the melting of existing rocks can also generate magma. Typically, the mantle's composition consists of solid silicate minerals, which begin to melt when exposed to high temperatures and pressures or when they come into contact with hotter materials from the Earth's core. As the molten material rises, it forms magma chambers in the crust. When magma reaches the Earth's surface, it is known as lava. This can occur during a volcanic eruption, where molten rock or lava is expelled from a vent or fissured area of Earth's crust. Lava can also be extruded quietly and slowly from volcanic fissures without any explosive activity. 2. Magma Crystallizes: As magma cools, minerals start to crystallize and form solid rock. This process is called crystallization, and the resulting rocks are classified as igneous rocks, particularly intrusive (or plutonic) rocks, as they form beneath the Earth's surface. Examples of intrusive rocks include granite and gabbro. The rate at which the magma cools and the specific minerals present determine the size and texture of the resulting rock. 3. Lava Cools on the Surface: When lava reaches the Earth's surface and flows out of a volcanic vent or fissure, it starts to cool and solidify. This process is quicker than the crystallization of magma beneath the surface due to the exposure to ambient temperature and air. The cooling allows minerals to crystallize and form solid rock, developing into extrusive (or volcanic) igneous rocks. Examples of extrusive rocks include basalt and andesite. 4. Lava Crystallizes: As lava cools, the minerals within it begin to crystallize and form solid rock. This process is similar to the crystallization of magma beneath the surface but occurs more rapidly. The resulting rocks are also classified as igneous rocks and are grouped as extrusive rocks since they form at or near the Earth's surface. 5. Minerals Dissolved in Water Crystallize: In addition to igneous rocks, crystals also form through the process of precipitation from water solutions. Over time, minerals dissolved in water can reach supersaturated levels, causing them to crystallize and form solid rock. This process, known as precipitation, contributes to the formation of sedimentary rocks, such as limestone, evaporites, and chert. These rocks are composed of mineral grains deposited from a water-based solution, like lakes, oceans, or groundwater. In summary, the missing first step in the process you have outlined is the formation of the molten material (magma or lava) from Earth's mantle through melting induced by factors like increased temperature, pressure, or the addition of water and other volatiles. This sets the stage for the series of steps that follow, leading to the crystallization of igneous and sedimentary rocks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Miami Heat NBA Win Streak Ends at 27 After Loss to Chicago Bulls CHICAGO—With two-tenths of a second left, LeBron James took the final inbounds pass in his own end, dropped the ball to let time expire, turned and walked toward the exit. No record for James and the Miami Heat, either. The Heat's bid for NBA history ended Wednesday night when their 27-game winning streak was snapped by the Chicago Bulls 101-97, setting off a raucous celebration inside United Center. Miami Heat forward LeBron James expressing displeasure at a second-half call—a theme he picked up after the game Miami finished six shy of the 33-game record held by the 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers. James said there was no shame in falling short. \\"It's one of the best that this league has ever seen,\\" James said, referring to the streak that began on Super Bowl Sunday, Feb. 3. \\"We recognized that and rightfully so.\\" James tried to spur yet another comeback in the final minutes, getting mad after a rough foul. But the reigning MVP could never get the defending champions even or, more importantly, ahead. Luol Deng scored 28 points, Carlos Boozer added 21 points and 17 rebounds, and the Bulls brought the Heat's stampede to a screeching halt. Miami's superstar did all he could to keep the run going, scoring 32 points and even collecting a flagrant foul during a physical final few minutes. \\"We haven't had a chance to really have a moment to know what we just did,\\" James said. \\"We had a moment, just very fortunate, very humbling and blessed to be part of this team and be part of a streak like that.\\" For the better part of two months, since they lost since to the Pacers in Indianapolis on Feb. 1, the Heat were the NBA's comeback kings. They erased seven double-digit deficits during the streak, once rallying from 27 down in Cleveland. They found themselves trailing in the fourth quarter 11 times, and won them all. \\"We understand, probably more so later on in our careers, the significance of that. And then that was it,\\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \\"We took that moment to acknowledge it, to acknowledge each other, that experience, but it was never about the streak. We have a bigger goal, but also right now, it's about 'Are we getting better?'\\" They walked off the floor stoically after the loss, not exchanging any handshakes or pleasantries with the Bulls. James slapped high-fives with a couple of teammates and coaches, then glared at a fan who grabbed his head as he headed toward the tunnel leading to the visitors' locker room. James was frustrated on the court at times, and showed more of the same in the locker room afterward with regard to how he's officiated. He cited two instances from Wednesday alone—a play where Kirk Hinrich took him down with two hands in the first quarter, and one where Taj Gibson appeared to make contact around his neck with about four minutes remaining—where he thought the contact was excessive. Referees reviewed the Gibson hit, but did not award a flagrant foul. So, seconds later, James tried to barrel through Carlos Boozer on a screen, only to be called for a flagrant four himself. \\"Those are not basketball plays and it's been happening all year,\\" James said. \\"I've been able to keep my cool and try to tell Spo, 'Let's not worry about it too much,' but it is getting to me a little bit.\\" The Bulls, meanwhile, whooped and slapped hands with anyone they could reach. It will go down as the second-longest winning streak in the history of American major pro sports. And some of those long-ago Lakers believed their streak would be surpassed this time, with Jerry West among those saying that he believed the reigning NBA champions had a real shot at pulling it off. The streak began in Toronto, a day when Heat players were mildly annoyed about having to miss football's title game. They were scheduled to be flying home at Super Bowl time, for a game the following night. So team officials changed course, as a surprise. After Miami beat the Raptors that afternoon, they stayed in the city several more hours to watch the Super Bowl together, an event highlighted by an impromptu Shane Battier speech about appreciating little moments as a team. For whatever reason, the Heat were unbeatable for nearly the next two months, winning every which way—from blowing out good teams like the Los Angeles Clippers, Oklahoma City Thunder and the Bulls to inexplicably struggling to overcome lottery-bound Cleveland, Detroit, Sacramento, Charlotte and Orlando. There was the 27-point, third-quarter hole at Cleveland, a 13-point deficit with eight minutes left against Boston, and 11-point deficits against Detroit and Charlotte—all in a seven-day span, no less. \\"There are several teams that can do it,\\" Pistons guard Jose Calderon said, when asked what it would take for someone to beat Miami. \\"It's difficult to maintain this concentration every day. It will likely take everyone to have a bad day.\\" Even when those bad days happened, the Heat found ways to win. A layup by James with 3.2 seconds left against Orlando. Double-overtime against Sacramento. Huge comebacks. Whatever it took. \\"To do something like this, everyone needs to step up,\\" said Battier, who was earlier part of a 32-game winning streak at Duke and a 22-gamer with the Houston Rockets. There were times when even the Heat themselves didn't know how long the streak was. Because it was interrupted by the All-Star break, Spoelstra was surprised when a staff member said something about Miami having won nine in a row. When it was at 24 games, Dwyane Wade made a reference to \\"23, 24, whatever it is.\\" They insisted they did not care about it, whatever the number was. Heat President Pat Riley, who played for the Lakers team that won 33 in a row, remained silent throughout Miami's streak—both because he rarely gives interviews these days because the official team stance was that it simply did not matter. This season is championship-or-bust for Miami. Still, the streak will go down as the story of the regular season. When it started, Miami was 5½ games behind San Antonio for the overall NBA lead, only a half-game ahead of New York in the Eastern Conference race, held just a four-game edge over Atlanta in the Southeast Division and were the league's ninth-best road team by of winning percentage. Funny what two months or so without losing can do. The Heat now sit atop the overall NBA standings, gained 12 games over New York in the East entering Wednesday, put away the Hawks for good several weeks ago and are now, by far, the league's best road team. And with the streak over, all that's left now is getting ready for the postseason. They trailed by as much as 13 in the first half, took the lead while outscoring Chicago 22-14 in the third quarter and were within two early in the fourth after a basket by Wade. That's when Deng answered with a 3-pointer from the wing and Kirk Hinrich brought the crowd to its feet with a floater. Then, after a layup by James, Deng nailed a 3 to make it 83-75 with just over six minutes left. It got testy after that. James did all he could to keep the streak going, taking enough hard hits that even his headband was dislodged, and finished with seven rebounds. Chris Bosh scored 21. Wade added 18 points after a sore right knee sidelined him for victories over Charlotte and Orlando, but the Heat fell to a team that continues to give them fits even though Derrick Rose has been sidelined all year. Deng came up big, burying four 3-pointers. He also had seven rebounds and five assists. Boozer was a force inside. Jimmy Butler provided a spark with 17 points and the Bulls stopped Miami even though they were missing Joakim Noah (right foot), Marco Belinelli (abdominal strain) and Richard Hamilton (lower back). For the Heat, luck simply ran out after all those recent late rallies—though when Battier nailed a 3 with 4:30 left in the third quarter to give them a 59-58 lead, it looked like they just might pull this one out, too. They were up by two in the closing seconds of the quarter when Boozer converted a three-point play off a neat bounce pass from Taj Gibson to send Chicago into the final 12 minutes with a 69-68 lead. Miami failed to close again, and as the game neared the finish the fans started chanting \\"End of streak! End of streak!\\" \\"We were much more competitive in the second half. It became make or miss in the fourth quarter, and we couldn't get the necessary stops we needed to,\\" Spoelstra said. \\"In the last handful of games, those shots were going down and maybe that masked a few things going down the stretch.\\" The Bulls were the biggest threat to Miami in the Eastern Conference the past two years, but without superstar Rose, they're just part of the pack. Still, the Bulls have now won two of the past three, winning in Miami in early January and falling at the United Center last month before Wednesday's win.

Latif comes from an upper-class family and had attended school with Uday, where the other students would remark on their likeness. Latif initially refuses the position, but is imprisoned and tortured, ultimately relenting when his family is threatened. Latif undergoes minor cosmetic surgery to perfect his resemblance to Uday and practices emulating the young Hussein's mannerisms and wildly volatile persona. He is given access to all of the luxurious benefits of the Husseins' fortune, including massive palaces, expensive wardrobes and Uday's Ferrari and various other exotic cars. Latif tries to resist Uday's exorbitant merrymaking and erratic behavior, at one point fleeing a nightclub in another of Uday's Ferraris to attempt to see his family, who believe he has died in the war. However, he is apprehended by Uday's bodyguards and given a whipping by Uday.

News article: Winnipeg musician Robb Nash now has the names of 120 young people tattooed onto his right arm.      Nash, who's known for his self-harm prevention work, is often handed suicide notes by students at school after his band plays.      Musician Robb Nash had the names of 120 kids who gave him their suicide notes tattooed on his arm. 2:42 In total so far Nash has been given 523 of these notes and he wanted to honour what that has meant to him.      \\"My goal through this tattoo is I'm getting the names of the first 120 kids that handed us suicide notes tattooed on my arm,\\" said Nash. \\"So many of these kids have our lyrics or our logo tattooed on them and I want to show them that they're as much a part of my life as I might be of their's.\\"      Nash hopes the tattoo will be a powerful tool as he continues his outreach work.      \\"I want to be able to show kids that are feeling suicidal, look, look at the names on my arm,\\" said Nash. \\"These were all kids that were just like you. You're not alone. They were also in that dark place, and they are still here today.\\"      Nash was getting the tattooing done all in one shot on Thursday at The Parlour on Main Street. But he wasn't going through it alone.      Taylor Bowman, one of the students who gave Nash her suicide note, helped keep him company while the inking got done.      \\"She was planning to take her life on the weekend,\\" said Bowman of their first meeting four years ago.      Taylor Bowman talks about how she was able to turn her life around through help from musician Robb Nash. 1:23 \\"She was planning to leave a suicide note and a bracelet for her Mom. And rather than leaving it there for her she gave it to me that day and she said, 'I get it now.' And she had a breakthrough that day.\\"      Bowman continues to stay connected to Nash and his band. She attends shows and monitors Twitter for posts from Nash's followers which may indicate they are in crisis.      \\"As soon as we see that someone is feeling low and not so very good about themselves we just kind of try to bombard them with as much love and support as we can so that they know they are not alone,\\" said Bowman.      Bowman is still processing the fact that her name will be on Nash's arm. ||||| Robb Nash is seated in a chair at the Parlor Tattoos on Main Street, getting a tattoo. The needle zips around his forearm, spelling out names: Paige. Riley. Bree. Taylor. Signatures in telltale teenage penmanship, inked in black and red.      When Nash leaves the studio, his forearm will bear the names of the first 117 kids who handed over their suicide notes to him during the first year of the Robb Nash Project, their signatures lifted from the notes themselves. It’s a permanent reminder of the work he does and why he does it.      'I'm glad I got the second chance when I came back from the dead after a car accident, and this is what I'm trying to do with that second chance'-- Robb Nash      photos by PHIL HOSSACK/ winnipeg free press Robb Nash says the tattoos will remind teens at future performances they are not alone in their ‘dark thoughts.’      PHIL HOSSACK / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS Robb Nash holds a bag full of suicide notes while getting his arm tattooed. Nash performs at high schools all over the country as part of the Robb Nash Project, giving hope to teens who are struggling and contemplating suicide.      Over the past seven years, the Robb Nash Project has performed for thousands of young people at hundreds of schools across the country. He goes where he’s needed, putting on free-of-charge rock shows that spread messages of hope, encouragement and empowerment to middle school and high school students who are suffering — often in silence. His band has performed in many communities in crisis, such as the Pimicikamak Cree Nation in northern Manitoba, which made headlines earlier this year after six young people died by suicide in the span of three months. More than 100 are on suicide watch.      Like the new ink on his arm, Nash has made an indelible impression on many kids. Now, more than 500 students have handed him suicide notes — and that number doesn’t include the kids who have reached out to him via social media. He’s kept many of the notes, but stresses that all suicide letters he receives are dealt with by the appropriate professionals. Nash and his band are not counsellors; they are there, as he puts it, to open a dialogue about suicide and self-harm. He works closely with schools so students can get the follow-up help they need.      Many of his fans have his name or his inspirational lyrics tattooed on their arms. Taylor Bowman, a young woman I first met at one of Nash’s shows last spring, has both. His name is inked on her arm; now hers is inked on his.      \\"I want to show them that they’re a big part of my life as well,\\" Nash tells me. \\"I’m glad I got the second chance when I came back from the dead after a car accident, and this is what I’m trying to do with that second chance.\\"      At 17, Nash was in a head-on collision with a semi on the highway outside of his hometown of Kleefeld and was pronounced dead on the scene. Incredibly, he survived — his skull is mostly made of metal — but, as he told me last year, he didn’t wake up wanting to change the world. He woke up wanting to burn it down. He was angry and bitter. He felt insignificant.      Through music, he discovered how he could be useful. His story could help others. He could have had a more conventional music career — and for a while, he did — but he wanted to make himself even more accessible and available to his fans. And so, he plays in schools at no cost to either the schools or the students. He gives out his music for free.      Reflecting on the permanence of the tattoo — which will be a one-off; he doesn’t plan to keep adding names — he says he further wants to show young people he’s sincere. \\"Kids can smell bullshit a mile away. We’re here because we care.\\"      Nash recalls the first time he received a suicide note. He was at a school that was dealing with the suicide of a student. The note revealed there was a pact with another student, but the principal didn’t know who.      \\"So we went to do the show right away, and it was a bizarre feeling knowing somebody in the audience was about to take their life and we didn’t know who it was. So we spoke directly. ‘We know someone in the audience is having these dark thoughts.’ And we spoke directly about suicide that day and, sure enough, a young girl came up after the show and she handed me her suicide note, planning to take her life that weekend. What a crazy feeling that was.\\"      There’s a consistent through-line in all the letters he’s received since: everyone feels alone.      \\"I want to show them my arm and say, ‘Look, you think you’re alone, but look at all these names on my arm. These are all kids that were in the same place as you. They did not want to be alive anymore. And they ripped up their notes, they found the strength, the kept walking, they got off the train tracks. They’re still here.’      \\"These people needed my story. Someone out there needs your story.

The context of the sentence is that the mom is telling her son to stay in bed instead of going to school. Step 2: Evaluate each answer choice. A. more rest: While it's possible that the mom could say this, it does not provide a clear reason for staying home. There's no explicit connection between needing more rest and skipping school. B. rest more: Similar to option A, this choice implies that the son might be tired, but it doesn't address the specific reason for staying home. C. were sick: This option seems like a misspelling or incorrect grammar. It could be an attempt at saying \\"we are sick,\\" but that would imply both the mom and the son are sick. Since the focus is on the son and not the mom, this answer doesn't fit. D. drink water: Drinking water is a generic suggestion and doesn't specifically address why the son should stay home from school. E. you're sick: This answer directly states the reason for the son to stay in bed and not go to school – he is sick. This provides a clear and specific rationale for the mom's instruction.

Hibernation is a state of inactivity and metabolic depression in animals during winter to conserve energy when food resources are scarce.  Step-by-step process: 1. (Missing step) As winter approaches, the animal starts to prepare for hibernation by increasing its food intake to build up fat reserves. 2. Winter comes, and the animal finds a place to hibernate (safe and insulated from temperature fluctuations). 3. Over a period of days, the animal's heart rate and breathing rate drop slowly, conserving energy and reducing the need for oxygen. 4. Electrical activity in the brain almost ceases completely, though some areas remain active to monitor the surroundings and maintain basic life functions. 5. The animal has entered hibernation mode, where it will remain until environmental conditions improve.

His publicist Joy Fehily confirmed the tragic news, reporting that Duncan passed away in a Los Angeles hospital, nearly two months after suffering a massive heart attack that left him hospitalized since July 13. Born in Chicago in 1957, Duncan, who stood at a towering 6 feet 5 inches tall and weighed around 315 pounds, began his Hollywood career with small roles in movies such as Friday, Renaissance Man, and Armageddon. However, it was his breakthrough performance in the 1999 adaptation of Stephen King's ‘The Green Mile’ that catapulted him into stardom. Playing opposite Tom Hanks, Duncan's portrayal of a gentle, miracle-working death row inmate earned him a best supporting actor nomination at the Academy Awards. Duncan's sudden death has left Hollywood reeling and is a great loss to the acting community. Colleagues, co-stars, and fans have taken to social media and other platforms to express their shock and grief at his passing. Tom Hanks was one of the first to pay tribute to Duncan, saying, \\"I am terribly saddened at the loss of a Big Mike, a treasure we all adored. He was a man of big love who embraced every moment of every day. He was magic.\\" Actress and TV host Holly Robinson Peete, who knew Duncan, also expressed her condolences, tweeting: \\"RIP Michael Clarke Duncan… Devastated. Speechless. Sending rowing prayers for Omarosa & MCD's family.\\" Director Frank Darabont, who directed Duncan in ‘The Green Mile,’ said in a statement, \\"I'm devastated at the loss of Michael Clarke Duncan, one of the finest people I've ever had the privilege to work with or know. Michael was the gentlest of souls—a big man with an even bigger heart, a devout Christian who loved everyone and had a smile that would light up a room.\\" Duncan's impressive film career also included the box office hits such as ‘Daredevil,’ ‘Planet of the Apes,’ ‘Sin City,’ and ‘Kung Fu Panda.’ He also lent his deep, resonant voice to various animated projects, including the role of Tug in the movie ‘Brother Bear.’ The actor's journey to success was not an easy one. Prior to his acting career, Duncan worked as a ditch digger, club bouncer, and even a personal bodyguard for celebrities such as Will Smith and Notorious B.I.G. His success story, though sadly short-lived, is a testament to his determination and perseverance in the face of adversity. Duncan's death has come as a significant blow to the industry, particularly to those who knew him closely. With his incredible talent, resonant voice, and one-of-a-kind presence, the late actor is sure to be remembered by many for his unforgettable performances in his unassuming, genuine, and, at times, dazzling roles. His fiancée, Omarosa Manigault, who has been by his side throughout this difficult time, expressed her gratitude for the support and well-wishes that she and Duncan's family have received in the wake of his passing. Ultimately, the loss of Michael Clarke Duncan serves as a poignant reminder of the fragility of life, and his legacy will remain etched in our hearts and on the silver screen. May he rest in peace."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Change is a part of life and can be a positive thing if you use it correctly. Be prepared to grow and adapt at every stage of life. Ask yourself which aspects of your life are being influenced by past hurts, insecurities, and regrets. Once you identify those issues, commit to letting them go so that they no longer control who you are.  Write out the things that frustrate you, or that you think hold you back. Expressing your feelings can help you let go of anything unpleasant in your past. This type of list can help you learn about the skills you need to develop in order to feel fulfilled. Realize that whatever your regrets are, in some ways you are better off than others. Focus on your strengths and other positive things you take away from your past. In order to reinvent yourself, it is important not to dwell too much on the past. However, there are often lessons you can take away from the past that can improve who you are in the present.  Analyze a relationship that ended painfully to determine what went wrong. Think about what you can do to prevent the same thing from happening in your next relationship. Look at which decisions led you or your family to make financial mistakes in the past. Based on this, work to develop a financial plan for the future that corrects these errors. Correcting bad habits is an important part of leaving the old you behind. It can, however, be very difficult and even intimidating. Instead of trying to change yourself all at once, focus on breaking one bad habit at a time.  Make a list of the habits that really bother your. Narrow it down to the top few that you would like to break, then start by working on the most important one. Focus on the positive feelings that you first have when trying to break a bad habit. This can help you succeed. Try replacing a negative habit with a positive one. For example, if you have a habit of snacking on junk food, replace it with healthy snacks, or spend more time exercising. As soon as a negative thought about yourself or your life pops into your mind, try replacing it with a positive one. Doing so trains your mind to focus on possibilities instead of difficulties.  Conceptualize the things that cause you to feel stress. Think about how you have responded to them in the past. Then, actively replace negative thoughts about those stressors with positive ones. For instance, a bad date might cause you to think something like, “I'll never find someone. There must be something wrong with me.” Correct yourself with something like “This date went poorly, but that doesn't mean the right person isn't out there waiting for me. I won't find that person unless I keep looking.” Your opinion of yourself is formed in part by your idea of how others see you. If you really want to redefine yourself, however, you'll need to become the person you want to be, not the person someone else expects you to be. You also need to identify and step away from social pressure that comes from society itself. Society may hold certain expectations of you based on your race, gender, economic class, or religion, and these expectations can be just as restricting. What is a summary?","output":"Summary: Reinventing oneself is a positive and achievable process at any stage in life. Start by identifying past issues and letting them go, while learning from past mistakes and experiences. Focus on breaking one bad habit at a time and replace negative thoughts with positive ones.

Tampa Bay's defense dominated a good part of the game, forcing six turnovers, and despite quarterback Jeff Garcia sitting out most of the game, the Buccaneers held on for a 19-13 victory. On the game's first play, Garcia tried to scramble, but injured his back upon being tackled by Cornelius Griffin. He lasted only two more plays, and was replaced by Bruce Gradkowski until early in the fourth quarter. Garcia's injury seemingly galvanized the Tampa Bay defense, who went on to cause 4 turnovers in the first half. Phillip Buchanon forced a fumble off the Redskins' first pass which was recovered by Tanard Jackson who advanced it 8 yards to the Washington 19. Three plays later, Earnest Graham scored a 1-yard touchdown run. On the third play of Washington's next drive, Greg White hit Clinton Portis hard, forcing a fumble which Jackson recovered at the 19-yard line. Tampa took a 10-0 lead after a Matt Bryant field goal. Early in the second quarter, Greg White forced yet another fumble as he sacked Jason Campbell which Kevin Carter recovered. The turnover led to another field goal. Portis fumbled again on the following drive as he took a bone-jarring hit from Jermaine Phillips and Tampa Bay capitalized with a third field goal. Before the half, Washington got on the board with a field goal, then Tampa Bay kicked a fourth field goal as the half expired to lead, 19-3. The second half saw Washington attempt a comeback. Despite injuring his hand, Campbell stayed in the game, and threw a 39-yard touchdown pass to Chris Cooley. Meanwhile, Gradkowski stayed in at quarterback for Tampa Bay, and continued to perform poorly. Tampa Bay managed only 9 yards of offense in the third quarter, and 0 yards passing. The Redskins drove 66 yards in 13 plays and over nine minutes to the Tampa Bay 4-yard line. Tampa Bay's defense held on 4th and 1 at the 4, however, as linebacker Derrick Brooks shed several blockers to down Portis for no gain. Washington narrowed the score to 19-13 in the fourth quarter. With about 11 minutes to go, Jeff Garcia returned to the game, hoping to spark Tampa Bay's offense, and hold on for the win. He was unable to do much against the Redskins' well-rested and fired up defense, however, and Tampa Bay ended up having to punt. Josh Bidwell pinned the Redskins at their own 9-yard line, and Campbell drove them to the Tampa Bay 32-yard line. Ronde Barber stopped the threat when he intercepted the ball at the 28-yard line. With less than a minute to go, Campbell drove the Redskins to the Tampa Bay 16-yard line, but Brian Kelly intercepted the pass in the end zone with 17 seconds remaining, to clinch the victory for the Buccaneers.

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"The depletion of what results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth?\\" with the following options:  - O3  - O2  - oil  - pan  - h2o  - CO2  - DNA  - DDT Answer:","output":"The depletion of O3, also known as ozone, results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. To provide a comprehensive understanding, let's first discuss the two facts mentioned and then analyze the given options. Fact 1: Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. Ozone is a gas predominantly present in the upper layers of Earth's atmosphere, specifically in the stratosphere. It plays a critical role in protecting life on Earth by absorbing harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. The depletion of the ozone layer can lead to an increase in the amount of UV radiation that reaches the Earth's surface, causing various environmental and health problems, such as skin cancer, cataracts, and suppression of the immune system in humans, as well as negative effects on plants and marine ecosystems. Fact 2: Ozone is represented chemically as O3. Ozone is a molecule composed of three oxygen atoms (O3). It is formed by the reaction of diatomic oxygen (O2) and a single oxygen atom (O) in the presence of ultraviolet radiation or electrical discharge. Now, let's go through the options provided: - O3: Given the two facts above, the depletion of O3 or ozone results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. As discussed earlier, ozone absorbs the harmful UV radiation from the sun, and its depletion leads to increased UV exposure at the Earth's surface. - O2: O2 represents diatomic oxygen, which is a vital component of the atmosphere but does not directly absorb UV radiation like ozone. - Oil: Oil refers to hydrocarbon substances, such as petroleum and its derivatives, which have no connection to ozone depletion or the increase in UV radiation. - Pan: A pan is a cooking utensil, which is irrelevant to the topic of ozone depletion and UV radiation. - H2O: H2O represents water, which is not directly related to ozone depletion or the increase in UV radiation. - CO2: CO2 is carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming and climate change. It does not directly deplete the ozone layer or affect UV radiation levels. - DNA: DNA stands for Deoxyribonucleic Acid, which is the genetic material found in living organisms. It is not related to ozone depletion or UV radiation levels. - DDT: DDT is an abbreviation for Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, a pesticide that was once widely used but is now banned in many countries due to its harmful environmental effects. DDT does not directly deplete the ozone layer or contribute to increased UV radiation levels. In conclusion, the depletion of O3 (ozone), given the facts stated above, results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. It is crucial to protect the ozone layer as it acts as a shield against the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation, which can have severe consequences for life on our planet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: To make your own pH indicator, you will need half a head of red cabbage, a knife, water, a stove, and a medium saucepan. Red cabbage contains a chemical called anthocyanin that changes color based on acidity. By boiling the cabbage, you can make a pH indicator from this chemical and test the acidity of your rain. Adult supervision is recommended for this because you will need to handle a hot stove and a sharp knife. . You want about 2-3 cups of red cabbage cut into small pieces. If you are young, have an adult help you with this step to avoid potential injury. The exact amount of cabbage is not important, so just cut up half of the head of cabbage. Place the chopped cabbage into the saucepan and add enough water to cover the cabbage. Put the saucepan on the stove and bring the water to a full boil. Once the solution boils, turn the heat off and let the water cool to room temperature.  Have a parent help with this step to avoid injury when using the stove and working with boiling water. You should notice that the water is now purple. Pour the cabbage and water mixture through a strainer into a bowl. The purple water (the indicator) is currently neutral because the water from your tap is neutral. In the presence of an acid, the indicator turns pink. In the presence of a base, the indicator turns blue. You can refrigerate the solution until you need it. To make sure the indicator is working properly, you can test it using baking soda and vinegar. Put 1 teaspoon (~5 mL) of the cabbage water into two small, clear glasses. Add a teaspoon of vinegar to one glass and a teaspoon of baking soda to the other.  Vinegar is acidic, so the water will turn pink. Baking soda is basic, so the water will turn blue. Collect some rainwater in a clean, plastic container. Pour 1 teaspoon of cabbage water into a small, clean glass. Add a teaspoon (~5 mL) of the collected rainwater to the cabbage water. The water should turn pink because all rain is slightly acidic. The deeper the pink, the higher the acidity in your area. This method will not tell you the exact pH of the rain, but will give you an idea of how acidic it is. If you are traveling, you can compare rain from different areas such as different cities, state or province, or even countries and see if the deepness of the pink changes. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article is as follows: To create your own pH indicator using red cabbage, follow these steps: Chop half a head of red cabbage into small pieces and place them into a saucepan. Add water to cover the cabbage and bring to a boil, then let it cool to room temperature. Strain the mixture, collecting the purple liquid (the indicator), which is currently neutral. The indicator will change colors in the presence of acids (turning pink) and bases (turning blue). Test the indicator with vinegar and baking soda, observing the color changes. Finally, collect rainwater and mix it with the cabbage indicator to determine its acidity, with deeper pink indicating higher acidity levels. This process offers a general idea of rainwater acidity, not an exact pH value, and can be used for comparing rain acidity from different locations.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: United States has varied geographical characteristics. Take for example, the Mississippi Delta. The delta has vast wetland that gets inundated every year. On the contrary, farther west, the Mojave Desert in Nevada sees very little precipitation or floodwater. Both places are beautiful in their own right, and attract many tourists every year.  Would Mojave Desert be less or more prone to hypoxia than Mississippi Delta? Answer:","output":"The Mojave Desert would be less prone to hypoxia than the Mississippi Delta due to their distinctive geological and environmental characteristics. Hypoxia occurs when an environment has a low concentration of dissolved oxygen, creating stress for the organisms living within that ecosystem. This condition is mainly observed in aquatic environments and wetlands, and can be triggered by factors such as excessive nutrient input, organic matter decomposition, and limited water circulation. The Mississippi Delta is an expansive wetland with a network of rivers, marshes, and swamps. It experiences regular flooding, which brings in a large amount of nutrients from the surrounding watershed. These nutrients stimulate the growth of algae and aquatic plants in the water, and when these organisms die and decompose, bacteria consume the oxygen for their metabolic processes, reducing dissolved oxygen levels in the water. This increased biological oxygen demand can lead to hypoxic conditions, causing stress and even death to various marine organisms in the area. On the other hand, the Mojave Desert is an arid region characterized by dry landscapes, sparse vegetation, and limited water sources. Due to it being a desert, it does not experience regular flooding, and the scarce water bodies in the region, such as springs or small ponds, are less likely to have high nutrient input. Consequently, the risk of hypoxia in the Mojave Desert is significantly lower than in the Mississippi Delta, as the factors that contribute to hypoxic conditions are not present or are minimal in this environment. In summary, the Mojave Desert is less prone to hypoxia than the Mississippi Delta due to differences in their geographical and ecological characteristics. The Mississippi Delta's wetlands and nutrient-rich waters promote conditions that can lead to hypoxia, while the Mojave Desert's arid environment does not support such processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The tie dye for the white shirt involved carefully preparing the dyes, folding the fabric in intricate patterns, and patiently waiting for the colors to seep into the fibers, resulting in a vibrant and mesmerizing swirl of hues that seemed to dance and intermingle on the surface. This captivating piece of wearable art not only showcased my creativity but also served as a reflection of my personality, with each color symbolizing a different aspect of who I am and what I believe in. On the other hand, the grey shirt required a different approach altogether. This seemingly plain piece of clothing held a blank canvas, inviting me to project my thoughts and ideas onto it. After carefully considering several potential words and phrases, I chose one that resonated deeply within me, a word that held immense significance and evoked powerful emotions. The word embodied my core values and aspirations, encapsulating the essence of my journey through life. With a steady hand and an unwavering focus, I skillfully etched the word onto the grey shirt, using a fabric marker to ensure its permanence and boldness. The two shirts, though vastly different in appearance and execution, shared a common thread – they both stood as physical manifestations of my identity. The tie dye represented the multifaceted aspects of my character, the kaleidoscope of experiences, and emotions that have shaped me into the person I am today. Meanwhile, the word on the grey shirt served as a reminder of my guiding principles and the driving force behind my actions, urging me to stay true to who I am despite the challenges and uncertainties that life may throw my way. Ultimately, these seemingly simple projects turned out to be so much more than just decorating shirts. They became a form of personal expression and self-discovery, allowing me to explore my creativity while simultaneously delving deeper into my thoughts and ideals. As I wear these distinctive pieces, I am reminded of the time and effort that went into their creation and the growth that occurred during the process.

Context: In this article, I’ll address a real mainstay of modern medicine: laboratory tests that require drawing blood. This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself. In this article, I’m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older...

Here is an article: Hillary Clinton distanced herself from Barack Obama’s strategy for defeating Islamic State extremists on Thursday in a sweeping foreign policy speech that called for greater use of American ground troops and an intensified air campaign. Though ruling out deploying the tens of thousands of US troops seen in Iraq and Afghanistan, the former of secretary of state made clear she would take a notably more hawkish approach than the current administration if she is elected president. “The United States has been conducting this fight for more than a year; it’s time to be begin a new phase and intensify and broaden our efforts,” Clinton told the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. “We should have no illusions about how difficult the mission before us really is … but if we press forward on both sides of the border, in the air on the ground and as well as diplomatically, I do believe we can crush Isis’s enclave of terror,” she added. The extensive but nuanced speech singled out coalition efforts against Isis in Iraq for particular implied criticism, urging that US troops be given “greater flexibility” to embed with Iraqi troops on the frontline and target airstrikes. She also said the US should arm Sunni tribes and Kurds in the country if the government in Baghdad refused to. But Clinton called for further US special forces to be deployed to Syria too, reiterated her call for a no-fly zone and demanded an “intelligence surge” to allow the airstrikes against Isis to be stepped up. “We have a lot of work to do to really decimate Isil in Iraq and Syria,” she said, using an alternate name for Isis. Dressed entirely in white, a determined Clinton also used the speech to attack a number of key allies, including Turkey and the Gulf states for not doing enough to tackle fundamentalism. She called on Silicon Valley to stop viewing the US government “as the enemy” and urged the tech industry to design encryption tools that can balance privacy and yet still allow for state surveillance. Taking questions afterward, Clinton said her speech called for an “intensification and acceleration” of the Obama strategy, rather than a major change to it. She also defended the White House response to the Syrian refugee crisis, in the face of opposition from Republicans who want to bar new entrants to the US. “We are in a conflict of ideas against an ideology of hate … but let me clear, Islam is not our adversary,” added Clinton. “The obsession in some quarters with a clash of civilisation, or repeating the words Islamic terrorism, isn’t just a distraction, it plays into their hands by alienating people we need by our sides.” In the question and answer session, Clinton made clear she would directly arm Kurds and Sunni tribes if Baghdad refused to do so, saying the war required “a second Sunni awakening” after the alliance of tribes that took on al-Qaida in Iraq in the mid-2000s. She was also specific about a no-fly zone for northern Syria to cut off supply lines of resources and foreign fighters to Isis – at the same time insisting Turkey “finally locks down its border”. Related: Turkey could cut off Islamic State’s supply lines. So why doesn’t it? | David Graeber Republican candidates have been robust in their attacks on Obama, and by extension Clinton, casting the administration’s record as weak and risky given his decision to enter into an agreement with Iran. Among the proposals put forth by presidential candidates, frontrunner Donald Trump has suggested bombing oil fields in the Middle East, and Jeb Bush and Texas senator Ted Cruz have suggested only allowing Christian refugees into the United States from the Syrian conflict zone. South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, the most hawkish of the candidates, has gone as far as to call for the deployment of 10,000 American troops to Iraq and Syria. The Democratic candidates have been more restrained in their response in the aftermath of the Paris attacks, the bombing of a Russian passenger jet over Egypt and explosions that killed 43 people in Beirut, all of which have been claimed by Isis. During the Democratic television debate on Saturday, in which the candidates paused for a moment at the outset to remember the victims of the Paris attacks, Clinton sought to distinguish herself from Obama when she was asked about his comments hours before the Paris terrorist strike in which he said the group had been “contained”. “It cannot be contained. It must be defeated,” Clinton responded on Saturday. It was a theme she returned to in more detail in New York on Thursday, with a lengthy section on what she believed were the shortcomings of the current coalition approach against Isis. “A key obstacle standing in the way is a shortage of good intelligence about Isis and its operations, so we need an immediate intelligence surge in the region, including technical assets, Arabic speakers with deep expertise in the Middle East, and even closer partnership with regional intelligence services,” said Clinton. “Our goal should be to achieve the kind of penetration we accomplished with al-Qaida in the past. This would help us identify and eliminate Isis’ command and control and its economic lifelines.” The speech drew heavily on Clinton’s involvement in the Obama administration’s efforts against al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden, so is unlikely to alarm the White House hugely, but nonetheless the president deliberately sought to pre-empt some of Clinton’s suggestions – such as a no-fly zone in Syria – during remarks at the G20 this week, in which he said US experts had examined such options and decided they would be counterproductive. Perhaps the toughest criticism was reserved for the combat in Iraq, where in the fight against Isis-controlled cities such as Ramadi is increasingly bogged down despite overwhelming numerical superiority by the coalition. “We’ve been in a similar place before in Iraq,” said Clinton. “In the first Sunni awakening in 2007, we were able to provide sufficient support and assurances to the Sunni tribes to persuade them to join us in rooting out al-Qaida. Unfortunately, under Prime Minister Maliki’s rule, those tribes were betrayed and forgotten. “So the task of bringing Sunnis off the sidelines into this new fight will be considerably more difficult,” she added. “But nonetheless, we need to lay the foundation for a second Sunni awakening. We need to put sustained pressure on the government in Baghdad to get its political house in order, move forward with national reconciliation, and finally stand up a national guard.” Clinton, who is fond of noting that she traveled to 112 countries during her four-year tenure as secretary of state, had hoped her near million miles of travel would give her an unassailable advantage on foreign policy – a record that includes pushing Obama to intervene earlier in Syria and take a harder line with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Her Democratic challengers cannot match her knowledge of foreign affairs, but during the second debate, former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders attacked her for her 2002 vote in favour of invading Iraq and her policies in Libya, which left a vacuum for extremists to exploit. She pushed to topple the Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi, to which Sanders responded during the debate: “I’m not a big fan of regime change.” This was Clinton’s second major foreign policy speech, in a campaign that has been largely dominated by economic policies and supporting the middle class. In September, she offered a robust endorsement of the Iran nuclear deal at a speech at the Brookings Institute in Washington DC.

The name of the band comes from the Kingdom of Delain in Stephen King's novel, \\"The Eyes of the Dragon\\".  - Within Temptation is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in April 1995 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and guitarist Robert Westerholt. They have always been classified by critics as gothic metal, although the \\"gothic\\" influence varies with each album. Their most prominent and well-known sound is described as symphonic metal, although their earlier material, such as debut album \\"Enter\\", was mostly gothic metal. \\"Enter\\" even had a hint of doom metal. In an interview, Den Adel said they fell into a symphonic rock genre with various influences. In a later interview with Dutch music platform 3VOOR12, den Adel stated that \\"we consider ourselves more a symphonic rock band ... in my opinion, we are no gothic band\\".  - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows:  European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.  - Nightwish is a symphonic power metal band from Kitee, Finland. The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and lead singer Tarja Turunen. The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami Vänskä after the release of their debut album, \\"Angels Fall First\\" (1997). In 2002, Vänskä was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers.  - Symphonic metal is a subgenre of metal music which combines the characteristics of this genre, such as heavy drums and guitars, with different elements of classical music including symphonic instruments, choirs and on occasion, a full symphony orchestra. Keyboards reminiscent of power metal also often find a dominant place in this subgenre. Symphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname opera metal or operatic metal, and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing growls, a more common characteristic of gothic metal. Perhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Finnish band Nightwish, Dutch bands Within Temptation, Delain and Epica, and Swedish band Therion, all four of which place a large focus on elements prevalent in film scores on top of the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre.  - Vanishing Point are a progressive / symphonic metal band based in Melbourne , Australia .

Help as much as you can. I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones. Question: who is the author?

One day he catches the attention of gangster Dutch Schultz.  Changing his last name to Bathgate, after a local street, he goes to work for Schultz's organization, serving mostly as a gopher for Schultz.  Billy is present when Schultz murders his former partner Bo Weinberg, who Schultz believes betrayed him. Schultz then begins a relationship with Weinberg's beautiful, married, girlfriend, Drew Preston. Facing legal charges in a court in upstate New York, Schultz brings Billy and Drew along.  He successfully charms the locals, presenting himself as charming and good natured.  While his boss Dutch stands trial, Billy's job is to watch over Drew.  His loyalties to Schultz are tested as he begins falling in love with the flirtatious Drew. Realizing that Drew is about to be killed, Billy calls her husband, who hurries to town and takes her home before Schultz's men can make their move. Having beaten the rap in court, Dutch is indicted again on federal tax evasion charges.  He wants to have federal prosecutor Thomas Dewey murdered, but his request is rejected by the Mafia Commission.  Schultz sends Billy to another gangster with some bribe money, but the effort is rejected.  When Billy returns with the bad news, he and Schultz have a falling out and Billy is fired by Schultz's associate Otto, who lets him keep the bribe money as a severance package.  As Billy leaves, he is abducted and beaten by gangsters working for Lucky Luciano.  The men storm Dutch's hideout and kill everyone inside.  Billy is taken before Luciano, who warns him that he knows where Billy's family lives, before letting him go.  Guess a valid title for it! Answer:","output":"A suitable title for this story could be \\"Bronx Betrayal: Billy Bathgate and the Tangled Web of Loyalty.\\" This title captures the essence of Billy Behan's journey, from a poor teenager in the Bronx to his involvement with notorious gangster Dutch Schultz as he adopts the name Billy Bathgate. It highlights the theme of betrayal — Schultz's suspicions about his former partner, Bo Weinberg, Billy's shifting loyalties as he navigates the dangerous world of organized crime, and the ultimate betrayal by Lucky Luciano's men, leading to Dutch Schultz's downfall. The title also emphasizes the importance of loyalty and the web of deceit and shifting allegiances that form the undercurrent of this story. From Billy's initial loyalty to Dutch Schultz, which is put to the test as he falls in love with Drew Preston, to the various betrayals and double-crosses that take place throughout the narrative, the reader is constantly left guessing as to who can be trusted and in whom loyalty truly lies. The inclusion of both \\"Bronx\\" and \\"Billy Bathgate\\" in the title explicitly connects the story's setting and protagonist, grounding the tale in its gritty, urban environment, and providing an immediate sense of place and character. Ultimately, the title \\"Bronx Betrayal: Billy Bathgate and the Tangled Web of Loyalty\\" encapsulates the central themes and conflicts of the story, promising a thrilling tale of love, crime, and the high-stakes battle for power and survival in the dangerous world of gangland New York."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: You are considering whether to buy a product.

(CNN) -- Brazilian club Corinthians are champions of South America for the first time after a 3-1 aggregate defeat of Argentina's Boca Juniors in the final of the Copa Libertadores. After a 1-1 draw in last week's first leg in Buenos Aires, two goals from Brazil-born Qatar striker Emerson gave coach Tite's Corinthians a 2-0 second-leg win in Sao Paulo. Wednesday's historic win over six-time champions Boca ensured Corinthians' qualification for December's FIFA Club World Cup in Japan. It also means South America's premier club competition has been won by a Brazilian team in each of the last three years, following on from Santos in 2011 and Internacional. \\"This afternoon, I spoke with the president and informed him that I would not continue,\\" OPTIONS: - Argentina told reporters. - Argentine told reporters. - Boca told reporters. - Boca Juniors told reporters. - Brazil told reporters. - Brazilian told reporters. - Buenos Aires told reporters. - CNN told reporters. - Copa Libertadores told reporters. - Corinthians told reporters. - Emerson told reporters. - FIFA Club World Cup told reporters. - Internacional told reporters. - Japan told reporters. - Juan Roman Riquelme told reporters. - Qatar told reporters. - Santos told reporters. - Sao Paulo told reporters. - South America told reporters. - Tite told reporters.","output":"Juan Roman Riquelme told reporters. After the match, veteran Boca Juniors midfielder Juan Roman Riquelme addressed the media regarding the heartbreaking loss for the Argentine team. \\"This afternoon, I spoke with the president and informed him that I would not continue,\\" Riquelme told reporters. Stunned by the news, the media clamored for more information from the legendary Argentine footballer. Riquelme, who had been instrumental in Boca Juniors' previous successes, spoke about his decision to step away from his beloved club. \\"I gave it my all for Boca Juniors, but now it's time for a new chapter in my life and for the club to move forward with fresh talents,\\" Riquelme revealed. As he stated this, his eyes welled with a mixture of sadness and pride for the journey he had with the team. The news of Riquelme's departure left the Argentine football world in a state of shock and disbelief. Many fans and fellow players took to social media to express their gratitude and admiration for the skillful playmaker who had been such a vital part of Boca Juniors' history. In the weeks that followed, Boca Juniors began the process of rebuilding their team without their cornerstone player, focusing on training and scouting for promising future stars. The fans understood that replacing Riquelme would not be a simple task, but they remained hopeful and excited about the club's future. As for Riquelme, he embarked on a new journey mentoring young players, sharing his knowledge and experience with the next generation of footballers. He took part in charity events and youth training camps, inspiring those who looked up to him as a role model, and ensuring that his legacy would continue to live on through the future stars of Argentine football. In December, Corinthians participated in the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where they represented South America at the prestigious global club competition, showcasing the strength and talent of Brazilian football. Although they faced fierce competition from teams across the globe, Corinthians showed their grit and determination, proving that they were indeed worthy champions of South America. As the years went by, the stories of Riquelme and Corinthians continued to intertwine, with former Boca Juniors players and coaches praising the talented Brazilian team for their growth and success. The Copa Libertadores victory resonated in both Brazilian and Argentine football history, creating a lasting bond between the two nations as they continued to compete at the highest level. Even though the South American powerhouses would always maintain their fierce rivalries, the spirit of respect and admiration would endure, thanks to those unforgettable moments and heroes like Juan Roman Riquelme."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Putin announced the move at the Russian Hmeimim airbase in Syria      Russia has begun withdrawing some of its troops from Syria, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Monday.      President Vladimir Putin ordered the partial withdrawal during an unannounced visit to Syria on Monday.      Russian support has been crucial in turning the tide of Syria's civil war in favour of government forces, led by president Bashar al-Assad.      Mr Putin made a similar withdrawal announcement last year, but Russian military operations continued.      When asked how long it would take for Russia to withdraw its military contingent, Mr Shoigu said that this would \\"depend on the situation\\" in Syria.      The Russian president was met by Mr al-Assad at the Russian Hmeimim airbase near Latakia.      Mr Putin said: \\"I order the defence minister and the chief of the general staff to start withdrawing the Russian group of troops to their permanent bases,\\" according to the Russian RIA Novosti news agency.      \\"I have taken a decision: a significant part of the Russian troop contingent located in Syria is returning home to Russia,\\" he added.      Syria campaign boosts Russian influence      By Steve Rosenberg, BBC Moscow correspondent      Less than a week after announcing he will stand for re-election, Vladimir Putin flies to Syria and declares victory. Coincidence? Probably not.      Signalling the end of Russia's military operation in Syria will go down well with Russian voters.      Electoral concerns apart, Moscow views its two-year campaign in Syria as a success - and not only in terms of fighting international terrorism.      The Russians have succeeded in keeping a key ally, President Assad, in power. In the process, Russia has been guaranteed a long-term military presence in Syria, with its two bases Hmeimim and Tartus. Moscow has also raised its profile across the Middle East.      Then there's the global stage. The operation in Syria prevented Moscow's international isolation.      Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 had sparked Western sanctions and earned the country, in the eyes of some Western governments, the label \\"pariah state\\". The Syria operation forced Western leaders to sit down and negotiate with Russia's leadership.      Mr Putin said that if \\"terrorists raise their heads again\\", Russia would \\"carry out such strikes on them which they have never seen\\".      \\"We will never forget the victims and losses suffered in the fight against terror both here in Syria and also in Russia,\\" he said.      He told President Assad that Russia wanted to work with Iran, the government's other key ally, and Turkey, which backs the opposition, to help bring peace to Syria.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Russia has been carrying out air strikes in Syria since September 2015      Last week, Mr Putin announced the \\"total rout\\" of jihadist militants from so-called Islamic State (IS) along the Euphrates river valley in eastern Syria.      Russia launched an air campaign in Syria in September 2015 with the aim of \\"stabilising\\" Mr Assad's government after a series of defeats.      Officials in Moscow stressed that it would target only \\"terrorists\\", but activists said its strikes mainly hit mainstream rebel fighters and civilians.      The campaign has allowed pro-government forces to break the deadlock on several key battlefronts, most notably in Aleppo.      The Syrian and Russian air forces carried out daily air strikes on the rebel-held east of the city before it fell in December 2016, killing hundreds of people and destroying hospitals, schools and markets, according to UN human rights investigators.      Moscow has consistently denied that its air strikes have caused any civilian deaths.      However, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported on Sunday that Russian air strikes had killed 6,328 civilians, including 1,537 children.      The UK-based monitoring group has documented the deaths of 346,612 people in total since the start of the uprising against Mr Assad in 2011. ||||| Russian President Vladimir Putin exhibited his growing diplomatic clout with a lightning tour through the Middle East on Monday, surprising Russian troops with his first visit to a Russian air base in Syria before skipping across the region to discuss bilateral ties in Cairo and Ankara.      Along the way, he announced a withdrawal of Russian troops from Syria, presided over the signing of a 21 billion plan to build a nuclear power plant in Egypt, and called President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel \\"counterproductive\\" and \\"destabilizing,\\" a criticism he leveled without mentioning Trump by name.      The decision could \\"provoke conflict,\\" he said during a news conference following a meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi.      Putin, who declared last week that he would run for a fourth term as president, has largely staked his legacy on Russia's revival as the dominant military power in its region and a counterweight to the West in the Middle East. His tour to shore up bilateral ties comes at a time when U.S. policy in the Middle East is in flux, amid Trump's decision on Jerusalem and apparent support for the rise of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia, as well as growing questions about the future role and mission of the U.S. military in Syria.      The trip began with a surprise visit to Russia's Khmeimim air base in Syria, where Putin announced an imminent drawdown of Russian forces in the wake of his declaration of victory in Moscow's intervention in the Syrian war. Russian warplanes secretly flew to Syria in late 2015. It was Putin's first known visit to Syria.      At the air base, Putin ordered his defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, to begin the \\"withdrawal of Russian troop contingents\\" to their permanent bases.      But he left open the door to a continued Russian presence in Syria, saying that Russia's air base at Khmeimim and naval base at Tartus would keep operating. He promised further strikes \\"if terrorists raise their head again\\" — an apparent reference to forces in Syria's long civil war that sought to topple the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.      \\"We will deliver such strikes on them that they have not seen yet,\\" he told military personnel at the air base in remarks carried by Russian news services.      Russia's military intervention in Syria bolstered Assad's government and gave Syrian forces a critical edge against rebel factions backed by the West and its Middle Eastern allies. Iran, another key supporter of Assad, provided military advisers and other aid.      [A Putin-Assad embrace launches Russia’s new peace bid for Syria]      U.S. defense officials cast doubt Monday on Putin's announcement of a troop withdrawal. Similar pronouncements in the past — including one in March 2016 and another in January — \\"don't often correspond with actual troop reductions,\\" said Col. Rob Manning, a Defense Department spokesman.      The speech to the troops also had the whiff of a reelection campaign at times.      \\"You are victorious, and you are going home to your families, parents, wives, children and friends,\\" Putin told pilots at the air base. \\"The fatherland is waiting for you, my friends. Have a safe trip home. I am grateful for your service.\\"      The deployment of troops to Syria marked Moscow's first major overseas military campaign since the invasion of Afghanistan in late 1979 under the Soviet Union. In July, Russia extended its lease of the Khmeimim air base for 49 years, giving Moscow a military foothold in the region for generations.      Putin met at the air base with Assad, whose regime appeared close to defeat in the summer of 2015 before the Russian intervention. At the time, it appeared that Assad would be forced to step down.      \\"I have come, as I promised,\\" Putin told him. While hailing the fall of the Islamic State, Putin also noted the rebuke to Western plans in the region. \\"Syria has been preserved as a sovereign independent state,\\" he said.      Putin has been eager to declare the intervention a victory, and his March 2016 drawdown announcement came as Syrian troops backed by Russian air power and special forces made a final push to recapture the ancient Roman city of Palmyra.      Western leaders were skeptical that Russia would pull back its troops, and Russian forces later played a key role in the race by pro-government forces to retake territory ahead of the Islamic State's eventual collapse.      The intervention has showcased much of Russia's military might: new warplanes, helicopters and warships, as well as cruise missiles fired from the Caspian Sea. It has come at the cost of more than 40 Russian soldiers killed, according to official statistics. The deaths of a similar number of military contractors have been reported by Russian journalists.      In Cairo, Putin met with Sissi and discussed the conflicts in Syria and Libya, a possible resumption of direct air travel after a 2015 terrorist attack aboard a Russian charter jet, and Trump's decision on Jerusalem. The contract signed during a meeting between Putin and the Egyptian president calls for the construction and a supply of nuclear fuel for Egypt's Dabaa power plant, scheduled to begin operating in 2026. Russia has also signed agreements to build nuclear plants in Turkey and Jordan. Russia finished construction on Iran's Bushehr nuclear power station — a project begun by a German firm under the shah — and opened it in 2011.      Putin arrived in Ankara, Turkey, on Monday evening for talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The leaders discussed developments in Syria and elsewhere in the region as well as relations between their countries, Turkish officials said.

Given the question \\"What does Addison need to do before this?\\", is \\"get the water\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"Yes, \\"get the water\\" is a valid answer to the question \\"What does Addison need to do before this?\\" given in the context of Addison supplying the classroom with water because the water was out in the entire building. To generate a more detailed response, one needs to analyze the situation and steps taken by Addison. The water outage in the entire building would necessitate an alternative source of water for the classroom. Before Addison could supply the classroom with water, they would have to perform the following actions: 1. Identify an alternative water source: Before Addison could provide water to the classroom, they would need to find a source that still had water available. This could involve checking nearby buildings, contacting local water suppliers, or searching for water storage facilities in the area. 2. Ensure the water is safe for consumption: Depending on the source of the water, it may not be suitable for drinking purposes. Addison would need to confirm that the water is safe to consume, either by following the guidelines of the local health department or by conducting tests to ensure its quality. 3. Acquire proper containers for water storage: In order to transport the water to the classroom, Addison would need suitable containers that could hold the volume of water required. These containers should be clean, leak-proof, and, preferably, portable enough to be carried or transported easily. 4. Arrange transportation: Depending on the distance between the alternative water source and the classroom, Addison might need to arrange transportation for the water containers. This could involve securing a vehicle that can adequately carry the filled containers or enlisting the help of people to assist in carrying or moving the water. 5. Get the water: With the necessary preparations in place, Addison would have to collect the water from the identified source. This step involves filling the prepared containers with the required amount of water. It is essential to ensure that the water remains uncontaminated during this process. 6. Transport the water to the classroom: Following the collection of the water, Addison would need to transport the filled containers to the classroom. This could involve carrying them personally, loading them into a vehicle, or using another form of transportation previously arranged. After completing these steps, Addison will have successfully supplied the water to the classroom, allowing the students and teachers to have access to it despite the water outage in the building. Therefore, \\"get the water\\" constitutes a valid answer to the question, as it encompasses a crucial step before Addison can supply the classroom with water."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The original NES (but not the top-loading NES-101) contained the 10NES lockout chip, which significantly increased the challenges faced by unlicensed developers. Tinkerers at home in later years discovered that disassembling the NES and cutting the fourth pin of the lockout chip would change the chip’s mode of operation from \\"lock\\" to \\"key\\", removing all effects and greatly improving the console’s ability to play legal games, as well as bootlegs and converted imports. NES consoles sold in different regions had different lockout chips, so games marketed in one region would not work on consoles from another region. Known regions are: USA/Canada (3193 lockout chip), most of Europe (3195), Asia (3196) and UK, Italy and Australia (3197). Since two types of lockout chip were used in Europe, European NES game boxes often had an \\"A\\" or \\"B\\" letter on the front, indicating whether the game is compatible with UK/Italian/Australian consoles (A), or the rest of Europe (B). Rest-of-Europe games typically had text on the box stating \\"This game is not compatible with the Mattel or NES versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System\\". Similarly, UK/Italy/Australia games stated \\"This game is only compatible with the Mattel or NES versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System\\". Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". What was the lockout chip number for most of Europe, save the UK and Italy?","output":"The lockout chip number for most of Europe, excluding the UK and Italy, was 3195. Just like a key in a lock, this chip helped make sure that only certain games could be played on the Nintendo Entertainment System in that region. It's kind of similar to how some toys only work with specific batteries."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Higgins boasts he could teach anyone to speak so well he could pass them off as a duke or duchess at an embassy ball, even the young woman with a strong Cockney accent named Eliza Doolittle who tries to sell them flowers. Eliza's ambition is to work in a flower shop, but her accent makes that impossible (\\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\\"). The following morning, Eliza shows up at Higgins' home, seeking lessons.

Before the mysterious disappearance of one of its passenger jets this month, Malaysia wasn't a country used to finding itself dominating headlines around the world. Some of its Southeast Asian neighbors, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have suffered devastating natural disasters in recent years and are all too familiar with the media frenzy that accompanies a major crisis. But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \\"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"It doesn't have tsunamis.

They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization.  Two brothers learned about animal reproduction, Tim learned about fish reproduction, while Bill learned about mammal reproduction. They both received grade A.  Which brother studied less about fertilization that takes place outside the mother's body? Answer:","output":"Answer: Bill studied less about fertilization that takes place outside the mother's body. Explanation: The passage mentions that in most fish species, fertilization takes place outside the mother's body. Since Tim learned about fish reproduction, he studied this type of fertilization more in-depth. On the other hand, Bill learned about mammal reproduction. Mammals typically have internal fertilization where the sperm fertilizes the egg inside the female's body. Therefore, Bill studied less about external fertilization than Tim since his focus was on mammal reproduction, which primarily involves internal fertilization."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

I couldn't believe some of the horrible dialog coming out of people's mouths, and the end reel of bloopers attached to body of the film was a real hoot. And we get titty shots of Angelique Pettyjohn (sort of) and Loren Crabtree to boot. A teleportation device activated by psychic Angelique Pettyjohn brings an alien container to an underground lab out in the desert. According to director Fred Olen Ray, they were leftover sets from the Klaus Kinski film, ANDROID which gives the film an increased value beyond how cheap it looks. Inside the container is a midget alien (played by Ray's son) who starts clawing people to death. It was pretty funny watching this little 'creature' in a black reptile suit with what looks like large beetle shells attached to it, running around in the dark. We even get to see the little thing stamp and tear at a poster of ET, which I thought was hilarious.

Please answer the following question: Barry and Will are two geologists. Barry is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor. Will is specialized in montology.  Which person learned more about isostasy?  Hint: As new seafloor forms and spreads apart from the mid-ocean ridge it slowly cools over time. Older seafloor is, therefore, colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise) with spreading rates of up to 13  cm/yr. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a \\"textbook\\" slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is used as an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone. The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.Since the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world's ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, sea level was so high that a Western Interior Seaway formed across North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, it appears that Barry, who specializes in subduction zones and new seafloor, would have learned more about isostasy.  Justification: 1. The hint provided clearly mentions that older seafloor is colder and deeper than new seafloor due to isostasy. This suggests that understanding isostasy is essential for someone studying subduction zones and new seafloor formation, which is Barry's area of expertise. 2. The destruction of oceanic crust at subduction zones, a topic relevant to Barry's specialization, is tied to the isostasy phenomenon to maintain Earth's diameter. 3. Will, on the other hand, specializes in montology, which is the study of mountains. While it's possible that he's come across isostasy in his studies, the given information does not directly link montology with the concepts of isostasy, subduction zones, or seafloor spreading. Based on these justifications, it is reasonable to conclude that Barry has learned more about isostasy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Problem:So I went to Santa Monica with a bunch of college  friends who my roommate (someone I've only known for 2 weeks) knows, I do a lot of photography work myself. I happened to have snapped a shot of a girl half naked. When I get back to my dorm, my roommate picks up my camera without even asking me, just goes through my photos. I was shocked at first, then I say, \\"I can't let you see past IMG 250\\", he gets upset and says \\"why?\\", I respond with \\"there's photos I can't let you see (in particular to protect the privacy of the half naked girl), he replies, \\"I thought we were friends\\". This makes me feel bad because it makes me feel like I don't trust him. I say \\"hey, at least I don't go through people's camera's without asking\\". I got frustrated. Now, come last night we went to a party together, I brought my camera out and took photos, I leave early to go to bed. My camera is placed on my desk. Come next morning he says, \\"hey the photos you took were pretty good\\", I'm confused, thinking... How did you see my photos? I say \\"how did you see them?\\", he says \\"I looked through your camera while you were asleep\\". I'm straight up like WTF! (to myself), that's literally not cool. I say, \\"have you heard of privacy?\\", he smirked. Wtf?! I genuinely don't feel comfortable with my information. Do I actually have to take my photos off the card before I go to sleep? What if he goes through them and confronts me about my photos being missing. I don't feel like that's necessary. Now the best option is to say, \\"can you please not go throigh my photos while I'm asleep\\", but knowing him, he'd say \\"why, I was there too, why can't I see \\". I don't want to publish and show everyone my photos that I took. And also, within the Santa Monica photos, I had some personal shots, like, my home, family, etc.  It's like I'm fathering this kid. It's really frustrating because he sleeps right next to me in my room and I feel like my privacy is literally exposed 24/7 I discussed this with our mutual friend and feel annoyed that I talked shit about him, because I don't like it when others talk about me. But I just had to. It's like a voilation of trust being roommates. 😡 So what now? What's a polite yet not dick move to say, don't go through my photos.  Solution:","output":"In this situation, the OTHER category (the roommate) is at fault. The author's roommate is violating the author's personal privacy by going through their camera without permission and seeing photos that are intended to be private. The appropriate response for the author is to communicate with their roommate, establish boundaries, and request that they respect their privacy. Additionally, they may consider finding a secure place to store the camera and the memory card to prevent any further invasions of privacy. They should respectfully express their feelings without being confrontational, and try to find a mutually agreeable solution to the situation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  During the 1999 Russian Presidential elections, the two leading candidates are Igor Komarov, a former Colonel of the KGB, and Nikolai Nikolayev, a retired General of the Russian Army. When a car bomb explodes outside one of Komarov's pharmaceutical companies, and a virus is stolen from inside, an investigation by the FSB ensues headed by FSB agents Sonia Astrova and Andrei Kasanov. Their investigation is obstructed by the Director of the FSB, Anatoly Grishin. A British Embassy worker from Moscow, Sir Nigel Irvine, tracks down Jason Monk, a former CIA operative, who ran double agents in the Soviet Union and convinces him to investigate the incident. Once in Moscow, Jason finds an old friend, Viktor Akopov, who agrees to hide Jason from Komarov's men. Viktor steals a residue sample of the bomb used and his scientist friend Tonkin tells him that the explosive used, Semtex H, has a direct traceable link to the FSB. Tonkin is soon killed by Vladimir Dorganosov, the man who attacked Komarov industries and stole the bioweapon. Sonia and Andrei locate Leonid Zaitzev, a cleaner who worked at the Komarov Industries plant and saw Dorganosov steal the virus. As they question him, Grishin appears, arrests Zaitzev and fires Sonia and Andrei. Zaitzev is later killed by Dorganosov while in custody. Sonia goes home to find Jason waiting for her, and agrees to help him access the FSB network. However, they are shot at by Dorganosov, and a car chase ensues.

Article: Similarly, movies and television often revert to standard, clichéd snatches of classical music to convey refinement or opulence: some of the most-often heard pieces in this category include Bach´s Cello Suite No. 1, Mozart's Eine kleine Nachtmusik, Vivaldi's Four Seasons, Mussorgsky's Night on Bald Mountain (as orchestrated by Rimsky-Korsakov), and Rossini's William Tell Overture. Question: What piece by Vivaldi is used as a cliche to convey opulence?","output":"The piece by Antonio Vivaldi that is most frequently used as a cliché to convey refinement, opulence, and sophistication is \\"The Four Seasons,\\" which is a group of four violin concertos collectively known as \\"Le quattro stagioni.\\" Each concerto represents one of the four seasons: Spring (La primavera), Summer (L'estate), Autumn (L'autunno), and Winter (L'inverno). Vivaldi's \\"The Four Seasons\\" was composed in 1723 and is one of the most popular and recognized examples of the Baroque music era. Each concerto is composed in three movements, with a fast-slow-fast tempo structure. These concertos are characterized by their virtuosic violin solos and vivid programmatic writing, which is meant to evoke the sounds, moods, and images of each season. In addition to the music, Vivaldi also provided sonnets detailing the narrative and emotions for each season. The iconic status and widespread appeal of \\"The Four Seasons\\" in popular culture can be attributed to several factors: 1. Musical accessibility: The memorable melodies, rhythms, and harmonies in the concertos make them easily accessible for listeners, even for those who are not well-acquainted with classical music. 2. Visual and narrative appeal: The programmatic nature of \\"The Four Seasons\\" allows audiences to relate to and visualize the natural and emotional associations with each season, making it more engaging. 3. Versatility: Individual movements or sections of \\"The Four Seasons\\" can be excerpted and used for various purposes in media, such as to convey a sense of grandeur, luxury, or magnificence. 4. Familiarity: The Four Seasons has been reinterpreted, adapted, and sampled in various film scores, television shows, advertisements, and even contemporary music, which reinforces its status as a cultural icon and cliché. Consequently, Vivaldi's \\"The Four Seasons\\" has become a go-to piece to convey opulence, refinement, and sophistication, which has gradually led to its clichéd status in movies, television shows, and other forms of media."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Objective: How do you prep yogurt for making cream cheese. Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? Available choices:  (A). Put plain yogurt in a dish towel and let it drip out overnight..  (B). Put plain yogurt in a bath towel and let it drip out overnight..","output":"I will reason through the given options to determine which solution is more sound for prepping yogurt to make cream cheese based on naive physics reasoning: (A) Put plain yogurt in a dish towel and let it drip out overnight: 1. Dish towels are designed specifically for kitchen use, indicating a higher likelihood of suitability in this context. 2. Dish towels typically have a finer weave than bath towels, allowing them to catch smaller particles of yogurt while still permitting liquid to drain. 3. Roughly assessing size, dish towels are smaller than bath towels, requiring less material to wrap the yogurt and potentially being easier to handle in the kitchen. 4. The smaller size of a dish towel could also allow for a more controlled environment during the draining process, with less potential space for bacterial growth or contamination. (B) Put plain yogurt in a bath towel and let it drip out overnight: 1. Bath towels are designed primarily to absorb water from the body and are not typically expected to be used in a kitchen setting. 2. Bath towels have a larger surface area, which may lead to less effective straining and uneven distribution of pressure on the yogurt. 3. The coarser textile of a bath towel may not catch some of the finer yogurt particles, leading to a less smooth cream cheese. 4. Using a larger bath towel may be more challenging to maneuver in a kitchen setting, and it may not fit within a standard refrigerator or designated strain setup. Based on these observations, Option (A), putting plain yogurt in a dish towel and letting it drip out overnight, appears to be a more sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning. A dish towel is better suited for use in the kitchen, it will likely strain the yogurt more effectively, and its smaller size makes it more practical for this task."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

They identify many of the weapons and several of the buyers.Over M's protests, the officers agree to launch a guided missile into the area believing that they will eliminate half of the world's most dangerous criminals. The missile is launched from a British frigate and speeds toward the target just as the command center receives a radio call from their agent on the scene. Among the camera images is a plane holding two powerful soviet nuclear weapons which may be triggered by the guided missile. An attempt to abort the missile attack fails and the agent, who is revealed to be James Bond, rushes into the area to steal the plane and the bombs. The attack causes most of the terrorists to flee the area.Bond reaches the plane and knocks the pilot in it unconscious. He successfully escapes the valley before the missile hits but is pursued by another of the surviving terrorists in a plane identical to his. He evades the 2nd plane, however, the pilot he knocked out awakes and throws a heavy cord around Bond's neck. Bond keeps control of the plane, flying under the second one and activates the rear ejection seat of his own plane, throwing the man up into the other plane, causing it to explode. Bond contacts the command center and tells them he is flying home with the nukes, asking the admiral where he wants his bombs delivered.In the South China sea, a British missile frigate, the HMS Devonshire, is on patrol and is being threatened by Chinese MIGs.

This would imply that her acting work has been watched by viewers from various parts of the world and that her talent as an actress has been acknowledged in different regions. Furthermore, the fact that she is described as \\"an English actress and television presenter\\" implies additional versatility in her career, which could also contribute to her being well-known. Having multiple roles and appearing in different capacities on television can increase a celebrity's visibility and recognition both nationally and internationally. In conclusion, given the information provided on Sheree Victoria Murphy's career in the text, it is reasonable to assume that the sentence claiming she is a well known actress around the world is true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: Tuesday night, Scheck himself was billed as a guest, but he never appeared. Hypothesis: Scheck did not show up on Tuesday night. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis. In the given premise, it is stated that \\"Scheck himself was billed as a guest, but he never appeared.\\" In deductive reasoning, this implies that Scheck was expected to be present, most likely at an event or function, on a specific day, which is Tuesday night. However, as it's mentioned that he never appeared, this specifically denotes that he did not show up or attend. Now, looking at the hypothesis, \\"Scheck did not show up on Tuesday night,\\" it is unambiguously aligned with the situation stated in the premise. It is an explicit reiteration of the scenario that was covered - Scheck did not arrive or participate in the event he was supposed to on Tuesday night.  Therefore, the hypothesis is a straightforward reflection of the premise with no additional presumptions or complexities. They both convey the same idea and fact - Scheck's absence on Tuesday night - and hence, the premise does entail the hypothesis. It means if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is necessarily true, which is the core definition of entailment in logic.  In other words, when it is said that a premise entails a hypothesis, it means that the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. In this context, given the premise is stating the fact of Scheck's absence, it indeed affirms the accuracy of the hypothesis which is similarly revealing Scheck did not turn up on Tuesday night. It is important to note that entailment is a key concept in logic, used to denote a relationship between sentences wherein if one sentence (the premise) is true, then the other (the hypothesis or conclusion) is also true. The way the information is presented in the hypothesis directly reflects the condition described in the premise, implying that truth-wise, they are equivalent.  So, to summarize, the premise \\"Scheck himself was billed as a guest, but he never appeared\\" absolutely entails the hypothesis \\"Scheck did not show up on Tuesday night.\\" The evidence lying within the premise fully supports the hypothesis, and the credibility of the premise ensures the veracity of the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One sunny afternoon, Tom hatched a grand plan to finally catch his elusive rival. While most cats were content to chase mice at a moment's notice, Tom decided to employ a more creative approach. He designed and built a massive Rube Goldberg machine, designed solely for the purpose of capturing Jerry. The machine was a wonder of modern engineering, filled with intricate gears, pulleys, and ropes, all working together to chase and strategically trap the wily mouse. To ensure success in his endeavors, Tom crafted a detailed blueprint, which he decorated with stick figures of a cat, which represented himself, and a mouse, symbolizing Jerry. With great excitement, Tom prepared himself for what he believed would be his greatest and final triumph against his enemy. However, unbeknownst to Tom, one of the stick figures, the stick-mouse, had somehow come to life. As a fellow mouse, it felt compelled to warn Jerry of the impending doom that awaited him. Slipping away from the blueprint, it hurriedly entered Jerry's mousehole and woke him up. Jerry, upon hearing about Tom's dastardly plan, knew he couldn't let this stand. He had to put an end to it, once and for all. Jerry, along with the now animated stick-mouse, observed Tom's Rube Goldberg machine from a safe distance. They decided that the best course of action was not to outrun the machine, but to sabotage it. Grabbing a nearby eraser, Jerry began to erase various structural elements of the machine. To his delight, he discovered that certain alterations to the blueprint affected the physical machine as well. When Jerry erased the larger legs supporting the machine, it caused the cat structure to topple over, sending the machine into disarray. Seeing Tom's plan crumbling before his eyes, Jerry knew that now was the time to strike. He rallied his fellow mice, who had been hiding in fear during Tom's preparations. Together, they launched a counteroffensive against the malfunctioning contraption. Using water, they began erasing additional parts of the machine, making it wildly unpredictable in its movements. As the chaos grew, Jerry spotted Tom's jar of white ink, from which the stick figures on the blueprint had been drawn. Formulating a plan on the spot, Jerry marshaled his mice comrades to collectively dump the contents of the jar into the machine. As the white ink inundated the machine, blinding sensors and gumming up the gears, it was sucked into the mechanical chaos, leaving nothing but a blank canvas on various points of the blueprint where Tom's symbols once stood. The now-ruined machine lurched and groaned, desperately trying to continue its pursuit of Jerry. What happened next would go down in the annals of cat-and-mouse history. With the machine now entirely out of control, Tom's plan backfired spectacularly. Due to his trap's malfunction, a series of events were set in motion, all leading to Tom being crushed by a massive safe that had once been poised to trap Jerry in a dead-end corner. As the dust settled, Jerry and his fellow mice celebrated their grand victory, having once again thwarted Tom's best-laid plans. And so, in the end, the cunning Tom was defeated by the very machine he had designed to ensure his success. While it may not have been the outcome he had envisioned, one thing was certain: life with Jerry would never be dull."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The second and third places were taken by Italian riders Italo Zilioli and Felice Gimondi, respectively.  - An individual time trial (ITT) is a road bicycle race in which cyclists race alone against the clock on flat or rolling terrain, or up a mountain road such as Alpe d'Huez (in French: \\"contre la montre\\"  literally \\"against the watch\\", in Italian: \\"tappa a cronometro\\" \\"stopwatch stage\\"). There are also track-based time trials where riders compete in velodromes, and team time trials (TTT). ITTs are also referred to as \\"the race of truth\\", as winning depends only on each rider's strength and endurance, and not on help provided by team-mates and others riding ahead and creating a slipstream. The opening stage of stage race will often be a short individual time trial called a prologue.  - Uitkerke is in West Flanders and is part of the coastal city of Blankenberge, Belgium. The two neighboring communities were officially united in the early 1970s.  - West Flemish is a dialect of the Dutch language spoken in western Belgium and adjoining parts of the Netherlands and France.  - A dam is a barrier that impounds water or underground streams. Reservoirs created by dams not only suppress floods but also provide water for activities such as irrigation, human consumption, industrial use, aquaculture, and navigability. Hydropower is often used in conjunction with dams to generate electricity. A dam can also be used to collect water or for storage of water which can be evenly distributed between locations. Dams generally serve the primary purpose of retaining water, while other structures such as floodgates or levees (also known as dikes) are used to manage or prevent water flow into specific land regions.  - Luxembourg, officially the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, is a landlocked country in western Europe. It is bordered by Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east, and France to the south. Its capital, Luxembourg City, is, together with Brussels and Strasbourg, one of the three official capitals of the European Union and the seat of the European Court of Justice, the highest juridical authority in the EU. Its culture, people and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbors, making it essentially a mixture of French and Germanic cultures. The repeated invasions by its neighbor countries, especially in World War II, resulted in the country's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and led to the foundation of the European Union.  - Felice Gimondi (born 29 September 1942) is an Italian former professional racing cyclist. With his 1968 victory at the Vuelta a España, only three years after becoming a professional cyclist, Gimondi, nicknamed \\"The Phoenix\\", was the second cyclist (after Jacques Anquetil) to win all three \\"Grand Tours\\" of road cycling: Tour de France (1965, his first year as a pro), Giro d'Italia (1967, 1969 and 1976), and Vuelta a España (1968). He remains one of only six cyclists to have done so.  - The Union Cycliste Internationale, commonly known by the acronym UCI, is the world governing body for sports cycling and oversees international competitive cycling events.

Its name means \\"dike of the bear\\", according to the area's dialect, or \\"dike of a man called Bear\\", or \\"passage by the marsh\\". But \\"drecht\\" or \\"tricht\\" means \\"ferry\\" or \\"crossing\\" (from Latin \\"trajectus\\"), and \\"ber\\" or \\"bere\\" in Indo-European means \\"dam\\", \\"defence against water\\" (compare Slavic East Germany): the resulting meaning is \\"river crossing at a dam\\".  - Blankenberge (West Flemish: \\"Blanknberge\\") is a town and a municipality in the Belgian province of West Flanders. The municipality comprises the town of Blankenberge proper and the settlement of Uitkerke.  - The Giro d'Italia (aka Corsa Rosa or Giro) is an annual multiple-stage bicycle race primarily held in Italy, while also occasionally passing through nearby countries. The race was first organized in 1909 to increase sales of the newspaper \\"La Gazzetta dello Sport\\"; however it is currently run by RCS Sport. The race has been held annually since its first edition in 1909, except when it was stopped for the two world wars. As the Giro gained prominence and popularity the race was lengthened, and the peloton expanded from primarily Italian participation to riders from all over the world. The Giro is a UCI World Tour event, which means that the teams that compete in the race are mostly UCI Proteams, with the exception of the teams that the organizers can invite.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages.

The term province has since been adopted by many countries, and in those with no actual provinces, it has come to mean \\"outside the capital city\\". While some provinces were produced artificially by colonial powers, others were formed around local groups with their own ethnic identities. Many have their own powers independent of federal authority, especially in Canada. In other countries, like China, provinces are the creation of central government, with very little autonomy.  - The Tour de France is an annual multiple stage bicycle race primarily held in France, while also occasionally making passes through nearby countries. The race was first organized in 1903 to increase sales for the newspaper \\"L'Auto\\"; which is currently run by the Amaury Sport Organisation.

Question: What is the reason I could n't sew in flip flops ?","output":"The inability to sew effectively while wearing flip flops could be due to several factors. Here's a detailed explanation that might help you understand the reasons behind this difficulty: 1. Lack of stability and support: Flip flops, by design, provide little to no support for your feet and tend to be less stable than other types of footwear, such as sneakers or boots. This lack of support can make it difficult to maintain a steady and secure footing while sewing, especially if you're using a sewing machine that requires the use of a foot pedal. The unstable nature of flip flops may cause you to feel unbalanced or uncomfortable, making it challenging to focus on your sewing task. 2. Impaired dexterity: When sewing, it's essential to have good control over your movements, especially when using a sewing machine's foot pedal. Wearing flip flops can impair your ability to accurately control the pressure applied to the pedal, potentially causing irregular stitching or difficulty maintaining a steady speed. Additionally, the loose nature of flip flops may limit your ability to move your feet and legs with precision, further affecting your sewing performance. 3. Sensitivity to tactile feedback: Many people prefer to perform certain tasks with their bare feet since it provides better sensory feedback. There might be a heightened sense of connection between your feet and the ground or sewing machine pedal, allowing for improved coordination and control over your movements. Going barefoot may give you a better sense of how much pressure to apply and when to adjust it, leading to a smoother sewing experience. 4. Psychological factors: It's possible that you might have developed a personal preference for sewing barefoot over time, perhaps due to the reasons mentioned above. This preference could lead to a self-fulfilling mentality, wherein you believe that you cannot sew effectively while wearing flip flops – which, in turn, causes you to experience difficulty when attempting to do so. It's also possible that you might feel more relaxed or comfortable when sewing barefoot, thereby leading to a more enjoyable and productive experience. 5. Environmental conditions: As you mentioned, you were sewing in a hot environment by the lake. This heat combined with the act of wearing flip flops might have made your feet sweat, resulting in a slippery or uncomfortable sensation that made it difficult to sew properly.  In conclusion, it's not necessarily that you're \\"weird\\" or an \\"oddball\\" for struggling to sew in flip flops - there are legitimate physical, psychological, and environmental factors at play here."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What was reissued by EMI in the 1970s? from the following article ?  Elgar's recordings were released on 78-rpm discs by both HMV and RCA Victor. After World War II, the 1932 recording of the Violin Concerto with the teenage Menuhin as soloist remained available on 78 and later on LP, but the other recordings were out of the catalogues for some years. When they were reissued by EMI on LP in the 1970s, they caused surprise to many by their fast tempi, in contrast to the slower speeds adopted by many conductors in the years since Elgar's death. The recordings were reissued on CD in the 1990s.In November 1931, Elgar was filmed by Pathé for a newsreel depicting a recording session of Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 at the opening of EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London. It is believed to be the only surviving sound film of Elgar, who makes a brief remark before conducting the London Symphony Orchestra, asking the musicians to \\"play this tune as though you've never heard it before.\\" A memorial plaque to Elgar at Abbey Road was unveiled on 24 June 1993.A late piece of Elgar's, the Nursery Suite, was an early example of a studio premiere: its first performance was in the Abbey Road studios. For this work, dedicated to the wife and daughters of the Duke of York, Elgar once again drew on his youthful sketch-books. In his final years, Elgar experienced a musical revival. The BBC organised a festival of his works to celebrate his seventy-fifth birthday, in 1932. He flew to Paris in 1933 to conduct the Violin Concerto for Menuhin. While in France, he visited his fellow composer Frederick Delius at his house at Grez-sur-Loing. He was sought out by younger musicians such as Adrian Boult, Malcolm Sargent and John Barbirolli, who championed his music when it was out of fashion. He began work on an opera, The Spanish Lady, and accepted a commission from the BBC to compose a Third Symphony. His final illness, however, prevented their completion. He fretted about the unfinished works. He asked Reed to ensure that nobody would \\"tinker\\" with the sketches and attempt a completion of the symphony,... A:","output":"The answer to the question is that EMI reissued Elgar's recordings on LP in the 1970s.

Andrew Larabee teaches at a school run by his headmaster father Matthew, a traditional man who disapproves of his son's unconventional methods despite their popularity with the students. Andrew's special interest is archaeology, and he hopes to earn his father's respect through this field of study. During the school holidays, Andrew bicycles to ancient ruins in Sussex where he believes a statue of Pan (which had been left behind by a Roman legion) can be found. Such a discovery would enable him to publish and subsequently wed Letitia Fairchild, his fiancée of five years, who insists he earn a promotion before she marries him. At the site he encounters the Gallini family traveling circus, which has been ordered to pack up and leave by the local police since the land is now property of dairy farmer Lord Elmwood. The five Gallini brothers and their cousin Selena mistake Andrew for a contractor, and when he tells them he doesn't mind if they remain, the Gallinis halt their \\"pulling up stakes\\". Lord Elmwood arrives and threatens to remove both Andrew and the circus, but Andrew realizes he's a former fellow Oxford University student with a checkered romantic past.

Answer the following question: Some might say that if you want to do something that results in changing society then you need to start from within, to do this what would you be doing?  A. riots  B. vote  C. change yourself  D. social activism  E. change clothes  The best answer is Answer:","output":"C. change yourself In order to bring about a change in society, one must first start by changing oneself. This involves adopting the values, principles, and habits that one wishes to see in society as a whole. By embodying these values, an individual can become a role model, inspiring and influencing others to adopt similar attitudes and behaviors. This, in turn, helps to create a ripple effect, ultimately leading to a shift in societal norms and values. Although options A, B, D, and E may contribute to creating change in society, they are not as effective as starting with oneself. Here's a breakdown of these options: A. Riots: Riots are a manifestation of social unrest and can bring attention to societal issues that need addressing. However, they tend to cause destruction and harm innocent people as well, which can lead to further dividing society instead of ushering in positive change. B. Vote: Voting is an essential component of a democratic society and is one way to participate in shaping the nation's policies and leadership. However, voting alone may not be sufficient to generate significant societal change. It is also important to engage with others, challenge existing systems, and promote the values and behaviors that one wishes to see in society. D. Social activism: Social activism, especially when it involves peaceful protest or raising awareness about important issues, can be an effective means to instigate change. Nonetheless, without individuals willing to embody the values and ideals that they advocate, activism can only go so far in generating sustainable and meaningful societal transformations. E. Change clothes: Changing clothes might symbolize a personal transformation or communicate a message (such as through slogan T-shirts), but this alone is not enough to create a shift in societal attitudes or behaviors. In conclusion, the best answer to the question is to change yourself (Option C). By embodying the values one wishes to see in society, an individual can inspire and influence others to adopt similar beliefs and mindsets. This approach not only promotes a more harmonious and positive society but also creates a strong foundation for lasting change."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Background: Joseph Conrad (Polish pronunciation: ['juzef ,kon.rad]; born Jozef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski; 3 December 1857 - 3 August 1924) was a Polish-British writer regarded as one of the greatest novelists to write in the English language. He joined the British merchant marine in 1878, and was granted British citizenship in 1886. Though he did not speak English fluently until his twenties, he was a master prose stylist who brought a non-English sensibility into English literature. He wrote stories and novels, many with a nautical setting, that depict trials of the human spirit in the midst of an impassive, inscrutable universe. Context: Conrad was a Russian subject, having been born in the Russian part of what had once been the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In December 1867, with the Russian government's permission, his father Apollo had taken him to the Austrian part of the former Commonwealth, which enjoyed considerable internal freedom and a degree of self-government. After the father's death, Conrad's uncle Bobrowski had attempted to secure Austrian citizenship for him - to no avail, probably because Conrad had not received permission from Russian authorities to remain abroad permanently and had not been released from being a Russian subject. Conrad could not return to Ukraine, in the Russian Empire - he would have been liable to many years' military service and, as the son of political exiles, to harassment.  In a letter of 9 August 1877, Conrad's uncle Bobrowski broached two important subjects: the desirability of Conrad's naturalisation abroad (tantamount to release from being a Russian subject) and Conrad's plans to join the British merchant marine. \\"[D]o you speak English?... I never wished you to become naturalized in France, mainly because of the compulsory military service... I thought, however, of your getting naturalized in Switzerland...\\" In his next letter, Bobrowski supported Conrad's idea of seeking citizenship of the United States or of \\"one of the more important Southern Republics\\".  Eventually Conrad would make his home in England. On 2 July 1886 he applied for British nationality, which was granted on 19 August 1886. Yet, in spite of having become a subject of Queen Victoria, Conrad had not ceased to be a subject of Tsar Alexander III. To achieve the latter, he had to make many visits to the Russian Embassy in London and politely reiterate his request. He would later recall the Embassy's home at Belgrave Square in his novel The Secret Agent. Finally, on 2 April 1889, the Russian Ministry of Home Affairs released \\"the son of a Polish man of letters, captain of the British merchant marine\\" from the status of Russian subject. Question: Is there anything else interesting about his citizenship?. Whats the answer?","output":"Joseph Conrad was a very interesting man when it came to citizenship. He was born in a part of Poland that was controlled by Russia, so at first, he was a Russian subject. However, he couldn't stay in the Russian Empire because he would have to join the army and maybe face harassment. His uncle tried to help him become a citizen of other countries, like Austria or Switzerland, but it didn't work out. Then, Conrad decided to join the British merchant marine - it's like the ships that move things from one place to another - and he later became a British citizen in 1886. But, even though he became a British citizen, he was still considered a Russian subject too. To fix this, he had to go to the Russian Embassy many times in London and ask them nicely to let him stop being a Russian subject. Finally, in 1889, the Russian government agreed to release him from being a Russian subject, and he only remained a British citizen. So, Joseph Conrad's journey to citizenship was a unique and interesting one."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

For this, we will choose option (b) - Cover the floor with foil, then run a hot iron over it. Here's how we do it: 1. First, we need to carefully lay aluminum foil on top of the warped flooring.

Article: Play is the basic business of childhood, and more and more in recent years research has shown the great importance of play in the development of a human being.From earliest infancy  , every child needs opportunity and the right material for play, and the main tools of play are toys.The main function of toys is to suggest, encourage and assist play.To succeed in this, they must be good toys, which children will play with often, and will come back to again and again.Therefore, it is important to choose suitable toys for different stages of a child's development. In recent years research on infant development has shown that the standard a child is likely to reach, within the range of his inherited abilities, is largely determined in the first three years of his life.So a baby's ability to benefit from the right play materials should not be underestimated.A baby who is encouraged, talked to and shown things and played with, has the best chance of growing up successfully. The next stage, from three to five years old, curiosity knows no bounds.Every type of suitable toy should be made available to the child, for trying out, experimenting and learning, for discovering his own particular ability. Bricks and jigsaws and construction toys; painting, scribbling and making things; sand and water play; toys for imaginative and pretending play; the first social games for learning to play and get on with others. By the third stage of play development--from five to seven or eight years old-- the child is at school.But for a few more years play is still the best way of learning, at home or at school.It is easier to see which type of toys the child most enjoys. Until the age of seven or eight, play and work mean much the same to a child.But once reading has been mastered, then books and school become the main source of learning.Toys are still interesting and valuable, which lead up to new hobbies, but their significance has changed --to a child of nine or ten years old, toys and games mean, as to adults, relaxation and fun.

And among the more conservative part of the OPTIONS: - Ana Navarro base, only 41% now support a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants, compared to 56% five months ago. - Bush base, only 41% now support a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants, compared to 56% five months ago. - Central America base, only 41% now support a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants, compared to 56% five months ago. - Florida base, only 41% now support a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants, compared to 56% five months ago. - Jeb Bush base, only 41% now support a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants, compared to 56% five months ago. - Marco Rubio base, only 41% now support a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants, compared to 56% five months ago. - Perry base, only 41% now support a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants, compared to 56% five months ago. - Republican base, only 41% now support a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants, compared to 56% five months ago. - Rick Perry base, only 41% now support a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants, compared to 56% five months ago. - Rubio base, only 41% now support a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants, compared to 56% five months ago. - Texas base, only 41% now support a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants, compared to 56% five months ago.","output":"The story concludes with the note of the Republican base, demonstrating how changes in public opinion on immigration have occurred and revealing political possibilities for the main characters. As Ana Navarro continues her analysis, she highlights a significant shift in public opinion within the conservative populace. She observes that, among the Republican base, there has been a dramatic decrease in support for a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants. \\"Now only 41% support a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants,\\" she noted, \\"compared to 56% five months ago.\\" This shift in conservative opinion reflects the changing political landscape around immigration. The crisis on the southern border, including the influx of migrant children, has had significant impact on public sentiment. People started rethinking their stance on immigration, creating a more complex and demanding space for politicians to navigate.  Yet this environment presented an opportunity for Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and Rick Perry. All three had earlier endured consequences due to their risky positions on immigration. However, the changing landscape allowed them to reconsider their standpoints, commensurate with the shifting sentiments within their electorate. Rick Perry, due to his governance of the directly affected Texas, was more overt in his positioning. Bush and Rubio, on the other hand, chose a more subdued approach. Their somewhat silent strategy, while subject to criticism, also reflected a sense of deliberation and careful response. Navarro's observation therefore is not just about statistics, but about the evolving political space in which these Republicans operate. It was about how change in public sentiment could mean both danger and opportunity, and how politicians respond to such tectonic shifts in public opinion. In concluding the story, it can be said that the immigration issue serves as a litmus test, gauging conservative leaders’ abilities to connect with their base, while navigating a complex, controversial issue. By understanding the shifts within their own party, Bush, Rubio and Perry might find new routes to regain the trust of their voters, and possibly, pave their paths toward more significant political offices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I kept the number and adjective (\\"18-hole\\") before the noun (\\"Golf Course\\") because, in Spanish, adjectives usually come after the noun, but numbers come before the noun. 2.

Translate prepositional phrase: \\"from the lodge\\" can be translated to \\"del albergue\\". \\"From\\" refers to the origin or starting point, which in Spanish is \\"del\\". The word \\"the\\" is translated to \\"el\\" or \\"la\\" based on gender, in this case, \\"lodge\\" (albergue) is a masculine noun, so it becomes \\"el albergue\\".

The answer is:","output":"I recently downloaded and installed the com.koushikdutta.superuser app on my device and felt utterly disappointed and frustrated by the experience. My expectations were thoroughly shattered, and I strongly believe it deserves a 1-star rating. First and foremost, the user interface (UI) is extremely outdated and unintuitive. The layout, design, and color scheme are extremely unattractive and confusing. As a result, navigating through the app and understanding its features became a monumental task, causing undue stress from the moment I started using it. Secondly, the performance of the app is incredibly slow and sluggish. It consumes a significant amount of system resources, and I experienced frequent app crashes and hangs. There were also instances of incompatibilities with my device's Android version, further causing instability and slow response times. This indicates a lack of optimization, and it is unbelievable that an app with such glaring shortcomings found its way to the market without thorough testing. Moreover, I found the app to be riddled with a multitude of intrusive advertisements. These ads pop up incessantly, hindering the user experience and making it extremely challenging to perform any task without having to close multiple ads. Often, the advertisements force the app to redirect to other websites and applications, which is a severe security and privacy concern. The app also suffers from poor customer support. Upon encountering issues with com.koushikdutta.superuser, I reached out to their customer service team for assistance. However, my inquiries were either unanswered or answered after a long delay with generic and unhelpful responses. It is disappointing to see that they do not prioritize users' needs and concerns. Lastly, the app's core functionality, which is managing superuser permissions, also left me dissatisfied. The app did not always process permission requests correctly, causing other apps on my device to malfunction. The lack of a proper advanced feature set and frequent inaccuracies raises severe doubts about the app's reliability and usefulness. In conclusion, I would not recommend com.koushikdutta.superuser to anyone who values a seamless, efficient, and user-friendly app experience. With a poorly designed interface, abysmal performance, intrusive advertisements, lack of customer support, and unreliable functionality, this app has earned my unequivocal 1-star rating. The developers must profoundly reassess and improve the current state of the app before it can even be considered a viable option in the superuser management category."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What she doesn't realize is that fate has different plans in store for her. Eloise's life takes an unexpected turn when she accidentally leaves one of her most stunning art pieces on a park bench while taking a break from her daily routine. Unbeknownst to her, the painting catches the eye of a successful, international film director, Pierre Dupont (played by Romain Duris). Pierre falls in love with the painting, feeling a deep emotional connection to the story it conveys. Determined to find the gifted artist behind the masterpiece, Pierre sets out on a city-wide search. Meanwhile, Eloise has a chance encounter with Pierre's charismatic assistant and amateur photographer, Marc Lefevre (played by Gaspard Ulliel). As they continue to meet unintentionally around the city, they gradually become more entangled in each other's lives. Marc, realizing Eloise's talent and potential, shares Pierre's search for the mysterious painter with Eloise, all the while unaware that she is in fact the artist Pierre seeks. As the search for the talented painter intensifies, Eloise finds herself divided between pursuing her growing feelings for Marc and her ambition of making it big in the world of art. Choosing to keep her identity as the mystery painter secret, Eloise assists Marc and Pierre in the search, hoping that the events will eventually push her work into the international limelight. The story reaches its climax when Marc, while looking through Eloise's sketchbook, recognizes her distinctive painting style. The truth finally dawns on him. Marc, feeling both exhilarated and betrayed, confronts Eloise, who was planning to reveal her secret to him in her own way. Their heated argument threatens to tear them apart, and Eloise's life starts to spiral out of control. Despite the hard feelings surrounding the revelation, Eloise's work starts gaining international attention, thanks to Pierre and Marc's efforts. As her career begins to soar, she realizes her love for Marc has grown into something she never truly expected. In the end, Eloise must make a choice between what she has always dreamed of and the person who ignited a passion beyond her art. As the film concludes, we find Eloise organizing a special exhibition in Paris, including the painting that started it all. As the exhibition draws to a close, Marc secretly attends, feeling proud of Eloise's achievements but heartbroken over their unresolved relationship. Eloise, finding Marc lost in the crowd, realizes that her success cannot overshadow what truly matters; the love she shares with Marc. Together, they reconcile and acknowledge that their relationship is what truly gives color to their world. \\"The Art of Chance\\" is a heartwarming romantic comedy-drama that weaves a story about love, ambition, and the magic of chance encounters.

Harry doesn't really recognize him at first but there appears to be a contrast between the two of them with Milt boasting of how well he is doing in life while Harry tries to listen. Milt takes Harry to his house to meet Ellen Manville (Elaine May), Milt's long-suffering wife. She is complaining that their sex life is non-existent but Milt has a secret lover in the form of beautiful blonde Linda. Milt convinces a barely-there Harry to make a go of things with Ellen so that she is not left lonely when he will divorce her for Linda. It takes a while but Harry and Ellen eventually fall in love. They marry and go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon but this is when Ellen realizes that Harry is the world's worst roommate and childish at heart. In one example, Harry unexpectedly stomps on Ellen's toe in order to test her love for him.  As she hobbles in pain, she asks, \\"What did you do that for?,\\" and in response, he asks her if she still loves him, and she says she does. As Milt and Linda start to settle down as a couple, she quickly realizes that he has an addiction to selling household items and junk for a quick buck, something that she is strongly against. She immediately dumps him, which leads to Milt to want Ellen back when he realizes how much he loves her for real. She admits that she doesn't really love Harry as much as she thought, as his bizarre day-to-day activities get to her. Milt and Ellen plot to get back together and convince Harry to divorce her but he loves her and sets out to prove it by getting a job as an elevator operator in a shopping mall. Answer:","output":"The full name of the character who plans to divorce his wife so that he can be with his lover is Milt Manville."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Thomas Stanley Raymond Hafey (5 August 1931 - 12 May 2014) was an Australian rules football Victorian Football League player and coach. Hafey played for Richmond between 1953 and 1958, and coached four clubs--Richmond, Collingwood, Geelong and Sydney--between 1966 and 1988, leading Richmond to a total of four premierships: 1967, 1969, 1973 and 1974. Hafey was an inaugural inductee into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996, named coach of Richmond's team of the century in 1998, and given the AFL Coaches Association \\"Coaching Legend Award\\" in 2011. He was renowned for his fitness and toughness even in his elderly years when he would still run rings around his juniors. Richmond dominated the 1967 season, running out winners in a classic Grand Final against Geelong. In his first two years, the team lost only seven games and Hafey had gone from an unknown coach in the bush to the toast of the football world. In hindsight, the 1967 premiership marked a turning point for the game. The Tigers were fitter than any team that had gone before and were the highest scoring team since 1950. Australian football, after two decades of defensive-based play, was about to enter an era of high scoring, aided by rule changes, new tactics and betters standards of fitness.  The Tigers started the 1968 season slowly. They rallied to win the last six games, but missed the finals. When the Tigers were again lethargic in mid-1969, accusations of under-achievement arose and rumours that Hafey was on the way out circulated. The players rallied behind Hafey and finished the season strong, taking fourth place. The team won all three finals, taking a second premiership.  After missing the playoffs in 1970, Hafey took the Tigers to the finals for the next five years. Basing the team's strategy around all-out attack had drawbacks. Most famously, during the 1972 finals the team conceded the highest score ever, losing to Carlton in a shock upset. Hafey later said the defeat depressed him for many months, but it later became the motivation for back-to-back premierships in 1973 and 1974. By now, the aggressive attitude of the club both on and off the field had created resentment toward the club. A number of incidents during the 1973 Grand Final - the Windy Hill brawl, the attempted recruitment of John Pitura from South Melbourne and a poor reaction to Kevin Bartlett's failure to win the Brownlow medal - all focussed negative attention on the club. Hafey, however, used the resentment to his advantage, telling his players \\"it's Richmond against the world\\".  Richmond showed signs of ageing in 1975, when they lost in the preliminary final. A raft of player departures made for a poor 1976 season, with the Tigers finishing seventh, Hafey's worst ever result. He was reappointed for 1977, but not unanimously (he had no contract with Richmond, instead being appointed on a year-to-year basis). When it leaked that Graeme Richmond, the club's powerbroker, had voted against Hafey's reappointment Hafey immediately resigned.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Imagine this situation. You pass a group of people. The people are talking to each other. You cannot hear what they are saying. But suddenly they start laughing. What would you think? Would you think they were laughing at something funny that one of them said? Or -- be honest with yourself -- would you think they were laughing at you? Yes, you. Being laughed at is a common fear. But a major study published in two thousand and nine found that this fear is not the same around the world. It differs from culture to culture. People in Finland were the least likely to believe that people laughing in their presence were making fun of them. Less than ten percent of Finns in the study said they would think that, compared to eighty percent of people in Thailand. Some people in the study said they felt unsure of themselves in social situations but hid their feelings of insecurity. Others said they avoided social situations where they had been laughed at before. The study found that people in Turkmenistan and Cambodia were more likely to be in the first group. They would hide their feelings of insecurity if they were around other people's laughter. But people in Iraq, Egypt and Jordan were more likely to try to avoid such situations if they felt they had been laughed at before. Shy people often avoid situations that would force them into close contact with other people. They worry that something they say or do will make other people laugh at them. But some people worry much more than others. They may have a disorder called gelotophobia. Gelos is a Greek word. It means laughter. Phobia means fear.

It supports both lossy and lossless compression, and is the preferred image format for Ecma-388 Open XML Paper Specification documents.  - JPEG 2000 (JP2) is an image compression standard and coding system. It was created by the Joint Photographic Experts Group committee in 2000 with the intention of superseding their original discrete cosine transform-based JPEG standard (created in 1992) with a newly designed, wavelet-based method. The standardized filename extension is .jp2 for ISO/IEC 15444-1 conforming files and .jpx for the extended part-2 specifications, published as ISO/IEC 15444-2. The registered MIME types are defined in RFC 3745. For ISO/IEC 15444-1 it is image/jp2.  - Digital photography is a form of photography that uses cameras containing arrays of electronic photodetectors to capture images focused by a lens, as opposed to an exposure on photographic film. The captured images are digitized and stored as a computer file ready for further digital processing, viewing, digital publishing or printing.  - The ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) is one of the three sectors (divisions or units) of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU); it coordinates standards for telecommunications.  - The Joint Photographic Experts Group is the joint committee between ISO/IEC JTC1 and ITU-T (formerly CCITT) that created the JPEG, JPEG 2000, and JPEG XR standards. It is one of two sub-groups of ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 29, Working Group 1 (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 1)  titled as \\"Coding of still pictures\\". In the ITU-T, its work falls in the domain of the ITU-T Visual Coding Experts Group (VCEG). ISO/IEC JTC1 SC29 Working Group 1 (working together with ITU-T Study Group 16  SG16 and previously also with Study Group 8  SG8) is responsible for the JPEG and JBIG standards. The scope of the organization includes the work of both the Joint Photographic Experts Group and Joint Bi-level Image Experts Group.  - JPEG is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images, particularly for those images produced by digital photography. The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable tradeoff between storage size and image quality. JPEG typically achieves 10:1 compression with little perceptible loss in image quality.  - In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks.  - A digital image is a numeric representation of (normally binary) a two-dimensional image. Depending on whether the image resolution is fixed, it may be of vector or raster type. By itself, the term \\"digital image\\" usually refers to raster images or bitmapped images.  - A wavelet is a wave-like oscillation with an amplitude that begins at zero, increases, and then decreases back to zero. It can typically be visualized as a \\"brief oscillation\\" like one recorded by a seismograph or heart monitor. Generally, wavelets are purposefully crafted to have specific properties that make them useful for signal processing. Wavelets can be combined, using a \\"reverse, shift, multiply and integrate\\" technique called convolution, with portions of a known signal to extract information from the unknown signal.  - Lossless JPEG is a 1993 addition to JPEG standard by the Joint Photographic Experts Group to enable lossless compression . However , it might be used as an umbrella term to refer to all lossless compression schemes developed by the Joint Photographic Expert group . They include JPEG 2000 and JPEG - LS . Lossless JPEG was developed as a late addition to JPEG in 1993 , using a completely different technique from the lossy JPEG standard . It uses a predictive scheme based on the three nearest ( causal ) neighbors ( upper , left , and upper - left ) , and entropy coding is used on the prediction error . The standard Independent JPEG Group libraries can not encode or decode it , but Ken Murchison of Oceana Matrix Ltd. wrote a patch that extends the IJG library to handle Lossless JPEG . Lossless JPEG has some popularity in medical imaging , and is used in DNG and some digital cameras to compress raw images , but otherwise was never widely adopted .  - Image quality is a characteristic of an image that measures the perceived image degradation (typically, compared to an ideal or perfect image). Imaging systems may introduce some amounts of distortion or artifacts in the signal, so the quality assessment is an important problem.  - A filename extension is an identifier specified as a suffix to the name of a computer file. The extension indicates a characteristic of the file contents or its intended use. A file extension is typically delimited from the filename with a full stop (period), but in some systems it is separated with spaces.  - The objective of image compression is to reduce irrelevance and redundancy of the image data in order to be able to store or transmit data in an efficient form.  - In information technology, lossy compression or irreversible compression is the class of data encoding methods that uses inexact approximations and partial data discarding to represent the content. These techniques are used to reduce data size for storage, handling, and transmitting content. Different versions of the photo of the cat above show how higher degrees of approximation create coarser images as more details are removed. This is opposed to lossless data compression (reversible data compression) which does not degrade the data. The amount of data reduction possible using lossy compression is often much higher than through lossless techniques.  - In signal processing, data compression, source coding, or bit-rate reduction involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. Compression can be either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information. The process of reducing the size of a data file is referred to as data compression. In the context of data transmission, it is called source coding (encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted) in opposition to channel coding.  - The Joint Bi-level Image Experts Group (JBIG) is a group of experts nominated by national standards bodies and major companies to work to produce standards for bi-level image coding. The \\"joint\\" refers to its status as a committee working on both ISO and ITU-T standards. It is one of two sub-groups of ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 29, Working Group 1 (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 1), whose official title is \\"Coding of still pictures\\".  - JBIG is an early lossless image compression standard from the Joint Bi-level Image Experts Group, standardized as ISO/IEC standard 11544 and as ITU-T recommendation T.82 in March 1993. It is widely implemented in fax machines. Now that the newer bi-level image compression standard JBIG2 has been released, JBIG is also known as JBIG1. JBIG was designed for compression of binary images, particularly for faxes, but can also be used on other images. In most situations JBIG offers between a 20% and 50% increase in compression efficiency over the Fax Group 4 standard, and in some situations, it offers a 30-fold improvement.  - Lossless compression is a class of data compression algorithms that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data. By contrast, lossy compression permits reconstruction only of an approximation of the original data, though this usually improves compression rates (and therefore reduces file sizes).  - A discrete cosine transform (DCT) expresses a finite sequence of data points in terms of a sum of cosine functions oscillating at different frequencies. DCTs are important to numerous applications in science and engineering, from lossy compression of audio (e.g. MP3) and images (e.g. JPEG) (where small high-frequency components can be discarded), to spectral methods for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. The use of cosine rather than sine functions is critical for compression, since it turns out (as described below) that fewer cosine functions are needed to approximate a typical signal, whereas for differential equations the cosines express a particular choice of boundary conditions.  - Compress is a Unix shell compression program based on the LZW compression algorithm. Compared to more modern compression utilities such as gzip and bzip2, compress performs faster and with less memory usage, at the cost of a significantly lower compression ratio.

(A) granite countertop (B) carpet floor","output":"Based on the logic presented in the test, the correct answer for your students to choose would be (A) granite countertop. Here's a more detailed explanation that you can refer to or share with your students: The question mentions that \\"a chef rolled his rolling pin a much greater distance on his ____.\\" This indicates that the appropriate answer will be the surface that allows the rolling pin to travel a more significant distance. The potential options for this answer are \\"granite countertop\\" and \\"carpet floor.\\" The test subsequently provides information regarding the smoothness and friction of both surfaces: \\"The carpet was not nearly as smooth as the countertop and created more friction.\\" Based on this information, we can deduce that the granite countertop is smoother and has less friction when compared to the carpet floor. In the context of rolling a pin, a surface with less friction, such as a smoother surface, would enable the rolling pin to move more freely and cover more significant distances. Therefore, the granite countertop is the surface on which the chef can roll his rolling pin a much greater distance. Thus, the answer that students should choose for this logic test is (A) granite countertop, as it is the smoother surface with less friction, allowing the chef to roll his rolling pin a greater distance compared to the carpet floor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Write a title for this article: Washington (CNN) -- The pilot of an Asiana Airlines jet that crashed in San Francisco this year told investigators after the accident that he had been \\"very concerned\\" about landing without help from an airport navigation system that was out of order. Capt. Lee Kang Kuk, who was highly experienced in a Boeing 747 but was transitioning to flying a 777, told the National Transportation Safety Board that he found it \\"very stressful, very difficult\\" to land without the glideslope indicator that helps pilots determine whether the plane is too high or too low during approach. \\"Asked whether he was concerned about his ability to perform the visual approach while piloting Asiana Flight 214, he said 'very concerned, yea,'\\" the safety board revealed at a hearing on Wednesday on its investigation into the July 6 crash that killed three people and injured more than 180 others. The jet struck a sea wall and broke apart on the runway following a missed approach.

But a second, visual lighting system was operable at the time of the daytime crash and the weather was clear. The safety board investigation is focusing on whether pilots have become overly reliant on automation to fly commercial planes, and whether basic manual flying skills have eroded. Investigators have also focused on the pilot understanding -- or misunderstanding -- of the plane's auto-thrust system, which controls aircraft power. Automated cockpit systems key to Asiana probe Some of the crew of the Asiana flight from Seoul told investigators the auto thrust was always engaged. But the safety board has said that system was not engaged, and the jet descended in altitude faster than it should have, and had a slower forward speed than intended. The combination put the plane into a perilous situation in the final minute of flight. The relief first officer, Bong Dongwon, who was sitting behind Lee and instructor pilot Lee Jungmin, said he observed the fast descent -- or sink rate -- and called out the excessive sink rate \\"more than four times.\\" Bong told investigators the pilot appeared to be correcting the \\"sink rate\\" and did not advise further changes. But its speed was declining at about the same time. The plane was flying at 170 knots 73 seconds before impact, dropped below the target speed for landing of 137 knots at roughly 38 seconds before impact, and plummeted as low as 103 knots just seconds before the plane's front landing gear and tail hit the sea wall at the end of the runway. Will firefighter be charged after Asiana crash? The crew made its first reference to the plane's speed problem just seven seconds before the crash. The pilot called out a \\"go around\\" -- a command to abort the landing -- three seconds before impact. Boeing's former chief pilot for the B777 program said automated systems are intended to help pilots, but that they still need to exercise diligence. \\"We accept the fact that pilots, as all humans, make errors,\\" he said. Automation is intended \\"as a tool to aid the pilot, not replace the pilot,\\" he said. Information released at Wednesday's hearing also showed investigators are concerned about the role Korean and airline culture played in the crash. Bong said the crew practiced \\"cockpit resource management,\\" training that encourages subordinates to speak up about safety concerns to other crew members, despite their senior rank, experience or seniority. But when Lee -- who was considered a student pilot in the 777 -- was asked whether he had contemplated an aborted landing as the plane descended, he said it was a \\"very hard\\" decision to make, given the deference shown to superiors in Korean culture. By the time Lee pushed the throttle forward just seconds before impact, he discovered his instructor had already done so. Three passengers died in the accident -- two in the crash and a third on the ground when hit by a rescue truck responding to the scene. The accident was the first fatal commercial airline crash in the United States since February 2009. Crash survivor Ben Levy told CNN he was forfeiting an opportunity to watch the proceedings. \\"I think something that I've done quickly after this plane crash has been to focus on work and family and things that matter to me,\\" Levy said. \\"I'm extremely happy that something is being done to get to the bottom of what happened that day because it should not have happened.\\" Opinion: Pilots, not computers, should fly planes CNN's Dan Simon contributed to this report.

This is because the hypothesis is essentially a restatement or summarization of the premise, with both statements sharing the same underlying concept of assessing the effectiveness of multiple programs in working together to fulfill urgent client needs. The premise states that some programs are designed to evaluate if other programs are working cohesively to ensure that urgent clients' needs are being addressed. This implies that there is a process in place to determine if all the programs are functioning well together and are keeping the clients' needs in mind. The hypothesis, on the other hand, simplifies the original premise and states that programs to evaluate whether programs worked together to assure clients' needs are addressed. Again, the focus of the hypothesis is on evaluating the cohesion and effectiveness of various programs in fulfilling the clients' needs. While there is a slight difference in the wording of the two statements, the overall objective and commitment to evaluating the functioning and performance of the programs remain the same. Thus, if the premise is true, which means that programs were indeed created to evaluate the synergy and effectiveness of all programs in addressing urgent client needs, then it supports the hypothesis. Consequently, if we assume that the premise is true, we can conclude that the hypothesis is also true, as both statements are based on the same fundamental concept of assessing the performance and coordination of multiple programs to ensure that they are fulfilling the clients' urgent needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Godzilla The answer is:","output":"Title: \\"To Tame a Titan\\" Genre: Sci-Fi/Action/Adventure Plot: Dr. Martin Landers, a brilliant but troubled scientist, has been working on a top-secret government project – developing a mind-controlling device to communicate with and control massive creatures, primarily the legendary Godzilla who has wreaked havoc across the world for years. The experiment involves a brain-to-brain connection between Martin and the gigantic beast.  The movie begins with Martin in a hospital bed. He wakes up with no memory of his past or the experiment. The only memories he has are fragmented visions of massive destruction and a silhouette of Godzilla. As Martin struggles to make sense of his situation, in comes Dr. Jennifer Sanders, a colleague who has been working alongside him on the project. She helps Martin remember his past and explains their mission to tame Godzilla to prevent further catastrophes. As Martin recovers, they begin testing the mind-controlling device. However, they accidentally trigger a deep, primal rage in Godzilla, causing the creature to go on an even more ruthless rampage. Their failed experiment prompts retaliation from monster-hunting organization Monarch, who blame Martin and Jennifer for the heightened danger. With time running out, Martin and Jennifer must evade Monarch and correct their mistake, all while trying to understand the visions that Martin experiences during his connection with Godzilla. As they dig deeper, they uncover a hidden truth: Godzilla's destructive tendencies are not born from blind rage, but from a desperate attempt to protect its offspring.  Our protagonists also learn that another, more sinister force called Ghidorah, a three-headed dragon-like creature, has been manipulating Godzilla to swarm cities in a quest to conquer the earth. In a twist of fate, Martin and Jennifer join forces with Monarch to stop Ghidorah. Utilizing the mind-controlling device, Martin must push himself to the limit and establish a connection with Godzilla, convincing the creature to join the fight against Ghidorah in order to save its offspring and the world. As the epic battle between Godzilla and Ghidorah unfolds, Martin wakes up once again, lying in that same hospital bed. This time, he retains the memories of his journey and adventures. He discovers that he was in a coma after the first experiment went awry, causing an explosion at their facility.  The movie ends with Martin returning to his work with Jennifer and Monarch, dedicating himself to understanding, empathizing with, and protecting these misunderstood titans. Together, they set out to strike a balance between the human world and the world of the mighty giants, utilizing the power of friendship and mutual trust."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For about 13 minutes, Team USA sat at the top of its World Cup soccer group, ahead of the mighty Germany and star-powered Portugal. Then Portugal struck back. With seconds left to play, Cristiano Ronaldo set up a header for his teammate Silvestre Varela, leaving the final score tied at 2-2. It was a harsh blow for the Americans, but it does not end their World Cup dreams -- it just makes them harder to achieve. With every team in Brazil now having played two matches, most groups now have clear winners and losers. But not Group G. In theory, any of the four teams in the group of Germany, the United States, Ghana and Portugal could still qualify for the knockout round. Here's how it could work for the United States. It plays Germany, the group leader, on Thursday. Third-ranked Ghana plays Portugal at the same time. If the United States beats Germany:. The Americans qualify for the knockout stage. Team USA would get three points for the victory, giving it seven. No other team in the group can match that, so the Americans go through to the next stage. Is that likely? It's possible, but it's not likely. Germany is the No. 2-ranked team in the world, and it hasn't lost a game yet this World Cup. The Americans haven't lost a game either, though. If the United States ties with Germany:. Both teams go through to the knockout stage. Each would get a point for the draw, giving them five points each. No matter who wins the Ghana-Portugal match, neither team can end up with more than four points. Is that likely? The odds aren't bad. Ghana held Germany to a draw Friday, proving that it can be done. Germany and the United States have each won one and drawn one. If the United States loses to Germany:. It's bad, but even that's not necessarily game over. Germany would definitely finish at the top of the group, and second place would depend both on how badly the Americans lose and what the margin of victory is in the Ghana-Portugal game. If the two teams draw, then the Americans come in second place. If Portugal wins by a narrow margin, USA still comes second in the group and goes through. But if Ghana wins by two or more, it'll be the Africans and not the Americans who advance -- making this the third World Cup in a row where Ghana eliminates Team USA. Monday's matches. Brazil and Mexico advanced to the Round of 16 with victories Monday while the Netherlands' win over Chile gave it the top spot in its group and the South Americans second place.

These little germs eat up the sugar in food, like in bread dough or grape juice, and as they do that, they create other stuff. They essentially transform the food.  Now, the second question is asking about the outcome or the products of this cooking-without-heat process, the fermentation. When the microorganisms have done their work on the sugar, they make new things. For example, when they work on bread dough, they create gas that makes the bread fluffy. In grape juice, they make alcohol, which is how we get wine. So you see, one question is about what fermentation is and the other is about what it produces, but both are talking about the same interesting process!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We have the following equation to solve: -177861*y = -177929*y - 1224 First, let's add 177929*y to both sides of the equation to get all the 'y' terms on one side: (-177861*y) + (177929*y) = (-177929*y) + (177929*y) - 1224  This simplifies to: (177929*y - 177861*y) = -1224 Now, if you subtract the two 'y' parts (177929-177861), you get: 68*y = -1224 Now, we have to solve for 'y'. To do that, we will divide both sides of the equation by 68: (68*y)/68 = (-1224)/68 This simplifies to: y = -18 So, it turns out that y equals -18, like the answer to a little puzzle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Inland waters may be grouped into two general classes: standing waters and flowing waters. As is often the case, the boundary between these two classes is not sharp and clear. A pond is an example of standing water. But most ponds are fed by springs or brooks and most have an outlet. Thus some current of changing water flows through them. On the other hand, a river is an example of flowing water. In some places, however, a river may have such a slow current that it is very difficult to detect. Standing inland waters differ in size, in age, and in many _ environmental characteristics. They range in size from roadside puddles to the Caspian Sea. Puddles may last for only a few days or weeks; ponds, for a few hundred to a thousand years. In general, lakes are older, though the waters of some tropical \\"lakes\\" disappear completely during each dry season. Standing waters vary from very shallow to very deep, from clear to muddy, from fresh to salty. In flowing waters we roughly distinguish between brooks, creeks, and rivers. The size and age of flowing waters are unimportant. Speed of flow, clearness, oxygen content, and other chemical characteristics are used by scientists in studying flowing-water ecosystems.

Prestige Records released jazz records in this format in the late 1950s; for example, two of their Miles Davis albums were paired together in this format. Peter Goldmark, the man who developed the 33 1⁄3 rpm record, developed the Highway Hi-Fi 16 2⁄3 rpm record to be played in Chrysler automobiles, but poor performance of the system and weak implementation by Chrysler and Columbia led to the demise of the 16 2⁄3 rpm records. Subsequently, the 16 2⁄3 rpm speed was used for narrated publications for the blind and visually impaired, and were never widely commercially available, although it was common to see new turntable models with a 16 rpm speed setting produced as late as the 1970s. What was 16 2/3 rpm speed used for?","output":"The 16 2/3 rpm (rotations per minute) speed was used primarily for specific types of recordings and applications. Initially, this speed was utilized for pressing certain records, such as books for the blind. These recordings provided narrated content to make literature accessible for individuals with visual impairments.  In the late 1950s, Prestige Records also released jazz records at this speed. Notably, they paired two Miles Davis albums together in this format. Around the same time, Peter Goldmark, the developer of the 33 1/3 rpm record, created the Highway Hi-Fi 16 2/3 rpm record, specifically designed to be played in Chrysler automobiles. However, due to poor system performance and weak implementation by Chrysler and Columbia, this format ultimately failed and contributed to the decline of 16 2/3 rpm records in the automotive industry.

Alduksen lehti Which language is this?","output":"Alduksen lehti is a phrase in Finnish, which is a Uralic language spoken mainly in Finland, where it is the official language alongside Swedish. Finnish is part of the Finnic group of languages, which also includes Estonian and other minor languages spoken around the Baltic Sea. It is worth noting that Finnish is not part of the Indo-European language family, as it descends from a different language family called Uralic. Finnish has several dialects, influenced by various historical factors and regional variants. Generally, these dialect groups can be characterized into two primary categories: Western Finnish dialects and Eastern Finnish dialects. Some of the dialects include Tavastian, Central Ostrobothnian, Southwestern Finnish, Eastern Finnish, Southeastern Finnish, and others. In terms of orthography, Finnish uses the Latin alphabet, but it also includes some special characters such as \\"ä\\" and \\"ö.\\" The Finnish language is characterized by its agglutinative nature, meaning it combines multiple morphemes (basic units of meaning) into single words. This can create rather long and complex words. Finnish has a relatively small number of prepositions, and it relies on cases to indicate relationships between words. The language has 15 grammatical cases: nominative, genitive, essive, partitive, translative, inessive, elative, illative, adessive, ablative, allative, essive, exessive, abessive, and comitative. Regarding Alduksen lehti, this Finnish phrase can be translated into English as \\"the leaf of Aldus.\\" There isn't a specific context or additional information provided about the phrase, so it is difficult to determine whether it represents a proper name or a reference to something else. To summarize, Alduksen lehti is a phrase in the Finnish language, which is part of the Uralic language family and spoken primarily in Finland. Finnish has various dialects and features an agglutinative structure with a relatively small number of prepositions, relying on cases to indicate relationships between words. The translation of this Finnish phrase is \\"the leaf of Aldus,\\" although more context would be needed to determine its specific meaning or reference."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's break it down to understand why it's classified this way. Firstly, referring to a film as \\"beautiful\\" is a clear indication of a positive sentiment. The word \\"beautiful\\" implies an appreciation of aesthetic value and quality. When used to describe a film, it generally means the viewer enjoyed the movie, liked the way it was made, found it visually appealing, or was moved by the storyline, the characters, or the meaning conveyed. Similarly, tagging the film as being for \\"people who like their romances to have that French realism\\" is also radiating positivity. This statement not only implies that the movie excellently showcases French realism—it's also subtly suggesting that viewers who admire such kind of films are likely to enjoy it. And in movie reviews, segmenting the audience and specifying exactly who could enjoy the movie isn't always common—thus, naming the potential audience makes the statement more powerful and persuasive. Moreover, acknowledging \\"French realism\\" brings out a sense of sophistication and refinement associated with French cinema. This style is known for its focus on character development, social themes, and often poignant and melancholic treatment of love which distinguishes it from 'typical' romances. This indirect compliment further indicates a positive sentiment. So, in conclusion, the sentence's sentiment radiates positivity. It praises the film's beauty, appreciates its adherence to French realism, and recommends it to the audience that admires this genre—thus making a strong, positive statement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First and foremost, they mention that they enjoyed the breakfast and gyro, which are presumably two of the menu items that they have experienced. Praise for the food is a clear indication of a positive review. Additionally, they compliment the service, stating that it is great.

The reviewer also appreciates the availability of a patio for smokers, catering to their personal preferences and enhancing their overall experience. Furthermore, they point out that there might be a wait for breakfast on Saturdays and Sundays. While mentioning a wait time could be perceived as a negative aspect, in the context of this review, it seems to suggest that the establishment is popular and draws in crowds, which may be seen as an affirmation of its appeal and quality.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: Only Obama can fix his broken foreign policy “I am giving an order,” said Obama needlessly in the final meeting in the Situation Room when he backed the halfway counterinsurgency strategy from Gen. Stanley McChrystal’s menu of options. Gates writes bitterly: “That order was unnecessary and insulting, proof positive of the depth of the Obama White House’s distrust of the nation’s military leadership.” By June 2010, Obama was confiding privately to Gates: “I don’t have the sense it’s going well in Afghanistan. He [McChrystal] doesn’t seem to be making progress. Maybe his strategy is not really working.” This is the ultimate nightmare for a commander in chief, to be caught in a war in which he no longer believes. The Vietnam version broke Lyndon Johnson and his defense secretary, Robert McNamara. Afghanistan has badly damaged Obama and his team. Gates is brutally honest about his former colleagues. But this reader was left wondering why Gates continued serving in an administration “with people talking blithely about the use of military force as though it were some kind of video game.” Why didn’t he resign? Perhaps the answer is the same as to why Obama stuck with the policy he doubted: War sometimes doesn’t allow clean options, all-in or all-out. People soldier on as best they can. White House officials are upset about the book. But they should use it as an opportunity to examine the deeper question of how the foreign policy process got so damaged and what they can do to repair it. If anything, the situation is worse now than when Gates was at the Pentagon: He was part of the famous “team of rivals” that also included other strong, confident leaders such as Hillary Rodham Clinton at State, Leon Panetta at the CIA and then the Pentagon, and Gen. David H. Petraeus in Kabul and, later, at the CIA. At the center of this process was Tom Donilon, the national security adviser, disliked by Gates as a political commissar but effective at maintaining order among a team whose members, as Gates makes clear, were often seething. The dream team (with all its dysfunction) has been replaced by a group that is more closely aligned with the war-weary Obama — the president who wanted out of Afghanistan and resisted involvement in Syria. Officials I’ve spoken with are unanimous that, with the exception of Secretary of State John Kerry, this group is weaker and less self-confident. Susan Rice has been nearly invisible as national security adviser at a time when U.S. allies are hungry for contact. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, a well-liked former senator, comes across in public as overwhelmed by some of the policy choices facing the Pentagon. It’s a bad sign that, when Hagel was looking for a new deputy secretary to replace Ashton Carter, several top candidates, such as former undersecretary Michele Flournoy, weren’t interested. Hagel reportedly has settled on Robert Work, a former undersecretary of the Navy, who gets good marks from former colleagues but isn’t well known at home or abroad. The reality is that Obama needs to own his foreign policy. He needs to be more strategic and less political. He needs to set a vision and articulate it to allies and adversaries. His national security adviser needs to help him focus and communicate policy decisions. These criticisms were true in the era Gates describes, when the president was surrounded by strong personalities. It’s even true now, when the cast is less experienced. An example of how Obama can drive policy is his approach to Iran. In dealing with Tehran, Obama has been strategic and disciplined, opening the door to negotiations on the nuclear issue and forming a U.N. coalition for tough sanctions to pressure Iran into dialogue. Gates admits: “Our ‘team of rivals’ let personal feelings and distrust cloud our perceptions and recommendations.” True, and the damage can be repaired only by the president.

Summary:","output":"This article talks about how President Obama needs to fix his broken foreign policy. A long time ago, President Obama wasn't sure if things were going well in Afghanistan and didn't think the military's plans were working. Because of this, his team and their plans were damaged. The article says that President Obama needs to have a better plan and talk to other countries about it. Right now, his team doesn't have as many strong leaders as before, so he needs to work even harder to fix his foreign policy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

There are a few important assumptions we have to make in order to analyze the tweet, as the text has some errors and is therefore open to interpretation.  1. Context: It is crucial to consider the context surrounding the tweet, such as the subject matter, any previous conversation, the Twitter user's profile, and recent related events. A sentiment analysis based solely on the text may provide a skewed or misleading interpretation. 2. Text interpretation: Taking the given tweet at face value, it appears to contain a typing error. We can assume that the correct version could be \\"@clairemsp means alot\\" or \\"@clairemsp thanks a lot\\", with the latter being a more plausible interpretation as 'tians' could possibly be a misspelled or typo version of 'thanks'. This interpretation suggests a message of gratitude. Semantically, this phrase signifies a positive sentiment. 3. User's Tone: Analyzing the specific tweet, we can observe that the user is directly addressing \\"clairemsp\\" and sharing that something \\"means a lot\\" or they are thankful. This could imply that clairemsp has contributed to something valuable or helpful; however, the tweet lacks specific details. Despite that, overall, the tone of the tweet appears to be appreciative and possibly positive. Considering these elements, the sentiment of the tweet can be described as predominantly positive. Here, the author is expressing gratitude to the person they've mentioned in the tweet and is likely appreciative of their help, contribution, or impact. It is essential to note that understanding the broader context and tone of the conversation or topic would provide better insight and accuracy in determining the tweet sentiment.

He finally dies with a comical lack of interest, expressing his slight concern in an affected English accent. Humbert is left exhausted and disoriented.The film then turns to events four years earlier and goes forward as Humbert travels to Ramsdale, New Hampshire, a small town where he will spend the summer before his professorship begins at Beardsley College, Ohio. He searches across the town for room to let, being tempted by widowed, sexually famished mother, Charlotte Haze (Shelley Winters) to stay at her house. He declines until seeing her beautiful 14-year-old daughter, Dolores Haze (Sue Lyon), affectionately called Lolita (hence the title). Lolita is a soda-pop drinking, gum-chewing, overtly flirtatious teenager, with whom Humbert falls hopelessly in love.In order to become close to Lolita, Humbert accepts Charlotte's offer and becomes a lodger in the Haze household.

Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Neil Shaw (Snipes) is an operative for the United Nations's covert dirty-tricks squad, using espionage and quasi-ethical tactics to secure peace and cooperation. In Hong Kong, Shaw infiltrates a Chinese New Year party held by Chinese business mogul David Chan (Tagawa) and covertly hacks an office laptop of a North Korean Defense Minister, and blackmails him with the misappropriation of U.N. aid money, in exchange for continuing negotiations with South Korea. Shortly after being discovered, Shaw fights his way out of the party, and suffers a gunshot wound to his shoulder during extraction.Six months later, a shipping container full of dead Vietnamese refugees from Hong Kong turns up on the New York docks on the week as China's trade agreement with the U.S. Shaw's boss, Eleanor Hooks (Archer) suspects Chinese ambassador Wu's (Hong) connection with the Chinese Triad, and assigns Shaw to plant a bug on Wu during a banquet held by Chan. During the trade agreement banquet, Wu is gunned down, Chan is shot in the arm, and Shaw pursues a masked gunman. During the pursuit, Shaw's teammate Robert Bly (Biehn) supposedly corners the gunman, but perishes, and Shaw is arrested by the NYPD. In the middle of a prison transfer, FBI agent Frank Capella's (Chaykin) van is disabled by a roadside bomb, and an unconscious Shaw is captured by Triad members to be framed of the murder and disposed of. Shaw regains consciousness and frees himself from captivity, only to find his last remaining team member, Jenna Novak (Liliana Komorowska) murdered by a Chinese hitman. Shaw kills the hitman, recovers the audio file, and secures weapons and equipment from Novak's hidden armory. Shaw seeks out Julia Fang's (Matiko) help after reading a news article stating Shaw's innocence. Shaw manages to save Fang from an ambush by a Chinese hitwoman at a hospital.With Fang's aid, Shaw finds a Triad-owned bakery serving as a front for a Gentleman's club, setting up an unlikely alliance with Capella, as well as retrieving video footage of Chan's role in derailing the trade agreement. Fang delivers the evidence to Hooks while Shaw confronts Chan at the same hotel serving as the banquet. Chan is shot dead by a masked gunman while being interrogated by Shaw. The pursuit ends when Shaw finds a scanner that is tuned to a tracking device embedded in Shaw's gunshot wound before being ambushed by Bly. Bly reveals himself as the assassin at the banquet, and also engineered the tracking device implant from an earlier basketball game injury. Hooks reviews the evidence, and reveals that she and Chan were the masterminds behind the conspiracy. A disgusted Fang tries to leave, but attempts to hide from Bly only to be locked in a bathroom.Shaw eventually figures out Hooks's role behind the conspiracy and approaches Capella with his findings. Shaw uses Capella's business card to surgically remove his tracking device, and gives the Triads a business proposition. Shaw breaks into the U.N. building, and enters into a shootout and hand-to-hand fight with Bly, where the latter dies after falling on a glass shard from a broken glass pane. The following day, Shaw calls Hooks in her limousine and lectures her on a lesson in karma, revealing that Shaw's business proposition to the Triads was to assassinate Hooks for her betrayal. Shaw later has his death faked before reuniting with Fang in France, but is monitored by an unknown spy., Question: Shaw was assigned to plant a bug on who?

After sustained AF was present, the atrial pacemaker was turned off and 9 open chest dogs received 0.015 mg/kg ibutilide (37 degrees C) in 30 ml saline into the pericardial sac. Ten control dogs received 30 ml saline (37 degrees C) ip. QT intervals, right ventricular monophasic action potential duration at 90% of repolarization (RV-MAPD(90)), AF mean cycle length (AFCL(m)), systolic- and diastolic intraarterial blood pressures, intrapericardial-, right atrial- and ventricular pressures, cardiac output and ibutilide concentrations were measured. If AF persisted after the 1st drug infusion, dual site rapid atrial pacing (DRAP) simultaneously from the high right atrium and coronary sinus was performed to terminate AF. If it was ineffective, a 2nd ip. drug infusion in the same fashion as the 1st one, was attempted. There was no significant difference in AF termination [5/9 (56%) in ibutilide treated and 3/10 (30%) in control dogs] between the two groups. DRAP never terminated AF. The AF duration did not differ between the two groups. Compared with control, ibutilide treatment prolonged significantly AFCL(m) (p < 0.001) and non-significantly QT, RV-MAPD(90). No significant difference was found in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and cardiac output between the two groups. The two orders of magnitude greater ibutilide concentration in the pericardial fluid than that in the femoral vein decreased rapidly over time, drug concentration was greatest in the atria, smaller in the ventricular myocardium, with a trend decreasing from the epi- to endocardium.Question: Does intrapericardial ibutilide administration fail to terminate pacing-induced sustained atrial fibrillation in dogs? Student:","output":"Based on the context provided, intrapericardial ibutilide administration does not consistently terminate pacing-induced sustained atrial fibrillation in dogs. The study showed that atrial fibrillation was terminated in 5 out of 9 (56%) ibutilide-treated dogs, and in 3 out of 10 (30%) control dogs. Although there was a higher termination rate in the ibutilide-treated group, the difference was not statistically significant between the two groups. Therefore, it can be concluded that intrapericardial ibutilide administration does not reliably terminate pacing-induced sustained atrial fibrillation in dogs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\".

Article: What is your body language saying to your children? What is their body language telling you? I had the honor of hearing Jan Hargrave speak the other day. She is one of four body language experts in the US. Jan Hargrave says we lie with the right side of our brains, so it is our left hand that gives us away. A person touching his nose, pulling at his ear or rubbing his eye with his left hand might be lying to you. Also, a person who, in any way, crosses any fingers might just be lying. That, she says, is a holdover  from childhood, when we crossed our fingers to signal that we didn't mean what we were saying. When children squint  their eyes, move their body away from you, or can't seem to make good eye contact, you may need to ask for a little more clarification. But just as important, children learn early how to read our body language when they are conversing  with us. Here are some acceptance signals to let them know you are interested when they are talking to you. Lean  towards them. Make good eye contact and smile. Open your arms. Let your hands relax with the palms  showing: an open, upward palm always show acceptance. If your legs are crossed, make sure you are not crossing them away from your child. These are important because they signal to your child that you are focused on them and are accepting and welcoming them into your world. By paying attention, we can open those lines of important communication with our children and we can see the truth more clearly. I think it would be a mistake to use these tools to lie, but we need to be aware of the signals we are giving so we can show people that they really do matter to us. Question: According to Jan Hargrave, we can tell whether a person is lying by   _  . Options: A: observing his/her left hand's movements.

The iconic animal has declined because of habitat loss, poaching and civil unrest in many parts of Africa. Some populations are growing, mainly in southern parts of the continent. Until now, the conservation status of giraffes was considered of \\"least concern\\" by the IUCN. However in their latest global Red List of threatened species, the ungainly animal is now said to be \\"vulnerable\\", meaning that over three generations, the population has declined by more that 30%. According to Dr Julian Fennessy, who co-chairs the IUCN giraffe specialist group, the creatures are undergoing a \\"silent extinction\\". \\"If you go on a safari, giraffes are everywhere,\\" he told BBC News. \\"While there have been great concern about elephants and rhinos, giraffes have gone under the radar but, unfortunately, their numbers have been plummeting, and this is something that we were a little shocked about, that they have declined by so much in so little time.\\" The rapid growth of human populations has seen the expansion of farming and other forms of development that has resulted in the fragmentation of the giraffe's range in many parts of Africa.  But civil unrest in parts of the continent has also taken its toll. \\"In these war torn areas, in northern Kenya, Somalia, and Ethiopia in the border area with South Sudan, essentially the giraffes are war fodder, a large animal, extremely curious that can feed a lot of people,\\" said Dr Fennessy. A study in recent months suggested that the giraffe was actually four different species but for this update of  the Redlist, the IUCN have stuck with the traditional definition of one species with nine subspecies. Of these, five have had falling populations, one has remained stable while three have grown. Different outcomes seem to be highly dependent on location. \\"The species in southern Africa, those numbers are increasing by two to three times over the last three decades,\\" said Dr Fennessy. \\"But when you come up through East Africa, those numbers have plummeted some by up to 95% of the population in the case of the Nubian giraffe, in the last three decades alone.\\" While researchers believe that some local populations may not survive, there is optimism that that the long term future of these tall creatures can be secured. The success in keeping giraffe numbers high in Southern Africa has much to do with the management of game parks for tourists say experts, who believe that the extra attention that the IUCN listing will now attract will benefit the species. \\"South Africa is a good example of how you can manage wildlife, there is a lot of moving of animals between different conservation areas, it is a very different scenario than in most of the rest of Africa.\\" said Chris Ransom from the Zoological Society of London. \\"I think giraffes can survive, with the right conservation efforts, and we can ensure that the animals do live in the wild. There  are a lot of cases of success in conservation. The giraffes could be one.\\" The latest edition of the IUCN Red List now contains over 85,000 species in total with more than 24,000 threatened with extinction. Over 700 newly recognised bird species have been added, with 11% of them on the edge of survival. One bird, the Antioquia wren has been listed as \\"endangered\\" as more than half of its habitat in Colombia could be wiped out by proposed dam. Invasive species on islands are also seen as a threat for many birds including the Pagan reed-warbler and the Laysan honeycreeper. The publication also includes the first assessment of crops including wild oats, barley, mango and other wild relative plants. \\"Many species are slipping away before we can even describe them,\\" says IUCN Director General Inger Andersen. \\"This IUCN Red List update shows that the scale of the global extinction crisis may be even greater than we thought.\\" Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"This article talks about the decreasing number of giraffes in the world.

I really love this hotel! Here's why:  Local- How rare is it to find a local hotel in your area? Okay well in AZ it's somewhat rare and this one is LOCAL and it's fantastic. Usually those two items don't go together.  Design- I love the retro vibe of the design. It's like stepping back in time but in the best way. It makes me want to wear cat-eye glasses and drink vintage cocktails. I love it!   Bath Products- Yes, I know. How tacky am I that I'm even bringing this up but c'mon; we all secretly judge hotels by the quality of what they have in the bathroom. These Icelandic wonder potions smell amazing! AND the soap is a sphere. Holy shit! Nothing gives me more satisfaction than rolling that around in my hands as I wash them (it's the small things in life, really). Honestly, when I stayed here with a friend for my birthday we literally had the same fond memory \\"SOAP BALLS!\\" We recalled, affectionately.   Customer Service- Every employee I've ever talked to is nice and upbeat. I like that, especially being a local that stays here for fun every now and again.   The pool- Is awesome. Both of them (I just remembered there are two; one has a cool fountain and the other I've actually sat by). I love lounging out there and just checking out from life for awhile.

Use a sharp blade to slice off each end at an angle about 1 inch (2.5 cm) up the stem.  It’s important to clip them regularly because microbes will grow at the base and block the flow of water up the stem. If you notice the ends are slimy or dark green after snipping the end, cut it again about 1 inch (2.5 cm) at a time until you see a fresh base. Cut gladiolus will last anywhere from 6 to 12 days depending on the health of the plant when you cut it and how you take care of it. Plant food is made of sugar, an acid, and bleach; the mixture feeds the plants while keeping bacteria or mold from growing. Every time you change the water and snip the ends, stir some plant food into the water. The feed will give the flower more nutrients and keep it healthy for longer.  You can buy cut flower feed at any superstore or grocery store that has a plant nursery. You can also use half a crushed aspirin pill instead of flower feed. Inspect the stalks twice a week and pinch off any wilted or scraggly-looking florets. This will not only improve the look of the flowers but it will allow new, healthier blooms to grow.  Wilted florets will appear shriveled and limp or show signs of discoloration (like darkening or browning). Remove each flower as it begins to wilt—don't wait until the seed head begins to form. Take care to remove not just the shriveled petals but also the swollen bit at the base of the dead flower (where it connects onto the main flower stem). This is the bit that forms the seed.

Context: I have 2 friends from college who completely did a 180 after they got married. We were party animals in college. Every day revolved around alcohol on some form or fashion. It literally was like the movie Animal House Now these 2 friends (let's call them Bill and Ted) were a little dorky compared to the rest of the other guys. We all played sports in high school and college and they were more like bookworms. Borderline alcoholics but bookworms. They were really awkward around girls but funny as hell around guys. Long story short. Both of them got involved into serious relationships after college and ended up marrying these girls. One girl was this born again Christian who vowed to cleanse Bill from his evil ways. Bill was so far removed from his friends (the wolfpack!) that he didn't even invite us to his wedding. It's been maybe 14-15 yrs now and I have no clue what he's doing. I think one of my friends did attend the wedding but it was only because they desperately needed a groomsmen. Ted married this girl who seemed cool at first but after marriage, he stopped coming to any and all get togethers. He always had an excuse. He ended up moving a few hrs away and eventually just stopped responding to us. He did show up to a mutual friend's wedding maybe 3 yrs ago. He has a baby now but he's alot different than how he used to be. Other than Bill and Ted, all my other friends got married and have pretty normal marriages.

Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe. Orchid tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swanö. The album was named Morningrise, and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66 minutes, it features Opeth's longest song, the twenty-minute \\"Black Rose Immortal\\". Opeth toured the UK in support of Morningrise, followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.In 1997, after the tour, Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons. Former Eternal members, drummer Martín López (formerly of Amon Amarth) and bassist Martín Méndez, responded to an ad at a music shop placed by Åkerfeldt. López and Méndez were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job.

The answer to this question is:","output":"Terrence Begley was born in either 1843 or 1844 in Ireland. Despite his early life being shrouded in mystery, Begley's legacy can be traced back to his service in the United States Army. Emigrating from his homeland, Begley would later become a national hero in the United States during the American Civil War. Begley enlisted in the Union Army in 1864, at a time when the nation was deeply entrenched in the brutal conflict between the Union and the Confederate States. He proudly served as a sergeant in Company D of the 7th New York Heavy Artillery – a regiment known for its distinguished service during the war. Terrence Begley's most notable military accomplishment took place during the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House in Virginia. It was a critical series of engagements between Union and Confederate forces from May 8 to May 21, 1864. The battle was a gruesome, protracted struggle that featured some of the most intense hand-to-hand combat of the entire war. Begley distinguished himself in the assault on the Confederate line and demonstrated immense courage and leadership amid the chaos. For his exceptional acts of valor under fire, Terrence Begley was awarded the Medal of Honor – the highest and most prestigious military decoration awarded to U.S. service members. The Medal of Honor is bestowed upon individuals who have exhibited extraordinary courage, dedication, and self-sacrifice in the face of great personal danger. Begley's recognition in the annals of American military history showcased his bravery and commitment to his adopted country. Tragically, Terrence Begley's life was cut short on August 25, 1864, in Virginia, a few months after the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House. The exact circumstances of his death remain uncertain, and his final resting place is unknown. Nevertheless, his bravery and sacrifice will be remembered for generations to come. In conclusion, Terrence Begley was a gallant Irish-born soldier who fought for his adopted land – the United States of America – during the American Civil War. Despite his relatively short period of service, he left an indelible mark on history with his actions during the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, which earned him the prestigious Medal of Honor. Although his life ended tragically in Virginia in 1864, Begley's sacrifice and dedication to the cause of the United States will stand as a testament to the bravery and resilience of all those who fight for the principles of freedom and justice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You might notice some blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet bowl. This is the most common symptom of an internal hemorrhoid.","output":"The most logical next event would be to seek medical attention for the proper diagnosis and management of internal hemorrhoids. 1. Schedule an appointment with your physician or a specialist: The first step to take after recognizing potential signs of internal hemorrhoids is to schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or a gastroenterologist. Make sure to inform them of any recent bleeding or other concerning symptoms. 2. Prepare for the consultation: Before the appointment, make a list of any symptoms you've been experiencing, even if they seem unrelated. Also, note any lifestyle factors, medical conditions, and medications that you're currently taking. These details will help guide the conversation and allow your healthcare provider to identify potential risk factors and make an accurate diagnosis. 3. Consultation and discussion of symptoms: During the appointment, your physician will ask you about your symptoms, medical history, and any potential risk factors. Be honest and detailed in your responses to ensure a thorough understanding of your condition. 4. Physical examination: Your physician will likely perform a physical examination to assess the area for any external hemorrhoids, fissures, or other abnormalities. 5. Diagnostic tests: If your physician suspects internal hemorrhoids, they may recommend additional diagnostic tests. This may include:    a) Digital Rectal Examination (DRE): A physician inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum to feel for any abnormal growths or masses.        b) Anoscopy: A small, tube-shaped instrument called an anoscope is inserted into the rectum to visualize internal hemorrhoids and other issues within the lower rectum.        c) Sigmoidoscopy: A flexible, lighted tube called a sigmoidoscope is inserted into the rectum to examine the sigmoid colon and rectum for the presence of hemorrhoids or other abnormalities.        d) Colonoscopy: If there's a concern that the bleeding could be from a source other than hemorrhoids, a colonoscopy may be recommended. This procedure uses a flexible, lighted tube with a camera to examine the entire colon and rectum. 6. Diagnosis and treatment plan: Based on the findings from your consultation, physical examination, and diagnostic tests, your physician will determine if you have internal hemorrhoids and discuss the appropriate treatment options. Treatment may include:    a) Over-the-counter medications: Pain relievers, creams, ointments, and suppositories can help alleviate the pain, discomfort, and itching associated with hemorrhoids.        b) Lifestyle changes: Improving your diet, staying well-hydrated, exercising regularly, and avoiding strain during bowel movements can help prevent and manage hemorrhoid symptoms.        c) Medical procedures: In more severe cases, your physician may recommend minimally invasive procedures such as rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, or infrared coagulation to treat your internal hemorrhoids.        d) Surgery: If your hemorrhoids are large or do not respond well to conservative treatments, your physician may recommend surgical procedures, such as hemorrhoidectomy or stapled hemorrhoidopexy. By following these steps and working closely with your healthcare provider, you can achieve an accurate diagnosis and develop an effective treatment plan to manage internal hemorrhoids. Remember that early intervention and active participation in your care are crucial for a successful outcome."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Why doesn't my iPhone charge when plugged into anything but the included USB Wall Adapter? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Select from the following. [i] no; [ii] yes;","output":"To determine whether these two questions are inquiring about the same information, let's analyze each question separately and then compare them. Question 1: Why will my iPhone not charge when it's plugged into a charger? This question could be referring to multiple issues related to an iPhone not being able to charge when connected to a charger. The potential issues include a faulty cable, damaged charging port, incompatible charger, software issues, or other related issues. Question 2: Why doesn't my iPhone charge when plugged into anything but the included USB Wall Adapter? This question is more specific about the iPhone only charging when connected to the included USB Wall Adapter. This implies that the iPhone is able to charge, but not when plugged into other charging sources or devices. Now, let's compare them: Both questions center around the issue of an iPhone not charging, but they have different focus points. The first question is seeking reasons for any potential charging problem, while the second question only specifies a specific charging scenario. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, the answer is [i] no; these two questions are not inquiring about the same information, as they have different focuses within the broader context of iPhone charging issues."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],D={key:0},z={key:1};function E(i,e,h,m,o,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),n(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),n("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
