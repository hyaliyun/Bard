Q: In October 2014, the trial of six senior staff and journalists at The Sun newspaper began. All six were charged with conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office. They included The Sun's head of news Chris Pharo, who faced six charges, while ex-managing editor Graham Dudman and ex-Sun deputy news editor Ben O'Driscoll were accused of four charges each. Thames Valley district reporter Jamie Pyatt and picture editor John Edwards were charged with three counts each, while ex-reporter John Troup was accused of two counts. The trial related to illegal payments allegedly made to public officials, with prosecutors saying the men conspired to pay officials from 2002–11, including police, prison officers and soldiers. They were accused of buying confidential information about the Royal Family, public figures and prison inmates. They all denied the charges. On 16 January 2015, Troup and Edwards were cleared by the jury of all charges against them. The jury also partially cleared O'Driscoll and Dudman but continued deliberating over other counts faced by them, as well as the charges against Pharo and Pyatt. On 21 January 2015, the jury told the court that it was unable to reach unanimous verdicts on any of the outstanding charges and was told by the judge, Richard Marks, that he would accept majority verdicts. Shortly afterwards, one of the jurors sent a note to the judge and was discharged. The judge told the remaining 11 jurors that their colleague had been \\"feeling unwell and feeling under a great deal of pressure and stress from the situation you are in\\", and that under the circumstances he was prepared to accept majority verdicts of \\"11 to zero or 10 to 1\\". On 22 January 2015, the jury was discharged after failing to reach verdicts on the outstanding charges. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced that it would seek a retrial.

Question: Different wavelength electromagnetic radiations have different uses. John is a physicist. He needed to find appropriate wavelength electromagnetic radiations for his experiments. To that end, he selected three electromagnetic radiations, microwaves, infrared light, and visible light. He noted microwaves as case A, infrared as case B, and visible light as case C.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which wavelengths would be longer, case B or case C?  Hint: Infrared (IR) light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 0.7 and 300 micrometers, which corresponds to a frequency range between 430 and 1 THz respectively. IR wavelengths are longer than that of visible light, but shorter than that of microwaves. Infrared may be detected at a distance from the radiating objects by \\"feel.\\" Infrared sensing snakes can detect and focus infrared by use of a pinhole lens in their heads, called \\"pits\\". Bright sunlight provides an irradiance of just over 1 kilowatt per square meter at sea level. Of this energy, 53% is infrared radiation, 44% is visible light, and 3% is ultraviolet radiation. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, case B represents infrared light, and case C represents visible light. Infrared light has wavelengths ranging from 0.7 to 300 micrometers, while visible light has wavelengths ranging from approximately 400 to 700 nanometers (0.4 to 0.7 micrometers). Given that the wavelength range of infrared light (case B) is longer than that of visible light (case C), it can be concluded that the wavelengths in case B would be longer than those in case C."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I work know security and one night at around 2am I walked in the bathroom because a customer complained about a man yelling in the bathroom. I told my partner I would go check it out by myself so he could stay and keep quality control of who comes in the venue. I walk in and in the first cubicle I could see lots and lots of blood on the floor and a pair of feet placed as if he was sitting down. I quickly go to the next cubicle asking at the same time if the person was OK obviously with no response. I look over and it was a horrible bloody mess. I quickly get on the radio and tell my partner to call police and ambulance and to put the place on lock down. I walk around to the from of the cubicle and kick open the door. The man had grabbed a straight razor and cut his arms extremely deep from the wrist downwards all the way to his elbow palms up. On both arms mind you. A good example of what it would look like would be the scene from the terminator 2 where Arnold cuts the skin off from his arm. The ambulance came and had to call another team to collect the body. The building was closed for around a day and a half they had to repaint and do all sorts of things because of so much blood. Ill say they do not train you for seeing such horrible things or even mention that it can happen I'm lucky enough to have a strong head and can handle seeing such horror.

Still, it rains and the air is cool. All he has to shelter him is a think nylon jacket. The jacket is soaked. It feels both chilly and coarse against his skin. His hair hangs in flat and sodden wings, falling into his eyes. It's long in the back, almost to his shoulders, and he thinks that the cars that pass him on the street, the occupants of those cars, might look at him and see only that he is wet and not that he is dirty as well. Can they tell that his hair has been unwashed for days? That his clothes are the same ones he's worn for more than a week? It doesn't matter. He's invisible to them as soon as they pass, taking any assumptions they might make with them.

News article: Measure of Global Slavery Up Almost 30% Since 2014 Australian human rights group Walk Free Foundation measured the prevalence of slavery in the 167 most populous countries for its 2016 Global Slavery Index. The index found instances of slavery in every one of the countries looked at, with 45.8 million people enslaved overall—that’s up from 35.8 million in 2014. The forms of slavery included were sex trafficking, debt bondage, and forced labor. This estimate is more than double that of the United Nation’s International Labor Organization, though the U.N. doesn’t consider all forms of slavery. The index looked at the prevalence of slavery, people’s vulnerability to it, and government efforts to fight against it. India and North Korea were deemed the worst offenders. India has the highest number of slaves overall, with 18.4 million, while North Korea had the highest concentration, with about 4.4% of its population enslaved. The five places in which government takes the least action are North Korea, Iran, Eritrea, Equatorial Guinea, and Hong Kong. Walk Free founder Andrew Forrest told Reuters the large increase can be explained by better data collection, but he also worries that global displacement and migration make people more vulnerable to slavery. The methodology included interviews with 42,000 people in 53 languages and 25 countries. While the index has been criticized by some, Forrest has challenged critics to find an alternative method. “Without measurement you don’t have effective management and there’s no way to lead the world away from slavery,” Forrest told Reuters. Efforts to combat slavery have been held back in the past because we don’t have hard data. He said he wants this index to be a “call to action.” “This is not AIDS or malaria,” he told the news outlet. “We have caused slavery and because it’s a human condition we can fix it.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"1.

Mary's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of Byzantium. Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the \\"purification\\" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of \\"purification\\" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism). St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as \\"prokathartheisa (prepurified).\\" Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory. Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas. Nazianzen's title of Mary at the Annunciation as \\"prepurified\\" was subsequently adopted by all theologians interested in his Mariology to justify the Byzantine equivalent of the Immaculate Conception.

One day, Sean meets \\"Duke\\" Wayne (George Wendt), who introduces Sean to his boss, a shady developer named Ray Matthews (Daniel Baldwin). Ray hires Sean as a spy, and orders him to follow Eric Gatley (Ron Livingston), an accountant who has been investigating Ray's company. Problems start when Ray, while drunk, offers Sean 13,000 to kill Eric. Sean accepts his offer and, although ambivalent, ends up killing Gatley by breaking into his house and beating him to death. When Sean goes to collect his pay, however, he is double-crossed and when he insists that they pay him, he is kidnapped and taken to Ray's secluded farm. It emerges that Matthews never had any intention of paying Sean for the killing, for he only wanted to use and eliminate him. But Sean survives from having a bullet put in his head then reveals that he had taken Gatley's work file of evidence and hidden it along with his documentation of events leading to the murder. When torture fails to make him disclose the whereabouts of the file, Sean is then brutally beaten about the head with golf clubs many times by Ray and his henchmen daily for weeks, in an effort to destroy his memory. After suffering a heavy amount of trauma, Sean escapes, killing Duke, and finds his way to a downtown homeless shelter where Gatley's widow, Susan (Kari Wuhrer), takes him under her wing, oblivious to his role in her personal tragedy. After she nurses him back to normal, he feels he has been reborn and they become lovers and he moves into her house. But after a few weeks, Susan finds his file describing the murder and, enraged, physically attacks him. Defending himself, Sean accidentally kills her. Having lost what he saw as his redemption and rebirth, more angry and cynical than ever, Sean returns to Ray's farm and methodically and ruthlessly exacts revenge on his captors; having arrived before Ray, he finds Duke's body...

If you beat a dog in Schuylkill County, you'll probably get a 100 fine. If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine. In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\\" West said. \\"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred.  After reading the above, is \\"Depends, within the county in 2001, only 98 cases on the matter were heard by a judge and only 48 percent of those were found guilty\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Will everyone have to pay a fine for beating a woman or a dog in Schuylkill County?\\"?","output":"Yes, \\"Depends, within the county in 2001, only 98 cases on the matter were heard by a judge and only 48 percent of those were found guilty\\" is a correct answer to the question \\"Will everyone have to pay a fine for beating a woman or a dog in Schuylkill County?\\" because it highlights that not all cases result in being found guilty, and thus not everyone who is accused of these actions will necessarily be fined.

Impressed by Woody, and disgusted by how she was treated by her lover/boss Krokov when she returns to Moscow, Natalia decides to defect and asks the CIA to have \\"Condorman\\" be the agent that helps her.Back in Paris, Woody's encounter with Natalia inspires him to create a super heroine patterned after her named \\"Laser Lady\\".

Sentence from a movie review: up as the worst kind of hubristic folly  Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","output":"Based on the given sentence fragment from the movie review - \\"up as the worst kind of hubristic folly\\" - it appears that the movie was viewed negatively. The term \\"hubristic folly\\" itself carries a negative connotation, and when combined with \\"the worst kind,\\" the sentiment clearly depicts a disapproval of the movie. The word \\"hubristic\\" refers to excessive pride or self-confidence, often resulting in overconfidence that leads to misfortune or failure. The term \\"folly\\" is synonymous with foolishness or a lack of good judgment. When a movie is being described as a \\"hubristic folly,\\" it implies that the creators of the movie were overly confident in their talent or ideas, ultimately resulting in a poorly executed or misguided end product. The phrase \\"the worst kind of\\" further emphasizes the level of disapproval by suggesting that not only was the movie a failure, it was an egregious one. This negative assessment could be due to various factors, such as poor direction, subpar acting performances, a weak script, or an overabundance of special effects that overshadowed the core story, among others. It is important to note, however, that this sentence fragment does not provide enough information to understand the specific reasons for the negative review.

He appreciated the advantages of democracy: \\"It is an invaluable gift, if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords.\\" Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God. To further protect the rights of ordinary people, Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Thus he and his followers resisted political absolutism and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy. Besides England, the Netherlands were, under Calvinist leadership, the freest country in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It granted asylum to philosophers like Baruch Spinoza and Pierre Bayle. Hugo Grotius was able to teach his natural-law theory and a relatively liberal interpretation of the Bible. Question: What political mixture did Calvin prefer?","output":"Calvin preferred a political mixture of aristocracy and democracy. He recognized the value of democracy, acknowledging that it was an invaluable gift from God when a people were allowed to freely elect their own authorities and rulers. However, he also incorporated elements of aristocracy to ensure a balance of power and to prevent any one group from dominating the political landscape. This mindset led Calvin to advocate for the separation of political powers, establishing a system of checks and balances, which inherently protects the rights of ordinary citizens. This approach to governance enabled Calvin and his followers to resist political absolutism, ultimately contributing to the development of modern democracy. Notably, countries influenced by Calvinist leadership, such as England and the Netherlands, became freer societies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In fact, the Netherlands was known to grant asylum to philosophers like Baruch Spinoza and Pierre Bayle, and it was a place where Hugo Grotius could teach his natural-law theory and promote a relatively liberal interpretation of the Bible. Overall, Calvin's preference for a mixture of aristocracy and democracy laid the groundwork for greater political freedom and the evolution of democratic principles in subsequent centuries."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

U.S. businesses have long bristled at Beijing's requirement that they transfer technology to Chinese companies as a condition of entering the Chinese market.

Oscar Leonard Carl Pistorius was born to Henke and Sheila Pistorius on 22 November 1986 in Sandton, Johannesburg, in what was then Transvaal Province (now Gauteng Province) of South Africa. He grew up in a Christian home and has an elder brother, Carl, and a younger sister, Aimee. Pistorius credits his mother, who died at the age of 43 when Pistorius was 15 years old, as a major influence in his life. Pistorius is a white South African with Italian ancestry from his maternal great-grandfather, who was an Italian emigrant to Kenya. Pistorius also carried the flag at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Paralympics on 29 August. He entered the T44 classification men's 100 metres, 200 metres and 400 metres races, and the T42-T46 4 x 100 metres relay.  In the 200-metre competition, Pistorius established a new T43 world record of 21.30 seconds in his heat on 1 September, but he was defeated in the final the next day by Alan Oliveira of Brazil. Pistorius took silver, and then created a controversy by complaining about the length of Oliveira's blades. He later apologised for the timing of his remarks, but not the content of his complaint. The IPC confirmed the length of Oliveira's blades were proportional to his body, with all the finalists measured before the race. The IPC also confirmed that Pistorius had raised the issue of blade length with it six weeks prior to the race. SASCOC issued a statement welcoming Pistorius's apology for his outburst and declared their full support for him and promised to assist him in discussions with the IPC about the issue of lengthened prosthetics after the conclusion of the Games. The IPC expressed willingness to engage with Pistorius about the issue. Australian runner Jack Swift, USA runner Jerome Singleton, and other athletes also expressed support for Pistorius's position.  Pistorius won a gold medal on 5 September running the anchor leg as part of the South African 4 x 100 metres relay team. The team set a world record time of 41.78 seconds. He was unsuccessful in defending his Beijing Olympics 100-metre title when he came fourth with a season's best time of 11.17 seconds, and the race was won by Great Britain's Jonnie Peacock. On 8 September, the last full day of competition, Pistorius won gold in the T44 400 metres with a time of 46.68 seconds, breaking the Paralympic record. what is the most important fact mentioned in this article?","output":"The most important fact mentioned in this article is that Oscar Pistorius is a Paralympic athlete who has set world records and won multiple gold medals, including those at the 2012 Summer Paralympics.

Fact 2: Spring, summer, autumn, and winter are the seasons of the year.  Given the two facts above, what being tilted on its rotating axis causes spring, summer, autumn, and winter.? A:","output":"The Earth's tilt on its rotating axis is the primary cause of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of approximately 23.5 degrees relative to its orbit around the Sun. This axial tilt, also known as obliquity, is responsible for the varying intensity of sunlight and the changing duration of daylight hours throughout the year, which in turn create the distinct seasons we experience. As the Earth orbits the Sun, the tilted axis always points towards the same spot in space, namely the North Star (Polaris). This means that at different points during the year, each hemisphere of the Earth will receive differing amounts of sunlight due to their position relative to the Sun. Spring: Spring, or vernal equinox, occurs when the Earth is positioned such that its equator aligns with the plane of its orbit around the Sun. At this point, both hemispheres receive equal amounts of sunlight, and the daylight hours are approximately equal to the nighttime hours. As the Earth continues to revolve around the Sun and its axis tilt, the hemisphere that is tilting towards the Sun starts to experience more intense sunlight, leading to longer daylight hours and warmer temperatures. Summer: As Earth's orbit progresses, the hemisphere tilted towards the Sun reaches its maximum inclination, resulting in the summer solstice. In this season, the sun's rays are most directly hitting the Earth, leading to longer daylight hours, increased intensity of sunlight, and consequently warmer temperatures. This is the time when that hemisphere experiences its warmest weather, while the opposite hemisphere experiences its coldest. Autumn: As the Earth continues its orbit around the Sun, it reaches a point where its equator aligns with the plane of its orbit once again. This marks the autumnal equinox, during which both hemispheres of the Earth receive equal amounts of sunlight, and the daylight hours are approximately the same as nighttime hours. The hemisphere that was tilted towards the Sun during summer starts to lean away, causing diminished sunlight intensity, shorter daylight hours, and cooler temperatures. Winter: As the Earth reaches the opposite point in its orbit from the summer solstice, the inclined hemisphere experiences the least direct sunlight of the year, leading to the winter solstice. During this season, the daylight hours are at their shortest, and the sunlight's intensity is at its weakest, resulting in colder temperatures. The opposite hemisphere, now tilted towards the Sun, experiences its warmest weather during this time. In summary, the tilting of the Earth on its rotating axis causes the varying intensity of sunlight and the changing duration of daylight hours throughout different points of the year, leading to the four distinct seasons: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. This tilt, combined with Earth's orbit around the Sun, accounts for the differences in temperature, daylight, and weather patterns experienced globally."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The speaker is unsure of whether the act would have indeed been funny and even acknowledges that they \\"don't know.\\" On the other hand, the second sentence asserts a clear and unequivocal opinion on the matter: \\"It sounds really unfunny.\\" This statement contradicts the uncertainty that the first sentence exhibits. Instead of expressing doubt, the second sentence firmly states that the act mentioned in the first sentence is not funny at all.

First, let's examine the premise more closely. According to the statement, the Dorian invaders originated from the Balkans and initiated their invasion around 1200 BC. Their route of invasion is specifically mentioned as southward through the Greek mainland, the Aegean islands, and finally across to Crete. This clearly implies that the Dorians were successful in traversing these geographic regions and were not confined to the Balkan territories. Now, let's consider the hypothesis. \\"The Dorian invaders were stopped in the Balkans and proceeded no farther.\\" This statement suggests that the Dorians did not successfully invade regions beyond the Balkans. However, as per the information provided in the premise, this is not the case. The Dorians' southward route through various geographic locations shows that they were not confined to the boundaries of the Balkans and had indeed proceeded further. Furthermore, the mention of specific locations in the premise, such as the Greek mainland, the Aegean islands, and Crete, gives us an insight into the possible extent of the Dorian invasion. The fact that the invaders managed to cross the Aegean Sea and reach Crete, one of the southernmost points within the geographic areas mentioned, reinforces the idea that the Dorians were successful in expanding their territorial conquest much farther than the Balkans. In conclusion, if the premise is true, it negates the hypothesis that \\"The Dorian invaders were stopped in the Balkans and proceeded no farther.\\" The premise highlights their southward expansion, successfully invading the Greek mainland, the Aegean islands, and finally arriving in Crete. Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be supported by the given premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who portrayed the leading men of his day? , can you please find it?   James Barton Longacre (August 11, 1794 – January 1, 1869) was an American portraitist and engraver, and the fourth Chief Engraver of the United States Mint from 1844 until his death. Longacre is best known for designing the Indian Head cent, which entered commerce in 1859, and for the designs of the Shield nickel, Flying Eagle cent and other coins of the mid-19th century. Longacre was born in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, in 1794. He ran away to Philadelphia at age 12, where he became an apprentice in a bookstore. His artistic talent developed and he was released to apprentice in an engraving firm.  He struck out on his own in 1819, making a name providing illustrations for popular biographical books. He portrayed the leading men of his day; support from some of them, such as South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun, led to his appointment as chief engraver after the death of Christian Gobrecht in 1844. In Longacre's first years as a chief engraver, the Philadelphia Mint was dominated by Mint Director Robert M. Patterson and Chief Coiner Franklin Peale. Conflict between Longacre and the two men developed after Congress ordered a new gold dollar and double eagle, with both to be designed by Longacre.  Peale and Patterson nearly had Longacre fired, but the chief engraver was able to convince Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith that he should be retained.  Both Patterson and Peale left the Mint in the early 1850s, ending the conflict. In 1856, Longacre designed the Flying Eagle cent. When that design proved difficult to strike, Longacre was responsible for the replacement, the Indian Head cent, issued beginning in 1859. Other coins designed by Longacre include the silver and nickel three-cent pieces, the Shield nickel, the pattern Washington nickel, and the two-cent piece.  In 1866–1867, he redesigned the coins of Chile. Longacre died suddenly on New Year's Day 1869; he was succeeded by William Barber.

James Barton Longacre was an accomplished American portraitist and engraver who designed various coins during his tenure as the fourth Chief Engraver of the United States Mint. His work was well-regarded, and he was known for portraying prominent figures of his time. Some of these notable individuals, such as South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun, contributed to Longacre's appointment as chief engraver, succeeding Christian Gobrecht in 1844. During his time at the Philadelphia Mint, Longacre faced conflicts with Mint Director Robert M. Patterson and Chief Coiner Franklin Peale. The disputes arose after Congress ordered new gold dollar and double eagle coins, which Longacre was tasked with designing. Despite the challenges he faced, Longacre managed to retain his position by convincing Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith of his capabilities and valuable contributions. Eventually, both Patterson and Peale left the Mint in the early 1850s, resolving the conflicts. Longacre's incredible designing talent led to the creation of iconic coins such as the Flying Eagle cent, Indian Head cent, silver and nickel three-cent pieces, Shield nickel, pattern Washington nickel, and the two-cent piece. He even redesigned the coins of Chile during 1866-1867. After his sudden death on New Year's Day in 1869, he was succeeded by fellow engraver William Barber. Today, Longacre's coins are held in high esteem for their historical significance and distinctive designs. Though they have faced some criticism for their artistic aspects, his contributions to numismatics and the impact of his work on the coins of the United States and beyond cannot be denied. As a result, James Barton Longacre's legacy continues to be celebrated and admired by collectors and enthusiasts alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is important because she must ensure that she has no prior commitments or appointments that conflict with the proposed lunch meeting. Additionally, verifying her schedule will help her determine the optimal time to meet Alex. First, Sasha should open her calendar or planner, whether it's a physical copy or a digital one on her computer or smartphone. She should examine her appointments, meetings, or events scheduled on the specific day she plans to have lunch with Alex. It's crucial for her to consider a buffer time that she needs for traveling between her appointment location and the lunch venue. Sasha should also consider the time required for other essential tasks she may have on that day, such as picking up groceries, doing laundry, or any work-related activities.

This has led to the person's vegetative state for an entire year, during which the hospital suggested installing a pacemaker.  On the other hand, Sentence 2 states that the individual has Alzheimer's and has not been functional for a year. While it is clear that both sentences discuss the same person with Alzheimer's, it is crucial to note that Sentence 1 refers to the individual as being in a vegetative state, whereas Sentence 2 merely mentions their lack of functionality.  Although the latter could be inferred from the former, as a vegetative state implies a lack of functionality, it is not explicated in Sentence 1. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively ascertain whether Sentence 2 is entailed by Sentence 1. The information in Sentence 2 could potentially be inferred from Sentence 1, but it is not directly stated, thus making it impossible to confirm with certainty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Q: As academic work is becoming arguably more precarious and competitive, shorter contracts are becoming the norm, and the number of people completing PhDs in the UK is increasing, the risks associated with researching academia are high. This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants. Reflection is and was an important element in the research process for me, as it allowed me to reflect on the effects of the self on the research process and, ultimately, also on the data, as well as the various power dynamics discernible during interviews for my study. I was continually taken aback by participants’... Question: Why was the author aware of their positionality? === The answer to the above question is The answer is:","output":"The author was aware of their positionality because they knew that their own experiences, background, and status as a junior researcher could influence the research process, interactions with participants, and interpretation of data. Being conscious of their positionality allowed the author to reflect on potential biases and power dynamics within the research, and helped ensure a more transparent and valid analysis of the findings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What does the term \\"mens rea\\" mean I found the following answer on Google: The exception is strict liability crimes. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no.","output":"No, the answer you found on Google is not a correct definition of \\"mens rea.\\" The term \\"mens rea\\" is a Latin phrase that means \\"guilty mind\\" in English. In criminal law, mens rea refers to the mental state or intent required to establish that a person knowingly or purposefully committed a criminal act. For a crime to occur, there must typically be both an actus reus (\\"guilty act\\") and a mens rea (\\"guilty mind\\"). The mens rea element is important because it is used to distinguish between intentional crimes and accidents. Some crimes require specific intent (e.g., murder, theft), while others require general intent (e.g., assault and battery). The exception you found on Google, \\"strict liability crimes,\\" refers to a separate concept. Strict liability crimes are offenses where the defendant can be held guilty without the need to prove a guilty mind or intention. In other words, the mere act or consequence itself is sufficient to establish criminal liability, regardless of whether the person intended to commit the crime. Examples of strict liability crimes include certain traffic offenses, selling alcohol to minors, and statutory rape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: In what year did market-based economic reforms take place in the country that expanded its economy in the 17th century under the Mughal Empire? is inside the article: India (ISO: Bhārat), also known as the Republic of India (ISO: Bhārat Gaṇarājya), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh largest country by area and with more than 1.3 billion people, it is the second most populous country as well as the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, while its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. The Indian subcontinent was home to the urban Indus Valley Civilisation of the 3rd millennium BCE. In the following millennium, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism began to be composed. Social stratification, based on caste, emerged in the first millennium BCE, and Buddhism and Jainism arose. Early political consolidations took place under the Maurya and Gupta empires; later peninsular Middle Kingdoms influenced cultures as far as Southeast Asia. In the medieval era, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived, and Sikhism emerged, all adding to the region's diverse culture. Much of the north fell to the Delhi Sultanate; the south was united under the Vijayanagara Empire. The economy expanded in the 17th century in the Mughal Empire. In the mid-18th century, the subcontinent came under British East India Company rule, and in the mid-19th under British Crown rule. A nationalist movement emerged in the late 19th century, which later, under Mahatma Gandhi, was noted for nonviolent resistance and led to India's independence in 1947. In 2017, the Indian economy was the world's sixth largest by nominal GDP and third largest by purchasing power parity.

C++ (programming language): When I typed the following code the output screen flashed and disappeared. What should I do? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Available options: +no +yes","output":"No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. They are two distinct questions focusing on different topics. The first question pertains to the disappearance of the language activity chart from a HackerEarth profile. HackerEarth is a competitive programming and technical assessment platform where developers can solve coding challenges and showcase their skills to potential employers. If a language activity chart is missing or disappears from a user's profile, it could be due to several factors, including: 1. Your recent activity may not have registered yet in their system. Sometimes, the platform might take some time to refresh and display your recent activities. 2. Technical Issues: There could be a temporary technical issue on the HackerEarth platform that is causing the language activity chart to disappear. In such cases, it is usually resolved by the platform's technical team in due course. 3. Changes made by the platform: Sometimes, the platform may decide to update its features or interface to improve user experience. If the language activity chart has been removed, it might be due to changes in the platform's UI/UX or as part of an update. You can check their updates, announcements, or contact their support team for further information. Now, let's address the second question. It is related to a specific programming language, C++, and an issue regarding an output screen flashing and disappearing. It appears that the issue might be related to the code written by the user. The output screen generally flashes and disappears when a C++ program runs in a console window, completes its execution, and immediately exits without waiting for user input. If you want to prevent the output screen from disappearing after the program executes, you can include a statement to pause the program execution before it terminates. You can achieve this by using the \\"cin.get()\\" function that waits for user input, letting you view the output of your program before closing the window. Here's an example of how to use \\"cin.get()\\": \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> using namespace std; int main() {     // Your code here     cout << \\"Press Enter to continue...\\";     cin.ignore();     cin.get();     return 0; } \`\`\` By adding this code at the end of your main function, the program will pause, display the \\"Press Enter to continue...\\" message, and wait for you to press Enter before terminating and closing the console window. This way, you will be able to see the output screen without it flashing and disappearing immediately. In summary, the two questions are not paraphrases of each other, as they address different topics: one is related to HackerEarth profile language activity chart disappearance, and the other is about a C++ programming issue causing an output screen to flash and disappear."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are more cans transported happens, how will it affect there are less cans to be heated up.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you've presented proposes that if there are more aluminum cans transported to the recycling facility, there would be fewer cans to heat up. To assess whether this hypothesis has a direct or indirect effect on the recycling process, I will break down the steps in the process and analyze the potential consequences of the change in the volume of cans transported. 1. Put the aluminum can into a recycle bin: This step would remain the same, regardless of the number of cans being transported to the facility. Collection and sorting from public and private recycling bins occur independently of the amount of cans transported. 2. The cans are transported to a facility: According to the hypothesis, more cans are being transported to recycling facilities. This might result from more people recycling aluminum cans or increased efficiency in collecting cans. Either way, the transportation aspect should be scalable, meaning that more cans could be transported with relatively minimal adjustments (e.g., additional trucks or trips). 3. The cans are shredded by a machine: With more cans being transported to the facility, there would be a larger throughput requirement for the shredding machines. This could imply a need for additional machines, increased working hours, or more efficient shredding mechanisms to manage the increased volume of cans. 4. The cans are heated to 1400 degrees to melt them: In contrast to the hypothesis, the presence of more cans in the facility does not lead to fewer cans to be heated. Instead, more cans would need to be heated to handle the increased volume of materials. The facility might need to increase furnace capacity or operating hours to accommodate the extra cans. 5. The molten metal is poured into molds: As a result of more molten metal being generated from increased cans, more molds would be required to make use of the recycled material. This aspect should be easily scalable, with additional molds and equipment to manage the higher volume of molten metal. 6. The molds are flattened and rolled into sheets to reuse: Finally, the process of flattening and rolling the molds into sheets would also have to be adjusted to account for the increased volume of aluminum. This could involve investments in additional machinery or labor, or making modifications to increase productivity. The supposed perturbation in the volume of cans transported would have both direct and indirect effects on the recycling process. Directly, more cans transported would result in larger quantities of aluminum material available for recycling, contradicting the hypothesis that fewer cans would be heated. Indirect effects would manifest through the scaling-up of the recycling process, with adjustments made in shredding, heating, molding, and rolling. These adjustments might introduce additional requirements for machinery, labor, and resources, potentially affecting the environmental impact, processing costs, and efficiency of the recycling process. Overall, the perturbation hypothesis, if it were to occur, would not result in fewer cans being heated but would certainly have significant direct and indirect effects on the recycling process as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Expand this summary.","output":"Wall Street experienced a mixed day on Thursday, with an extreme drop in the value of Facebook shares having a significant impact on the technology stock market. Meanwhile, other sectors saw boosts due to increasing optimism over trade tension ease between the US and Europe, promising earnings reports, and upward movement in a variety of stocks. Facebook shares plummeted by an astounding 19% on Thursday as the social media giant issued warnings of slower growth ahead. This severe tumble erased about 119 billion in market value, marking the worst single-day loss for any public company in stock market history according to sources from CNN. Facebook's decline also had substantial personal implications for founder Mark Zuckerberg, who lost close to 16 billion. This drop resulted in a significant reshuffling of Forbes' list of the richest people in the world, with Zuckerberg slipping from fourth to sixth place. Despite this tumultuous downturn in the technology sector, other areas of the market managed to climb. A renewed sense of optimism permeated Wall Street as traders braced for possible advancements in easing the current trade tensions between the US and Europe. This positivity was reflected in the rising value of various company shares. Notably, Caterpillar Inc., the esteemed machinery and engines manufacturer, saw its stock rise by 1.5%. Further bolstering the market, strong earnings reports from several companies sent stock values higher. Within these, airlines, energy companies, and consumer goods stocks were the sectors experiencing the most noteworthy increases. This upsurge shows that despite the downturn facing some companies like Facebook, others are exceeding expectations and demonstrating strong financial performance. In another encouraging sign for the market, small-company stocks performed better than the rest of the market. This suggests a healthy appetite for risk among investors, which is generally regarded as a positive sign for the overall economy. Despite these gains, overall the S&P 500 index saw a minor slip of 8 points, or 0.3%, ending at 2,837. Similarly, the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite also slid 80 points, or 1%, finishing the day at 7,852. On the other hand, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 112 points, or 0.4%, closing at 25,527.

In October, MacDonald introduced Thomson to Dr. James MacCallum. A frequent visitor to the Ontario Society of Artists' (OSA) exhibitions, MacCallum was admitted to the Arts and Letters Club in January 1912. There, he met artists such as John William Beatty, Arthur Heming, MacDonald and Harris. MacCallum eventually persuaded Thomson to leave Rous and Mann and start a painting career. In October 1913, MacCallum introduced Thomson to A. Y. Jackson, later a founder of the Group of Seven. MacCallum recognized Thomson's and Jackson's talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time. MacCallum and Jackson both encouraged Thomson to \\"take up painting seriously, [but] he showed no enthusiasm. The chances of earning a livelihood by it did not appear to him promising. He was sensitive and independent, and feared he might become an object of patronage.\\" MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson's sketches, he recognized their \\"truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland ... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places.\\" He described Thomson's paintings as \\"dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects\\".

He travelled around Ontario with his colleagues, especially to the wilderness of Ontario, which was to become a major source of inspiration. Regarding Algonquin Park, he wrote in a letter to MacCallum: \\"The best I can do does not do the place much justice in the way of beauty.\\" He ventured to rural areas near Toronto and tried to capture the surrounding nature.

Please briefly summarize this news article: What I learned on my summer vacation The first blush of summer: Restaurants need to add more roses onto their wines lists during the hot months. (Tim Carman/The Washington Post) Some lessons are more painful than others, like the one about hydration in extreme heat. Let me tell you, the concrete-and-steel radiator that is New York can be unforgiving to those who try to survive on the usual coffee-only morning routine as the mercury pushes into triple digits. Coffee is not just for closers; it’s for cold, cold offices, far away from Manhattan’s griddlelike sidewalks in summer. I feel faint just recounting the episode. Other lessons I took home from my week in the Big Apple and upstate New York: * Don’t try to eat late in Manhattan’s Financial District, even on the weekend. You’ll end up at a Marriott sports bar, staring at old movies and ESPN, while passing around plates of calamari. Conversations will be as fractured as the food. * The bomboloni at Sullivan Street Bakery in Hell’s Kitchen might be the perfect breakfast pastry: light, fluffy, not cloyingly sweet, and, if you want, with seasonal fruit filling piped inside. Best of all, it’s small, no larger than a Parker House roll (and just as airy). Unless you order them in blocks of four, like sliders at White Castle, you can keep the calorie count down. Heat treatment: Don't let the oppressive temperatures steer you away from the pleasures of radishes dusted with freshly cracked black pepper. (Tim Carman/The Washington Post) * Excessive heat is sometimes a good thing: The spicy radishes I ordered at Terroir on the Porch — the patio outpost on the High Line — were dusted with freshly cracked black pepper, adding another level of piquancy to the dish. Heat, after all, is not some element fixed to a certain thermonuclear temperature; it can be applied in layers that are detectable and delightful to the tongue. * Restaurants need to offer seasonal wine menus. Too many lists are stagnant, particularly during the warmer months when heavy reds are about as appealing as a cup of hot cocoa in a sauna. I’d love to see a much wider selection of roses during the summer. * With that said, the best rose I sampled was the 2011 Parusso at Il Pesce inside Eataly. The nebbiolo-based wine tasted like fresh strawberries in liquid form.(See photo above.) Bone-in octopus: The fusilli with red wine-braised octopus at Marea comes with a sauce made rich with bone marrow. (Tim Carman/The Washington Post) * The new surf and turf: At two separate meals — one at Michael White’s Marea near Central Park and the other at David Chang’s Ma Peche in Midtown — I ordered a seafood dish (red wine-braised octopus at Marea, striped bass at Ma Peche) that came with a sauce or broth thickened with bone marrow. Both dishes were, in a word, spectacular. * At more than 100 miles away, Hudson, N.Y., has become a defacto suburb of Manhattan. The latest evidence: Two former chefs from wd~50 have opened a modernist restaurant, The Crimson Sparrow, in the town of 6,700 residents. * The latest evidence that Hudson has not become a suburb of Manhattan: The Crimson Sparrow is open for dinner Wednesdays through Saturdays only. White Castle sliders: Best served with beer. Lots and lots of beer. (Tim Carman/The Washington Post) * Drunk food is, and always will be, just drunk food. A visit to a White Castle on the New Jersey side of the Lincoln Tunnel proved, once and for all, what a lecherous old troll my palate becomes after a few drinks. It’ll let anything slide down its throat, including greasy little burgers that, when assessed while dead sober, will sit in your stomach like spoonfuls of Crisco eaten straight from the can.

Examples include the ATF Dingo, Oshkosh , Iveco LMV , M-ATV, AMZ Dzik, AMZ Tur, Mungo ESK, and Bushmaster IMV. This term also applies to those vehicles fielded as part of the MRAP program. , The ATF Dingo is a German heavily armored military infantry mobility vehicle based on a Unimog chassis with a V - hull design , produced by the company Krauss - Maffei Wegmann ( KMW ) . It is designed to withstand land mines , rifle fire , artillery fragments and NBC - threats . ATF stands for Allschutz - Transport - Fahrzeug , meaning all - protected transport vehicle in German . It is named after the Australian native dog , the dingo . Currently KMW is developing the Dingo 2 GFF for the German Army with increased internal volume . Textron signed an exclusive deal to produce and market KMW 's Dingo in the United States . However , Textron chose its own more expensive and heavier M1117 Armored Security Vehicle for the MRAP competition , which did not receive a contract ., The Leopard Security Vehicle is an unusual land-mine protected APC used by the Rhodesian Government and civilian population during the Rhodesian Bush War. It offered basic but necessary protection against mine attack through the use of a V-hull., Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) is a United States military term for vehicles that are designed specifically to withstand improvised explosive device (IED) attacks and ambushes. Armored vehicles designed specifically to counter the land mine threat were first used during the Rhodesian Bush War; the technology subsequently matured with the development of the South African-designed Casspir armored fighting vehicle, which inspired the United States MRAP program and was the basis for some of the program's vehicles. From 2007 until 2012, the Pentagon's MRAP program deployed more than 12,000 MRAPs in the Iraq War and War in Afghanistan., The Rhodesian Bush Waralso known as the Second Chimurenga or the Zimbabwe War of Liberationwas a civil war that took place from July 1964 to December 1979 in the unrecognised country of Rhodesia (later Zimbabwe-Rhodesia). The conflict pitted three forces against one another: the Rhodesian government, under Ian Smith (later the Zimbabwe Rhodesian government of Bishop Abel Muzorewa); the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army, the military wing of Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union; and the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army of Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union., Iveco LMV (Light Multirole Vehicle) is a 4WD tactical vehicle developed by Iveco, and in service with several countries.

The Italian Army took vehicles to both Afghanistan and Lebanon. In Afghanistan, Lince vehicles have saved passengers' lives in several attacks with IEDs., The V-hull is a type of vehicle armor design used on wheeled armored personnel carriers (APC), infantry mobility vehicles and infantry fighting vehicles (IFV). The design originated in the 1970s with vehicles such as the Leopard security vehicle used in the Rhodesian Bush War and South African armored vehicle company Land Systems OMC's Ratel IFV and Buffel., The Buffel (English: \\"Buffalo\\") is a mine-protected infantry mobility vehicle used by the South African Army during the South African Border War.

Write a summary based on this article: U.S. Highway 10 was closed for almost 4 hours after a fatal crash Tuesday night near Becker. (Photo: KARE-David Peterlinz)      A man originally believed to be driving a pickup that ran a red light and crashed into a van in July, killing a 54-year-old Becker man and his 10-year-old daughter, has told investigators that his girlfriend was driving.      Search warrants filed in Stearns County District Court show that investigators are focusing on Carlee Rose Bollig, 17, as being the driver of the pickup that hit the van. One of those warrants indicates that Bollig, as she was being loaded into an ambulance at the crash scene, told a trooper that she was the driver.      The crash July 21 killed Charles Maurer and his daughter Cassy.      Those search warrants also show that Bollig and those in the pickup had stopped in St. Cloud before the crash to use drugs and that Bollig might have been posting to Facebook right before the crash. The warrants also quote a passenger in the vehicle as telling Bollig before the crash to stop using her phone while she was driving; Bollig is quoted in the warrants as telling that passenger to shut up and that she didn’t care if she crashed.      Investigators found synthetic marijuana and a pipe inside the truck in property that belonged to Bollig, according to the search warrants. They were seeking permission from a judge to search her phone to determine whether she was using her phone at the time of the crash.      No criminal charges have been filed; the Minnesota State Patrol continues to investigate the crash. The Patrol said early on that troopers believed the people in the pickup gave “conflicting statements” to investigators after the crash, which happened at about 8 p.m. at the intersection of U.S. Highway 10 and Sherburne County Road 11.      Investigators early on identified Deven Michael Garlock, 18, as the driver. But the search warrants indicate that he told a trooper at St. Cloud Hospital that Bollig was actually driving. Investigators learned that the passengers were going to say Garlock was driving because he was the only one who had a valid driver’s license, according to the warrants.      The other occupants of the pickup were identified by the Patrol as George Saldana, 18, and Caysi Jaronkie, 17. The warrants show that Jaronkie identified Bollig as the driver and told investigators that Bollig was “continuously on her cellphone and told her numerous times that she shouldn’t be texting and driving,” according to the warrants.      Bollig yelled at Jaronkie and made a comment “that she didn’t care if she crashed,” according to the warrants.      An initial review of Bollig’s phone showed that she was using Facebook Messenger to communicate with someone beginning at 7:49 p.m., about 12 minutes before the crash, according to the warrants. One of the search warrants seeks permission to further evaluate Bollig’s cellphone to see exactly how long Bollig might have used the phone before the crash.      Bollig refused to speak to investigators when they came to St. Cloud Hospital to question her after the crash, according to the warrants.

Once authorities had exposed as a lie the initial explanation that her boyfriend had been driving, Carlee R. Bollig, 17, of Little Falls, Minn., was charged last week in District Court with two counts each of criminal vehicular homicide and criminal vehicular operation, texting and driving, and driving without a valid license.      Killed in the July 21 crash were the van’s driver, Charles P. Maurer, 54, of Becker, and his daughter Cassy. The crash occurred about 8 p.m. at Hwy. 10 and County Road 11 between Becker and Big Lake.      “It is an illusion to believe that texting while driving is not dangerous behavior,” State Patrol Lt. Tiffani Schweigart, the chief spokeswoman for the agency that led the investigation into the crash, said Saturday. “This behavior is just as dangerous as DWI in that lives can change or be lost in the fraction of a second.”      Three people in Bollig’s pickup, all friends from Little Falls, also were injured but survived: Deven M. Garlock, 18, George E. Saldana, 18, and Caysi J. Jaronske, 17. The others in the van survived their injuries: Cassy’s sister Alenita, 16, and friend Alora K. Nelson, 15, of Becker.      Jaronske told investigators that she implored Bollig on at least “eight or nine occasions” since they left St. Cloud to stop texting while driving, according to the allegations spelled out in a juvenile petition. Bollig, however, “refused to comply,” the juvenile petition read.      Texting and driving is considered to be as dangerous as drunken driving.      In response to Jaronske’s pleas to stop texting and driving, Bollig yelled and said she “didn’t care if she crashed,” and eventually she told her friend to “f — - off,” according to a search warrant affidavit filed in court three weeks after the crash.      Just as the pickup was about to enter the intersection, the charging petition read, Jaronske said someone yelled, “red light, red light!”      Bollig never applied the brakes, investigators determined, the pickup kept going on eastbound Hwy. 10 and it T-boned the van on the driver’s side as it traveled north on County Road 11, prosecutors allege.      Analysis of Bollig’s cellphone found that she sent and received “multiple electronic messages” on Facebook for eight minutes leading up to the crash, the complaint read.      Charles Maurer was pronounced dead that night at North Memorial Medical Center in Robbinsdale. Cassy, in the same hospital with severe head injuries, died 10 days later. She would have been a fifth-grader at Becker School.      Cassy was a member of St. Marcus Catholic Church in Clear Lake, where she was a mass server. She enjoyed playing cribbage, biking, fishing, reading and playing games on her iPad. A fundraising page at gofundme.com/8gg894ptg8 has exceeded its goal of 8,000 pledged on behalf of the family.      Document: A lie is concocted      At first, “information on the scene” pointed to Garlock as the driver of the pickup, according to a search warrant affidavit. However, he told a trooper soon after the crash that he was in the back seat behind his girlfriend, and when a state trooper questioned Bollig and her sister, they acted on the advice of their mother and an attorney and refused to answer questions, the affidavit continued.      On July 31, Jaronske revealed to the trooper that Bollig and Saldana plotted to say Garlock was driving and ran the red light because he was the only one in the pickup with a valid license, the affidavit read.      That same day, the trooper obtained DNA from Bollig and Garlock to help determine who was driving, the court document read. The affidavit said blood was left throughout the pickup’s seating area and hair was embedded in the shattered windshield on the passenger side, offering biological evidence about who was seated where at the time of impact.      A search of the pickup also turned up a bag belonging to Bollig that held a small amount of synthetic marijuana, a digital scale and a smoking pipe, the court document read. Another pipe was discovered on the front passenger seat.      The document also noted one more item spotted and collected, this one sitting near the brake pedal: a cellphone.      Last year in Minnesota, 61 deaths and more than 7,000 injuries were attributed to either driver inattention or distraction, according to the state Department of Public Safety.      Over the past five years, 19 percent of all traffic fatalities and serious injuries in the state were distraction-related, the agency added.      A 225 increase in the fine for texting while driving went into effect in Minnesota in August. The increase is in addition to the current 50 fine and applies to second and subsequent convictions.      According to the state, 3,200 texting-while-driving citations were issued in 2014, a 278 percent jump since 2010. ||||| Summary:","output":"A fatal crash occurred on U.S. Highway 10, near Becker, on July 21st, which led to the closure of the highway for nearly four hours.

Pedro sends Paco into France to find his uncle and Artiguez. Paco tells Artiguez that he wants him to kill Viñolas, a Guardia Civil officer, for killing his father. Paco lets Artiguez know that his father was killed because he wouldn't tell the police where to find Artiguez, whom Viñolas must capture if he is to retain his rank in the Guard.  Meanwhile, Viñolas has learned that Artiguez's mother is dying, and sets a trap at the hospital in San Martín to capture Artiguez, presuming that he will come to see his mother.

In many people's eyes, rats are only bad. But Jean Decety and his partners at the University of Chicago did an experiment. It showed that rats are kind, warm-hearted animals. They can feel each other's pain. Scientists placed pairs of rats in plastic cages  for two weeks. During this time they got to know each other. Then they put one of the rats from each pair into a small container  in the cages. The small container had a door. It was so designed as to fall to the side when the free rat touched it. Many of the trapped  rats squeaked  to show their discomfort. The other rats of the pairs could see their suffering  friends clearly. In most pairs, the free rats would become very worried about their friends. They kept trying to save their friends again and again throughout the month. Scientists put the rats' favorite chocolate in the cages, but the rats didn't eat it until they had saved their friends successfully. Scientists also found that female rats seemed to act more empathetic than male rats. \\"The results are the first to show that rats take action in response to another's trouble,\\" Decety said. \\"Monkeys and chimpanzees have similar behavior.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  A manuscript  for the following movie plot:  The heroine, Sybylla Melvyn, is an imaginative, headstrong girl growing up in rural Australia in the 1890s. Drought and a series of poor business decisions reduce her family to subsistance level, her father begins to drink excessively, and Sybylla struggles to deal with the monotony of her life. To her relief, she is sent to live on her grandmother's property, where life is more comfortable. There she meets wealthy young Harry Beecham, who loves her and proposes marriage; convinced of her ugliness and aware of her tomboyish ways, Sybylla is unable to believe that he could really love her. By this time, her father's drinking has got the family into debt, and she is sent to work as governess/housekeeper for the family of an almost illiterate neighbour to whom her father owes money. She becomes acclaimated to this life to the point where it is almost bearable, but to her relief (again) is sent home (this time) to keep her away from her crass employer's son who has apparantely fallen for her (and, ironically, since she has no property, she is deemed unsuitable as the son's mate). When Harry Beecham returns to ask Sybylla to marry him, she concludes that she would only make him unhappy and sends him away, determined to pursue her career as a writer. The movie ending completes the suggestion, made at the begining, that this entire screenplay is based on her first book, as we see her putting the manuscript in a mailbox in front of her parent's ramshacle house.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Given the background: Hepatitis B is a contagious virus that affects the liver, infection can last from a few weeks to a serious lifelong illness. Two different types of infection exist for this disease, \\"acute\\" and \\"chronic.\\" Acute Hepatitis B is a short term illness that occurs within 6 months of exposure, Chronic Hepatitis B is long term and happens when the virus remains in the body. The younger the child is, the greater their chance of developing a chronic infection and this risk goes down as the child gets older. Approximately 90% of infected infants will develop a chronic infection.[3]  and the situation: Bob has just graduated from medical school. He went on to serve his community. Especially he is interested in treating children. One day he saw two children, child M and child N, and found child M is infected with Acute Hepatitis B while child N is infected with Chronic Hepatitis B. Next day he saw two other children, child O and child P. Child O was younger, but child P was older.  Answer the following question: Did child N had long term illness or short term illness? A:","output":"Child N had a long-term illness. This conclusion is based on the definition given in the background information provided: Chronic Hepatitis B is a long-term condition that occurs when the virus remains in the body. As such, if Child N is infected with Chronic Hepatitis B, it indicates that they are suffering from a long-term illness. This is in contrast with Acute Hepatitis B, which is a short term illness that occurs within 6 months of exposure, and was the infection that Child M was diagnosed with. In the broad context of Hepatitis B infections, the chronic form that Child N has is a serious condition that requires careful medical care and monitoring. This type of infection can increase the risk of developing liver disease, cirrhosis, or liver cancer over time. The virus continues to live and multiply in the liver, potentially causing significant damage.  Moreover, treatment for Chronic Hepatitis B differs significantly from treatment for the acute form of the disease, and medical management strategies must be altered accordingly. It is therefore essential for Bob to understand these differences in order to provide appropriate care for the children he is serving.  Given the information that the risk of developing a chronic infection decreases as children get older, Bob should pay particular attention if Child O is diagnosed with Hepatitis B, as this child being younger, may have a higher risk of developing a chronic infection, compared to Child P who is older.  However, age is not the only factor that affects the risk of chronicity, other factors including the general health condition, immune system status, and the particular characteristics of the virus strain also play essential roles in the progression of the disease, and these aspects should also be monitored and managed appropriately in both Child O and Child P's cases.  In conclusion, Child N, who was diagnosed with Chronic Hepatitis B, has a long-term illness. The virus remains in the body and can cause long-term health problems which require ongoing medical care and attention, particularly given the age and vulnerability of the patient. Bob's interest in providing care for children, his newly acquired medical knowledge, and ongoing community service will undoubtedly benefit these children and support them in managing these serious health challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: Almost Human, and Sometimes Smarter Jane Goodall, a young English woman working in Africa in the 1960s, began changing perceptions. At first, experts disputed her reports of chimps’ using tools and social behavior. The experts especially objected to her references to chimp culture. Just humans, they insisted, had “culture.” “Jane suffered early rejection by the establishment,” Richard Wrangham, a Harvard anthropologist, said. “Now, the people who say chimpanzees don’t have emotions and culture are the ones rejected.” The new consensus framed discussions in March at a symposium, “The Mind of the Chimpanzee,” at the Lincoln Park Zoo here. More than 300 primatologists and other scientists reviewed accumulating knowledge of chimps’ cognitive abilities. After one session, Frans de Waal of Emory University said that as recently as a decade ago there was still no firm consensus on many of the social relationships of chimps. “You don’t hear any debate now,” he said. In his own studies at the Yerkes Primate Research Center at Emory, Dr. de Waal found that chimps as social animals have had to constrain and alter their behavior in various ways, as have humans. It is a part of ape inheritance, he said, and in the case of humans, the basis for morality. The provocative interpretation was advanced in his recent book, “Primates and Philosophers.” Other reports shortly before the symposium had elaborated on the abilities of chimps as toolmakers. Jill Pruetz, a primatologist at Iowa State University, described 22 examples of chimps in Senegal making stick spears to hunt smaller primates for their meat. Dr. Goodall was the first to call attention to chimps as hunting carnivores, not strictly vegetarians. Dr. Pruetz observed several chimps jabbing the spears into hollow tree trunks where bush babies often dwell. Just one attempt was successful. Previously, chimps had been seen using sticks mainly to extract termites from their nests. A team of archaeologists led by Julio Mercader of the University of Calgary reported finding stones in Ivory Coast that chimps used 4,300 years ago to crack nuts. Today’s chimps have often been videotaped using rocks as a hammer to open nuts. The old stones with starch residues from nuts, the researchers said, were the earliest strong evidence of chimp tool use, and the finding suggested that chimps had learned the skill on their own, rather than copying humans. Other researchers combine field work showing chimp behavior in natural habitats with laboratory experiments that are created to disclose their underlying intelligence — what scientists call their “cognitive reserve.” For example, chimps on their own would not sit at a computer responding with rapid touches on the screen as a test of their immediate memory. Videos of their doing just that at Kyoto University in Japan especially impressed the symposium scientists. Tetsuro Matsuzawa, a Kyoto primatologist, described a young chimp watching as numbers 1 through 9 flashed on the computer screen at random positions. Then the numbers disappeared in no more than a second. White squares remained where the numbers had been. The chimp casually but swiftly pressed the squares, calling back the numbers in ascending order — 1, 2, 3, etc. The test was repeated several times, with the numbers and squares in different places. The chimp, which had months of training accompanied by promised food rewards, almost never failed to remember where the numbers had been. The video included scenes of a human failing the test, seldom recalling more than one or two numbers, if any. “Humans can’t do it,” Dr. Matsuzawa said. “Chimpanzees are superior to humans in this task.” Dr. Matsuzawa suggested that early human species “lost the immediate memory and, in return, learned symbolization, the language skills.” “I call this the trade-off theory,” he continued. “If you want a capability like better immediate memory, you have to lose some other capability.” Other experiments at Kyoto’s primate center demonstrated the ability of chimps to recognize themselves and focus attention on others. Masaki Tomonaga, who conducted the tests, said that an infant made eye contact with its mother at about 2 months and that sometime after the first year was able to maintain a gaze as the mother moved about. Dr. Tomonaga said such “gaze following” developed in humans about the same age, “though infant humans generally have more complex interactions.” Misato Hayashi, also from Kyoto, described experiments with infant chimps’ manipulating nesting cups and square and cylindrical blocks. They were slower to learn than humans, but the manual dexterity was there. A human starts stacking blocks shortly after age 1, he said; chimps are almost 3 before getting the hang of it. In experiments with mirrors, researchers showed that chimps had an awareness of themselves that is absent in monkeys but present in dolphins and all the great apes. Similar tests by Emory scientists showed some self-recognition among elephants. These behaviors were reported by Dr. de Waal and his associate J. M. Plotnik, who said that they “may suggest convergent cognitive evolution probably related to complex sociality and cooperation well documented in both chimpanzees and elephants.” Other researchers said that when confronted with problems obtaining food from the other side of a fence, chimps were not only clever on their own and often competitive with a fellow chimp, but they also showed a willingness to cooperate with one another to get the job done. Brian Hare of Duke University and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, said bonobos outperformed their chimp relatives in cooperative tasks and shared food more readily. The emotions of caring and mourning have been observed, as in the case of the chimp mother that carried on her back the corpse of her 2-year-old daughter for days after she had died. After fights between two chimps, scientists said, others in the group were seen consoling the loser and acting as mediators to restore peace. Devyn Carter of Emory described the sympathetic response to a chimp named Knuckles, who was afflicted with cerebral palsy. No fellow chimp was seen to take advantage of his disability. Even the alpha male gently groomed Knuckles. Dr. Wrangham of Harvard said the challenge to primatologists working in the field was to learn how much of the behavior and “surplus cognitive capacity” observed in captivity applied in the wild. The answer seems to vary from one isolated chimp community to another. Scientists said that indicated the role of social learning — picking up skills by emulation — and responses to different opportunities in separate cultures. At Gombe, the site in Tanzania where Dr. Goodall made a name for herself, the chimps with stick tools are accomplished extractors of termites from their nests. But termite fishing is rare in Bossou, Guinea. At Bossou, and not Gombe, chimps have learned to make use of many other tools, including stones for cracking nuts. Dora Biro of the University of Oxford in England has studied tool use by chimps at the Bossou site. They fold leaves in a mat to sponge water out of tree hollows and scoop algae off stream surfaces. They collect edible ants with sticks. They take stouter tree branches and pound the juicy palm fiber to a pulp, preparing another favorite food. Videos of Bossou nutcrackers show adult chimps, often female, placing a nut on a flat stone anvil and slamming down on it with a smaller rock. Two or three youngsters sit around watching. The adults do not appear to be giving instructions, except by example. “What we’ve learned is that manipulation of objects begins around 1 year of age,” Dr. Biro said. “If it involves two or three objects, as in cracking nuts, that happens at 3 ½ to 5 years. If it is not learned by 6 or 7, it will never be acquired.” At a dense forest in the Congo Republic, Crickette M. Sanz of the Max Planck institute said the chimps seemed as curious about her as she was about them. Groups came forward, calling others to join them. Sometimes, they sat with her for hours, eating fruit, grooming and even mating. For a more detached study, Dr. Sanz deployed 18 video cameras at remote locations and recorded 84 hours of chimp tool use. Leaf sponging was the simplest, she concluded, and collecting honey with a long stick required the most effort and risk, with termite fishing having “the highest element of success.” Dr. Sanz, who has worked with her husband, David B. Morgan, on some of the research, described mother chimps’ carefully withdrawing from a hole sticks swarming with black termites while their infants looked on. These social interactions, she said, passed on essential techniques and behaviors to the next generation. “Socially transmitted adjustable behavior,” Dr. de Waal said, is a hallmark of culture. Chimp behavior sometimes turns violent, particularly in territorial clashes. In Uganda, John Mitani of the University of Michigan observed chimp patrols regularly policing the forest boundaries of their communities. One patrol was seen assaulting an adult male, killing and emasculating him. Kristin Bonnie, another Emory primatologist, said the transmission of behavior could be benign and spontaneous, with the prospect of reward being secondary. “It is the desire to act like others, an identification with certain others,” she explained, citing as an example the way chimps usually clasp hands while grooming each other. At the symposium, researchers said the interest in learning more about chimps was not just a case of knowledge for the sake of knowledge. Their behavior and intelligence, scientists say, may offer insights into the abilities of early human ancestors like Australopithecus afarensis, the apelike “Lucy” species that thrived more than three million years ago. A more urgent motivation for the research, primatologists say, is that these are sentient beings and the closest living relatives of humans, and their survival is threatened. Elizabeth V. Lonsdorf, a primatologist at the Lincoln Park Zoo and a symposium organizer, said researchers needed “to keep their eyes out for ways to improve the care of chimpanzees.” Diseases like ebola and anthrax are taking their toll. Hunting chimps for “bush meat” is increasing. Many of the forest habitats of chimps in central Africa are being cut by loggers and land developers. As a result, Dr. Lonsdorf said, “Groups of the animals are getting closer together, which increased the threat of chimp violence and territorial disputes.” Dr. Goodall recalled that when she went to Africa nearly a half-century ago, at least a million chimps lived in the continent, and “now there are perhaps only 150,000.” In that time, they have impressed scientists with physical and emotional reminders of their kinship to humans and their occasional triumphs over them at a computer screen.","output":"A long time ago, a woman named Jane Goodall started studying chimpanzees in Africa. She found out that they are very smart and can do a lot of things we didn't think they could do. Chimps not only use tools but also have emotions and their own culture, very much like humans. Since then, more and more scientists have been studying and learning about these amazing animals. For example, chimps have been seen making tools like spears to hunt smaller animals, and even using stones to crack open nuts. These actions were taught among the chimps without human involvement. They can also recognize themselves in mirrors, which means they know who they are, just like we do. Chimpanzees can even cooperate with one another to solve problems and show compassion towards one another in tough situations. These discoveries are important not just because they are interesting, but because they can teach us about our early human ancestors. Also, understanding chimps can help us protect them from harm, as they face many threats like diseases and deforestation. Unfortunately, their population has decreased a lot since Jane Goodall first started studying them. While chimps can do many amazing things and are very similar to us, they need our help to keep them safe and thriving in their homes in Africa."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We just need to keep searching and piecing the puzzle together.\\" I sighed, knowing that he was right. There was no chance either of us would give up, especially not Resh. We were both too curious, too driven, to let the mystery of the artifact remain unfound. Together, we continued investigating the remnants of the structure. We pored over the faded inscriptions etched into the walls, hoping for a clue that would unlock the secret of the artifact's location. We searched through piles of rubble and debris, looking for anything that might have been overlooked. As the sun began to set, casting long shadows over the ruined structure, Resh stopped and stared at the flag he'd been holding onto. \\"There must be something we're missing,\\" he mused. \\"Some hidden detail that could lead us in the right direction.\\" I noticed his focus on the flag. \\"You think the flag might still be the key?\\" Resh glanced at me. \\"Maybe. If we look at it from a different angle, or in a different light. There has to be a reason we found it here, where the central chamber of the structure once stood.\\" With renewed vigor, we examined the flag under every possible condition – different angles, various levels of light, and even using the shadows cast by the setting sun. And as the last rays of sunlight disappeared below the horizon, we finally found it: a set of almost invisible markings on the flag that, when held up to a specific angle, formed a map. Filled with excitement, we quickly gathered our gear and set off in the direction the map indicated. Our previous exhaustion seemed to vanish, replaced by the adrenaline rush of discovery. As we trekked through the unforgiving terrain, Resh took turns leading the way and examining the map, ensuring that we were on the right track. And so, with renewed hope and a newfound sense of purpose, we continued our quest, determined to uncover the truth behind the artifact and the ancient civilization it belonged to. Our journey would undoubtedly be filled with challenges, but the prospect of discovering long-lost secrets drove us forwards, fueled by the same relentless curiosity that had brought us to this crumbling structure in the first place."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Group G had people over 65 in it, and group Y had people under 65 years old in it.  Which group had more people that had decreased stamina? The answer is:","output":"Group G, the group with people over 65 years old, had more people that had decreased stamina. The reason behind this can be explained by various factors related to the aging process. As people age, there are natural physiological changes that occur in the body, which can lead to decreased stamina. Some of these factors include: 1. Muscle mass decline: As people age, they gradually lose muscle mass, which is referred to as sarcopenia. This loss of muscle mass can lead to a decrease in overall strength and stamina. Sarcopenia is often more pronounced in individuals who are less physically active. 2. Decreased cardiovascular health: Older adults are more likely to have cardiovascular issues, such as reduced heart rate variability, decreased blood vessel elasticity, and a reduction in overall circulation. These factors contribute to a decreased ability to sustain and recover from exercises that would have been easier in their youth. 3. Changes in metabolism: The basal metabolic rate (BMR) – which is the rate at which the body burns calories at rest – tends to decrease as people age. This reduction in metabolism can lead to a decrease in energy levels and stamina. 4. Hormonal changes: The production of certain hormones, such as growth hormone and testosterone, decreases with age. These hormones are responsible for muscle growth and maintenance, and thus their reduction can further contribute to decreased muscle mass and stamina. 5. Medical conditions and medications: Older adults often have more medical conditions and take more medications than their younger counterparts. Some of these conditions and medications may also influence stamina. For example, conditions like arthritis or diabetes can directly impact an individual's ability to sustain physical activity, while some medications can cause side effects like fatigue or shortness of breath. 6. Poor sleep quality: Older adults tend to have more difficulty achieving restful and uninterrupted sleep compared to younger individuals. Poor sleep quality can contribute to lower energy levels and decreased stamina. Considering these factors, it is evident that Group G – comprising individuals over 65 years old – would experience a higher prevalence of decreased stamina in comparison to Group Y, which consists of younger individuals under 65 years old. While this is a general conclusion based on the physiological changes that come with aging, it is important to acknowledge that each individual's experience with aging is unique. Some people may maintain their stamina better than others due to factors such as genetics, lifestyle, and overall health. Therefore, it is crucial not to assume that every individual over 65 years old will automatically have decreased stamina."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

High heels were first worn in the 1500s, and were popular with both women and men. Today, high heels are strictly a female fashion that is easily found in stores. High heels are the hit items featured on the runway and are widely worn by celebrities. For instance, in the popular TV drama, Sex and the City, the main character, Carrie, is a lover of high heels that in almost every episode, she purchases a pair of gorgeous 4-inch high heels. Carrie loves the heels so much that she even sets her email address as \\"shoe girl\\". This clearly shows how much modern women love high heels. Even though high heels are popular, they are not the most comfortable shoes to wear. In many ways, high heels have already changed the shape of people's lives. Doctors have warned that continuous wear can cause back pain and serious damage to the knees. Though it is yet to be proven, some psychological reports suggest that high heels can lead to mental disorder, as it is stressful to the people who wear high heels, in the sense that they have to bear the pain in every step. According to Mayann Los Russo, chief editor of Footwear News, high heels are desirable because they make people appear taller. She says, \\"I think it goes back to the idea of pain before beauty.\\" Indeed, some people feel that they always need to look appealing in front of their peers. Still, Dr. Casey Kerrigan, a professor at Harvard Medical School, warns, \\"It takes a long time to feel the effects. And once you do, it's too late.\\" Despite the damage high heels can do to the feet and legs, they remain popular. Most women accept the pain because they like how they look wearing high heels. It is important that we all understand that we should never hurt ourselves just to please others. What is the passage mainly about? A) The trend of high heels. B) Women who wear high heels. C) The function of high heels. D) The effect of high heels on health.

Answer:","output":"\\"Stumbling down\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense in the context of involuntarily going somewhere because it implies a lack of control or intention in the movement. In this case, the phrase \\"I had to go somewhere involuntarily\\" suggests that the person didn't choose to go to a particular place, but instead ended up there accidentally, by force, or through some other means that didn't involve their conscious decision. \\"Stumbling down\\" is a phrase that can be used to describe a situation where someone moves forward or progresses without being in full control of their body or actions. This can happen, for example, when a person is under the influence of alcohol or other substances, or when they're physically pushed or jostled in a direction by external forces. In such situations, the individual might not have intended to go to a specific location, but they end up there regardless due to the circumstances.

WHAT THE HELL? why would they have an air conditioning vent in the patients room? Do they want him to be comfortable during his stay or something? 2)His intentions are somewhat uncertain the killer want all of the main victims family and friends dead so he can have her all to his self, he says he loves her but the next minute he trys to kill her, so does he want to kill her, love her or just plain rape her?? 3) The killer is too good, how did he develop all of his skills?

Cowboy drifter Jim Garry is summoned by his friend, smooth-talking Tate Riling. Garry rides into an Indian reservation and finds himself in the middle of a conflict between a cattle owner and some homesteaders. He meets cattle owner John Lufton, and eventually his daughters Amy and Carol. The Luftons suspect that Garry is on Riling's side and are initially hostile, especially Amy. Garry readily admits that he is going to work for his friend. Riling tells Garry that he and Indian agent Jake Pindalest have devised an elaborate scheme to force Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. Pindalest has gotten the government to order Lufton to remove his cattle from the reservation in a week. Meanwhile, Riling has organized the homesteaders into blocking the move, conning them into believing that he is working in their best interests. With no other option, Lufton would have to sell his herd at bargain prices or lose everything. Lufton would never sell to Riling, but he would to a stranger like Garry. Pindalest would then see that the government buys the herd at an inflated price. Garry would get 10,000 for his part in the swindle. Lufton manages to outsmart Riling and move his herd unimpeded, but Riling and his men stampede and scatter the cattle back onto the reservation. It would take several days to gather the herd, more time than Lufton has before the deadline. Garry becomes disgusted when a man is killed in the stampede, and he switches sides. Amy still does not trust him. She suspects Garry of betraying the contents of a letter to Riling, unaware that Carol is enamored with Riling and is the one passing information to him. Eventually, Amy comes to trust (and fall in love with) Garry, especially after he defends her father from two of Riling's men.

Here is a question about this article: A famous example of Arabic poetry and Persian poetry on romance (love) is Layla and Majnun, dating back to the Umayyad era in the 7th century. It is a tragic story of undying love much like the later Romeo and Juliet, which was itself said to have been inspired by a Latin version of Layla and Majnun to an extent. Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, the national epic of Iran, is a mythical and heroic retelling of Persian history. Amir Arsalan was also a popular mythical Persian story, which has influenced some modern works of fantasy fiction, such as The Heroic Legend of Arslan. What is the answer to this question: Who wrote Shahnameh?","output":"Shahnameh, the national epic of Iran, was written by the renowned Persian poet Hakim Abu'l-Qasim Ferdowsi Tusi, more commonly known as Ferdowsi. Born in 940 AD in the village of Paj, near the city of Tus in present-day Iran, Ferdowsi spent over three decades composing this magnificent work, which he completed around 1010 AD. Shahnameh is an extensive poetic opus containing approximately 60,000 couplets. It narrates the mythical and historical past of Iran, recounting tales of kings, warriors, and heroes from the dawn of time until the Arab conquest of the Sassanian Empire in the 7th century. Ferdowsi's Shahnameh not only preserves Persian history and culture but also played a crucial role in rejuvenating the Persian language after the Arab invasion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Process:  - An area is at a higher elevation than the surrounding area - Rain falls - Water is in the area of high elevation - The water creates a stream - The stream moves towards lower elevation - The stream continues along the same path for a long time - The soil and rocks erode where the stream touches them - The stream moves deeper into the soil - The stream is smaller than the eroded area.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose it is the height of summer happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER ravines forming.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"In the height of summer, a few factors may influence the formation of smaller ravines: 1. Evaporation rates are generally higher in the summer due to increased temperature, which could lead to a reduction in the amount of water available to form and maintain streams. 2. In some regions, summer may be marked by decreased precipitation, which would also reduce the amount of water available for stream formation and maintenance. This may lead to a slower rate of soil and rock erosion, and thus hinder the formation of smaller ravines. 3. Vegetation growth is typically more abundant during summer months, which could lead to increased root systems that stabilize soil and slow down erosion. This stabilization might reduce the formation of smaller ravines. In conclusion, while these factors may have direct or indirect influences on the formation of smaller ravines during the height of summer, the effect is likely dependent on specific regional climatic and geographic conditions. A decrease in precipitation or increased evaporation could potentially result in fewer or slower-forming ravines, while abundant vegetation growth may also inhibit the process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"Yes, these two questions are inquiring about the same information. They both ask about the Yeti, which is a famous creature from folklore. The Yeti, also known as the Abominable Snowman, is a legendary creature believed to inhabit the Himalayan mountain range in Nepal, Bhutan, and Tibet. It is an ape-like creature that is said to be taller than an average human and is covered in thick fur to withstand the harsh cold of the snow-capped mountains. Descriptions of the Yeti often depict it as having a large frame, muscular build, and sharp teeth and claws. The term \\"Yeti\\" is derived from the Tibetan word \\"Yeh-Teh,\\" which means \\"rock bear,\\" which suggests an association with the region's topography. In local folklore, the Yeti has been a part of the culture and beliefs of the indigenous people for centuries. They view it as a symbol of the harsh and unforgiving environment of the Himalayas – a living embodiment of the dangers and challenges faced by those who live in or attempt to explore the region. Many expeditions have been carried out in the pursuit of finding evidence of the Yeti's existence. In the 20th century, several renowned explorers, mountaineers, and researchers reported finding footprints, hair samples, and other potential signs of the elusive creature. Some of these findings have been debunked as hoaxes or misidentified natural occurrences, while others remain unexplained. Skeptics argue that the Yeti is likely a myth that has been perpetuated by witness misidentification of other animals found in the region, like bears or large primates. The Himalayan brown bear and the Himalayan black bear, which are commonly found in the area and are known for their larger size, could be misidentified as the Yeti. People might also misinterpret their tracks, especially in deep snow where footprints could become distorted. Despite the lack of conclusive evidence, the belief in and fascination with the Yeti persists. The creature has become a prominent figure in popular culture, with numerous movies, books, and documentaries featuring it as a mysterious and fearsome being. The search for the Yeti continues to intrigue researchers, adventurers, and enthusiasts alike, inspiring countless expeditions and fostering a sense of wonder about our world's unexplored mysteries. In conclusion, the questions \\"Who is the Yeti?\\" and \\"Who is Yeti?\\" refer to the same legendary creature from the folklore of the Himalayas.

David Duchovny really looks like he doesn't want to be here, and delivers his humorous lines as if he is doubting anyone will find them funny.

California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have abolished or overturned capital punishment on the grounds that it is unequally applied to minority populations and that innocent people are sometimes convicted.

Ned got infected with HIV because they re-used a needle. His friend Nate was not infected.  But I can use this background: The Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) is the virus that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ). Most researchers believe that the HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century. HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and by contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. It is also passed from mother to fetus. HIV is now a pandemic , with an estimated (as of 2008) 38.6 million people now living with the disease worldwide. It is estimated that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognized in 1981. For further information about HIV/AIDS, see the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) web site at http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/factsheets/ .

Question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Figure 24.8 Fungi may have both asexual and sexual stages of reproduction.   Q: Fungi may have both asexual and sexual stages of what?   Choices:  - absorption  - development  - photosynthesis  - reproduction  A: Answer:","output":"Fungi may have both asexual and sexual stages of reproduction. To provide a detailed answer, it is essential to understand the unique characteristics of fungi and how they reproduce through asexual and sexual stages. Fungi are a group of organisms that belong to the Eukarya domain, which also includes animals, plants, and protists. Unlike plants, fungi do not have the ability to photosynthesize, and they obtain their nutrients through the absorption of organic matter. They possess a unique cellular structure composed of chitin, and their body structure, called the mycelium, is made up of thread-like filaments called hyphae. Fungi play a crucial role in ecosystems, as they break down dead organic matter and recycle nutrients back to the environment. In the context of reproduction, fungi employ both asexual and sexual means to ensure their survival and genetic diversity. The asexual reproduction in fungi occurs through various mechanisms, such as budding, fragmentation, and the production of spores. During asexual reproduction, new fungal organisms are generated from a single parent, resulting in offspring that are genetically identical to the parent. This mode of reproduction allows fungi to expand their population quickly when the environmental conditions are favorable. Sexual reproduction in fungi, on the other hand, involves the fusion of genetic material from two parental fungi, resulting in offspring with a unique combination of genetic traits. Fungi have complex sexual reproduction that can involve several stages, such as plasmogamy, karyogamy, and meiosis. During sexual reproduction, compatible mating-types of hyphae come into contact and fuse together, leading to the formation of specialized reproductive structures and the eventual production of spores that will develop into new individuals. Sexual reproduction allows for the creation of genetically varied offspring, which can enhance the adaptability of fungi in diverse and changing environments. In summary, fungi may have both asexual and sexual stages of reproduction, which enable them to efficiently reproduce and maintain genetic diversity within their populations. These reproductive strategies contribute to the fungi's ability to occupy diverse ecological niches and adapt to various environmental conditions. Thus, the correct answer for the given question is reproduction. The other choices - absorption, development, and photosynthesis - do not correspond to the stages in which fungi can exhibit both asexual and sexual means."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Tinariwen (Tamasheq: , with vowels , pronounced tinariwen \\"deserts\\", plural of tenere \\"desert\\") is a Grammy Award-winning group of Tuareg musicians from the Sahara Desert region of northern Mali. The band was formed in 1979 in Tamanrasset, Algeria, but returned to Mali after a cease-fire in the 1990s. The group first started to gain a following outside the Sahara region in 2001 with the release of The Radio Tisdas Sessions, and with performances at Festival au Desert in Mali and the Roskilde Festival in Denmark. Their popularity rose internationally with the release of the critically acclaimed Aman Iman in 2007. Tinariwen was founded by Ibrahim Ag Alhabib, who at age four witnessed the execution of his father (a Tuareg rebel) during a 1963 uprising in Mali. As a child he saw a western film in which a cowboy played a guitar. Ag Alhabib built his own guitar out of a tin can, a stick and bicycle brake wire. He started to play old Tuareg and modern Arabic pop tunes. Ag Alhabib first lived in Algeria in refugee camps near Bordj Badji Mokhtar and in the deserts around the southern city of Tamanrasset, where he received a guitar from a local Arab man. Later, he resided with other Tuareg exiles in Libya and Algeria.  In the late 1970s, Ag Alhabib joined with other musicians in the Tuareg rebel community, exploring the radical chaabi protest music of Moroccan groups like Nass El Ghiwane and Jil Jilala; Algerian pop rai; and western rock and pop artists like Elvis Presley, Led Zeppelin, Carlos Santana, Dire Straits, Jimi Hendrix, Boney M, and Bob Marley. Ag Alhabib formed a group with Alhassane Ag Touhami and brothers Inteyeden Ag Ablil and Liya Ag Ablil in Tamanrasset, Algeria to play at parties and weddings. Ag Alhabib acquired his first real acoustic guitar in 1979. While the group had no official name, people began to call them Kel Tinariwen, which in the Tamashek language translates as \\"The People of the Deserts\\" or \\"The Desert Boys.\\"  In 1980, Libyan ruler Muammar al-Gaddafi put out a decree inviting all young Tuareg men who were living illegally in Libya to receive full military training. Gaddafi dreamed of forming a Saharan regiment, made up of the best young Tuareg fighters, to further his territorial ambitions in Chad, Niger, and elsewhere. Ag Alhabib and his bandmates answered the call and received nine months of training. They answered a similar call in 1985, this time by leaders of the Tuareg rebel movement in Libya, and met fellow musicians Keddou Ag Ossade, Mohammed Ag Itlale (aka \\"Japonais\\"), Sweiloum, Abouhadid, and Abdallah Ag Alhousseyni. All sang and played guitar in various permutations. The musicians joined together in a collective (now known as Tinariwen) in order to create songs about the issues facing the Tuareg people, built a makeshift studio, and vowed to record music for free for anyone who supplied a blank cassette tape. The resulting homemade cassettes were traded widely throughout the Sahara region.  In 1989, the collective left Libya and moved to Ag Alhabib's home country of Mali, where he returned to his home village of Tessalit for the first time in 26 years. In 1990 the Tuareg people of Mali revolted against the government, with some members of Tinariwen participating as rebel fighters. After a peace agreement known as the Tamanrasset Accords was reached in January 1991, the musicians left the military and devoted themselves to music full-time. In 1992 some of the members of Tinariwen went to Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire to record a cassette at JBZ studios. They played occasional gigs for far-flung Tuareg communities throughout the Sahara region, gaining word-of-mouth popularity among the Tuareg people.

PUBLISHED:. 13:18 EST, 26 September 2013. |. UPDATED:. 13:31 EST, 26 September 2013. Birds develop different 'accents' in their song depending on where they live, scientists said. A study of 723 male chaffinches in twelve different populations across the European mainland, the Azores and the Canaries found their notes became more unpredictable the further they moved. U.S. researchers believe that one reason, along with more mystifying ones, may be that island birds face less competition. Birds develop different 'accents' in their song depending on where they live, scientists said. A study of 723 male chaffinches in twelve different populations across the European mainland, the Azores and the Canaries found their notes became more unpredictable the further they moved. Whereas a female may be attempting to. pick out the right male among 60 other species singing all at once in. Europe, in the Azores she faces just eight others. The males are the singers and biologist Robert Lachlan, of Duke University, North Carolina, said: ‘One of the jobs the female has is to identify her own species.’ He compared the songs using a computer and discovered that the pattern of the notes, which he calls 'syllables', lost their syntax on the mid-Atlantic archipelago which the birds have colonised over half a million years. The research found the chaffinches living in Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands, still sing the same notes, but with a much less structured pattern from one bird to the next. Dr Lachlan said: ‘A chaffinch from mainland Europe always sounds like a chaffinch from mainland Europe.' But on Gran Canaria, it is much harder for a human to pick them out by hearing alone. The study, published in the journal Current Biology, found the syntax was gradually lost step-by-step matching the known dispersal of the species. U.S. researchers believe island chaffinches (pictured right next to a greenfinch) face less competition than their friends on the European mainland. Whereas a female may be attempting to pick out the right male among 60 other species singing all at once in Europe, in the Azores she faces just eight others. At the end of the island chain, it ‘is not just changing, it is disappearing,’ Dr Lachlan said. ‘It is not about changing the rules, it is about losing them.’ There are almost twice as many species on the Canary Islands as on the Azores, yet the Canary Island songs have much less structure, leading Dr Lachlan to say that 'other factors must also be involved.’ A large body of research has shown birds learn their species-specific song from their elders. The research found the chaffinches living in Gran Canaria (pictured) in the Canary Islands, still sing the same notes, but with a much less structured pattern from one bird to the next. But if cultural transmission were the only source of syntax, one would expect songs from the smaller island populations to have more than those from the mainland, Dr Lachlan said. Yet there is also a genetic component to that learning. Hundreds of genes have been identified which relate to song learning and singing. Studies show young birds have a genetic predisposition helping them pick out which songs they ought to be learning in order to develop typical songs. Dr Lachlan said: ‘It appears very likely what we measured is the result of the evolution of such genes.’ He believes one of two plausible explanations may be something called a ‘cultural trap’. ‘In small populations, like those on islands shortly after colonisation, an evolutionary interaction between culture and genetic predisposition favours individuals that can recognise and learn a wider range of songs - in this case, a wider range of syntactical patterns,’ he added. It may also be a case of ‘withdrawal of learning’. When populations are very small on the new island, young birds may find few tutors to learn from. Some would be forced to improvise, and this would introduce new songs into the at a higher rate than normal, leading to rapid change in structure. Now he has established this pattern of syntax loss across the islands, Dr Lachlan hopes to use it to investigate the causes of song learning evolution.

The Nationalist and Communist Chinese suspended their civil war to form a nominal alliance against Japan, and the Soviet Union quickly lent support by providing large amount of materiel to Chinese troops. In August 1937, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek deployed his best army to fight about 300,000 Japanese troops in Shanghai, but, after three months of fighting, Shanghai fell.

In March 1938, Nationalist forces won their first victory at Taierzhuang. but then the city of Xuzhou was taken by Japanese in May. In June 1938, Japan deployed about 350,000 troops to invade Wuhan and captured it in October.

Here is a goal: How do you identify when to take a stem cutting from a camellia plant? How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of identifying when to take a stem cutting from a camellia plant, I would follow these steps: Step 1: Research the camellia plant The first step is to understand the camellia plant's growing and reproduction process. Camellias are evergreen shrubs or small trees that produce flowers. They can be propagated through stem cuttings, grafting, layering, or seed germination. Stem cuttings are considered an efficient and straightforward method for propagating camellias. Step 2: Determine the best time of year for cuttings The ideal time to take stem cuttings from a camellia plant is when the plant is in the semi-hardwood phase of growth. This phase typically occurs from summer to early autumn. During this time, the stems are not too soft or too woody, which makes them suitable for propagation. Step 3: Check the age of the stem To determine if a stem is in the semi-hardwood phase, check the age of the stem. Semi-hardwood stems are partially matured, typically 2 to 4 months old. They should have some mature leaves at the top of the branch and be firm and flexible to the touch. Step 4: Examine the plant's health Before taking a stem cutting, ensure the camellia plant is healthy and free of pests or diseases as these issues can compromise the success of propagation. A healthy plant should have vibrant green leaves and no signs of damage or stress. Step 5: Choose the right stem Select a healthy stem that has at least one node, preferably two or more, and is approximately 4-6 inches long. The stem cutting should have a mix of mature leaves and younger, flexible growth. Avoid taking cuttings from stems with flowers or flower buds as they may drain resources from the stem, reducing the chance of successful rooting. To summarize, I would identify when to take a stem cutting from a camellia plant by researching the camellia plant, determining the best time of year for stem cuttings, checking the age of the stem, examining the overall health of the plant, and finally, choosing the right stem to take a cutting from. By following these steps, I would increase the likelihood of successful propagation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Which means his mistress and his wife were both pregnant at the exact same time with his children. Details continue to unravel ever since actor and former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger revealed that he fathered a love child with a former household staff member yesterday.The staffer has reportedly been identified as Mildred Patricia \\"Patty\\" Baena , a housekeeper and assistant who worked for Schwarzenegger and his wife, Maria Shriver, for 20 years before resigning in January. The exact identity of the child still remains under wraps, but new details emerged when TMZ got their hands on a copy of his birth certificate The certificate, which blacks out the boy's first and middle name, reveals that he was born on October 2, 1997 just five days after Schwarzenegger and Shriver welcomed their fourth child, Christopher Sargent Shriver Schwarzenegger, to the family. Which means his mistress and his wife were both pregnant at the exact same time with his children.      In case that mental image isn't enough, while Shriver was puttering around their house pregnant with Schwarzenegger's baby, their housekeeper was puttering around their house, cleaning and also pregnant with his baby. You can't make this stuff up.The boy, who is now 13, was born in Burbank, CA to Baena, who lists her last name as \\"Pena\\" in the certificate. She also named the father as Rogelio D.J. Baena, who was her husband at the time. Patty's place of birth is Guatemala, while her ex-husband's is Columbia.Schwarzenegger and his wife of 25 years, Shriver, shocked the public when they announced they were separating a week ago. On Monday (May 16), Schwarzenegger released a statement admitting to his wrongdoing and apologizing to his family. Shriver has since broken her silence , calling it a \\"painful and heartbreaking time\\" and asking for privacy. His 17-year-old son with Shriver, Patrick, spoke out via Twitter writing, \\"Some days you feel like sh*t, some days you want to quit and just be normal for a bit, yet I love my family till death do us apart.\\" ||||| Maria Shriver needs her friends more than ever right now -- including Oprah Winfrey, a close pal for over 30 years.      PHOTOS: Maria and other stars at the Oprah Show finale      Which is probably why the TV journalist and estranged wife of Arnold Schwarzenegger appeared Tuesday before a crowd of 15,000 -- and a bevy of A-list stars -- to celebrate the final episodes of Winfrey's eponymous show after 25 years.      VIDEO: A look back at Arnold and Maria's marriage      Half a day after her husband stunningly confessed to fathering an illegitimate child over a decade a ago with a female staffmember, Shriver took the stage at Chicago's United Center alongside Gayle King (Winfrey's other best girlfriend) around 10 p.m. (Find out what other stars showed up for the finale.)      Radiant in a sexy teal gown, Shriver paid tribute to her close friend. \\"For more than 30 years you have bestowed upon me the most amazing friendship,\\" said Shriver, who has four kids with Schwarzenegger, 63.      PHOTOS: Surprise! These celebs are BFFs      She even made a slight dig at her cheating spouse, noting to Winfrey: \\"You have shown love, support, wisdom, and most of all,\\" she said, with a big, meaningful pause, \\"the truth.\\"      Winfrey tightly squeezed her hand as the crowd erupted in applause.      \\"Over the years, you have shared that very generous spirit--you've believed in others, so they can believe in themselves.\\"      PHOTOS: Oprah's body through the years      Shriver could certainly use some TLC these days. Earlier that day, she released her own statement about her estranged husband's shocking admission. \\"This is a painful and heartbreaking time,\\" she said. \\"As a mother, my concern is for the children. I ask for compassion, respect and privacy as my children and I try to rebuild our lives and heal. I will have no further comment.\\"      Late Monday, multiple outlets reported that the other woman was Mildred Baena, who worked as the family's housekeeper-assistant for over 20 years, and allegedly gave birth to Schwarzenegger's son 14 years ago. ||||| Summary:","output":"This article is about a scandal involving Arnold Schwarzenegger, a well-known actor and former governor of California. The primary issue revolves around a child, referred to as a \\"love child,\\" who was reportedly fathered by Schwarzenegger with a household staff member named Mildred Patricia \\"Patty\\" Baena, while he was still married to Maria Shriver. An interesting and complicating twist is that Schwarzenegger's fourth child with his then-wife Shriver, Christopher Sargent Shriver Schwarzenegger, was born just five days earlier than Baena's child, meaning both women were pregnant at the same time with Schwarzenegger's children. Baena, who worked for Schwarzenegger and Shriver for 20 years, resigned from her position in January. The birth certificate of the child, whose full name was not disclosed, indicates that he was born in Burbank, California on October 2, 1997. On the document, Baena used her last name as \\"Pena\\" and listed her then-husband, Rogelio D.J. Baena, as the father of the child.  The news of the love child surfaced following Schwarzenegger's and Shriver's announcement that they were separating after 25 years of marriage, which in itself shocked the public. Schwarzenegger confessed to his misdeed and apologized to his family, while Shriver described the situation as a \\"painful and heartbreaking time\\". She sought privacy, in contrast to their son Patrick's more public response to the situation on Twitter. Amidst the turmoil, the article shifts focus slightly to detail Maria Shriver's appearance at an event to celebrate the final episodes of the Oprah Winfrey Show. Shriver, who has a long-standing friendship with Winfrey, paid tribute to her friend and subtly addressed the situation with her husband by noting that Winfrey represented \\"truth,\\" among other virtues. Shriver's own comments on the situation stressed her concern for her children and her desire for privacy during their healing process. The final part of the story reiterates that Mildred Baena, Schwarzenegger's alleged mistress and former housekeeper, gave birth to Schwarzenegger's son 14 years ago. The article portrays Schwarzenegger's extra-marital affair and subsequent paternity as a shocking revelation with far-reaching emotional and public implications. The dual pregnancies, staggered births, and the overlapping roles of staff member and mistress add layers of complexity to the events."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Once the sandwiches got home again it was clear that the italian sub had been opened and then rewrapped and as stated on the ticket he wanted it hot and it was cold and never had been hot.

(i). can dissolve in  water  ; (ii). can dissolve in  oil ; Answer:","output":"To determine the best way to chalk, we need to consider the properties of chalk and the substances it can dissolve in. Chalk is primarily composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which is a relatively insoluble substance. Let's analyze each option: (i) Chalk can dissolve in water: While chalk is not very soluble in water, it does dissolve to a certain extent. When chalk is immersed in water, a small amount of calcium carbonate reacts with water to form calcium bicarbonate, which is soluble in water. This is a slow process, and the dissolution is minimal. (ii) Chalk can dissolve in oil: Chalk, being primarily calcium carbonate, does not dissolve in oil. Oil is a nonpolar substance, and calcium carbonate is a polar substance, which means the two do not mix well chemically. Based on the properties of chalk and the substances presented, the best way to use chalk would be to let it dissolve in water, even though the process is slow and minimal. Therefore, the answer is: Answer: (i) Chalk can dissolve in water."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

What is the answer?","output":"The plays \\"The Caretaker\\" (1959) and \\"The Birthday Party\\" (1957) were both written by Harold Pinter, a critically acclaimed British playwright, screenwriter, director, and actor.  Harold Pinter was born on October 10, 1930, in Hackney, London, and went on to become one of the most important figures in 20th-century British theater. Pinter was known for his signature style which showcased his mastery of dramatic tension, indirectness, and his use of pauses and silences to create an atmosphere of discomfort, menace, or uncertainty. \\"The Birthday Party\\" is Pinter's second full-length play and one of his early \\"comedies of menace.\\" It revolves around the protagonist, Stanley, who leads an uneventful life at a seaside boarding house until two mysterious strangers arrive, eventually leading to his \\"birthday party.\\" The play initially suffered poor reviews and a short-lived run, but it was later reassessed and became a classic in the modern drama canon.  \\"The Caretaker\\" solidified Pinter's reputation as a pioneer of modern drama. The play, which unfolds in an old, cluttered room in West London, explores the power struggles between three characters: the elderly tramp, Davies, and the two brothers, Aston and Mick, who inhabit the house. As the plot advances, the conflicts between the characters are portrayed through manipulation, duplicity, and fear, thus reflecting Pinter's trademark themes of power struggle and human identity. Throughout his career, Harold Pinter wrote over 30 plays, 27 screenplays, and received numerous honors for his contributions to theater and the arts. Notably, Pinter was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2005 for the impact of his plays on the theater world. His significant influence on modern drama and his unique style have led to the coining of the term \\"Pinteresque,\\" which describes work that exhibits similar qualities of unease, menace, and ambiguity. Unfortunately, Pinter passed away on December 24, 2008, but his contributions to literature, theater, and the arts remain celebrated around the world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 1: Identify possible sources of evidence In this case, we are given four options: particles in the air, rocks containing fossils, tree rings from recently logged trees, and chemicals in human hair. We will analyze each of them briefly. Step 2: Analyze the options - Particles in the air: These provide information about the current state of the atmosphere and might indicate evidence of human influence or pollution, but not of the evolution of life forms over hundreds of millions of years. - Rocks containing fossils: Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of living organisms from the past. They provide a historical record of life on Earth and show how species have changed over time, which is a strong indicator of evolution. - Tree rings from recently logged trees: Tree rings can provide information about climate and environmental conditions during the tree's lifetime, but they only cover a relatively short period of time, usually less than a few thousand years. They are not suitable for showing evidence of evolution over hundreds of millions of years. - Chemicals in human hair: Chemicals in human hair can provide clues about a person's diet, lifestyle, and exposure to various substances. However, they do not provide evidence of the evolution of life forms over hundreds of millions of years. Step 3: Choose the best evidence Based on the analysis above, rocks containing fossils provide the most convincing evidence for the evolution of living things over hundreds of millions of years.

You will need to use smaller frames for guns such as regular plasma shooters and machine guns. You will use much larger handles once you’re making guns that shoot saw blades from the bottom and grenades from the top however! These dictate what kind of projectiles your gun uses. Always make sure you’re using combos that make sense. You need to find your own balance between those powerful tools that rip necromorphs to pieces, and the smaller less powerful tools that will keep them at bay. For example, it may seem like a great idea to pack two powerhouses on one gun, but that is not always the case. Two powerhouses also will mean slow shots. Use the tips to adjust exactly how your tool fires. There are hundreds of different ways you can make different tips and tools work together. The best way to figure it out is to experiment! For example, you really love that pneumatic torch but wish there was a way you  could make the fire come out in a smaller area with more power. Easy peasy: you would need to attach a compressor. You can have up to two attachments on your weapon at all times, and they alter the way your gun fires in general. You can connect a safety guard if you’re using a grenade launcher. This will prevent you from taking any splash damage if you should happen to get trigger-happy in a narrow hallway. It’s the last way that you can edit your gun. Most tools can hold up to 4, so 8 total for each of your guns. These have a variety of effects that alter the damage you do, your reload speed, ammo capacity and more.

A:","output":"\\"United States\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because the question refers to Louisiana as one of fifty, implying that it is part of a larger group or collection. In this context, it is reasonable to assume that the question addresses the topic of geography, specifically political or administrative divisions. Among the potential answers provided, some options such as \\"deep south\\" and \\"gulf states\\" can also refer to geographical regions. However, these options represent smaller subsets of the group that the question is referring to, which is the United States of America. The United States, commonly known as America or the U.S., is a federation comprising 50 states, and Louisiana is indeed one of them. Therefore, recognizing Louisiana as one of the fifty states within the United States aligns with human common sense, given that this fact is widely known and taught in geography and history lessons. On the other hand, the options \\"swamp\\" and \\"98% of the world's crayfish\\" are not consistent with the context of the question, as they do not refer to a larger entity made up of fifty components. \\"Swamp\\" is a type of ecosystem, and the fact about crayfish, while possibly accurate, pertains more to an aspect of Louisiana's fauna and economy rather than the broader political structure of the country. In conclusion, \\"United States\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense because it accurately represents the broader context of the question, which is the political and administrative division of states that collectively form the United States of America.

Write an article based on this summary: – An apparent gas explosion leveled an empty mansion in an affluent suburb of Philadelphia on Sunday, reducing the 9,000-square-foot home to rubble and frightening neighbors and others who felt the thunderous boom, the AP reports. The explosion at the Gladwyne mansion happened just after 8pm, and was felt as far away as southern New Jersey. The house was undergoing extensive renovations, authorities said, and no one was inside the home at the time of the explosion. It was reduced to a few walls and rubble, as various debris ended up strewn among nearby trees. The family was staying in a second residence when the mansion exploded. Their names have not been released. A spokeswoman for PECO Energy Company said no injuries were reported. The cause of the explosion remained under investigation Monday. Peter Cooke, who lives across the street from the home, told the Philadelphia Inquirer that he was reading a book when the explosion occurred. The 80-year-old Cooke said he had never heard something that loud, but when he looked outside, he couldn't see fire. Cooke's son, Michael, compared it to a meteor strike. Steve Liebowitz, 60, who lives about a half a mile away, said the boom sounded as if it was right in his backyard and he initially feared his outdoor grill may have exploded before he realized what had happened. \\"We were actually afraid,\\" he said. \\"In today's world, you don't know what kind of explosion happened or whether it was a gunshot.\\" The fire marshal and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are investigating. (Investigators are still looking for answers in the dozens of devastating gas explosions that hit Massachusetts.) Article:","output":"Massive Gas Explosion Levels Mansion in Affluent Philadelphia Suburb On Sunday evening, a shockingly powerful explosion -- reportedly the result of a gas leak -- devastated a massive 9,000-square-foot mansion in the affluent Gladwyne neighborhood, just outside Philadelphia. The thunderous boom was heard and even felt by residents several miles away in New Jersey, creating a scene of armed confusion and prompting emergency responders to descend upon the scene rapidly. The mansion, which was undergoing extensive renovations at the time of the explosion, was completely leveled, with only a few sections of walls still standing amid heaps of rubble and debris. Fortunately, no one was inside the house at the time of the accident, as the family was staying in a secondary residence. Their identities have not been disclosed, but reports confirm that no injuries were sustained during the incident. PECO Energy Company, which provides natural gas services to the area, was on site shortly after the explosion to assess the situation. While official investigations are still underway by both the local fire marshal and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, early reports from PECO indicate that a gas leak may be the primary cause of the disaster. Witnesses in the area recalled the harrowing moments following the explosion, including Peter Cooke, an 80-year-old resident of the neighborhood. Cooke was just across the street from the mansion and described the sound as the loudest he had ever heard. When he looked outdoors, he was struck by the absence of fire, leading his son to compare the aftermath to the surreal devastation of a meteor strike. Another resident, 60-year-old Steve Liebowitz, spoke about the terror of the initial blast. Living only half a mile away, the boom was still so powerful that he initially believed his outdoor grill had exploded in his own backyard. He eventually came to understand the true nature of the event, but not before admitting, \\"In today's world, you don't know what kind of explosion happened or whether it was a gunshot.\\" As the investigations continue, much remains uncertain about the finer points of this shocking incident. With a long history of gas explosions causing extensive damage and even fatalities, the Philadelphia event calls into question the safety precautions and possible oversights associated with a gas leak of this magnitude. As residents and officials work together to understand the cause and implications of this dramatic accident, one thing remains clear: in the face of such force, the community is fortunate to have suffered no casualties or injuries."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

Article: A Japanese toy maker declares that they have developed a gadget that translates dog barks into human language and plans to begin selling the gadget----under the name of Bowlingual----in U. S. pet stores and gift shops this summer. Tokyo-based Takara Co. Ltd. says about 300, 000 of the dog translator gadgets have been sold since it was on sale in Japan late last year. It is forecasting far bigger sales once an English language translation for dogs comes to America in August. The United States is home to about 67 million dogs, more than six times the number in Japan. \\"We know that the Americans love their dogs so much, so we don't think they will mind spending  120 on this product, \\" the Takara marketing manager said during an interview at a recent pet products conference in Atlanta. Regarded as one of the coolest inventions of 2002 by Time magazine, Bowlingual is made up of a 3 - inch long wireless microphone that is fastened to a dog collar and sends out sounds to a small console   that is connected to a database  . The console divides each bark into six emotional types----happiness, sadness, disappointment, anger, threat and desire----and shows common phrases, such as \\"You're ticking me off,\\" that fit the dog's emotional state. Takara says it has spent millions of dollars developing the gadget in cooperation with famous sound experts and animal behaviorists. One thing that does appear certain is that the markets for animal translation products will likely remain a dog's world since Takara has no plans to develop a similar gadget for cats. \\" _ are too unpredictable   , \\" the marketing manager said.

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"The sentence in German states, \\"Eine andere Reihenfolge beeinflusst das Farbannahmeverhalten (Trapping).\\" In English, this translates to, \\"A different order affects the color trapping behavior (Trapping).\\" Color trapping, also known as trapping, is a term used in the printing industry to describe how well different colors of ink adhere to each other when printed one on top of the other. The order of printing different colors can have a significant impact on the final product, as some colors may not blend well when printed in certain combinations or sequences, leading to issues with color registration and quality. For example, if you are printing a design with various colors, and you decide to change the order in which the colors are printed, the trapping behavior might be affected. This could result in colors bleeding into each other or not properly adhering to the paper or previous ink layers, causing a less than desirable final appearance. It is crucial for printers and designers to consider and optimize the order in which colors are printed to minimize potential trapping issues and ensure that the final product is visually appealing and meets the desired quality standards. However, it is important to note that trapping behavior can be influenced by factors such as ink composition, print speed, paper type, and printing method."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy.

Article: It's not every week that England's greatest playwright William Shakespeare hits the headlines, but the Bard of Avon   has been the subject of two news stories in recent days as new information has come to light about the writer and his working environment. In the first development, a portrait of Shakespeare, which is believed to be the only picture painted of him during his lifetime, was _ in London. The artwork has been dated back to 1610, meaning it was painted six years before the writer's death. The painting had been owned by a family descended from Shakespeare's literary patron   tor hundreds of years without them ever knowing who the man in the picture was. Alec Cobbe, who inherited the portrait, realized that the painting was a likeness of Shakespeare after visiting an exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery where he saw a portrait that had, until 70 years ago, been accepted as a life portrait of Shakespeare. Mr Cobhe immediately realized he was looking at a copy of the painting that had been in his family for centuries. The painting will now go on display in Shakespeare's hometown Stratford-upon-Avon. In a separate story, archaeologists in London believe they have unearthed the remains of Shakespeare's first theatre. The site was excavated  by a team from the Museum of London last summer, and is believed to have been built in 1576. Experts think that Shakespeare himself acted at the theatre, which may have been where the play Romeo and Juliet was premiered  . It is believed that 25 years after construction, the building was pulled down and moved timber by timber to the South Bank of the Thames, where a reconstruction of the theatre now stands. Question: .Which of the following is true? Options: A: The site was the first theater Shakespeare built. B: Romeo and Juliet was first put on in 1576. C: The theatre was pulled down to make place for a new one. D: The theatre rebuilt stands on the South Bank of the Thames.

Write a title for this article: On Wednesday morning, as a calmer Baltimore awoke, it appeared that the city’s emergency curfew had helped quiet the unrest that swept the area following the funeral of Freddie Gray. Shortly before the planned 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew ended, the city’s police commissioner announced that the city was stable. The declaration of success draws attention to one of the stranger things about curfews: the word has two similar but in practice very separate meanings. As William Ruefle, a professor of criminology at the University of South Florida St. Petersburg who has done research into the effectiveness of curfews, explains, emergency curfews and permanent juvenile curfews can’t really be lumped together. And considering that difference, it’s not a surprise that the emergency curfew may have helped contribute to the calm in Maryland. “I don’t think there’s any question that [emergency curfews] are needed and legitimate, whereas with the permanent ones there was some question,” Ruefle says. In fact, the lack of dispute about emergency curfews is such that there’s been very little research actually done on the topic—Ruefle says that can’t think of anything he read in all his research that even talked about them—and it’s hard to pin down their history. There wouldn’t have always been such a split between the two types of curfews. As Yvonne Vissings explains in an essay in the book Juvenile Crime and Justice, the first curfews were imposed under England’s Alfred the Great, who ruled in the ninth century. The word itself is from the French for “cover fires”; instituting a special time of night at which fires had to be doused or covered. This could have served several purposes: it lowered the risk of a spreading fire, it got townspeople who congregated around public fires to go home and it was a useful tactic in times of trouble. Emergency curfews were used in the U.S. at least as early as the Civil War. But, as explained in a very thorough entry in the encyclopedia The Social History of the American Family, the original idea of covering fires so that townspeople would go home also meant that those in power could control the rights of lower-class populations, who wouldn’t have had private places to congregate. By the 1700s in Europe and the U.S., cities instituted permanent curfews for workers and slaves. At that time and into the 1800s, most of those curfews were aimed at controlling laborers. When child-labor laws came along, the reasoning got swapped: adults were now working in factories (often at night, making curfews unappealing to the bosses) and children were at home without supervision, getting into trouble. Curfews as a tactic to suppress crime became linked with age restrictions on movement. By the middle of the 20th century, many cities had permanent youth curfews. The U.S. Department of Justice bulletin on curfews cites 1975’s Bykofsky v. Borough of Middletown as the first federal court test of the constitutionality of those curfews; the court decided that the curfew in question was allowed, as any infringing on parents’ rights to make decisions for their children was outweighed by Middletown’s interest in protecting them. In general, the DOJ sums up, a constitutionally acceptable juvenile curfew must come with a demonstrated reason and be precisely written in a way that addresses that reason. For example, a city could demonstrate that juvenile crime during certain hours is a problem and that the curfew applies to those hours. A rise in crime often coincides with a rise in permanent juvenile curfews, and vice versa. Even though many dispute the effectiveness of juvenile curfews, they’re a frequent tactic when a city is looking for solutions. “In general, in the early ’90s when violence was such a hot topic, curfews were something many cities were trying,” says Ruefle. “I haven’t had a call about this in a decade. It’s faded away because crime has faded away.” Still, many cities continue to keep permanent juvenile curfews on the books, whether or not they’re enforced. Baltimore is included in that group. In fact, last August Baltimore made news by tightening its policy. That means that, even after next week, Baltimore’s will be a tale of two curfews: one that ends when the emergency does, and one that will keep on going.

If the perspective could possibly convince someone with different view, it is supporting, otherwise it is undermining. Problem:claim: It is fine to do random drug-testing in schools.  perspective: Prevent drug use Solution:","output":"Step 1: Understand the claim The claim states that it is fine to do random drug-testing in schools. Step 2: Understand the perspective The perspective given is \\"Prevent drug use.\\" This perspective aims at discouraging and stopping drug use among students. Step 3: Analyze the relationship between the claim and the perspective If random drug-testing in schools can prevent or reduce drug use among students, then the perspective of preventing drug use aligns with the claim. In this case, random drug testing can help identify students who are using drugs, leading to intervention or assistance in helping them quit.  Step 4: Determine if the perspective supports or undermines the claim Since preventing drug use is a positive outcome and random drug-testing can contribute to this goal, the perspective supports the claim that it is fine to do random drug-testing in schools. Conclusion: The perspective of preventing drug use supports the claim that it is fine to do random drug-testing in schools, as it could potentially help reduce and discourage drug use among students."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Only once he was away from the carnival of Rio de Janeiro did Manuel Neuer quite realise the magnitude of what he achieved this summer. Of course, any footballer would recognise that climbing the steps of the Maracana Stadium to lift the World Cup was the landmark moment in their professional lives. The subsequent public acclamation in Berlin at The Brandenburg Gate — where the victorious Germany team were greeted by more than a million fans — certainly enforced the point. Yet it was only when Neuer went on holiday that the size of the triumph became truly clear. Manuel Neuer has set his sights on winning the Champions League final staged in Germany this season. Neuer holds the trophy aloft after winning the 2014 World Cup with Germany in Brazil. Neuer holds up the Germany flag after helping his country to a fourth World Cup triumph. Germany keeper did not realise the impact of winning the World Cup until he was surrounded by fans on holiday. ‘I didn’t know how long we would be in the World Cup, so I hadn’t booked any time away beforehand,’ said the Bayern Munich goalkeeper. ‘Then I decided to go away in Europe, a last-minute holiday. ‘Never before has there been such hype when I was on holiday. I was just so surprised about what happened. Wherever I went, there were hordes of Germans. Everyone was on a high and celebrating. On holiday, everybody was asking for a photo. I loved doing it but there was not much privacy.’ Neuer is the man Manchester City must get past on Wednesday, a formidable last line of defence for Bayern and Germany. His career had already been somewhat spectacular: he won the treble of German league and cup and Champions League in 2013 and then the World Club Cup the same year; he won the league and cup double with Bayern in 2014. But the 1-0 win over Argentina is clearly the culmination of the 28-year-old’s achievements in the game. ‘As I went up the stairs in Rio to get the World Cup, my thought was, “How easy it is to climb up these stairs when you have won.” After we had lost to Chelsea (in the 2012 Champions League final) it was more like a horror story. Your legs feel heavy as lead, so does your head. It’s no fun to go up then.’ German keeper pulls off a point blank save against Karim Benzema in the quarter-final against France. Neuer (C) is unrepetant after colliding with Argentina striker Gonzalo Higuain (R) during the  World Cup final. Neuer celebrates with Germany teammates among thousands of fans on their hero's return to Berlin. VIDEO All Star XI: Manuel Neuer highlights. The summer not only confirmed him as the world’s greatest goalkeeper — a worthy heir to Germany’s Sepp Maier and Oliver Kahn — but also as the pioneer of a new style. The ‘sweeper-keeper’ phrase has been around for a while but it took Neuer in the World Cup to demonstrate just what it can mean. In the 2-1 win against Algeria, when Germany were forcing the pace of the game, Neuer covered six kilometres, effectively operating as an extra member of the defence ‘I had games like that before,’ said Neuer. ‘But as far as the World Cup is concerned, it attracts more attention. People might get the impression that it was something new but a keeper remains a keeper even when he operates further up field. A keeper has to adjust his game to the team. If the team moves further up, he has to do the same. It’s nothing I’ve invented. ‘It is something that comes naturally. Everybody knows I like it and I can somehow deliver that style. But, again, it all happens because the coach wants to play a certain way and it is better for the team. ‘I have always been interested in finding new ways to play and have looked at handball keepers and ice hockey goal-minders. It helps me.’ Neuer raises the 2013 Champions League trophy after Bayern Munich beat Borussia Dortmund in the final. The Bayern stopper celebrates winning the Bundesliga and German Cup double last season. The 28-year-old ranks Jens Lehman (L) and Edwin van der Sar (R) as his goalkeeping role models. There was of course a darker moment in the World Cup final: that charge from goal and the high-knee challenge to the face of Gonzalo Higuain. A stronger referee would have sent Neuer off and awarded a penalty, at which point the story of the summer might have had an entirely differnet conclusion. Neuer is unrepentant. ‘My opinion is still the same as it was after the game: it was no foul and no penalty. I got to the ball and he didn’t touch it at all. It was not intentional. I apologised right away. I was aware of the fact that it was a tight situation as I had to take a big risk. I had to take a decision in a split second. As a keeper you can’t be afraid. Of course I was aware afterwards that it was painful for him. I clearly went for the ball.’ His predecessor in the German goal, Kahn, has described Neuer’s style as ‘harikiri’ but Neuer is phlegmatic. ‘It can be risky, he is right as far as that is concerned. But it’s not about the keeper being a one-man show. The risk I take is one I take for the team. In the end, I’m the one to blame if it does not work. ’ His inspirations have a strong Premier League flavour and he names former Arsenal and Manchester United keepers as key influences. ‘It is something I often saw from Jens Lehmann, who won the UEFA Cup in 1997 with my former club Schalke. Internationally, I saw it from the Dutch keeper Edwin van der Sar.’ Neuer practices against Franck Ribery ahead of opening Champions League match against Manchester City. With homegrown stars like Neuer and Thomas Mulller (L), Bayern can dominate for years to come. Pep Guardiola takes a final training session ahead of Bayern Munich's clash with Manchester City. For now, there is no time for reflecting. Neuer has Wednesday's game against City and a Champions League campaign on which to focus. There is a sense that this Bayern team might emulate the Barcelona side which made up the core of Spain’s team from 2008-2012. Club and country dominated football and Neuer, Jerome Boateng, Philipp Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Mario Gotze and Thomas Muller perhaps have the capability to do the same. ‘The Bundesliga and the cup are the basics,’ said Neuer. ‘But this season we have the chance to play two finals in Berlin. Everybody wants that. It’s a great thing to play a final in your capital city.’ He is referring to the 2015 Champions League final and the German FA Cup final. It feels as though this is Bayern Munich’s time once more. Taken from an original interview by Ludger Schulze and Oliver Trust.

Question: I read this background article the other day: In nature, when the population size is small, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual. When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease.  I am facing a new situation today: John is studying a species in two similar countries, country A and country B. Country A has large population, but country B has small population of that species. John is pondering about how this species would fare in the future in these two countries.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would country A see higher or lower growth rate of the species than country B? Answer:","output":"Based on the knowledge from the background article, it's likely that country A would see a lower growth rate of the species than country B. The article suggests a strong relationship between population size and resource availability. When the population size is small, such as in Country B, there are typically plenty of resources for each individual, allowing organisms to reproduce more easily. This leads to a high birth rate and, hence, a high population growth rate.  On the other hand, in Country A, where the population size is large, the increased competition for resources could result in diminishing food supplies or other necessary resources. This situation can lead to a lower survival rate and a reduced ability for organisms to reproduce at the same rate, resulting in a lower birth rate. The article indicated that this decline in birth rate causes the population growth rate to decrease.  Therefore, based on this understanding, it can be inferred that Country A, with its larger population, is likely to experience a lower growth rate for the species than Country B, where the population is smaller and resources are more readily available. Nonetheless, it's important to note that other factors could also influence the species' growth rate, for example, environmental conditions, predation levels, disease, or changes to the ecosystem and spaces for living may impact population growth rates beyond just resource availability."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Sometimes they try to remember a solution from the last time they had a similar problem. They often accept the opinions or ideas of other people. Other times they begin to act without thinking. They try to find a solution by trial and error. However, when all these methods fail, the person with a problem has to start analyzing. There are six stages in analyzing a problem. First the person must recognize that there is a problem. For example, Sam's bicycle is broken, and he cannot read it to class as he usually does. Sam must see that there is a problem with his bicycle. Next the thinker must define the problem. Before Sam can repair his bicycle, he must find out the reason why it does not work. For instance, he must determine if the problem is with the gears, the brakes, or the frame. He must make his problem more specific. Now the person must look for information that will make the problem clearer and lead to possible solutions. For instance, suppose Sam decided that his bike does not work because there is something wrong with the gear wheels. At this time, he can look in his bicycle repair book and read about gears. He can talk to his friends at the bike shop. He can look at his gears carefully. After studying the problem, the person should have several suggestions for a possible solution. Take Sam as an illustration. His suggestions might be: put oil on the gear wheels; buy new gear wheels and replace the old ones; tighten or loosen the gear wheels. Eventually one suggestion seems to be the solution to the problem. Sometimes the final idea comes very suddenly because the thinker suddenly sees something new or sees something in a new way. Sam, for example, suddenly sees that there is a piece of chewing gum between the gear wheels. He immediately realizes the solution to his problem: he must clean the gear wheels. Finally the solution is tested. Sam cleans the gear wheels and finds that afterwards his bicycle works perfectly. he has solved the problem. Question: What is the best title for this passage?

Indigenous peoples of Mexico (Spanish: pueblos indigenas de Mexico), Native Mexicans (Spanish: nativos mexicanos), or Mexican Native Americans (Spanish: nativo america mexicanos), are those who are part of communities that trace their roots back to populations and communities that existed in what is now Mexico prior to the arrival of Europeans. According to the National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples (Comision Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indigenas, or CDI in Spanish) and the INEGI (official census institute), in 2015, 25,694,928 people in Mexico self-identify as being indigenous of many different ethnic groups, which constitute 21.5% of Mexico's population. According to the National Commission for the Development of the Indigenous Peoples (CDI), there were 25,694,928 indigenous people reported in Mexico in 2015, which constitutes 21.5% of the population of Mexico. This is a significant increase from the 2010 census, in which indigenous Mexicans accounted for 14.9% of the population, and numbered 15,700,000 Most indigenous communities have a degree of financial, political autonomy under the legislation of \\"usos y costumbres\\", which allows them to regulate internal issues under customary law.  The indigenous population of Mexico has in recent decades increased both in absolute numbers as-well as a percentage of the population. This is largely due to increased self-identification as indigenous, as-well as indigenous women having higher birth rates as compared to the Mexican average. Indigenous peoples are more likely to live in more rural areas, than the Mexican average, but many do reside in urban or suburban areas, particularly, in the central states of Mexico, Puebla, Tlaxcala, the Federal District and the Yucatan Peninsula.  According to the CDI, the states with the greatest percentage of indigenous population are: Yucatan, with 65.40%, Quintana Roo with 44.44% and Campeche with 44.54% of the population being indigenous, most of them Maya; Oaxaca with 65.73% of the population, the most numerous groups being the Mixtec and Zapotec peoples; Chiapas has 36.15%, the majority being Tzeltal and Tzotzil Maya; Hidalgo with 36.21%, the majority being Otomi; Puebla with 35.28%, and Guerrero with 33.92%, mostly Nahua people and the states of San Luis Potosi and Veracruz both home to a population of 19% indigenous people, mostly from the Totonac, Nahua and Teenek (Huastec) groups.","output":"This text is about the indigenous peoples of Mexico, also referred to as Native Mexicans or Mexican Native Americans.

In physics, there two main types of energy: kinetic and potential energy. Kinetic energy is the energy of an object due to its motion. If an object is moving, it possesses kinetic energy. Potential energy is the energy stored in the object due to its position in a force field, internal stresses, electric charge, or other factors.  Therefore, when an object is moving in space (like a pendulum swinging), the energy constantly changes from potential to kinetic energy. When the object reaches the highest point of its swing (meaning it's temporarily still before it starts to swing back), it's all potential energy.

Q: If I tell you that Some airplanes use propellers to move, and ask you the question \\"propellers are on some airplanes primarily to give\\", is the correct answer \\"stability\\"? A:","output":"The correct answer is not \\"stability,\\" but rather \\"thrust.\\" Propellers are on some airplanes primarily to provide \\"thrust,\\" which is the force that propels the aircraft through the air. Thrust is produced by the spinning propeller blades, which create a pressure difference between the front and back surfaces of the blades. This pressure difference propels the airplane forward, allowing it to generate lift and maintain flight. While propellers do contribute to an airplane's stability in certain aspects, their primary function is to generate thrust. Airplanes that use propellers to move are commonly referred to as propeller-driven or propeller-powered aircraft. These airplanes are powered by internal combustion engines or turboprop engines. Turboprop engines combine the principles of jet engines and propeller-driven engines. In a turboprop engine, a jet engine's exhaust is harnessed to drive a propeller, which generates thrust. Propeller-driven aircraft are generally more fuel-efficient and suited for lower speeds and shorter distances compared to jet-powered aircraft. It's important to note that there is a difference between propellers and the airplane's control surfaces, which contribute significantly to its stability and maneuverability. Control surfaces include the ailerons, elevator, and rudder. These surfaces are used to control the airplane's movement in the three axes of rotation - roll, pitch, and yaw. Stability is an essential aspect of flight, as it determines the airplane's ability to maintain a steady flight path and resist outside forces, such as turbulence. Stability is achieved through a combination of factors, including the shape and position of the airplane's wings, fuselage, tail, and control surfaces, as well as the distribution of its weight and balance. In summary, while propellers on some airplanes play a role in maintaining stability, their primary purpose is to provide the thrust necessary for flight. The correct answer to the question \\"propellers are on some airplanes primarily to give\\" would be \\"thrust.\\""},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Question: I can use this background: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).  Now, I have a new situation: Beth and Sally are both on the high school basketball team and are about to play a match against their rival school. This match is extremely important, and students from both schools always turn out in droves to support their team. Last year, Beth and Sally's team lost so they are extra motivated this year to win. Before the game, Beth spends her time running in place and doing jumping jacks to prepare, and Sally spends her time talking to her friends who are sitting in the bleachers cheering the team on.  Answer this question please: Are Sally's muscles more or less ready for the game than Beth's? Answer:","output":"Sally's muscles are less ready for the game than Beth's. This is because Beth is actively engaging in warm-up exercises, such as running in place and doing jumping jacks, which help her to gradually increase the intensity of physical activity, preparing her muscles for the upcoming basketball match. These warm-up exercises are important for a few reasons: 1. Increased blood flow: Warming up helps to increase blood flow to the muscles, ensuring that they receive an adequate amount of oxygen and nutrients needed for optimal performance during the game. 2. Increased flexibility: Warming up helps to loosen the muscles and tendons, making them more flexible and reducing the risk of injury during the basketball match. 3. Enhanced neuromuscular coordination: Warm-up exercises help to improve the communication between the nervous system and the muscles, which will enable Beth to have better control over her body movements and reduce the risk of mistakes during the game. 4. Mental preparation: Warming up allows Beth to mentally focus on the game and her role in the team, further enhancing her performance during the match. On the other hand, Sally spends her time talking to friends in the bleachers instead of warming up. In doing so, she is not benefiting from any of the physiological and psychological advantages that a proper warm-up can provide. Her muscles will be less prepared for the sudden, intense exertion that a basketball game demands, and she will be at a higher risk of injury. Furthermore, her lack of focused warm-up might also impact her mental preparedness for the game. In conclusion, Beth's muscles are more ready for the game than Sally's, as she actively engages in warm-up exercises that prepare her body and mind for the intense activity of the basketball match. Sally, conversely, skips this crucial step and may face negative consequences as a result, including a higher risk of injury and reduced performance during the game."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"From the given biography, we can gather that Archibald Douglas was a Scottish nobleman belonging to a prestigious lineage, as indicated by his title, the 8th Marquess of Queensberry. His full name was Archibald William Douglas, and he was born on 18 April 1818 and died on 6 August 1858. He held another title before becoming the Marquess, which was the Viscount Drumlanrig. He held this title between 1837 and 1856 implying that he inherited the title of Marquess in 1856. Douglas was actively involved in politics, aligning with the conservative party in Scotland. This suggests that his political views were more traditional or aimed at preserving existing social order. His contributions to politics are noteworthy, having served in a high-ranking position as the Comptroller of the Household from 1853 to 1856, which is a post associated with the royal household in the United Kingdom. This position is traditionally held by a member of the government and is a public role, demonstrating his considerable influence in public service during this period. Moreover, the use of \\"PC\\" indicates that he was a member of the Privy Council, a prestigious board of advisors to the monarch in the British government. Being appointed to this council shows that Douglas was trusted and respected by the monarchy. The timeline suggests this appointment occurred either during or after his term as Comptroller of the Household. It also seems that he did not live a particularly long life, as he passed away at the age of 40 in 1858.

The New York police have 170 horses working in certain parts of the city. The horses are expensive to feed, but it is even more expensive to look after them. Because the horses must walk on the streets, they need special horseshoes. In fact , they need more than 8,000 of them each year. Every police horse in New York gets new shoes every month. Keeping these shoes in good repair is the job of six blacksmiths. There are only about thirty-five of these blacksmiths in the whole United States. The cost of shoing a horse is between twenty dollars and thirty-five dollars, and it takes a good blacksmith two or three hours to do the job. A blacksmith's job is not an easy one. He must be able to shape a shoe from a piece of metal and then fit it to the horse's foot. The blacksmith must bend over all the time when he is fitting the shoe and must hold the weight of the horse's leg while he works. Clearly, a blacksmith must be very storng. But even more important, he must be able to deal with horses---for before the blacksmith can begin his work, he has to get the horse to lift its leg. One of the blacksmiths in New York is James Corbin. He came to the country from Ireland in 1948. He not only makes horseshoes for the police but also works for a group of horse owners near the city. Corbin became interested in blacksmithing because his father did it, and,as the puts it, \\"It's a good way to make a living.\\" Question: The best title for the passage is \\"  _  \\".

Yellowknife became the territorial capital in 1967, following recommendations by the Carrothers Commission.  - Ottawa is the capital city of Canada. It stands on the south bank of the Ottawa River in the eastern portion of southern Ontario. Ottawa borders Gatineau, Quebec; the two form the core of the OttawaGatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) and the National Capital Region (NCR). The 2011 census reported a population of 883,391, making it the fourth-largest city in Canada; and 1,236,324 within the CMA, making it the fourth-largest CMA in Canada. The City of Ottawa reported that the city had an estimated population of 960,754 as of December 2015.  - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - The Premier of Ontario is the first minister of the Crown for the Canadian province of Ontario.  - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area . An established global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and widely recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.  - Nunavut (from Inuktitut:  ) is the newest, largest, northernmost, and least populous territory of Canada. It was separated officially from the Northwest Territories on April 1, 1999, via the Nunavut Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act, though the boundaries had been contemplatively drawn in 1993. The creation of Nunavut resulted in the first major change to Canada's political map since the incorporation of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador in 1949.  - Minister of the Crown is a formal constitutional term used in the Commonwealth realms to describe a minister to the reigning sovereign. The term indicates that the minister serves \\"at His/Her Majesty's pleasure\\", and advises the monarch, or viceroy, on how to exercise the Crown prerogatives relative to the minister's department or ministry.  - The Deputy Premier of Ontario is the representative of the Premier of Ontario in the Canadian province of Ontario when the current Premier is unable to attend functions executed by the Premier . The role was created in 1977 . For much of the province 's early history , the position of Provincial Secretary and Registrar of Ontario was the second most powerful position in the Ontario cabinet . This role diminished by the 1960s , take overby the Deputy Premier in 1977 and abolished in 1985 .  - Canada's geography is divided into administrative divisions known as provinces and territories that are responsible for delivery of sub-national governance. When Canada was formed in 1867, three provinces of British North America  New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the Province of Canada (which, on the formation of Canada, was divided into Ontario and Quebec)  were united to form a federated colony, which eventually became a sovereign nation in the next century. Over its history, Canada's international borders have changed several times, and the country has grown from the original four provinces to the current ten provinces and three territories. The ten provinces are Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. Several of the provinces were former British colonies, Quebec was originally a French colony, while others were added as Canada grew. The three territories are Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon, which govern the rest of the area of the former British North America. Together, the provinces and territories make up the world's second-largest country by area.  - Ontario, one of the 13 provinces and territories of Canada, is located in east-central Canada. It is Canada's most populous province by a large margin, accounting for nearly 40 percent of all Canadians, and is the second-largest province in total area. Ontario is fourth-largest in total area when the territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are included. It is home to the nation's capital city, Ottawa, and the nation's most populous city, Toronto.    'deputy premier of ontario' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'instance of'?

Cyclin A2 activates the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk1 and Cdk2 and is expressed at elevated levels from S phase until early mitosis. We found that mutant mice that cannot elevate cyclin A2 are chromosomally unstable and tumor-prone. Underlying the chromosomal instability is a failure to up-regulate the meiotic recombination 11 (Mre11) nuclease in S phase, which leads to impaired resolution of stalled replication forks, insufficient repair of double-stranded DNA breaks, and improper segregation of sister chromosomes. Unexpectedly, cyclin A2 controlled Mre11 abundance through a C-terminal RNA binding domain that selectively and directly binds Mre11 transcripts to mediate polysome loading and translation. These data reveal cyclin A2 as a mechanistically diverse regulator of DNA replication combining multifaceted kinase-dependent functions with a kinase-independent, RNA binding–dependent role that ensures adequate repair of common replication errors.","output":"Title: \\"Cyclin A2: A Key Regulator of DNA Replication Ensuring Repair and Preventing Tumors via Mre11 Nuclease Control\\""},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Not until 1998 did al Qaeda undertake a major terrorist operation of its own, in large part because  Bin Laden lost his base in Sudan. Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by  Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to  Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies.  Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him.  Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of  Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the  Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case,  Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What is the name of the Islamist regime that came to power in Khartoum?\\" is \\"Sudanese\\"?","output":"Yes, that's right!

Tanya asked Angela which type of yarn would be best for crocheting a scarf, because","output":"Angela was well-known for her exquisite crochet creations. She had a talent for turning the most ordinary yarn into intricate works of art. Despite being modest about her skills, she was always happy to help others develop their crochet techniques. \\"Well, Tanya,\\" Angela began thoughtfully, \\"there are several factors we need to consider when choosing the perfect yarn for your scarf. We have to think about the texture, weight, and fiber content. The type of yarn you will use can greatly affect your project, making it light and airy or warm and cozy.\\" Tanya listened intently as Angela continued, \\"For a scarf, you generally want something that's soft and comfortable to wear against your skin. A good starting point is to look for a medium-weight or worsted weight yarn. They are versatile and provide a cozy feel.\\" \\"While you'll find many natural fibers on the market like, cotton, wool, alpaca, and silk, synthetic options such as acrylic, polyester, or nylon can also offer great results. Some people prefer the warmth and breathability of natural fibers like wool, but they can sometimes be itchy, especially for those with sensitive skin. Acrylic yarns, on the other hand, are budget-friendly and considered hypoallergenic. There are also yarns that blend both natural and synthetic fibers to provide the best of both worlds.\\" As they continued browsing through the aisles of the yarn store, Angela pointed out the different options' pros and cons. She picked up a skein of superwash merino wool. \\"This one's quite popular among crocheters for scarves. Though wool can sometimes be itchy, the superwash merino is much softer and doesn't irritate the skin. Plus, it's machine-washable, which means you can easily take care of your scarf.\\" \\"Another option to consider,\\" Angela continued, \\"is a cotton blend yarn. Cotton is soft, hypoallergenic, and breathable, so a cotton blend, such as cotton and acrylic, would work well for a lightweight scarf that can be worn in various climates.\\" Tanya couldn't help but be drawn towards the soft, shiny texture of a skein of silk-blend yarn. \\"What about this one, Angela? It's so luxurious and beautiful!\\" \\"Ah, yes,\\" Angela acknowledged, \\"silk blends are lovely and elegant, but they could be a bit more challenging to work with, especially for beginners, as silk tends to be a bit slippery. These blends also tend to be more expensive, so it might be best saved for a special occasion or gift. But if you're feeling up to the challenge and your budget allows, it can make a wonderfully soft and drapey scarf.\\" With Angela's guidance, Tanya finally decided on a soft, worsted weight acrylic-yarn blend that offered the best combination of warmth, softness, and durability. Excited to begin her project, the two returned to Angela's cozy living room. Over the next several weeks, Angela patiently taught Tanya how to crochet her scarf. Beginning with the basic chain stitch, Tanya quickly advanced to double crochet and learned to combine stitches for interesting textures and patterns. As her scarf grew, so did her confidence. Tanya watched in amazement as the yarn she had chosen transformed into a cozy, beautifully crocheted scarf under her fingertips. With Angela's help, she had learned not only how to choose the perfect yarn for her project but also how to create an item she would treasure for years to come. And perhaps even more importantly, she had discovered the joy of creating something by hand, sharing her newfound skill with others and continuing the ever-evolving story of crafting."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Currently, 147 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word \\"republic\\" as part of their official names; not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor do all nations with elected governments use the word \\"republic\\" in their names.  - Peter III ( Portuguese : Pedro III ( Portuguese pronunciation : ( pedu ) ) ( 5 July 1717 -- 25 May 1786 ) became King of the Kingdom of Portugal and the Algarves by the accession of his wife and niece Queen Maria I in 1777 , and co-reigned alongside her until his death .  - The Iberian Peninsula , also known as Iberia , is located in the southwest corner of Europe. The peninsula is principally divided between Portugal and Spain, comprising most of their territory. It also includes Andorra and a small part of France along the peninsula's northeastern edge, as well as Gibraltar on its south coast, a small peninsula which forms an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. With an area of approximately , it is the second largest European peninsula, after the Scandinavian.  - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla.  - Portugal (Portuguese: ), officially the Portuguese Republic (Portuguese: ), is a country on the Iberian Peninsula in Southwestern Europe. It is the westernmost country of mainland Europe. To the west and south it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean and to the east and north by Spain. The PortugalSpain border is long and considered the longest uninterrupted border within the European Union. The republic also includes the Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira, both autonomous regions with their own regional governments.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.

Please answer the following question: Kathy and Jacob are two coworkers out having a drink at a bar after a day at the office. They both wear glasses and Kathy comments that she hates that she is so farsighted and wishes there was a surgery to fix it. Jacob says that he finds it amusing she is farsighted because he himself is nearsighted. They both laugh at the opposite nature of their eye condition, and then both look at the menu on the other side of the room to decide what drinks to order next.  Which person's eyes naturally focus images behind the retina?  Hint: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it. Answer:","output":"Based on the description given, the person with farsightedness (hyperopia) would naturally focus images behind the retina. In this scenario, that person is Kathy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

My friend Simona Quirini and her family run the beautiful Canto del Maggio, a B&B, restaurant and garden, about one hour’s drive from Florence. We arrived to catch Simona with a wooden crate in her hands, already half full of blush pink flower heads, small and as fragrant as honey. It wasn’t just roses that were bursting out of their bushes with colour and fragrance. In fact, every time I go to Canto del Maggio, I notice how lush the property is with fruit, flowers and plants, and every season there are bounties to be collected. The first time I was there I noticed the myrtle bushes and heirloom fruit trees — little tiny, red pears and apples. The garden was full of summer produce and I stole green-skinned figs harbouring raspberry-red flesh off the trees. The next time I went, we picked ripe olives off the trees around the pool and took them down to the local frantoio, olive oil mill, to press the bright green oil out of them. I also came home with buckets of corbezzoli, or Irish strawberries, to make jam. This spring, I noticed the hedge rows of flowering wild strawberries and this last visit we picked the berries off them for an afternoon snack. With the help of my daughter (who was slightly more interested in playing with Simona’s new puppy), we filled a crateful of roses and picked the petals delicately off and into bowls. We were using the rose petal jam recipe and the technique I learned between two wonderful sources — Pellegrino Artusi’s 1891 cookbook (this pastry recipe below is also inspired by it) and the Armenian monks on Venice’s Isola di San Lazzaro Island where I worked for two autumns. The secret, other than having beautiful, small and fragrant roses to begin with, is in massaging the petals with a bit of the sugar and the lemon juice until almost a pulp to release the essential oils.

As the vet tech continues talking, the orange tabby cat remains seated on the table, calmly observing its surroundings. The cat has come to the veterinary clinic today for its annual physical examination, and the vet tech is meticulously documenting its medical history, ensuring that all vaccinations and preventive treatments are up-to-date. The clinic is a bustling environment, filled with other pets and their owners waiting to be attended to. The vet tech speaks gently to the cat, trying to establish a rapport to help soothe any potential anxiety it may be feeling. With an expert hand, the vet tech gently pets the cat, checking for any signs of discomfort or unease. Sensing the cat's relaxed state, the vet tech proceeds with the initial examination, looking for any abnormalities in its coat, eyes, ears, and teeth. Throughout the evaluation, the cat remains remarkably cooperative, allowing the vet tech to carry out her duties without issue. The vet tech checks the feline's heart rate, respiratory rate, and overall body condition. Once she has finished with the basic assessment, she takes a small blood sample from the cat's leg, which will be sent to a laboratory for further testing. As the vet tech finishes with the blood sample, she returns her focus to the cat, carefully reviewing its medical records and discussing the information with the pet owner. The owner listens attentively, nodding in understanding as they voice any concerns they may have regarding their pet's health or behavior. The vet tech attentively addresses each query, providing insights and advice based on her extensive knowledge of feline health and wellness. The cat remains unperturbed by the conversation, watching the vet tech and the owner exchange thoughts and ideas. The pet owner, eager to ensure their companion's continued health, agrees with the vet tech's recommendations for preventative treatments and vaccination schedules. The orange tabby cat, keeping a watchful eye on its owner and the vet tech, appears satisfied with the progress of its visit. As their time at the clinic comes to an end, the vet tech gives the orange tabby cat one last gentle stroke and a few words of praise before returning it to its carrier. The pet owner, feeling reassured by the thorough examination and the advice they received, expresses their gratitude to the vet tech before settling their bill and preparing to leave the clinic. The orange tabby cat, now nestled comfortably inside its carrier, casts one final glance towards the vet tech as they saunter toward the exit, the first steps of the journey to maintaining a healthy and happy life together."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What was the last name of the person who was a founder of the Group of Seven? from the following article ?  In October, MacDonald introduced Thomson to Dr. James MacCallum. A frequent visitor to the Ontario Society of Artists' (OSA) exhibitions, MacCallum was admitted to the Arts and Letters Club in January 1912. There, he met artists such as John William Beatty, Arthur Heming, MacDonald and Harris. MacCallum eventually persuaded Thomson to leave Rous and Mann and start a painting career. In October 1913, MacCallum introduced Thomson to A. Y. Jackson, later a founder of the Group of Seven. MacCallum recognized Thomson's and Jackson's talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time. MacCallum and Jackson both encouraged Thomson to \\"take up painting seriously, [but] he showed no enthusiasm. The chances of earning a livelihood by it did not appear to him promising. He was sensitive and independent, and feared he might become an object of patronage.\\" MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson's sketches, he recognized their \\"truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland ... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places.\\" He described Thomson's paintings as \\"dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects\\". After Thomson's death, MacCallum helped preserve and advocate for his work.Thomson accepted MacCallum's offer under the same terms offered to Jackson. He travelled around Ontario with his colleagues, especially to the wilderness of Ontario, which was to become a major source of inspiration. Regarding Algonquin Park, he wrote in a letter to MacCallum: \\"The best I can do does not do the place much justice in the way of beauty.\\" He ventured to rural areas near Toronto and tried to capture the surrounding nature.

Please answer the following question: Factories around the world produce lots of CFCs which deplete the ozone layer. One year a large number of these factories decided they would implement efforts to reduce the amount of CFCs they release into the atmosphere. As a result the depletion of the ozone layer greatly decreased. However, the companies realized that this was hurting profits too much and reverted their decision. As a result the ozone layer began to rapidly deplete again.  Will reducing the amount of CFCs released into the atmosphere increase or decrease ozone depletion?  Hint: Beginning in the late 1970’s, ozone depletion was recognized as a significant environmental issue. The most dramatic decrease in ozone occurs seasonally over the continent of Antarctica. The size and duration of the ozone hole steadily increased, with the largest hole recorded in 2006. Fortunately, most countries have recognized the danger of CFCs and dramatically curtailed their use in recent years. It is hoped that ozone depletion will slow and that the ozone layer may eventually be restored to its earlier levels. Answer:","output":"Reducing the amount of CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) released into the atmosphere will significantly decrease ozone depletion. CFCs are chemical compounds that were once commonly used in refrigeration, air conditioning, aerosol sprays, and various industrial processes. They have been identified as one of the main culprits in the depletion of the ozone layer, which is a vital component of Earth's atmosphere that helps to protect life on the planet from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Ozone depletion first became a prominent environmental issue in the late 1970s, when scientists observed a sizeable decline in stratospheric ozone concentrations, particularly in the polar regions and especially over Antarctica. The most dramatic decrease in ozone occurs seasonally over Antarctica, with the ozone \\"hole\\" reaching its largest size on record in 2006. The connection between CFCs and the ozone layer damage was firmly established by the scientific community, leading to global efforts to phase out the use of CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances. The pivotal international agreement was the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which has been overwhelmingly successful in reducing CFC production and consumption worldwide. As a result, ozone depletion has slowed, and there is evidence of gradual ozone layer recovery. Returning to the scenario in question: when the factories decided to reduce the amount of CFCs they released into the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer greatly decreased, because there were fewer ozone-depleting substances in the atmosphere to cause damage. However, when the companies reverted to their previous practices, the ozone layer once again began to rapidly deplete due to the reintroduction of larger amounts of these harmful substances. In conclusion, reducing the amount of CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances released into the atmosphere will lead to a decrease in ozone depletion, thereby allowing the ozone layer to recover and better shield Earth's inhabitants from harmful UV radiation. Continued efforts to adhere to international agreements such as the Montreal Protocol are crucial for addressing this global environmental challenge and securing a healthier future for our planet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a goal: Take family picture How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of taking a family picture, follow these steps: 1. Plan the location and date for the photoshoot:    Decide on a location that has significance to your family, offers a visually appealing background, or has good lighting that will complement your pictures. This could be anywhere from your home, a local park, or a known landmark. Choose a date that works for all family members involved and consider the weather forecast to avoid potential issues on the day of the photoshoot. 2. Choose the theme and attire:    Discuss with your family if you want to have a specific theme for the photoshoot, such as casual, formal, or holiday-based. Coordinate outfits in advance by picking a color scheme or style that is complementary to the theme and location. Make sure everyone's outfits are comfortable and flattering for the camera. 3. Gather photography equipment:    Ensure you have all necessary photography equipment, such as a camera, tripod, external flash, and extra batteries or chargers. Additionally, bring along props or additional accessories that align with your chosen theme, if needed. 4. Set up the equipment:    On the day of the photoshoot, arrive early to set up your camera on a tripod and ensure it is at the appropriate height and angle for the most effective framing. Test the lighting conditions and make necessary adjustments to the camera settings to capture the optimal exposure. If needed, set up an external flash to balance and enhance lighting. 5. Arrange family members:    Position your family members in a visually appealing formation within the frame. Balance the composition by distributing height, color, and relationships evenly. If you have a large group, consider arranging people in layers or using props to create depth within the picture. 6. Test the camera:    Take a few test shots to ensure your camera settings are appropriate for the lighting and location. Make any necessary adjustments to the focus, aperture, shutter speed, and ISO settings for optimal quality. 7. Use a self-timer or a remote shutter release:    If you want to be in the family picture too, use your camera's self-timer function or invest in a remote shutter release. This will allow you to set the timer, join the group, and be present in the shot without having to touch the camera. 8. Take multiple shots:    Capture several pictures to increase the chances of getting the perfect family photo. Encourage natural expressions, interactions, and smiles to create a more genuine and relaxed result. 9. Review and select the best images:    After the photoshoot, review the images with your family and select the best shots for sharing or printing. Check for details such as facial expressions, composition, and focus to ensure the chosen images are of high quality. 10. Edit and share:    Use photo-editing software to enhance the chosen images by adjusting color, brightness, contrast, and cropping, if needed. Share the final family pictures with friends and family through social media, email, or by printing physical copies to display in your home.     With careful planning, coordination, and attention to detail, you will be able to accomplish the goal of taking a beautiful family picture that captures treasured memories for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Greece is a southeastern European country located on the Mediterranean, and thus the most likely place for someone of Greek origin to come into contact with a shark would be the Mediterranean Sea. The other options are not in line with common sense for the following reasons: 1. Pool hall: It is highly unlikely to find a shark in a pool hall, as these establishments are dedicated to billiards and other cue sports, and not to housing marine life. 2. Seafood restaurant: While it is possible to find various types of seafood in a restaurant, including shark meat, it is improbable to see a live shark in such a setting. Restaurants are dedicated to serving prepared dishes and not typically suited for displaying live aquatic creatures. 3.

The population is 60,560 in 2016, an increase from the 2010 census, up from 45,256 in 2000 census. Redmond is commonly recognized as the home of Microsoft and Nintendo of America. With an annual bike race on city streets and the state's only velodrome, Redmond is also known as the \\"Bicycle Capital of the Northwest\\".  - An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. All computer programs, excluding firmware, require an operating system to function.  - Money laundering is the process of transforming the profits of crime and corruption into ostensibly 'legitimate' assets. In a number of legal and regulatory systems, however, the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial and business crime, and is sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system (involving things such as securities, digital currencies, credit cards, and traditional currency), including terrorism financing and evasion of international sanctions. Most anti-money laundering laws openly conflate money laundering (which is concerned with \\"source\\" of funds) with terrorism financing (which is concerned with \\"destination\\" of funds) when regulating the financial system.  - Internet Explorer (formerly Microsoft Internet Explorer and Windows Internet Explorer, commonly abbreviated IE or MSIE) is a discontinued series of graphical web browsers developed by Microsoft and included as part of the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, starting in 1995. It was first released as part of the add-on package Plus! for Windows 95 that year. Later versions were available as free downloads, or in service packs, and included in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) service releases of Windows 95 and later versions of Windows.  - Robert Alan Soloway is the founder of the so - called \`\` Strategic Partnership Against Microsoft Illegal Spam , '' or SPAMIS , but is said to be one of the Internet 's biggest spammers through his company , Newport Internet Marketing ( NIM ) . He was arrested on May 30 , 2007 , after a grand jury indicted him on charges of identity theft , money laundering , and mail , wire , and e-mail fraud . He was nicknamed the \`\` Spam King '' by prosecutors .  - In common usage, theft is the taking of another person's property or services without that person's permission or consent with the intent to deprive the rightful owner of it. The word is also used as an informal shorthand term for some crimes against property, such as burglary, embezzlement, larceny, looting, robbery, shoplifting, library theft, and fraud (\\"i.e.\\", obtaining money under false pretenses). In some jurisdictions, theft is considered to be synonymous with larceny; in others, theft has replaced larceny. Someone who carries out an act of or makes a career of theft is known as a thief. The act of theft is also known by other terms such as stealing, thieving, and filching.  - Consumer electronics or home electronics are electronic or digital equipment intended for everyday use, typically in private homes. Consumer electronics include devices used for entertainment (flatscreen TVs, DVD players, DVD movies, iPods, video games, remote control cars, etc.), communications (telephones, cell phones, e-mail-capable laptops, etc.), and home-office activities (e.g., desktop computers, printers, paper shredders, etc.). In British English, they are often called brown goods by producers and sellers, to distinguish them from \\"white goods\\" such as washing machines and refrigerators. In the 2010s, this distinction is not always present in large big box consumer electronics stores, such as Best Buy, which sell both entertainment, communications, and home office devices and kitchen appliances such as refrigerators. Consumer electronics stores differ from professional audio stores in that the former sells consumer-grade electronics for private use, whereas the latter sells professional-grade electronics designed for use by audio engineers and audio technicians.  - Identity theft is the deliberate use of someone else's identity, usually as a method to gain a financial advantage or obtain credit and other benefits in the other person's name, and perhaps to the other person's disadvantage or loss. The person whose identity has been assumed may suffer adverse consequences if they are held responsible for the perpetrator's actions. Identity theft occurs when someone uses another's personally identifying information, like their name, identifying number, or credit card number, without their permission, to commit fraud or other crimes. The term \\"identity theft\\" was coined in 1964.  - A video game console is an electronic, digital or computer device that outputs a video signal or visual image to display a video game that one or more people can play.  - A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for retrieving, presenting and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web. An \\"information resource\\" is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI/URL) that may be a web page, image, video or other piece of content. Hyperlinks present in resources enable users easily to navigate their browsers to related resources.  - Microsoft Windows (or simply Windows) is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. It consists of several families of operating systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry with the OS typically associated with IBM PC compatible architecture. Active Windows families include Windows NT, Windows Embedded and Windows Phone; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE) or Windows Server. Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x; Windows 10 Mobile is an active product, unrelated to the defunct family Windows Mobile.  - A court is a tribunal, often as a government institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law. In both common law and civil law legal systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all persons have an ability to bring their claims before a court. Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court.  - Microsoft Corporation (commonly referred to as Microsoft or MS) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington, that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics and personal computers and services. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, Microsoft Office office suite, and Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface tablet lineup. As of 2016, it was the world's largest software maker by revenue, and one of the world's most valuable companies.  - In law, fraud is deliberate deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain, or to deprive a victim of a legal right. Fraud itself can be a civil wrong (i.e., a fraud victim may sue the fraud perpetrator to avoid the fraud and/or recover monetary compensation), a criminal wrong (i.e., a fraud perpetrator may be prosecuted and imprisoned by governmental authorities) or it may cause no loss of money, property or legal right but still be an element of another civil or criminal wrong. The purpose of fraud may be monetary gain or other benefits, such as obtaining a driver's license or qualifying for a mortgage by way of false statements.  - Terrorism financing refers to activities that provides financing or financial support to individual terrorists or terrorist groups. A government that maintains a list of terrorist organizations normally will also pass laws to prevent money laundering being used to finance those organizations.  - Grand jury is a legal body empowered to conduct official proceedings and investigate potential criminal conduct, and determine whether criminal charges should be brought. A grand jury may compel the production of documents and compel sworn testimony of witnesses to appear before it. Grand jury is separate from the courts, which do not preside over its functioning.  - Law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.

Pavel Nedved (Czech pronunciation: ['pavel 'nedvjet] ( listen); born 30 August 1972) is a Czech retired footballer who played as a midfielder. Described as one of the best footballers of his generation, he is also regarded as one of the most successful players to emerge from the Czech Republic, winning domestic and European accolades with Italian clubs Lazio, including the last Cup Winners' Cup, and Juventus, whom he led to the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final. Nedved was a key member of the Czech team which reached the final of Euro 1996, during which he attracted international attention. He also captained the national team at UEFA Euro 2004, where they were defeated in the semi-final by eventual champions Greece, and Nedved was named as part of the Team of the Tournament. Nedved made his league debut for Lazio on 7 September 1996 in a 1-0 away defeat against Bologna. He scored his first league goal for the club against Cagliari on 20 October 1996, finishing the 1996-97 season with seven goals. He became an integral part of the side, scoring four goals in three matches early in the 1997-98 season. The club had a 24-match unbeaten streak from November 1997 to April 1998, ending with a league match against Juventus in which Nedved was sent off. That season, Lazio won the 1997-98 Coppa Italia and reached the final of the 1997-98 UEFA Cup. Nedved and Lazio began the 1998-99 season with a victory in the Supercoppa Italiana, Nedved scoring as the club defeated Juventus 2-1. He played a role in Lazio's road to the last-ever Cup Winners' Cup, scoring against Lausanne in the first round and in both legs of Lazio's 7-0 aggregate quarter-final victory over Panionios. In the 1999 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final, Nedved scored the decisive goal against Mallorca for Lazio's 2-1 win. This proved to be the last goal of the tournament, which was later discontinued.  Nedved was one of the ten highest-paid footballers in the Italian league in 1999. He played in the 1999 UEFA Super Cup against Manchester United at the beginning of the season, where Lazio won the match by a single goal. The club went on to win the Serie A title and Coppa Italia, completing a domestic double in 2000 with Nedved's help. In 2000, he won the Supercoppa Italiana with Lazio for a second time. With Sinisa Mihajlovic, Nedved was one of two Lazio players sent off in the quarter-final of the 2000 Coppa Italia held in December, where the defending champions lost 5-3 on aggregate to Udinese.  Nedved played UEFA Champions League football with Lazio, scoring against Real Madrid in a 2-2 draw in the second group stage before the Italian side was eliminated. In Lazio's final Champions League match of the season, Nedved was criticised by Leeds United manager David O'Leary for a challenge on Alan Maybury (although the referee did not call a foul), and he received a three-match suspension from European competitions from UEFA.  Despite Nedved's signing a new four-year contract with Lazio in April 2001, the club tried to sell him and teammate Juan Sebastian Veron that summer, triggering fan protests against club chairman Sergio Cragnotti. The players were ultimately sold to Juventus and Manchester United respectively.","output":"This text is about Pavel Nedved, a retired Czech footballer who played as a midfielder."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The most important holiday in spring, especially for Christians , is Easter. This Christian holiday is not on the same date every year, but it's always on a Sunday. It can be any Sunday between March 22 and April 25. Many people celebrate Easter by buying new clothes. Children celebrate by hunting for color1ed eggs that their parents have hidden around the house. People also give Easter baskets filled with candy and other goodies to one another to celebrate the day.      But the holiday is more than new clothes and good things to eat. On Easter, many people go to church to celebrate Jesus' resurrection from the dead.      Most people color1 them. Some people hide them. Others just eat them. But no matter what one does with Easter eggs, they are an important Easter tradition throughout the Western world.      People from many different cultures celebrate Easter. In both America and Belgium, children look for Easter eggs hidden on lawns and in bushes. In America, children believe the eggs are hidden by the Easter bunny . But in Belgium, the hidden eggs are supposed to have fallen from church bells. In Bulgaria, red Easter eggs are lucky in churches; Bulgarian families also hit these Easter eggs together to see whose is the strongest. The winner looks forward to good fortune that year. Still dozens of other Easter traditions exist. In parts of Austria, for example, children sing from door to door and are rewarded with color1ful eggs.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Clearly, if you can fly or lift extremely heavy objects, you're not awake. Keep in mind, however, that a lucid dreaming state can be a good way to practice actual physical actions that can help you in the real world. Some health care professionals use it to help people recovering from injuries envision their bodies recovering. The following abilities, however, are symptomatic of dreams. Test your abilities as follows:  Try to levitate or float. If you can, you're in a dream state. Can you speak normally? If your voice is extremely croaky or not coming from your mouth at all, you're more than likely dreaming (it could also mean laryngitis, but it's probably a dream if your throat doesn't feel sore). Another dream sign is if your voice is way too high or low or is in a different accent. Try jumping on the spot. Can you jump over the moon, or maintain a jump for an abnormally long period of time? Or did you jump straight up and then land on Earth with a thud? Are you able to shift objects across a room or area without going near them? Can you switch appliances and lights on and off with thoughts alone? In addition, note that the level of light will rarely change as a result of flipping a switch in a dream state. Be aware that not every lucid dreaming advocate believes that this is a reliable test - for some dreamers, nothing changes when a light is switched on and off. Can you make objects appear before you just by wishing? Can you breathe underwater or teleport? If so, then you must be dreaming. Do you have superpowers with the 'excuse' being you've always had them but you forgot? Do you seem perfectly normal, but weird things happen with location? For example, if you're walking around the streets of Paris, but get lost and end up in New York, then you must be dreaming. Have you forgotten how to do normal things? (like suddenly not knowing how to write your name or even speak). Are you doing something ridiculous? For example, trying to fix a leaky tap with a spatula, trying to hold up a supermarket for no reason, or peeing in public for no reason. Likewise, if you are doing something ridiculous, does nobody seem surprised? Similar to the toilet dream mentioned below, sometimes in dreams, people pee and yet still feel like they have to pee. In real life, this could mean you have a U.T.I, but if you seem fine otherwise, this could be a dream sign. Are you younger or older than you should be? Are you pregnant even though you haven't had unprotected sex recently if ever or are even a virgin? A good test of whether or not you're dreaming is if your usual waking habits distort or are inconsistent with what is normally done. For example, if you usually turn the key once to unlock a door but your dream has you turning it three times despite the fact that this would not be possible in waking life, then you have a sign that you're dreaming. Test this while awake. Read the paper, look away, then come back to it again and read it. Hopefully the text has stayed the same! The point of this is to reinforce this as an action for your mind whether or not it is dreaming. In dreams, reading is difficult as the words become distorted. Try looking away from the text and then looking back again; if it's a dream, there is a high likelihood that the text will have morphed into something else.  Keep something to read next to your bed. If you have just finished a lucid dream, it's possible that you're still dreaming. If not, and you're actually awake, you can read the text next to the bed. Look at a digital watch or clock. This is a variant on the text distortion - again, if the digital numbers blur, change, or make no sense, then you're probably dreaming.  Check complex patterns, another variant of text and clocks. Summary:","output":"The article discusses various tests and signs to determine if one is in a lucid dream state, such as levitation, voice changes, superpowers, and inconsistencies in reality, along with tips to practice these tests in waking life to reinforce their effectiveness in dreams."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The question at hand asks why the narrator's friend is always picking up the phone. While the passage does not explicitly state the reason, we can gather evidence and make an informed assumption. First, as the passage mentions that the friend is attentive and looks out for the narrator, the reason for picking up the phone could be related to a strong sense of responsibility towards the welfare of those around him. By answering the phone, he ensures that he is always available for his loved ones in case they need immediate assistance or emotional support. Second, as the friend seems to put considerable effort into making sure that everyone in their company enjoys themselves, it is likely that picking up the phone is another way they maintain strong connections and good relationships. In other words, he probably values communication and actively tries to address any concerns or resolve issues that may arise among his friends, keeping any potential negative feelings at bay. Finally, the fact that the narrator believes it's \\"literally impossible to have a bad time with him\\" suggests that answers his phone could also be a part of his overall pleasing personality. He may genuinely enjoy being sociable and always wants to be available when people need him. In conclusion, though the passage does not explicitly indicate why the narrator's friend always picks up the phone, it can be inferred from the evidence provided that it is due to his attentive nature, his focus on maintaining strong connections and good relationships with others, and his generally sociable and pleasing personality."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Nine Inch Nails, an industrial rock band fronted by Trent Reznor, has toured all over the world since its creation in 1988. While Reznor—the only official member until adding Atticus Ross in 2016—controls its creative and musical direction in the studio, the touring band performs different arrangements of the songs. In addition to regular concerts, the band has performed in both supporting and headlining roles at festivals such as Woodstock '94, Lollapalooza 1991 and 2008, and many other one-off performances including the MTV Video Music Awards. Prior to their 2013 tour, the band had played 938 gigs.Nine Inch Nails' live performances contrast with its in-studio counterpart. Reznor writes and performs nearly all Nine Inch Nails studio material, with occasional instrumental and vocal contributions from others artists. However, Reznor has typically assembled groups of backing musicians to interpret songs for tours and other live performances. Keyboardist Alessandro Cortini said that \\"if you see the show and you're used to the CDs it's pretty clear that the studio entity is different from the live entity\\".The only constant member of the live band is Reznor.  Live Nine Inch Nails performances are typically accompanied by lighting, stage, and video projection effects. Since 1999, the visual design components of live shows have been curated by Reznor with Rob Sheridan. Three tours have been chronicled on live albums and tour documentaries. Critical and commercial response to Nine Inch Nails live performances has generally been positive. Critics have pointed to the concerts' aggressive on-stage dynamic and visual designs as high points.

This surge in optimism has invigorated investors, eager to capitalize on potential gains and to support the American economy as it navigates through these unprecedented times. Emergence of Hope: The potential financial rescue plan, which is currently in the works, aims to achieve two primary objectives: to stabilize the U.S. economy and to aid those who have been hit the hardest by the pandemic. The very announcement of such a proposal has boosted the morale of citizens and investors alike, fostering a sense of unity and collective effort in tackling the challenges at hand. Ripple Effect on the Stock Market: The hope generated from this proposed rescue package has had a profound impact on the stock market. As investors continue to exhibit enthusiasm and confidence, the value of U.S. stocks is observing an upward trajectory. This positive sentiment is further strengthened by assurances from the government and other financial institutions, which reinforces the belief that the U.S. economy will soon rebound and enter a period of recovery. Sector-Wise Impact: The prospect of a financial rescue plan has benefited a wide range of sectors within the stock market. Industries, such as technology, finance, and leisure, have witnessed significant growth due to the increased spending power of consumers and the expectation of the pending economic turnaround. Additionally, small businesses and airline industries, touted as some of the most vulnerable entities during these difficult times, can hope for considerable relief and support through such a rescue plan. Roles of the Federal Reserve and Government: The Federal Reserve has an undeniably crucial role to play in implementing a financial rescue package aimed at stabilizing the U.S. economy and steering it towards a brighter future. In tandem with governmental support, the Federal Reserve must propose and execute monetary policies that uphold financial stability, create opportunities for economic growth, and ensure access to credit for dependable institutions. Conclusion: The U.S. stock market's recent rally represents an inspiring demonstration of how hope and confidence in a financial rescue plan can draw investors together and contribute to the country's economic recovery. As the government and financial institutions finalize and fine-tune this rescue package, the unwavering support of investors will continue to prove invaluable in restoring the economy and easing the lives of those most affected by the pandemic's challenges.

The answer is yes. Lightning is a form of static discharge. It is much more dramatic than what happens between you and the door knocker, but it is the same principle. You can see how it occurs in the following diagram and animation. You have no doubt seen lightning in a rainstorm. What does lighting have to do with static electricity? As it turns out, everything! During a rainstorm, clouds develop regions of different charges. This happens due to the movement of air molecules, water drops, and ice particles. The negative charges are concentrated at the base of the clouds. The positive charges are concentrated at the top. The negative charges repel electrons on the ground below. The ground then becomes positively charged. Over time the differences increase. Eventually the electrons are discharged. This is what we see as lightning. You can watch an awesome slow-motion lightning strike below.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What are two examples of static discharge?\\" is \\"Wind motion\\"?","output":"The paragraph does not suggest that \\"wind motion\\" is an example of static discharge. The two examples provided in the paragraph are:  1. Lightning: A large-scale and dramatic example of static discharge occurring in a natural environment, especially during thunderstorms. Lightning happens when the electrical charge differences between the base and the top of the clouds become large enough that circuits between them can be completed through the air. This results in a discharge of energy in the form of lightning. 2. The small-scale static discharge that happens between a person and a door knocker: This is a more commonplace example of static discharge. It occurs when, for instance, a person walks across a carpet and accumulates a buildup of static electricity on their body. Upon touching a metal object like a door knocker, the person experiences a sudden discharge or a small electric shock as the electrons are released and electrical equilibrium is restored. In summary, the two examples of static discharge provided are lightning and the small-scale static discharge between a person and a door knocker, not \\"wind motion.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which year started a period in which Ernst Wigforss was Minister for Finance in Sweden for only 1 year?","output":"Title: The Year that Marked Ernst Wigforss's Brief Tenure as Minister for Finance in Sweden Introduction Ernst Wigforss was a prominent Swedish socialist, economist, and political figure who significantly influenced Sweden's economic policies during the first half of the 20th century. As a representative of the social democratic party, he served as the Minister for Finance in Sweden on several occasions. Despite his distinguished career, there was a period in which he held the position for just a single year. This article delves into the year that started this brief period in Ernst Wigforss's political career. The Notable Year: 1925 Ernst Wigforss first became Sweden's Minister for Finance in October 1925, during the reign of Hjalmar Branting's third cabinet. This period lasted for merely six months, as the government faced significant challenges, both internally and externally. While this term was brief, it marked the beginning of Wigforss's long-lasting influence on Swedish economic policy. Background and Political Rise of Ernst Wigforss Born on January 17, 1881, in Halmstad, Ernst Wigforss showed a keen interest in academics, particularly literature, philosophy, and linguistics. He completed his Ph.D. in theoretical philosophy in 1907 at Lund University. Wigforss's passion for social and economic justice led him to join the Swedish Social Democratic Party in 1913, and he was elected to the Riksdag, Sweden's national legislature, in 1918. In the subsequent years, Wigforss emerged as one of the leading figures within the Swedish social democratic movement. He helped shape the party's economic policies, which were rooted in his commitment to promoting social welfare, fostering cooperation between labor and capital, and advancing progressive taxation. Challenges Faced During Wigforss's Brief Tenure as Minister for Finance in 1925 Ernst Wigforss's entry as Minister for Finance in 1925 came at a time when Sweden's economy faced considerable challenges. Among these were the dangers posed by the hyperinflation that had plagued many European nations following the end of the First World War. Additionally, Sweden's export-oriented economy was suffering from a lack of competitiveness in the international markets. During his year-long tenure, Wigforss introduced emergency measures to address these issues, including raising taxes and coordinating austerity measures. He also played a pivotal role in the establishment of the Unemployment Assistance Act (Arbetslöshetsunderstödslagen) of 1923, which became a cornerstone of Sweden's welfare policies. While these actions aimed to stabilize the Swedish economy, the political climate was tumultuous, causing the minority government to struggle. In April 1926, Wigforss's first term as the Minister for Finance came to an end when the government ultimately fell. Political Legacy and Later Tenure Though Ernst Wigforss's initial tenure as Minister for Finance was short-lived, he continued to play a significant role in shaping Sweden's economy, serving as Minister for Finance again from 1932 to 1949 under various governments. He is best known for his efforts to implement Keynesian economic policies, which helped shape the foundation of the Swedish Welfare State. His visions for social equity and economic stability, coupled with his systematic approach to policymaking, contributed to transforming Sweden into one of the leading examples of a modern, inclusive society. Conclusion The year 1925 marked the beginning of a brief yet noteworthy period in Ernst Wigforss's political career as Minister for Finance in Sweden. Despite lasting for only one year, this period set a precedent for Wigforss's subsequent influence on the nation's economic policies, culminating in a legacy that still resonates in Sweden's commitment to social justice and economic progress."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It reports that Conor McGregor, an Irish fighter, suffered his first defeat since 2010 when American Nate Diaz forced him to submit in the second round of their fight. Despite his loss, McGregor vowed to return and face future challenges like a champion. In another unexpected turn of events, the article highlights the defeat of Holly Holm, the women's bantamweight champion and former boxer. Holm had previously stunned the MMA world by defeating the previously undefeated Ronda Rousey in November, securing the title for herself. However, Holm was choked unconscious by her fellow American fighter, Miesha Tate, in the fifth round of their bout. Tate praised Holm's fighting spirit, stating that she went out like a true champion and that she has the utmost respect for her. The article also mentions that McGregor had been on the cusp of making history as the first UFC fighter to hold two world titles simultaneously. This potential milestone was thwarted when his scheduled opponent, Brazilian Rafael dos Anjos, had to withdraw due to injury, leading to Diaz filling in. McGregor managed to land heavy blows on Diaz in the first round of their fight, but Diaz countered with a strong punch in the second round, leaving McGregor unable to regain control of the match. From there, Diaz forced McGregor into submission with a choke hold.

I have a few things to say , though . First off , I love how instantly supportive everyone is to the ladies seeking advice on here . Question: What may be the reason for their support of the group ?","output":"There could be multiple reasons that contribute to the instant support for women seeking advice in the group, which include empathy, shared experiences and understanding, a sense of community, the virtual environment, and a desire to help others. Let’s break down each of these factors in more detail. 1. Empathy: One reason for the instant support could be the presence of empathy in the members of the group. Oftentimes, people can relate to the struggles faced by others and understand their situation on an emotional level. This empathy makes them more compassionate and responsive, offering support and encouragement to those who need it. 2. Shared experiences and understanding: When individuals have experienced similar situations or faced similar challenges, it creates a bond between them. This bond often results in an almost instinctive understanding of what the other person is going through. Group members who have faced similar challenges can provide more meaningful and practical advice, making it easier for them to extend their support to others in need. 3. Sense of community: The group may have fostered a sense of community among its members, which is crucial for providing support and maintaining a positive environment. When people feel that they are part of a community, they are more likely to help one another and offer support when needed. This is especially important for women, as they might face unique challenges that only their peers can understand and provide guidance on. 4. Virtual environment: Online platforms and groups offer a certain level of anonymity and a sense of safety, which makes it easier for individuals to open up and share their experiences. When someone seeks advice in a virtual setting, it can be much less intimidating than doing so in-person. This allows for more people to feel comfortable offering their support and encouragement. 5. Desire to help others: Many individuals have a natural inclination to help others when they see someone struggling. They may have benefited from support in the past and want to pay it forward or simply derive a sense of satisfaction from being able to lend a hand. This instinct to help others can be a driving force behind the almost immediate support seen in the group. In conclusion, the reasons for the instant support provided to women seeking advice in the group can be attributed to a combination of empathy, shared experiences, a sense of community, the virtual environment, and an inherent desire to help others. It is the interplay of these factors that contributes to the positive and supportive atmosphere within the group, encouraging members to provide assistance and advice to those in need."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the below context:  There was considerable local opposition to the Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872 by Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano, the first overseer and controller of the park. Langford served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection.   This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior and correctly predicted that Yellowstone would become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1874, both Langford and Delano advocated the creation of a federal agency to protect the vast park, but Congress refused. In 1875, Colonel William Ludlow, who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of George Armstrong Custer, was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone National Park.

Amy was emotional because she had PMS but Christine did not.","output":"Amy sat on the couch, tears streaming down her cheeks, as she clutched a tub of chocolate ice cream in her hands. Christine, her roommate and best friend, was seated next to her, expression expectant and understanding as she offered a comforting presence without prying. Step 1: Establish that Amy is emotional due to PMS. Justification: The story setup states that Amy is emotional because she has PMS. Step 2: Showcase their differing emotional states. Justification: The story setup highlights the differences between Amy and Christine's emotional experiences. Amy's emotions were all over the place lately, making her feel like a rollercoaster was running through her mind. Her sudden bouts of tearfulness and irritability were taking a toll on her confidence, making her question if she was overreacting to everyday situations. Christine, on the other hand, seemed to remain fairly even-keeled, her mood stable and unaffected by hormonal fluctuations. Step 3: Acknowledge the shared living situation. Justification: To emphasize the closeness and importance of their friendship, acknowledging that they are roommates adds depth to their relationship. However, Christine had experienced similar emotional turbulence before and was empathetic to Amy's current state. She had learned over time that sometimes the best way to help a friend in distress was to simply be there for them, providing a shoulder to lean on. Step 4: Show Christine's empathy and understanding of Amy's situation. Justification: Developing Christine's character and demonstrating the strength of their friendship by showing that she is attuned to Amy's emotions and invested in helping her. \\"Hey,\\" Christine said, softly rubbing Amy's back. \\"Why don't we watch your favorite movie? Maybe it will take your mind off things for a little while.\\" Amy sniffled, wiping her tears away with the back of her hand and looking up at her friend. \\"Thanks, Christine. You always know how to help me feel better.\\" Step 5: Have Christine offer comfort and support to Amy. Justification: Pivoting from the problem to a solution, Christine suggests an activity to lift Amy's spirits, further highlighting their bond and her understanding of Amy's needs. They settled in to watch the movie, the familiarity of the shared experience bringing a sense of comfort and warmth to the room. As time went on, Amy's laughter slowly returned, and her tears subsided. Thanks to Christine's steadfast support, she was reminded that she had someone she could always rely on during the tough moments life threw her way. Step 6: Conclude the story with the beginnings of a resolution. Justification: Bringing the story to a comforting and reassuring resolution showcases the power of friendship and understanding in helping someone navigate difficult emotional situations like PMS."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: As you begin to answer the question, focus on how you match with the company overall. That is, talk about your years of experience and the objective ways that you can talk about how you were valued at your last company. For instance, you could talk about how you were the youngest person in a managerial position at your last company, as it shows the company that you could handle the position. Three achievement-based examples will show that you are uniquely suited to the task. In addition, this approach will give your answer structure instead of letting your ramble through an answer.  Use the preparation you did before the interview to answer the questions. Try not to get flustered. Take a deep breath and give a brief but thorough answer. Don’t give canned answers. Once you know the facts of why you should be hired, try to approach it specifically, rather than generically.  For example, skip a generic answer, such as “An experienced manager will be better for employee morale and company growth.\\" Instead, try an answer like this one: “You should hire me because I have managed a team for 10 years. During my time managing, I have lowered employee turnover and increased productivity by 10 percent.” This response lists specific reasons why you're a good fit, matched up to what the company is asking for in the job description. When answering, don't focus on why you want the job or why you think the position would be good for you. Instead, put the attention on what you can give the company. That's what the interviewer wants to hear.  For instance, you may be tempted to say, \\"It's always been my dream to work for an art gallery.\\" Instead, say something to this effect: \\"I know many people want this position, but I have worked hard to be the best person for this job. From my degree in art history to my extensive internships in art galleries, I have the skill set needed to be useful to you.\\" Follow that statement with some of the skills you have picked up over the years. Take this time to use what you've learned in the interview. Connect your skills to what the company wants. Similarly, use the time to highlight aspects of your skills that the interviewer has overlooked.  For instance, maybe you heard that the company is really people-focused. Use the time to highlight your people skills with specific examples from your previous jobs. You could say something such as: \\"At my previous job, I handled all the service calls, and the numbers showed that customer satisfaction was up during my time there.\\" If the employer thinks you're overqualified, underqualified, or don't the right experience, take this time to reassure the interviewer that you're the right person for the job.  For instance, if it's evident the interviewer finds you overqualified, note that you are trying to make a new move in your career, and you're willing to start from the bottom.  If the person thinks you're underqualified, highlight other skills you have that would be relevant to the job.  If you haven't proven you have enough experience for this position, highlight other experience in your past that is relevant. In fact, you can make almost any experience relevant. Say you worked as a sales clerk at a store in the past. That may not seem relevant to an office job, but it gave you the skills to work diplomatically with a wide range of people. An elevator pitch is a sales pitch that will sell someone on your cause, even in the most limited of time frames. This question is usually asked at the end of the interview and possibly your last appeal to show you are a good fit. Sell yourself as if you have been designed to solve the company’s problem.  Stay on point. You may be tempted to tell everything you've ever done. However, tailoring it to the company will help you stay on task in addition to keeping the interviewer interested. Make sure your pitch isn't longer than two minutes.

Provide specific, achievement-based examples to demonstrate your value and prepare well for the interview to deliver a clear and concise response.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer:  Three days  for the following movie plot:  In the 19th-century American West, a young Kiger Mustang colt, Spirit, is born to a herd of horses. Spirit soon grows into a stallion, and assumes the role of leader of the herd, whose duty it is to keep the herd safe. Spirit is a courageous leader, but has great curiosity. Spotting a strange light one night not far from his herd, the stallion is unable to control his curiosity and investigates. He finds restrained, docile horses, and their human wranglers sleeping around a campfire. They wake up, and seeing him as a magnificent specimen, chase and capture him, taking him to a US cavalry post. At this time, the army is fighting the Indian Wars and taking over the soon-to-be western United States. Frightened and confused, Spirit sees horses used as 'slaves' all around him. There, he encounters \\"The Colonel\\", who decides to have the mustang tamed, refusing to believe the idea of Spirit being too stubborn, but Spirit manages to fight off all attempts to tame him. To weaken Spirit, The Colonel orders him tied to a post for three days with no food or water. Meanwhile, a Lakota Native American named Little Creek is also brought into the fort and held captive. Spirit is later supposedly broken in by the Colonel, who speaks his idea of how any wild horse can be tamed. However, Spirit gets a second wind and finally throws him off. When the Colonel gets frustrated and tries to shoot him, with Little Creek's help, they, along with other horses, escape the post. Little Creek's mare, Rain, meets them along with other natives who capture Spirit. After returning to the Lakota village, Little Creek tries to tame Spirit with kindness, but Spirit refuses to be ridden. Little Creek ties Spirit and Rain together and, when he tries to leave, she insists on staying, then shows him her world. Spirit begins to warm up to Little Creek and falls in love with the mare.

It can be hard for someone without an expertise in snakes to tell from only looking at a snake, so proceed with caution. If you suspect that a snake is venomous, do not try to catch it with your hands. Some of the most common U.S. based venomous snakes are:  Copperhead snakes. These are found most commonly in the eastern and mid-southern states. They get their name from unique copper colored scales on their head that slowly fade throughout the rest of their body.Their markings are often triangular in shape.   Cottonmouth snake.These are usually four to seven feet in length. They are generally a dark shade of brown or a dull black. They have pupils that are shaped like slits and have a bulky body. They are found predominantly in the southern U.S., throughout Florida and the Mississippi River region.   Diamondback Rattlesnake. These can grow up ten feet long. They are recognized by their distinctive black or brown diamond patterns down their bodies outlined in a light shade of yellow. They are a rattlesnake, and as that name implies, they have a series of hollow segments on the end of their tale that create a rattle sound when its shook. They live in the southern and south western parts of the U.S. and some of Mexico.   Coral snake. These snakes can be difficult to recognize since it resembles other similar species. They are found in the eastern, southwestern, and southeastern portions of the U.S. They can grow to be around thirty inches. They are universally a red-yellow-black-yellow pattern with black heads. They are venomous, so you should be very careful if you think you spot one. Catching a snake by hand is a little trickier, and should be done with caution. However, if you do not have any tools or nets handy, you can catch a snake using your hands. Use an object to distract the snake's head, like a stick. Firmly grasp its tail and lift the snake upwards, leaving the front part of its body on the ground, but keeping your legs and body as far away as possible. Place the snake in a pillow case or sack immediately.  If you know how to safely approach a snake, you can also grab the snake by the back of head to neutralize its chances of biting you. However, getting so close to the snake's head can be risky. If you use this method, it may be best to have a tool, such as a snake fork, that can pin the head down before you reach for it. Besides the risk of biting, snakes can also carry harmful bacteria. Make sure to use gloves to prevent your risk of catching a bacterial infection from the snake. If you do not have gloves, make sure to wash your hands thoroughly after touching the snake. Do not handle food or touch anyone else before you have washed your hands thoroughly.","output":"The article provides information on identifying venomous snakes in the U.S., including Copperheads, Cottonmouths, Diamondback Rattlesnakes, and Coral snakes, and offers safety advice on avoiding bites while attempting to catch a snake without any tools, using precautions like pinning its head down, wearing gloves, and washing hands thoroughly after handling."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Macroscopic refers to substances and objects that can be seen, touched, and measured directly. Microscopic refers to the small particles that make up all matter. Chemists must observe matter and do experiments macroscopically and then make generalizations and propose explanations that are microscopic in nature. For example, anyone can observe the physical change in appearance that occurs as an iron object such as a tractor that is left out in the elements gradually turns to rust. However, a chemist looks at the rusting tractor and thinks about what is going on with the individual atoms that make up the iron and how they are changing as a result of exposure to oxygen in the air and water from rain. Throughout your study of chemistry, you will often switch back and forth between the macroscopic and microscopic worlds.  Paragraph: Two cousins went to college to get a B.S.

Here's a step-by-step solution: 1. Simplify the equation: Given the equation: 62*q - 957 + 1701 = 0 First, combine the constant terms (-957 and 1701): -957 + 1701 = 744 So now we have: 62*q + 744 = 0 2.

We'll start by subtracting 744 from both sides of the equation: 62*q + 744 - 744 = 0 - 744 This simplifies to: 62*q = -744 3. Divide by 62 to solve for q: Now, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 62 to completely isolate q: (62*q) / 62 = (-744) / 62 Since 62/62 = 1, this simplifies to: q = -744 / 62 4.

If the weathering process is slower, then there will be LESS weathering occurring, as it will take a longer time for the rocks to break apart. Step 3: Analyze the influence of the supposed perturbation on the second effect mentioned. The second effect mentioned is the formation of cracks when rocks heat up. If rocks break down at a slower rate, it is likely that there will be less opportunity for cracks to form when rocks heat up. This would also contribute to the slowing down of the weathering process.

We have two terms with the variable s (-1194*s and -1192*s). We need to move one of these terms to the other side to isolate the variable s. Let's move -1192*s to the right side by adding 1192*s to both sides of the equation: -1194*s + 1192*s - 6 = -1192*s + 1192*s This simplifies to: -2*s - 6 = 0 Step 2: Remove any constants from the side containing the variable by performing the inverse operations. In our equation, we have a constant term -6. To remove this constant, we need to add 6 to both sides of the equation: -2*s - 6 + 6 = 0 + 6 This simplifies to: -2*s = 6 Step 3: Solve for the variable s by performing the inverse operations on the coefficients. We have a coefficient of -2 in front of the variable s.

The word evangelical (German: evangelisch), which refers to the gospel, was much more widely used for those involved in the religious movement. Nowadays, this word is still preferred among some of the historical Protestant denominations, above all the ones in the German-speaking area such as the EKD. The German word evangelisch means Protestant, and is different from the German evangelikal, which refers to churches shaped by Evangelicalism. The English word evangelical usually refers to Evangelical Protestant churches, and therefore not to Protestantism as a whole. It traces its roots back to the Puritans in England, where Evangelicalism originated, and then was brought to the United States.

Q: ['5615', '1559', 'L', 'v', 'A', 'd', '5093', 'C', 'B', 'n', '9477', '8269', 'O', 'A', '6521', 'C', '5281', 'L', '6393', 'q', 'g', '8439', 'b', '5315', 'j', 'r', '2643', '9655', 'x', 'I', 'w'] A:","output":"To solve this task I'll follow these steps : 1) Define a function that converts a character to its position in the English alphabet, 2) Loop over the list and apply this function to each of its elements, 3) If the element is not an alphabet letter, leave it unchanged. Now, solving the task : Step 1: Define a function converting an alphabet letter to a number The ASCII value of the uppercase 'A' is 65 and for the lowercase 'a' is 97. Considering this, if the ASCII value of a letter is larger/equal than 97, it means the letter is lowercase. If I subtract 96 from its ASCII value, I'll reach the position of the character in the English Alphabet. Similarly, if the ASCII value of the character is smaller than 97, it means the letter is uppercase and by subtracting 64, I'll reach its position. Here is the code representation of the above explanation: \`\`\` def char_to_num(char):     if ord(char) >= 97:         return ord(char) - 96     else:         return ord(char) - 64 \`\`\` The ord() function in Python gives us the ASCII value of a character.  Step 2 and step 3: Loop over the list and apply the conversion function We need a simple loop going through all elements in the list. For each element, I'll check if the element is an alphabet letter. If so, convert it. If not, keep it unchanged. Here's the code representation: \`\`\` for idx, value in enumerate(A):     if value.isalpha():         A[idx] = char_to_num(value) \`\`\` The complete code becomes: \`\`\` def char_to_num(char):     if ord(char) >= 97:         return ord(char) - 96     else:         return ord(char) - 64 A = ['5615', '1559', 'L', 'v', 'A', 'd', '5093', 'C', 'B', 'n', '9477', '8269', 'O', 'A', '6521', 'C', '5281', 'L', '6393', 'q', 'g', '8439', 'b', '5315', 'j', 'r', '2643', '9655', 'x', 'I', 'w'] for idx, value in enumerate(A):     if value.isalpha():         A[idx] = char_to_num(value) \`\`\` By running this code with the given list A as input, we convert the specified characters according to the position in the English alphabet, leaving the other characters as they are in the result final list.

Q:Given the background: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.  and the situation: Two cities situated on the shores of a large ocean polluted it in different ways.  Truck city had an economy that was based on tourism, while Farm city was based on agriculture.  Answer the following question: Which city caused fewer dead zones? A:","output":"To answer the question of which city caused fewer dead zones, we need to evaluate the pollution contributions of both Truck City and Farm City. Truck City: 1. Economy based on tourism 2. Possible pollution sources: marine litter from beach activities, waste from tourist boats, or land-based waste runoff from hotels and tourist accommodations. Farm City: 1. Economy based on agriculture 2. Possible pollution sources: fertilizers, pesticides, and livestock and human waste in rivers that flow into the ocean. From the background information, we know that the excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals, primarily agricultural fertilizers and waste from livestock and humans, lead to hypoxia and the creation of dead zones. Farm City's economy relies heavily on agriculture, which makes it a more significant contributor to oxygen-depleting chemicals in the marine environment. Truck City's pollution, on the other hand, is likely to be more focused on marine litter. While such litter could have negative effects on the ocean, it is not as directly linked to the creation of dead zones as agricultural pollutants. Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that Truck City caused fewer dead zones than Farm City, as its primary pollution source (marine litter) is less directly linked to the creation of dead zones compared to the agricultural pollution of Farm City."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The 37-year-old Krasovsky bravely declared, \\"I’m gay, and I’m just the same person as you,\\" putting his career at risk in exhibiting his solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community in a country where such an admission could come at a heavy price. Sadly, as expected, the footage of his announcement has since been deleted from the internet. The motivations behind Krasovsky's actions are clear and commendable. As a public figure, he chose to use his platform to challenge the homophobic attitudes and discriminatory laws pervasive in Russia. His decision to come out sent a powerful message to other LGBTQ+ individuals, both in Russia and abroad. Krasovsky's courage to take a stand against the status quo serves as a shining example for countless others in similar circumstances who may be silenced by fear. The impact of Anton Krasovsky's announcement cannot be underestimated. At a time when LGBTQ+ rights are under assault in Russia, it is paramount that the brave voices of public figures like Krasovsky reach the forefront of the conversation. With the country's law against \\"propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships,\\" signed by President Vladimir Putin in 2013, the LGBTQ+ community continues to be marginalized, and their rights are infringed upon. By coming out, Krasovsky took a defiant stand against this discriminatory legislation. The consequences Krasovsky faced following his announcement were severe. He was immediately fired from KontrTV and his public career significantly derailed. Despite the setback, Krasovsky remains actively involved in the LGBTQ+ rights movement in Russia. When LGBTQ+ individuals face harassment, discrimination, and even violence, Krasovsky's continued activism, and his dedication to the cause, cannot be understated. The deletion of the footage of Krasovsky's announcement is a testament to the challenges posed by an oppressive regime determined to suppress voices advocating for LGBTQ+ rights. Yet, Krasovsky's openness, resilience, and dauntlessness in the face of adversity have only invigorated his cause, inspiring support and admiration from both within and beyond Russia. His unwavering commitment and his public persona have undoubtedly touched the lives of many and further sparked conversations about LGBTQ+ rights in Russia and around the world. As we reflect on Anton Krasovsky's courageous move, it is essential to recognize the impact it has had, and continues to have, on the LGBTQ+ community worldwide. His selfless decision has allowed him to open doors for others, fostering individual growth and the motivation to enact change in the face of adversity. Anton Krasovsky's story serves as a reminder that the fight for LGBTQ+ rights is far from over – but that each act of bravery, each voice raised, brings us one step closer to a more inclusive, accepting, and equal world for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The match was filled with spectacular goals, dramatic moments, and standout performances from both sides. The Hammers proved once again that they are a force to be reckoned with, while also highlighting some vulnerabilities in the otherwise imperious Manchester City team. First Half: The first half saw a tightly contested battle between the two teams, with both sides creating multiple chances and playing at a high intensity. West Ham took the initiative right from the start, with their wingers, Jarrod Bowen and Michail Antonio, terrorizing the City defense with their pace and trickery. Manchester City, though, did not back down and responded with their trademark attacking prowess, led by the talismanic Kevin De Bruyne and the ever-dangerous Phil Foden. Breakthrough Moment: It was West Ham, however, who drew first blood in the 22nd minute. A brilliant piece of skill from Pablo Fornals saw him beat two City defenders before delivering a pinpoint cross into the penalty area. Sebastien Haller rose highest above the Manchester City defenders and expertly headed the ball into the bottom corner to give West Ham the lead. The home crowd erupted in jubilation as their team gained an unexpected advantage over the champions. City Fights Back: Manchester City, though, refused to let the setback derail their efforts. Manager Pep Guardiola urged his players to intensify their pressing game, and they began to regain control over the possession. The equalizer came in the 34th minute as De Bruyne played a clever one-two with Foden before sliding a perfectly weighted pass into the path of an onrushing Bernardo Silva, who made no mistake in slotting the ball past goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski. Second Half Drama: The second half saw both teams emerge with a renewed urgency, knowing that the decisive moments of the match were approaching. With neither side content to settle for a draw, the game became more open and frantic. The Winning Strike: With tensions mounting and the clock ticking down, the decisive moment came in the 78th minute. West Ham's Declan Rice intercepted a wayward pass from City's midfield and surged forward, driving deep into the opposition's territory. He then slipped a perfectly timed ball through to Bowen, who left the defenders in his wake and calmly placed the ball beyond the reach of goalkeeper Ederson into the net. The stadium erupted once again, with West Ham fans now daring to dream of a famous victory. Tense Final Moments: As the minutes ticked away, Manchester City threw everything they had at West Ham in a desperate attempt to salvage a point. Guardiola introduced attacking reinforcements in the form of Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Jesus, but West Ham's defense, marshalled by the imperious Angelo Ogbonna, held firm. A couple of heart-stopping moments ensued, with Fabianski making crucial saves and City hitting the woodwork, but West Ham ultimately held on for a famous 2-1 victory. Conclusion: This thrilling encounter further underlined the unpredictability and excitement of the Premier League. West Ham's victory will be remembered as a classic example of grit, determination, and tactical ingenuity from manager David Moyes. On the other hand, Manchester City must reflect on their vulnerabilities and seek improvements if they are to wrestle back the title from their city rivals, Manchester United. With performances like this one, West Ham will surely continue to defy expectations and establish themselves as genuine contenders for European places. Their talented squad and committed manager are more than capable of sustaining their recent success. Manchester City, meanwhile, must learn from their defeat and respond accordingly to remain a force to be reckoned with at the summit of English football."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: Start writing your message while the bottle is drying. You can write a story about your life, a poem, or an encouraging message. The possibilities are endless and you should write whatever you want to share, as long as the message is positive.  Since it is highly likely that a stranger will read the message, be sure not to reveal sensitive personal information. For instance, do not include your age or phone number if you are under the age of eighteen. You can add things that you enjoy, such as your favorite sport or your favorite food. Once you have finished writing your message, read it to determine if it is truly what you want to share with a stranger. They may contact you years down the road, so be sure to share something interesting. Some people send a message in a bottle for sentimental purposes, such as sharing a love story. Instead of using your address, use a Post Office Box number. You can also use an email address if you have an email address that you feel comfortable sharing with strangers. This allows the recipient to track you down and tell you where they found your message in a bottle.

Hey little buddies! Guess what? Facebook, the big website where people share pictures, videos, and messages with their friends, had a little bit of a nap, not just once, but twice in just one week! Let's talk about what happened and why. On a day called Monday, Facebook went \\"offline\\" for 40 minutes. Going offline means that no one could use the website (like they usually do) because something wasn't working, like when the power goes out and we can't watch TV or use the lights. Thankfully, Facebook woke up from its nap and everyone could start using it again. But this isn't the first time it happened. Just a few days before the Monday nap, Facebook went offline for a little while again. It's like when sometimes we feel a little sleepy and take short naps, just to feel more energetic after we wake up. Now, we may wonder why Facebook needed two naps in such a short time, and it could be because sometimes things can go wrong with big websites, as they have a lot of parts, like a giant jigsaw puzzle. When one small piece of the puzzle isn't in the right place, the whole picture might not look right. The people who work at Facebook are very smart, and they work hard to fix any problem that happens, just like when mom or dad fixes our broken toys. So, after the short naps, they made sure Facebook was up and running again so that everyone could share their pictures, videos, and messages with their friends.

Sentence 1: Development of an outcome measures reporting system to supplement or replace LSC's CSR system is underway. Sentence 2: The LSC's CSR system is going to be changed. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Thinking Step-by-Step: 1. First, understand the meaning of both sentences: Sentence 1 is saying that a new system for outcome measures reporting is being developed to either supplement (add on to) or replace (substitute entirely) the existing LSC's CSR system. Sentence 2 is stating that the LSC's CSR system is going to be changed. 2. Now, ensure the understanding of entailment in the context of given sentences: Entailment in this context means that the truth of the first sentence(database sentence) guarantees the truth of the second sentence(hypothesis sentence). 3. Next, compare the meanings of both sentences: The first sentence does propose a possible change to the LSC's CSR system but it does not confirm that change will definitely occur. It suggests that the LSC's CSR system could be supplemented or replaced (both instances would imply some sort of changes) but it also leaves room for the possibility that the current system remains as is if the development of an outcome measures reporting system only supplements it and does not alter it.  4. Finally, analyze whether the truth of the second sentence is guaranteed by the first one: The second sentence definitively states that a change to the LSC's CSR system is imminent. However, as per the first sentence, it's not necessarily true because the new system might just supplement the existing CSR system without changing it. Justification: Based on the above comparison and analysis, the second sentence is not necessarily entailed by the first sentence. The first sentence does not definitively guarantee the truth of the second sentence. The second sentence takes a definitive stance that change is going to happen to the LSC's CSR system, whereas the first sentence only suggests the possibility of change.

Allen and FIITJEE are coaching institutes that help students prepare for competitive exams like JEE. Step 2: Determine the relation between JEE (Advanced) and coaching institutes like Allen or FIITJEE - Clearing JEE (Advanced) is a goal for students who want to join prestigious engineering institutes such as IITs. Coaching institutes like Allen and FIITJEE prepare students for these exams. Step 3: Answer the question - Clearing JEE (Advanced) is not necessarily important for joining coaching institutes like Allen or FIITJEE. These institutes help students prepare for the JEE exams; however, their admission criteria may be different and could include factors such as academic performance or entrance tests specific to the coaching institute. Question 2: Can I deposit money in an SBT account using an SBI CDM? Step 1: Understand the context - SBT stands for State Bank of Travancore, which has now merged with the State Bank of India (SBI). A Cash Deposit Machine (CDM) is an ATM-like device that allows users to deposit money into their accounts. Step 2: Determine the feasibility of depositing money in an SBT account using an SBI CDM - Since SBT has merged with SBI, all SBT accounts have become SBI accounts. Consequently, it should be possible to deposit money in an SBT (now SBI) account using an SBI CDM. Step 3: Answer the question - Yes, you can deposit money in an SBT account (now an SBI account) using an SBI CDM. Final step: Compare the two questions - The first question revolves around the importance of clearing JEE (Advanced) for joining coaching institutes, while the second question is about depositing money in a bank account using a CDM.

Given the background: Another example of incomplete dominance is with sickle cell anemia, a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly. This causes the red blood cells to have a sickle shape, making it difficult for these misshapen cells to pass through the smallest blood vessels. A person that is homozygous recessive ( ss ) for the sickle cell trait will have red blood cells that all have the incorrect hemoglobin. A person who is homozygous dominant ( SS ) will have normal red blood cells.  and the situation: Doctors studied  the blood of 2 sisters, Ann and Julie. Ann had sickle cell anemia, Julie did not.  Answer the following question: Which sister was not homozygous recessive ( ss ) for the sickle cell trait?","output":"In this situation, Julie is the sister who is not homozygous recessive (ss) for the sickle cell trait.  To understand why Julie is not homozygous recessive, let's first dive into what it means to be homozygous recessive for the sickle cell trait. Recall that everyone inherits two copies of each gene, one from their mother and one from their father. A trait like sickle cell anemia is determined by the combination of these gene copies, specifically the copies of the gene that codes for hemoglobin.  When a person is homozygous recessive (ss) for the sickle cell trait, it means that they have inherited two mutated copies of the gene, one from each parent. In this case, both copies of the gene produce the abnormal hemoglobin, which in turn causes red blood cells to have a sickle shape. This leads to the characteristic symptoms of sickle cell anemia. Given that Ann had sickle cell anemia, she must be homozygous recessive (ss) for the sickle cell trait. This implies that both of her gene copies produce the incorrect hemoglobin and cause her red blood cells to have a sickle shape. On the other hand, Julie does not have sickle cell anemia, which means she is not homozygous recessive (ss). Instead, she might be homozygous dominant (SS), meaning she has two normal gene copies that produce the correct hemoglobin and result in normal red blood cells. Alternatively, Julie could be heterozygous (Ss) for the trait, meaning she has one normal gene copy and one mutated gene copy. In the case of heterozygosity, the dominance of the normal gene copy enables Julie to have normal red blood cells, even though she carries a mutated gene copy. In conclusion, Julie is the sister who is not homozygous recessive (ss) for the sickle cell trait since she does not have sickle cell anemia.  Instead, she could be homozygous dominant (SS) or heterozygous (Ss) for the trait, both of which would result in her having normal red blood cells."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This term indicates a low level of essential nutrients for aquatic life such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which are necessary for the growth and development of micro-organisms, plants, and fishes. These nutrients function as the foundation for life similarly to how they operate in terrestrial ecosystems. The shortage of these nutrients in High Lake implies that the water body is unable to support a high level of biodiversity or thriving aquatic life. Furthermore, High Lake is described as having a mix of fresh and saltwater, indicating that it's likely a brackish ecosystem. These water bodies often have fluctuation in their salt concentrations, which can add another layer of stress for organisms trying to survive in it. This might also contribute to a reduction in nutrient concentration, as not all nutrients are readily available or usable in higher salt concentrations. In contrast, the Low Lake is described as a remarkably abundant and prolific fishing spot. This suggests the presence of a healthy and vibrant community of fish which can only be achieved in environments where there is a balance of necessary nutrients and other life-sustaining conditions. The successful ecological productivity in the Low Lake indicates it has a high nutrient content that supports a high biomass in the food chain and provides an ideal environment for various fish species to thrive. In summary, considering all these factors, we can conclude that, between the two, High Lake has fewer dissolved nutrients, while Low Lake is nutrient-rich and more prolific in aquatic life."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer:  Berlin Wall  for the following movie plot:  Note: This film was shot in black/white and color. The Angels cannot see color. Therefore, when the shot is from the angels' point of view, the shot is black and white, and when the shot is from a human point of view, it is in color. There is much poetic language used in this film that simply cannot be properly conveyed.Damiel (Bruno Ganz) is writing on a paper, When the child was a child. He goes through a series of statements about when children were children: what they thought, how they acted, etc. Then, the opening credits appear. It fades to a scene of the sky, then a close-up of a human eye, then a bird's eye view of Berlin.Damiel is looking over the city from atop a large statue. He has wings, but they disappear only a few seconds into the scene. He can hear the people below, but only the children can see him. There is a quick shot of a flapping wing, and then we see one man walking with a baby. While we see this, Damiel speaks about wanting to see color and feel alive.We hear the thoughts of a woman on a bicycle. Damiel is on an airplane, passing through the aisle. He stops to see a little girl. Then, he focuses on Peter Falk (as himself). People's voices are heard.Peter talks to himself about the writer's block he is having over his script. Peter speaks in English. A shot of Berlin is shown from the airplane's view. We hear various radio stations as we see the radio tower over Berlin. The camera pans into an apartment, and we hear various people's thoughts. Many of the things we hear are typical thoughts, or people's problems.Again, Damiel starts to think, When the child was a child. This time he is wondering what children think about. We follow Damiel around his daily routine. First, we fly once more over the city, listening to an ambulance. Then we see the pregnant woman inside the ambulance.

During this period Buddhism was exposed to a variety of influences, from Persian and Greek civilization, to changing trends in non-Buddhist Indian religions—themselves influenced by Buddhism. Striking examples of this syncretistic development can be seen in the emergence of Greek-speaking Buddhist monarchs in the Indo-Greek Kingdom, and in the development of the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhāra.

Answer the following question: Like many other inventors before him, professor Slawomir Suwak designed only the things he needed himself. He had several patents on his conscience already: an automatic cork opener for wine in the indicative state, a portable set of board games for solving personality problems, a wallet with a mini-device for the duplications of 100 zloty bills, and a piece of equipment \\"the day after\\" used to irretrievably eliminate from the time-space continuum days burdened with a hangover. Now came the time for a mini-device preventing the development of symptoms of psycho-motor aggression. The device was really simple. It weighed about a kilo and was the size of a bag of flour. It was to be worn on the right wrist. The fact it had to be the right wrist was very important. Otherwise, the invention didn't work properly, or even worse, it produced results opposite to its intended effect. Each day, its mini-containers had to be re-filled with substances promoting positive processes in the body leading to the return of good mood. There were three containers to re-fill, and the substances were not available on the local market and had to be imported using diplomatic channels from the USA. To operate the device, turning it on stand-by was enough. In that mode, it could be used continuously for one and a half hours. To recharge the batteries, you needed a charger, which was stored in a small suitcase. The device, when it was turned on, made a low murmur (or according to some - a loud growl) designed to keep the owner in a good mood. Professor Suwak called his new baby \\"mini-anti-aggressor.\\" The McPhilips corporation expressed its interest in the product early on, even when it was still at the drawing-board stage. The company partially financed the purchase of sub-assembly elements from its subsidiary specializing in the productions of components for technologically advanced products.

The two burglars knocked on a side door of the museum at about 1:15 am. They told the two security guards on duty that there was a disturbance in the area. The guards then made the very serious mistake of allowing the two men to go into the building. After they went in, the two burglars tied the guards up with tape. The two men stole 11 paintings and an ancient Chinese vase. The stolen works included three paintings by Rembrandt. A maintenance worker discovered the two guards at about 7 am and called police. One of the greatest losses was Rembrandt's works, \\"The Storm on the Sea of Galilee.\\" It was a very popular attraction at the museum and was one of the most valuable works stolen. Museum officials said that the value of the stolen art is at least 200 million dollars, and may in fact be much more. The true value of the paintings is unknown, because they have not been on the market for nearly a century. This is considered to be the biggest theft ever in the United States. Officials are waiting to see whether the burglars will or try to sell them to a private collector. Museum officials and police are not sure why the burglars chose certain works and not others. There are other paintings in the museum that are even more valuable than the ones that were stolen. Special investigators are looking into the theft and the museum's security system.

Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes.  Question: \\"How much is the registration fee hike and what is cited as the reason for the lack of generated funds?\\" Answer: \\"42 increase to shore up homeless legal help\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"No, the answer is not entirely correct. The registration fee hike being proposed is up to 49 a year. While the 42 increase is mentioned for supporting pro-bono services for the poor, another reason cited is to bolster support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The lack of generated funds is attributed to low interest rates and a sagging economy, leading to less money being generated through the Lawyers' Trust Fund."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After examining the context in which \\"work\\" appears in both sentences, it is clear that while the term is used in the context of handling or manipulating dough in both sentences, it carries slightly different meanings: In the first sentence, \\"work\\" is used to describe a characteristic of the dough, implying that it is difficult to handle. In the second sentence, \\"work\\" is an action verb that instructs the reader to incorporate the raisins into the dough.

It will not directly impact the process steps, but the larger pot may affect the efficiency of the evaporation and condensation process. Here's the detailed explanation: 1. Directly impacting a step of the process: In this scenario, a direct impact would involve changing one of the steps of the process. However, placing a larger pot does not change any of the steps in the process mentioned, so it does not directly impact a step of the process. 2. Indirectly impacting a step of the process: A larger pot may indirectly impact the efficiency of the evaporation and condensation process. The larger pot can cause the distance between the two pots to be greater, which can lead to the water vapor having to travel a longer distance before it can condense on the lid. This could reduce the overall effectiveness in capturing the water vapor, leading to less salt being removed from the water as the water evaporates. 3. Not impacting any step of the process: Since placing a larger pot could affect the efficiency of the evaporation and condensation process, it does have an impact. Therefore, it cannot be classified as \\"not impacting any step.\\" So, the supposed perturbation is: indirectly impacting a step of the process."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you have sleep paralysis, the area of your brain that detects threats becomes more active and overly sensitive to stimuli. The temporary paralysis is caused by this oversensitivity. To be diagnosed with sleep paralysis, you must be experiencing three of the following primary symptoms:  Inability to move: This may feel as if some outside force is causing the paralysis. Feeling fear, dread, or anxiety because of the paralysis Being consciously awake during the paralysis Clear perception of surroundings: You may notice the time, the moonlight coming in through the window, what your partner is wearing and so on. In addition to primary symptoms, you may experience these symptoms:  A sense of overwhelming fear and dread A sense of another presence Pressure on the chest Difficulty breathing Laying on your back even if that is not your preferred position Visual, olfactory (smell) or auditory (sound) hallucinations. These may be combined with the sense of another presence. A feeling of impending doom or death Studies estimate that sleep paralysis affects 5 to 40% of the population, affecting men and women of any age group, although most sleep paralysis begins during the teenage years. Risk factors for sleep paralysis include:  A family history of sleep paralysis Changing sleep schedules The existence of another sleep disorder like insomnia; narcolepsy; parasomnias such as sleepwalking or sleep talking, confusional arousals, bedwetting and sleep terrors; hypersomnias (excessive sleepiness) A history of depression, anxiety, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and bipolar disorder. These mental disorders were also associated with some of the more disturbing hallucinations. Sleep related leg cramps and Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) Medications, including those used to treat anxiety and ADHD Drug and alcohol abuse If you don't notice a reduction in the number of sleep paralysis events within two to four weeks of trying treatment methods or you're losing significant amounts of sleep, talk with your doctor. You may even want to schedule an appointment with a sleep specialist. Sleep paralysis can be a symptom of other underlying sleep conditions or of significant psychiatric problems, but only a physician can make that determination. For example, sleep paralysis can actually be a symptom of narcolepsy, a condition with daytime drowsiness and sudden “attacks” of sleep.

Please answer the following question: Background: About 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones. The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock.  Paragraph: White mountains are often visited by tourists because of the many beautiful caves, stalactites, stalagmites and karst phenomena. Dome mountains are interesting to tourists because they are very massive, of volcanic origin and excellent for climbing.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which mountain has a higher percentage of sedimentary rocks? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided background information and paragraph, White mountains have a higher percentage of sedimentary rocks.  The White mountains are often visited by tourists due to their limestone features such as caves, stalactites, stalagmites, and karst phenomena. As mentioned in the background, about 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones. The solubility of limestone along with its susceptibility to erosion by water over time results in the formation of these karst landscapes. The fact that most cave systems develop through limestone bedrock further supports the connection between sedimentary rocks, particularly limestone, and the White mountains' notable features. On the other hand, Dome mountains are described as having volcanic origins. Volcanic rocks typically result from igneous processes rather than sedimentary processes. The formation of Dome mountains occurs due to the hardening and cooling of magma below the Earth's surface, which eventually pushes overlying rock layers upward, creating a dome shape. This implies that Dome mountains primarily consist of igneous rocks rather than sedimentary rocks. In conclusion, White mountains have a higher percentage of sedimentary rocks due to their characteristic limestone features and formations, while Dome mountains primarily consist of igneous rocks resulting from volcanic processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: Emoticons such as smiley and sad faces are changing the way our brain works, Australian researchers have claimed.

'Emoticons are a new form of language that we're producing,\\" Dr Owen Churches of the school of psychology at Flinders University in Adelaide told ABC News. 'And to decode that language we've produced a new pattern of brain activity.' The researchers say that we pay more attention to faces than most other things we see as we try to 'read' them for emotion. The team wanted to see if this was the case with emoticons. The team showed 20 participants images of real faces, smiley face. emoticons (involving the use of a colon, hyphen and parenthesis), and a. meaningless string of characters. They used electrophysiology to. determine the pattern of electrical activity in the brain when the. participants viewed the different images, and found we react to. emoticons ion the same way. Emoticons have become massively popular, being used in text message and online conversations, along with art projects such as this Banksy Exhibit. The researchers admit the were stunned by the results. 'There is no innate neural response to emoticons that babies are born with. 'Before 1982 there would be no reason that ':-)' would activate face sensitive areas of the cortex but now it does because we've learnt that this represents a face,\\" said Churches. 'This is an entirely culturally-created neural response. It's really quite amazing.' One of the earliest appearances of the emoticon appears in an 1862 transcript of a speech by President Abraham Lincoln. The transcript records the audience's response to Lincoln's droll introduction as \\"(applause and laughter ;).\\" However, the modern usage began when a joke about a fake mercury spill at Carnegie Mellon University was posted online and mistake for a genuine warning.

The most recognizable subspecies is the red-eared slider (\\"T. s. elegans\\"), which is popular in the pet trade and has been introduced to other parts of the world by people releasing it to the wild. Baby and juvenile pond sliders have a green shell (carapace) and yellow green skin with dark green striped markings. Markings and colors fade in adults to a muted olive green to brown or orange carapace. Some individuals become almost black with few visible markings. The carapace is oval and flattened for females, round and complex for males. The underside of the shell is yellow with dark markings in the center of each scute, making it easier to determine their sex. However, the markings underside the shell fade as the turtle age.  - A carapace is a dorsal (upper) section of the exoskeleton or shell in a number of animal groups, including arthropods, such as crustaceans and arachnids, as well as vertebrates, such as turtles and tortoises. In turtles and tortoises, the underside is called the plastron.  - Organisms of many species are specialized into male and female varieties, each known as a sex, with some falling in between being intersex. Sexual reproduction involves the combining and mixing of genetic traits: specialized cells known as gametes combine to form offspring that inherit traits from each parent. Gametes can be identical in form and function (known as isogamy), but in many cases an asymmetry has evolved such that two sex-specific types of gametes (heterogametes) exist (known as anisogamy).  - The red-eared slider (\\"Trachemys scripta elegans\\"), also known as the red-eared terrapin, is a semiaquatic turtle belonging to the family Emydidae. It is a subspecies of the pond slider. It is the most popular pet turtle in the United States and is also popular as a pet in the rest of the world. It has, therefore, become the most commonly traded turtle in the world. It is native to the southern United States and northern Mexico, but has become established in other places because of pet releases, and has become an invasive species in many areas, where it outcompetes native species. The red-eared slider is included in the list of the world's 100 most invasive species published by the IUCN.  - Puerto Rico, (Spanish for \\"Rich Port\\") officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (\\"Free Associated State of Puerto Rico\\") and briefly called Porto Rico, is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea.  - The Puerto Rican slider ( Trachemys stejnegeri stejnegeri ) is found mainly in Puerto Rico and surrounding areas . It is a relative of the pond slider .  - Bean is a common name for large seeds of several genera of the flowering plant family Fabaceae (also known as Leguminosae) which are used for human or animal food.

Possible answers: *no; *yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Yes, the answer to stopping both a German Shepherd/Border Collie mix puppy and an English Bulldog/Pitbull mix puppy from chewing your shoes would be similar. Both breeds may exhibit different energy levels or temperaments, but the process of correcting unwanted chewing behavior remains largely the same. Here is a detailed guide on how to stop a puppy from chewing your shoes: 1. Provide appropriate chew toys: Offer your puppy a variety of appealing and safe chew toys that they can focus on instead of your shoes. Make sure the toys are appropriate for their size and strength. Rubber toys, soft toys, rope toys, and puzzle toys are popular choices. 2. Use positive reinforcement: Whenever your puppy chews on the toys you provide, praise them and reward them with a treat. This positive reinforcement will help them form an association between chewing their toys and receiving a treat or praise, reinforcing their good behavior. 3. Deterrence: Apply a deterrent spray, such as bitter apple, on your shoes. This spray will have an unpleasant taste that most puppies dislike, discouraging them from chewing your shoes. Make sure to test the spray on a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure it won't damage your shoes. 4. Supervision and management: Supervise your puppy as much as possible when they are around your shoes. If you notice your puppy approaching or chewing your shoes, redirect their attention to an appropriate chew toy. It's also essential to put away your shoes when you're not wearing them to minimize the temptation for your puppy. 5. Exercise and mental stimulation: Puppies often chew out of boredom or due to excess energy. Ensure your puppy receives plenty of exercises, such as walks and playtime, to help tire them out. In addition, provide mental stimulation by introducing puzzle toys, teaching new tricks, and playing interactive games. 6. Crate training: If your puppy tends to chew shoes when you're not around, consider crate training them. This gives your puppy a safe and secure space when you're not able to supervise and reduces the likelihood of destructive chewing. 7. Patience and consistency: It's crucial to be patient and consistent when teaching your puppy not to chew your shoes. This process requires time and may involve some setbacks. Continue reinforcing good behavior and redirecting your puppy when they show interest in chewing inappropriate items. Remember that although the overall approach is the same for both breeds, individual dogs may require slight adjustments in training methods, exercise, and mental stimulation. Be attuned to your puppy's specific needs and adapt your approach as needed to achieve the desired outcome."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose imperial title was recognized? , can you please find it?   Charlemagne planned to continue the Frankish tradition of dividing his kingdom between all his heirs, but was unable to do so as only one son, Louis the Pious (r. 814–840), was still alive by 813. Just before Charlemagne died in 814, he crowned Louis as his successor. Louis's reign of 26 years was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and, after 829, civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire. Eventually, Louis recognised his eldest son Lothair I (d. 855) as emperor and gave him Italy. Louis divided the rest of the empire between Lothair and Charles the Bald (d. 877), his youngest son. Lothair took East Francia, comprising both banks of the Rhine and eastwards, leaving Charles West Francia with the empire to the west of the Rhineland and the Alps. Louis the German (d. 876), the middle child, who had been rebellious to the last, was allowed to keep Bavaria under the suzerainty of his elder brother. The division was disputed. Pepin II of Aquitaine (d. after 864), the emperor's grandson, rebelled in a contest for Aquitaine, while Louis the German tried to annex all of East Francia. Louis the Pious died in 840, with the empire still in chaos.A three-year civil war followed his death. By the Treaty of Verdun (843), a kingdom between the Rhine and Rhone rivers was created for Lothair to go with his lands in Italy, and his imperial title was recognised. Louis the German was in control of Bavaria and the eastern lands in modern-day Germany. Charles the Bald received the western Frankish lands, comprising most of modern-day France. Charlemagne's grandsons and great-grandsons divided their kingdoms between their descendants, eventually causing all internal cohesion to be lost. In 987 the Carolingian dynasty was replaced in the western lands, with the crowning of Hugh Capet (r. 987–996) as king. In the eastern lands the dynasty had died out earlier, in 911, with the death of Louis the Child, and the selection of the unrelated Conrad I (r....

Given the following context:  The French playwright Victorien Sardou wrote more than 70 plays, almost all of them successful, and none of them performed today. In the early 1880s Sardou began a collaboration with actress Sarah Bernhardt, whom he provided with a series of historical melodramas. His third Bernhardt play, La Tosca, which premiered in Paris on 24 November 1887, and in which she starred throughout Europe, was an outstanding success, with more than 3,000 performances in France alone.Puccini had seen La Tosca at least twice, in Milan and Turin. On 7 May 1889 he wrote to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, begging him to get Sardou's permission for the work to be made into an opera: \\"I see in this Tosca the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music.\\"Ricordi sent his agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to negotiate with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer. He complained about the reception La Tosca had received in Italy, particularly in Milan, and warned that other composers were interested in the piece. Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.In 1891, Illica advised Puccini against the project, most likely because he felt the play could not be successfully adapted to a musical form. When Sardou expressed his unease at entrusting his most successful work to a relatively new composer whose music he did not like, Puccini took offence. He withdrew from the agreement, which Ricordi then assigned to the composer Alberto Franchetti.  Illica wrote a libretto for Franchetti, who was never at ease with the assignment. When Puccini once again became interested in Tosca, Ricordi was able to get Franchetti to surrender the rights so he could recommission Puccini.  One story relates that Ricordi convinced Franchetti that the work was too violent to be successfully staged. A Franchetti family tradition holds that Franchetti gave the work back as a grand...  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person who warned that other composers were interested in adapting La Tosca? The answer to this question is:","output":"The last name of the person who warned that other composers were interested in adapting La Tosca is Sardou. Victorien Sardou was the original French playwright who wrote the play La Tosca. He had initially expressed his preference for a French composer to adapt his play into an opera and warned that other composers showed interest in the piece. Despite his reservations, Sardou eventually came to terms with Giulio Ricordi, the publisher who was representing the composer Giacomo Puccini's interests."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Her breasts may enlarge, and she may express a milky fluid. Enlarged nipples are also signs of being in heat, so bear in mind that growing nipples are not exclusively indicative of pregnancy.

Hey now, yours truly, TheatreX, found this while grubbing through videos at the flea market, in almost new condition, and in reading the back of the box saw that it was somewhat of a \\"cult hit\\" so of course it came home with me.  What a strange film. The aunt and cousin of former first lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis live in this decaying 28 room house out on Long Island (Suffolk Co.) and share the house with raccoons, cats, fleas (eyow!) and who knows what else. Suffolk Co. was all over them at one point for living in filth and old Jackie herself came by to set things right. Anyway, this is one strange pair, Big Edie and Little Edie...Edie (the daughter) always wears something over her head and dances, sings, and gives little asides to the camera that rarely make much sense. Big Edie (the mother, age 79) apparently likes to run around naked, and while we do get hints of what that might look like thankfully this was tastefully (?) done to the point where we're mercifully spared from that. These women talk and talk and talk, mostly about the past, and it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, except to them. They live in absolute filth, cats doing their business wherever (\\"Look, that cat's going to the bathroom behind my portrait!\\"), and one bedroom appears to be their center of operations. If I close my eyes and listen to Big Edie's voice it reminds me very much of my own late aunt, who was from that area of the country and had that Lawn Guyland accent. One scene has Little Edie putting on flea repellent, lovely, you can see all the cats scratching all the time so the place must have been infested. The box refers to these two women as \\"eccentric\\", and I'd have to say in this case it is just a euphemism for \\"wacked out of their gourds\\", but this film is not without its moments where you truly feel something for them. This is equal parts creepy, sad, and disgusting, but I couldn't stop watching once I started. This is not my \\"normal\\" type of flick but I found it to be somewhat fascinating. It won't be for everybody though, guaranteed. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review could be best described as mixed and candidly critical, with a dimension of intrigue and sympathy. The review clearly expresses a fascination with the film's unique and bizarre premise, manifesting itself as both a commendation and critique of the film's eccentric characters, peculiar plot, and peculiar setting. The reviewer highlights the strangeness of the film, demonstrating an element of confusion but also fascination, notably mentioning phrases like \\"what a strange film\\" and terms such as \\"cult hit\\". Furthermore, explicit references to the bizarre behavior and living conditions of the film's characters show an element of shock and disgust, marked by descriptive phrases such as \\"living in absolute filth\\", \\"mercifully spared\\", and \\"cats doing their business wherever\\". It's evident that the reviewer found these aspects to be unsettling, unconventional, and distasteful. However, the review also confesses the reviewer's inability to stop watching once they had started, inferring a sense of intrigue and fascination that drew them in despite the perceived oddities in the film's content. They seem to appreciate the oddity of the characters, their eccentricities, the house, and even the discussion of past incidences. Their reference to their own late aunt indicates the film managed to spark a personal connection and elicit some nostalgia. The box referring the characters as \\"eccentric\\" leading the reviewer to define it as a euphemism for \\"wacked out of their gourds\\" shows an attempt at humor and injects light-heartedness into the review. And while they found some parts of the film to be creepy, sad, and distasteful, they also admitted that there were moments that made them empathize and feel for the characters. In summary, the review's sentiment is a complex blend of shock, disgust, intrigue, fascination, nostalgia, humor, and sympathy, despite the reviewer acknowledging that this film certainly isn't for everyone. They approached the film with an open mind, allowing themselves to be drawn into the strange world it portrayed, and found some value in its oddity and uniqueness, which would appeal to specific viewers who share a taste for eccentric and unconventional films."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: You may need to undergo some tests to find out if you have pancreatitis. Blood tests, stool tests, CT scans, and ultrasounds are the most common tests to find out the source of your health problems when pancreatitis is suspected. For 75% of patients, basic hospital care will be all that is needed to recover. However, this is still complex enough care that it will need to be done at a hospital and home remedies are not usually a safe option. Your doctor should be able to explain your situation.  Expect to fast. Eating no food for up to several days, and instead being switched to liquid diets, feeding tubes, and other alternatives are generally the main basic treatment for pancreatitis. This is because eating makes the irritation worse and makes you unable to heal. Get IV fluids. Severe dehydration is a major part of pancreas problems, so expect to be given a large number of fluids to combat this. This will most likely come in the form of IV fluids, but you may also be asked to drink more water. You will probably be given some medication. Pancreatitis causes significant and constant pain and your doctor should give you painkillers to help alleviate the pain. Meperidine or Demerol are the most commonly prescribed painkillers for patients with pancreatitis. Take antibiotics should your doctor prescribe them. They may be given to prevent possible infection or to treat an existing one. For basic or mild cases, the underlying cause may be very easy to treat (such as a change in medications). However, more severe cases or chronic cases may require more serious treatment.  Surgery is the most likely option if you have a severe problem. The kind of surgery will depend on the underlying cause. Some options include gall bladder removal, surgery to repair or remove parts of the pancreas, or surgery to unblock bile duct obstructions. Treatment for alcohol dependency will be recommended if it is determined that this is the source of the problem. For your own happiness and well being, it is recommended that you comply with your doctor's wishes in this area, even if you don't think you have a problem. There are enzyme supplements which you may be asked to take if your problem is hereditary. These supplements are in the form of a simple tablet and aid with digestion, keeping the pressure off of your pancreas. Summary:","output":"To determine if you have pancreatitis, various tests such as blood tests, stool tests, CT scans, and ultrasounds may be performed. If diagnosed with pancreatitis, 75% of patients will only require basic hospital care. This includes fasting for several days, consuming only liquids or receiving nutrients through feeding tubes, receiving IV fluids to combat dehydration, and taking prescribed medications such as painkillers (Meperidine or Demerol) and antibiotics. Treatment varies based on the severity of the condition—mild cases may only require a change in medications, while more severe cases might necessitate surgery, such as gallbladder removal, pancreatic repair, or bile duct unblocking. If alcohol dependency is identified as the cause, treatment for this issue will be recommended, and enzyme supplements might be prescribed if the condition is hereditary in nature.

Answer the following question: This article: Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home.  Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at  the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895. Although Grainger never returned permanently to Australia, he... contains an answer for the question: What institution was recommended by William Laver?, what is it ? Answer:","output":"The institution recommended by William Laver is the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany. William Laver, who was the head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of Music, suggested this prestigious music conservatory for Percy Grainger to continue his studies. The Hoch Conservatory is a well-known institution that has nurtured many talented musicians throughout its history and provides an environment promoting musical excellence. After receiving the recommendation, Percy Grainger and his mother Rose secured financial assistance and left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895, where he would attend the Hoch Conservatory and further develop his musical talents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Only children are happier than those with brothers or sisters, according to a new research which shows _ rivalry   can have a serious effect on a child's emotion. Over half of the children surveyed said they had been bullied by a sibling, and one in three said they had been hit,kicked or pushed by a sibling, others complained of name-calling and having their belongings stolen. Other reasons for only children being much happier include not having to compete for parents' attention or share bedrooms with a sibling, said Gundi Knies, a researcher on the project. Dr. Ruth Koppard, a child psychologist, said, \\"In an average home, the more children, the less privacy for each child. Some love sharing a bedroom with a sibling but they would rather choose to do it than have to do it\\". Homes with just one child make up nearly half of all families in Britain.

Did you fall prey to their claims? Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome. I still feel for her. I wish I had contact information, so I could touch base, and express those thoughts personally. But that's the most personally resonant version of false advertising affecting someone that I've seen. Question: Why did the patient feel for R? === The answer to the above question is The answer is:","output":"The patient felt for R because they empathized with her experience of being misled and deceived by false advertising. R had placed her trust in a product that promised to help her lose weight, only to discover that it was a scam. The fact that she was new to the U.S. and had believed in the authenticity of the product made the situation even more unfortunate. This story resonated with the patient because it demonstrated the harm that can be caused by false advertising and the importance of being informed and vigilant in navigating such situations. Additionally, R's determination to use her experience to help others and pursue a career in the medical field further endeared her to the patient and inspired their desire to stay in touch."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Cheetah and Toy Story, have which organization in common?","output":"Cheetah and Toy Story, at first glance, may appear to have little in common. However, if we delve deeper into the organizations involved in their respective fields, we can find a common connection. Cheetah is a well-known animal in the Felidae family, specifically the Acinonyx genus. It is famous for its exceptional speed, with the ability to reach up to 60-70 miles per hour, making it the fastest land animal. Conservation organizations that work to protect and study cheetahs, such as the Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) and Save the Cheetah, are involved in this realm.  Toy Story, on the other hand, is an animated movie series produced by Pixar Animation Studios. The release of the first Toy Story film in 1995 revolutionized the animation industry thanks to its use of computer-generated imagery (CGI). Since then, Pixar has continued to be a powerhouse in the world of animation, creating numerous beloved films. Now, to find the organization that connects these two seemingly unrelated entities. It happens to be The Walt Disney Company. Disney has deep connections with both the world of animation and conservation.  In the case of Toy Story, Disney's connection is quite direct. Pixar Animation Studios, the creators of Toy Story, was acquired by The Walt Disney Company in 2006. Since then, Disney has been involved in the production and distribution of all Pixar films, including the Toy Story series. Regarding the cheetah, the connection comes through Disney's conservation efforts. Disney runs the Disney Conservation Fund (DCF), a charitable organization that focuses on the protection and preservation of wildlife and their habitats. One of the areas the DCF covers includes the conservation of cheetahs in Africa. Disney's Animal Kingdom, a theme park located in Orlando, Florida, also raises awareness and funds for cheetah conservation. So, the organization common to both Cheetah and Toy Story is The Walt Disney Company. While this connection may not be evident at first, Disney's involvement in both the animation industry and wildlife conservation brings these two distinct realms together."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His brother Frank had no interest in the subject whatsoever, he was more interested in engineering.  Which person studied more about inflammatory responses to harmless antigens? Answer:","output":"Ben is the person who studied more about inflammatory responses to harmless antigens, as he became interested in allergies after experiencing an allergic reaction to pollen. This pursuit of understanding allergies demonstrates that Ben wanted to learn more about the body's reactions to certain substances that are generally considered harmless, which includes inflammatory responses. Allergies occur when the body's immune system mistakenly identifies a harmless substance, like pollen in Ben's case, as a threat and produces an immune response to combat it. Inflammatory responses are a significant part of this process, as they are one of the ways the immune system attempts to protect the body. Inflammation involves the release of chemicals that expand blood vessels, allowing more blood to flow to the affected area and bringing in white blood cells to fight off any potential invaders. Given his personal experience and subsequent pursuit of knowledge on the subject of allergies, Ben would have studied various aspects related to allergic reactions, including inflammatory responses. He would have explored topics such as the immune system, allergens, the different types of allergies, and the various symptoms that people may experience when allergic to a particular substance. On the other hand, Frank had no interest in allergies and was more focused on engineering. Engineering is a broad field that encompasses various subfields like civil, mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering. Although engineering may involve some aspects of biology and human body functions, depending on the specific area of study, it is unlikely that Frank would have delved deep into the subject of inflammatory responses related to allergies, as it would not be directly relevant to his primary field of interest. Therefore, comparing the two individuals, Ben is the one who studied more about inflammatory responses to harmless antigens, driven by his personal experience and motivation to understand allergies and the body's response to them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Use a pressure garment to help reduce scarring. Use a chemical exfoliator to flatten out raised boil scars. Spread a vitamin E cream on your scars for a natural alternative.\\"","output":"Title: Effective At-Home Treatments for Reducing Boil Scars Introduction: Boils are a common skin condition characterized by a painful, red bump filled with pus. They usually occur on hair follicles or areas where sweat or oil glands are present. Although these skin eruptions usually heal on their own, they can sometimes leave hard-to-miss scars on the skin. This article explores five effective, non-prescription methods to diminish boil scars, from over-the-counter creams to natural alternatives.  Step 1: Utilize a Scar Treatment Cream  Scars arising from a previously infected area can be unsightly and stubborn. To minimize their appearance, applying a non-prescription scar treatment cream can work wonders. These creams typically contain ingredients, such as hydroquinone or glycolic acid, to help fade the scar. Use the product according to the manufacturer's instructions and observe the scar diminishing in size and color. Step 2: Apply Silicone Gel  Silicone gel is yet another option for treating boil scars. It works by hydrating the scar tissue, which assists in reducing redness and lightening its overall appearance. To use silicone gel, apply a thin layer of the gel on the clean and dry scar area. The gel can be applied twice daily to maximize the effects. Step 3: Use a Pressure Garment Pressure garments, otherwise known as compression garments, are made to help reduce the formation of hard and raised scars. These specialized clothing items apply constant pressure to the scarred skin, leading to the flattening and softening of the tissue over time. Consult a dermatologist who can recommend an appropriate pressure garment and wear it as advised for the best results. Step 4: Introduce a Chemical Exfoliator  Integrating a chemical exfoliator into your skincare routine is an effective way to minimize boil scars. Chemical exfoliators, like alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs), work by promoting cell turnover, resulting in the removal of dead skin cells and revealing fresher, more even skin. Remember to follow the product's instructions for usage and frequency, and always use a sunblock, as these exfoliants can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Step 5: Opt for a Vitamin E Cream  For individuals who prefer a natural approach to scar care, a Vitamin E cream is a viable option. Vitamin E is well-known for its skin-restorative properties, helping to heal, promote the growth of healthy cells, and strengthen the skin's barrier function. Apply Vitamin E cream or oil to the scar on a daily basis, allowing it to be absorbed by the skin to nourish and improve the scar's appearance. Conclusion: The aftermath of a boil can be discouraging, especially when scars remain visible on the skin. However, by incorporating these suggested remedies like scar treatment creams, silicone gels, pressure garments, chemical exfoliators, and Vitamin E creams, it is possible to reduce the appearance of these blemishes significantly. Remember to consult with a dermatologist before introducing any new treatment, as individual results and sensitivities may vary."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Question: \\"Who benefitted?\\"  Context: \\"The era of planning in Himachal Pradesh started 1948 along with the rest of India. The first five-year plan allocated ₹ 52.7 million to Himachal. More than 50% of this expenditure was incurred on road construction since it was felt that without proper transport facilities, the process of planning and development could not be carried to the people, who mostly lived an isolated existence in far away areas. Himachal now ranks fourth in respect of per capita income among the states of the Indian Union.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The primary beneficiaries from this situation seem to be the people of Himachal Pradesh.  Let's breakdown the reasoning: 1. The era of planning in Himachal Pradesh, which began in 1948, implies that structured developmental efforts were initiated in the region like in rest of the country. 2. It's mentioned that ₹52.7 million was allocated to Himachal in the first five-year plan. This suggests that the Government was investing in its development and those resources were used for the betterment of the regional infrastructure and services that benefit the local population. 3. More than 50% of this expenditure was spent on road construction that shows access and connectivity were the prime focus. This would have made transportation easier, connecting isolated regions with more developed areas, and benefitting the residents of these far flung areas by providing them access to better opportunities and services. 4. Finally, it's noted that Himachal now ranks fourth in respect of per capita income among the states of the Indian Union. This increase in per capita income is a direct indicator of the improved living standards of the people, implying they benefitted the most from these developmental plans. Therefore, the people of Himachal Pradesh, especially those residing in far flung and isolated areas, are the key beneficiaries in this context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The latest YouTube challenge involves people intentionally setting themselves on fire.      It’s called “The Fire Challenge” and young people across the country are taking it in droves, CBS2’s Elise Finch reported. They pour flammable liquid on their body then set themselves on fire, just for fun.      “It’s a little too dangerous just for a YouTube video,” Ace Dawson, an Ozone Park resident, said.      On Tuesday night, a 12-year-old in Queens was rushed to the hospital after mimicking the fire challenge in his Far Rockaway home.      According to police, the boy doused himself with rubbing alcohol and used a lighter to set himself on fire. Moments later he ran outside with his upper body still burning and neighbors extinguished the flames.      “I came out and I saw the police car, the fire truck, and the place blocked off with the yellow tape,” neighbor Beverly Robinson said.      Police said the boy has third-degree burns on over 40 percent of his body. Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency room physician at Lennox Hill Hospital, said it can take years to recover from the damage done in just seconds.      “The burns penetrate the skin and soft tissue and then involve the muscle. As they penetrate you lose fluid, causing dehydration and it causes all these inflammatory markers that drop your blood pressure and can put you into shock.,” Glatter said.      One teen said some of his classmates have taken the fire challenge to get attention.      “I’m just convinced that it’s a lot of dumb teenagers looking to be famous on the Internet,” Cody Davido said.      “Just to be on YouTube, really? It’s sad that this is what it’s come to now that social media has pushed kids to this limit where they have to do something as stupid as that just to get some recognition,” Jamaica resident Frank Gines said.      Health care professionals suggest parents talk to their children and tell them this is one challenge they should never accept. In addition to severe burns the challenge can lead to infections or even death. ||||| The 12-year-old boy who set himself on fire inside a Queens home as part of a moronic social media stunt initially told first responders the injury was caused by an oven, according to a source.

FDNY firefighters turn out their own 'Running Man' video      But the injuries are not thought to be life-threatening, cops said.      The crazy trend appears to have started in 2013.      There are hundreds of videos online of people performing the dangerous stunt to various degrees of injury.      It appears that the point of the challenge is to spray a small amount of flammable liquid like alcohol or perfume on an area of the body and light it on fire for a few moments.      But in multiple YouTube videos, many of the participants, who appear to be teenagers or younger, struggle to douse the fire fast enough.

A watchdog group critical of pork barrel spending released its latest findings Wednesday targeting the top Congressional \\"porkers.\\" Some of the pork projects, according to the group, include a Lobster Institute; the Rocky Flats, Colorado, Cold War Museum; and the First Tee, a program to build young people's character through golf. Members of Congress requested funds for all these pet projects and thousands of others last year, according to the latest copy of the annual \\"Pig Book\\" released by Citizens Against Government Waste. \\"Congress stuffed 11,610 projects\\" worth 17.2 billion into a dozen spending bills, the group said in the report released Wednesday. The \\"Pig Book\\" names dozens of what the citizens group considers the most egregious porkers, the lawmakers who funnel money to projects on their home turf.  Interactive: Pork barrel spending ». Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi, the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee, requested the most money, 892.2 million, according to the group. In a statement to CNN, Cochran said he doesn't \\"accept the premise\\" of the group's claim that \\"any and all federal spending not specifically requested by the Executive Branch is wasteful and irresponsible.\\" \\"The Congress is vested with the power to appropriate funds to be spent by the federal government by the U. S. Constitution. We will continue to carry out that responsibility with care and a commitment to serve the public interest,\\" he said. \\"There were several candidates for the Narcissist Award,\\" Tom Schatz, the president of the group said. Read the group's 2008 report. \\"But this one went to House Ways and Means Chairman Charlie Rangel for the Charles Rangel Public Service Center at the City College of New York -- 1,950,000 [for a project] that he named after himself.\\" Rangel, a Democrat from New York, said last summer he was \\"honored that City College chose to have my name attached to what is an important project, not just for the residents of my congressional district, but for New York City and this nation.\\" Some lawmakers defended their earmarks, such as Rep. Mike Thompson, D-California, who channeled 742,764 to olive fruit fly research. \\"The olive fruit fly has infested thousands of California olive groves and is the single largest threat to the U.S. olive and olive oil industries,\\" he said. Schatz responded that his organization is criticizing the way lawmakers direct money to specific projects, not the projects themselves. \\"There are existing programs for virtually everything in the 'Pig Book.' If members [of Congress] believe they should be given additional funding, give them to the agencies rather than to specific projects,\\" he said. The problem with earmarks, he said, is that \\"we don't know if [the projects] are valuable or not.\\" Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-South Carolina, the third ranking Democrat in the House, defended his earmark for a program that funds a youth golf program for children on U.S. military bases. \\"It's a character building program, that seems to be working well for low income kids and that's why we do it throughout the United States of America. I just feel that children living on military installations ought to have this program as well,\\" Clyburn told CNN. Clyburn also defended the practice of earmarking federal funds. \\"I can name earmark after earmark, there's absolutely nothing wrong with congresspeople responding to their constituents and funding programs that they feel are necessary to improve the quality of life of the people who live in their districts.\\" Clyburn also raised questions about the group releasing the \\"Pig Book\\" saying, \\"they're not telling the truth about this earmark no more than them telling the truth about where they get their money from. The committee against government waste isn't against government waste.\\" He cited press reports from the St. Petersburg Times that the Committee Against Government Waste received money from the tobacco industry and other private groups to lobby Congress. Both parties came in for criticism, with the Democrats, who control both houses of Congress, topping the Republicans in spending. The Democrats were behind 5,199 projects worth 5.5 billion, while the Republicans earmarked 3,408 projects worth 4.4 billion, the citizen's group said.

In this sentence, UNFPA (the United Nations Population Fund) outlines their primary objectives, one of which directly addresses the question asked. According to the statement, one of UNFPA's major goals is to make all pregnancies \\"wanted.\\" This means that the UNFPA aims to ensure that women and couples have the means and the knowledge to make informed decisions about whether or not to have children, and to have access to the necessary resources to prevent unintended pregnancies. In order to achieve this goal, the UNFPA works in numerous ways, including: 1. Advocacy: The UNFPA works with governments, policymakers, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders to promote policies and programs that prioritize sexual and reproductive health and rights, as well as gender equality. This advocacy includes addressing the importance of family planning, comprehensive sexuality education, and access to safe and affordable contraceptives. 2. Family planning: The UNFPA supports the provision of high-quality, affordable, and widely accessible family planning services and information. This includes distributing contraceptives, training healthcare providers, and supporting national family planning initiatives. 3. Comprehensive sexuality education: The UNFPA believes that educating young people about their sexual and reproductive health can help them make informed decisions about their bodies and relationships, and ultimately contribute to preventing unintended pregnancies. To this end, the organization supports the development and implementation of comprehensive sexuality education programs in schools and communities worldwide. 4. Supporting women's reproductive rights: The UNFPA also works to ensure that women have the necessary resources and support to make informed decisions about their reproductive lives. This includes access to safe abortion services where it is legal, as well as post-abortion care and counseling. 5. Addressing cultural, social, and gender barriers: Recognizing that deep-rooted beliefs and cultural norms can often contribute to unwanted pregnancies, the UNFPA works with local communities to address these barriers and promote gender equality. In conclusion, the statement provided from the UNFPA answers the question \\"One of UNFPA's goals is to make all pregnancies what?\\" by highlighting the organization's commitment to making all pregnancies \\"wanted.\\" The UNFPA achieves this through various approaches and initiatives such as policy advocacy, family planning, sexuality education, women's reproductive rights support, and addressing cultural and social barriers."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. You will need 16 15-foot (4.5-meter) ash saplings that are about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) thick for the frame. You will also need at least 12 ash or basswood saplings that are 15 feet (4.5 meters) tall and 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) thick for the horizontal hoops. The saplings need to be straight as possible.  Ash and basswood are the most traditional, but you can use other hardwoods, such as: cedar, chestnut, elm, or hickory.  If you are making a model, use thin, bendy twigs instead. You can also use wire instead. Florist's wire coated in brown paper would work well. Start by trimming off any bark and branches. This will help reduce wood rot and help the wigwam last longer. Next, cut the ends of the saplings into points. This will make it easier to insert them into the holes.  Make your poles extra-strong by hardening the pointy ends in a fire. This will also help them last longer once you drive them into the soil.  If the saplings aren't flexible enough, soak them in a lake or river for at least two days first. Be sure to tie them down so that they don't float away. Gather 50 bushels of cattail leaves. A bushel is a bundle that is thick enough to wrap your arms around. Separate the cattails into 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) thick bundles. Secure each bundle at one end with some string. Set them out in the sun to dry.  If you don't have access to cattails, you can use heavy canvas, which was used to cover wigwams from the late 1700s onwards. You will need 12 to 14 sheets that are 5 by 10 feet (1.5 by 3.5 meters). If you want to be more traditional, you can sew cattail leaves into large mats. Plan on using 12 to 14 mats, each 5 by 10 feet (1.5 by 3.5 meters).  If you are making a model, you could use pieces of grass, raffia, or straw instead. You can also use pieces of cotton, linen, or canvas fabric. Gather 7 to 10 sheets of birch bark, about 3 feet (cc meter) square. Use a hot nail or wood burner to make holes along the top edge of each birch bark sheet.  You can also use elm bark, or weave mats out of cattails.  If you are making a model, you can use white paper instead. For a more realistic effect, go over it lightly in a dry brush dipped in brown paint to make the streaks. Summary:","output":"This article explains how to build a wigwam using ash saplings, ash or basswood saplings, and materials like cattail leaves or heavy canvas for the covering, and birch bark for the finishing touches."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dennis Davis was an American drummer and percussionist who had a significant contribution to several of Bowie's albums during the 1970s and 1980s, including \\"Young Americans\\" (1975), \\"Station to Station\\" (1976), \\"Low\\" (1977), \\"Heroes\\" (1977), \\"Lodger\\" (1979), and \\"Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)\\" (1980). \\"Fame\\" was released in 1975 and is the fifth track on David Bowie's ninth studio album, \\"Young Americans.\\" The song was written by Bowie, John Lennon, and guitarist Carlos Alomar. The collaboration with John Lennon happened when he visited Bowie during the recording sessions in New York. They improvised and reworked a song called \\"Footstompin'\\" of which the guitar riff by Carlos Alomar became the central part of \\"Fame.\\" Interestingly, \\"Fame\\" became Bowie's first single to reach the number one spot on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.  Dennis Davis was introduced to David Bowie by his former bandmate Tony Visconti. Visconti, a record producer and musician, had worked with Davis in the band \\"Roy Harper,\\" and later on, he joined Bowie's band and started playing on his albums. The drummer's unique and versatile style made it possible for him to cover a wide range of genres from rock and funk to experimental and electronic music, which is evident on Bowie's albums that Davis worked on. Davis' drumming on \\"Fame\\" was exceptional. His tight, precise playing laid the groundwork for the song's funk-infused rhythms, creating an infectious groove that propels the entire track. His ability to explore different time signatures and embody the musical changes within Bowie's compositions enhanced the overall listening experience, making him a valuable addition to Bowie's recording sessions. Apart from working with David Bowie, Dennis Davis also collaborated with other notable artists, such as Stevie Wonder, George Benson, Roy Ayers, and Iggy Pop. Throughout his career, he managed to leave his mark on various genres, excelling in both live and studio performances. In summary, Dennis Davis played drums on \\"Fame\\" by David Bowie, producing an iconic groove that complemented Bowie's work and helped propel the song to the top of the charts. Davis' versatile drumming style made him a go-to choice not only for Bowie but also for many acclaimed artists in the music industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

People thought that poetry was the new rock 'n' roll. However, despite the brief popularity of a few pop poets, poetry and pop music didn't seem to mix. But are they really so different? If you look back at the origins of poetry, there is a strong connection between poems and popular music. In Greek mythology, for example, the muse   Erato is pictured with a lyre   in her hand, and looks just like the ancestor of the modern rock star with his electric guitar. In addition, the poets Shelley and Byron were as famous in the nineteenth century as the pop stars of today. But despite their common origins, there are many differences between poetry and pop music. Pop songs are always written for a public performance, whereas poetry often isn't. And the lyrics in pop songs sometimes have less rhythm than those in poetry. This is because the music provides the rhythm rather than the words. Pop lyrics are also simpler and often keep on saying the same thing. This repetition works well in a performance and means that pop songs are easier for people to sing and learn by heart. Both songs and poems tell a story or talk about feelings. Songs in particular deal with the different stages in a relationship, such as falling in love or breaking up. The words and ideas in songs are usually easier to understand than those in \\"serious\\" poetry. However, talented performers like Paul McCartney, or newer stars like Robbe Williams, often give simple songs more expression when they perform them. And some of the best lines from pop lyrics are as beautiful as poetry. So although pop music and poetry have many differences, they do have one important thing in common: the power to make us think about how we feel. Question: According to the article, the difference between poetry and pop songs is that   _  . Options: A: there is more rhythm in pop songs than poetry B: pop songs are more difficult to understand than poetry C: some words in pop songs are repeated over and over again D: pop songs are not always performed before audience","output":"According to the article, the difference between poetry and pop songs is that C: some words in pop songs are repeated over and over again."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter Movie plot: Young girls are literally being drained of their youth, so Dr Marcus [John Carson] sends for professional vampire hunter Captain Kronos [Horst Janson] who brings along his hunchbacked assistant Professor Hieronymous Grost [John Cater] and Carla [Caroline Munro], a girl they saved from a stockade. After investigating the most recent murder, Kronos and the Professor stop at an inn along the way where a wiseass named Kerro [Ian Hendry] insults the hunchbacked professor and draws a sword on Kronos. In lightning speed, Kronos shows his skill with the sword (NOTE: cool scene).Meanwhile, Dr Marcus goes to visit the Durward mansion where brother Paul [Shane Briant] and sister Sara [Lois Daine] live with Lady Durward [Wanda Ventham], their grieving mother who has been brooding since the death of her husband from a disease once treated by Dr Marcus. Riding away from the Durward mansion, Marcus meets up with a cloaked figure. Shortly thereafter, Marcus begins to turn vampire. Kronos tries to kill Marcus by staking and then hanging. No dice until Marcus is pierced by a small cross made of steel. Prof Grost fashions a steel sword with a cross handle, and he and Kronos go back into the words to search for the vampire. A coach goes by. Grost tosses a dead toad under the coach. After the coach passes over it, the toad is alive, proof that a vampire is in the Durward coach.Posing as bait, Carla wanders up to the Durward mansion and requests shelter. Later, as she lies on a couch before the fireplace, she is approached by a woman who mesmerizes her. It is Lady Durward, who reveals that she is Karnstein by birth and that Lord Durward [William Hobbs] has been reawakened. Lady Durward offers Carla to him. Fortunately, Kronos enters the room and deflects Lady Durward's gaze, mesmerizing her instead. As everyone stands around mesmerized, Lord Durward and Kronos sword fight. Kronos drops his cross, but the professor tosses it to him in the nick of time. Lord Durward dies. Lady Durward attacks Kronos, but he kills her, too. In the...

Thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes in Munich as experts today tried to defuse a 550lb Allied bomb dropped on the city during WW2. The undetonated explosive was found beneath ground at the site of the former Schwabinger 7 nightclub, a hangout of the Rolling Stones in the 1970s. Bomb disposal teams fear its complex chemical fuse could trigger a repeat of the 2010 tragedy when three experts were killed in a blast in another German city. Scroll down for video. Deadly: Bomb disposal expert Diethard Posorski next to the 550lb bomb discovered in Munich. Close up: The bomb, which was dropped by either American and British planes in either 1944 or 1945. Team leader Diethard Posorski said: 'That is a chemical delayed-action detonator. I am not defusing that - I’m not suicidal.' So, rather than defusing the bomb, experts plan to surround it with sand and carry out a controlled explosion as the site. 2.8million tons Weight of all U.S. and British bombs dropped on Germany (54% USAAF) 75,000 tons Weight of Luftwaffe bombs dropped on Britain. 543,000 Germans lost their lives in WWII air raids. 60,000 Britons killed by German bombs. 390,000 Sorties flown by RAF bombers. 2,500 unexploded bombs yet to be found in Munich, according to experts. 5% The proportion of bombs that failed to detonate. A large timber shell was today built around the bomb, which is believed to have been dropped in 1944 or 1945 by either British or American forces. The controlled explosion is likely to take place tomorrow morning. Only then will the 2,500 people living within a 1,000-yard radius of the site in the Schwabing area close to the city centre. A nearby subway station has also been closed as well as parts of Leopoldstrasse, one of Munich’s busiest streets. It is unknown whether American or British planes dropped the bomb, which was discovered as diggers tore a building down. Both countries used the same type of 550lb explosives and rust is understood to have obscured any identifying marks. During the war Royal Air Force and U.S. Army Air Force are estimated to have dropped around 50,000 bombs on Munich. City officials believe that 2,500 unexploded payloads – around 5 per cent of the total dropped - are still buried in the Bavarian capital. Precaution: The bomb, which cannopt be defused, is covered with sand bags ahead of a planned controlled blast. Cordon: A German police officer guards a section of Leopoldstrasse, which has been sealed off along with a a 1,000-yard radius area. A total of 2,500 people have been evacuated. And they pose a huge problem in all of Germany, where barely a week goes by without a new discovery. It is unusual, however, to find a bomb in such a densely populated areas as most undetonated explosives tend to be uncovered outside big urban zones. Allies dropped of 2.8million tons during WWII, massively eclipsing the 75,000  tons unleashed by the Luftwaffe on Britain. By the war’s end, the USAAF had dropped 1.5million tons of bombs on the country and the RAF 1.3million tons. British bombers alone flew a total of 390,000 sorties. Locked out: Evacutated people in an aid station in Munich, where they will have to stay until Wednesday. Round-up: German police officers evacuating apartment buildings after the bomb was found. Sealed off: Recovery vehicles parked on Leopoldstrasse, which has been blocked to traffic. As a result, few towns escaped extensive damage from air raids and, by 1945, 543,000 civilians had been killed by the allied assault, compared with 60,000 in Britain. The worst air raid occurred in Dresden when, over two days, at least 30,000 civilians were killed in attacks by the RAF and the USAAF. Last week a similar 550lb bomb was found in Nuremberg and experts fear that the dud payloads are becoming more dangerous due to ‘material fatigue’. Already 67 years have passed since Germany’s defeat and over time the safety elements in the trigger mechanisms are increasingly wearing away. It means that some bombs could explode before being discovered and others will be more difficult to defuse. In the most deadly incident in recent years, three bomb disposal experts were blown to bits in June 2010 as they attempted to defuse an American bomb in the northern university city of Göttingen.

Because it didn't explode a long time ago, experts have to safely remove it. A lot of people had to leave their houses so that the bomb can be removed safely. The bomb was likely dropped by British or American forces during the war. Munich officials think there are still many unexploded bombs in the city. The experts will try to carefully explode the bomb with sand around it to keep everyone safe."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Thet Sambath Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Whispers from the Shadows\\" Genre: Drama, Mystery, History Plot Summary: The film tells the story of a courageous and persistent journalist named Thet Sambath in his quest for the truth. In present-day Cambodia, Sambath, a talented young journalist, remains haunted by the crimes committed during the Khmer Rouge reign in the late 1970s. Unable to forget the horrors that took his own parents' lives, he embarks on an unforgettable journey to bring the dark past to light. Act 1: Sambath discovers a clue during his investigation: the reclusive Khmer Rouge leader, Nuon Chea, also known as Brother #2, is still alive and hiding in the depths of Cambodia. Fueled by his need for justice and to uncover the truth, Sambath decides to confront the man who may hold the key to understanding the genocide. He seeks support and advice from fellow journalists and history professors about what the public knows about Nuon Chea's role in the genocide, only to be met with reluctance and fear. Act 2: Undeterred by the challenges he faces, Sambath travels through rural Cambodia, investigating leads, seeking eyewitness accounts, and developing new connections that will ultimately lead him to Nuon Chea. Slowly, he gains the trust of the local villagers who provide critical pieces of information about Nuon Chea's location. Along the journey, Sambath wrestles with his personal emotions, torn between his desire for revenge and his duty to reveal the truth about the darkest period in Cambodian history. Act 3: With the help of a local villager named Sokha, played by Sareum Srey Moch, Sambath finally locates Nuon Chea, now a frail old man living in secrecy. As he interviews Nuon Chea, Sambath unfolds the story of the Khmer Rouge regime and the atrocities committed against the Cambodian population. In a series of powerful and emotionally charged conversations, Sambath faces off against the living ghost of his past, forcing him to confront his own internal battle of forgiveness and justice. Despite the chilling revelations of the interview, Sambath manages to maintain his composure and records the conversation for the world to witness, exposing the truth behind the ruthless regime. Finale: As the film reaches its climax, the relationship between Sambath and Sokha deepens, and together they find solace through their shared experiences and losses. Nuon Chea, faced with undeniable proof and the weight of the truth, finally acknowledges his part in the tragedy. The final scene shows Sambath releasing the interview to the public, allowing the long-suppressed truth to emerge from the shadows, offering a sense of closure to the survivors and a chance for their stories to be remembered. In the end, \\"Whispers from the Shadows\\" serves as a reminder of the lasting impact of the Khmer Rouge's brutal regime, and the relentless quest for truth and healing, making it a powerful and poignant drama that gracefully walks the fine line between the past and the present."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 2007, Newsweek published an influential cover story proclaiming it \\"the most dangerous country in the world.\\" The bill of particulars for this indictment typically includes the inarguable facts that the Taliban is headquartered in Pakistan, as is what remains of al-Qaeda, as well as an alphabet soup of other jihadist terrorist groups. And in 2011, it became embarrassingly clear that Pakistan had harbored Osama bin Laden for almost a decade, even if unwittingly, in a city not far from the capital, Islamabad. Leading Pakistani liberals are routinely assassinated by militants. Two-time Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was killed when she returned from exile in 2007. But there is another side to Pakistan that suggests some underlying strengths that don't make quite as good copy as the OPTIONS: - Benazir Bhutto marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. - Bergen marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. - CNN marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. - India marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. - Islamabad marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. - Newsweek marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. - Osama bin Laden marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. - Pakistan marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. - Pakistani marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. - Peter Bergen marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. - Taliban marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. - West marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. - al-Qaeda marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009.","output":"- Taliban marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009.

The other options can be eliminated for various reasons: - Benazir Bhutto, Bergen, CNN, Newsweek, Peter Bergen, and West are not the appropriate subject since they are either individuals, media/publications, or geopolitical entities and not the relevant militant groups mentioned in the passage. - India and Islamabad are incorrect because they refer to a neighboring country and the capital city itself, which are not the subjects of the passage. - Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda are not correct because the passage is focusing on a specific event in 2009 (the march towards Islamabad) which these options do not fit. - Pakistan and Pakistani are incorrect because they are too general and do not refer to a specific militant group or event."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.  - Carnivora (from Latin \\"car\\" (stem \\"carn-\\") \\"flesh\\" and \\"vorre\\" \\"to devour\\") is a diverse order that includes over 280 species of placental mammals. Its members are formally referred to as carnivorans, whereas the word \\"carnivore\\" (often popularly applied to members of this group) can refer to any meat-eating organism. Carnivorans are the most diverse in size of any mammalian order, ranging from the least weasel (\\"Mustela nivalis\\"), at as little as and , to the polar bear (\\"Ursus maritimus\\"), which can weigh up to , to the southern elephant seal (\\"Mirounga leonina\\"), whose adult males weigh up to and measure up to in length.  - Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. \\"True rats\\" are members of the genus \\"Rattus\\", the most important of which to humans are the black rat, \\"Rattus rattus\\", and the brown rat, \\"Rattus norvegicus\\". Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats.  - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.  - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.  - Guatemala (, or ), officially the Republic of Guatemala, is a country in Central America bordered by Mexico to the north and west, the Pacific Ocean to the southwest, Belize to the northeast, the Caribbean to the east, Honduras to the east and El Salvador to the southeast. With an estimated population of around 15.8 million, it is the most populated state in Central America. A representative democracy, Guatemala's capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción, also known as Guatemala City.  - Omnivore is a consumption classification for animals that have the capability to obtain chemical energy and nutrients from materials originating from plant and animal origin. Often, omnivores also have the ability to incorporate food sources such as algae, fungi, and bacteria into their diet as well.  - Central America is the southernmost, isthmian portion of the North American continent, which connects with South America on the southeast. Central America is bordered by Mexico to the north, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Central America consists of seven countries: Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. The combined population of Central America is between 41,739,000 (2009 estimate) and 42,688,190 (2012 estimate).  - An endotherm (from Greek  \\"endon\\" \\"within\\" and  \\"therm\\" \\"heat\\") is an organism that maintains its body at a metabolically favorable temperature, largely by the use of heat set free by its internal bodily functions instead of relying almost purely on ambient heat. Such internally generated heat is mainly an incidental product of the animal's routine metabolism, but under conditions of excessive cold or low activity an endotherm might apply special mechanisms adapted specifically to heat production. Examples include special-function muscular exertion such as shivering, and uncoupled oxidative metabolism such as within brown adipose tissue. Only birds and mammals are extant universally endothermic groups of animals. Certain lamnid sharks, tuna and billfishes are also endothermic.  - Theria (Greek: \\"\\", wild beast) is a subclass of mammals amongst the Theriiformes (the sister taxa to Yinotheria). Theria includes the eutherians (including the placental mammals) and the metatherians (including the marsupials).  - A mammary gland is an exocrine gland in mammals that produces milk to feed young offspring. Mammals get their name from the word \\"mammary\\". The mammary glands are arranged in organs such as the breasts in primates (for example, humans and chimpanzees), the udder in ruminants (for example, cows, goats, and deer), and the dugs of other animals (for example, dogs and cats). Lactorrhea, the occasional production of milk by the glands, can occur in any mammal, but in most mammals lactation, the production of enough milk for nursing, occurs only in phenotypic females who have gestated in recent months or years. It is directed by hormonal guidance from sex steroids. In a few mammalian species, male lactation can occur.  - Synapsids (Greek, 'fused arch'), synonymous with theropsids (Greek, 'beast-face'), are a group of animals that includes mammals and every animal more closely related to mammals than to other living amniotes. They are easily separated from other amniotes by having a temporal fenestra, an opening low in the skull roof behind each eye, leaving a bony arch beneath each; this accounts for their name. Primitive synapsids are usually called pelycosaurs or pelycosaur-grade synapsids; more advanced mammal-like ones, therapsids. The non-mammalian members are described as mammal-like reptiles in classical systematics; they can also be called stem mammals or proto-mammals. Synapsids evolved from basal amniotes and are one of the two major groups of the later amniotes; the other is the sauropsids, a group that includes modern reptiles and birds. The distinctive temporal fenestra developed in the ancestral synapsid about 312 million years ago, during the Late Carboniferous period.  - Panama City is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Panama. It has an urban population of 430,299, and its population totals 880,691 when rural areas are included. The city is located at the Pacific entrance of the Panama Canal, in the province of Panama. The city is the political and administrative center of the country, as well as a hub for international banking and commerce. It is considered a \\"gamma+\\" world city, one of three Central American cities listed in this category.  - Sauropsida (\\"lizard faces\\") is a group of amniotes that includes all existing birds and reptiles as well as their fossil ancestors and other extinct relatives. Large land animals are either in this group or in its sister group, Synapsida, which includes mammals and their fossil relatives. This clade includes Parareptilia and other extinct clades. All living sauropsids are members of the sub-group Diapsida, the Parareptilia clade having died out 200 million years ago. The term originated in 1864 with Thomas Henry Huxley, who grouped birds with reptiles based on fossil evidence.  - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León.  - Miacoidea is a paraphyletic superfamily that had been traditionally divided into two families of carnivores: Miacidae (the miacids) and Viverravidae. Miacoids were primitive carnivores that lived during the Paleocene and Eocene Epochs, about 33-66 million years ago. Today, Miacidae is recognized as a paraphyletic array of stem taxa that probably resulted in some \\"miacid\\" genera ending up just outside the order Carnivora, the crown-group within the Carnivoramorpha. Carnivoramorpha consists of both Miacoidea and Carnivora, but excludes the order Creodonta that existed alongside Carnivoramorpha. Miacoids are regarded as basal carnivoramorphs. The miacids are a paraphyletic group containing all miacoids that are not viverravids.  - In an ecosystem, predation is a biological interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked). Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption. Thus predation is often, though not always, carnivory. Other categories of consumption are herbivory (eating parts of plants), fungivory (eating parts of fungi), and detritivory (the consumption of dead organic material). All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems. It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors. For example, some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse after it has died. The key characteristic of predation however is the predator's direct impact on the prey population. On the other hand, detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead individuals and have no direct impact on the \\"donor\\" organism(s).  - Hair is a protein filament that grows from follicles found in the dermis, or skin. Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals. The human body, apart from areas of glabrous skin, is covered in follicles which produce thick terminal and fine vellus hair. Most common interest in hair is focused on hair growth, hair types and hair care, but hair is also an important biomaterial primarily composed of protein, notably keratin.  - Mustelodon is an extinct carnivore , which belongs to the family Viverravidae . This genus contains only one species , Mustelodon primerus . Fossils of this mammal were found in the 57 million years old deposits of Lago Nandarajo , near the northern border of Panama in Central America . Mustelodon had a length of approximately 80 cm ( head to tail ) and this carnivore superficially resembled the modern mongooses . Mustelodon fed on fruits , insects and smaller mammals like shrews . It is closely related to the more famous Protictis from the Paleocene of the United States ( Wannagan Creek - South Dakota , San Juan Basin - New Mexico ) .  - A carnivore meaning 'meat eater' (Latin, \\"caro\\" meaning 'meat' or 'flesh' and \\"vorare\\" meaning 'to devour') is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue, whether through predation or scavenging. Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called obligate carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called facultative carnivores. Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore. A carnivore that sits at the top of the food chain is termed an apex predator.  - Costa Rica (literally meaning \\"Rich Coast\\"), officially the Republic of Costa Rica, is a country in Central America, bordered by Nicaragua to the north, Panama to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and Ecuador to the south of Cocos Island. It has a population of around 4.5 million, of whom nearly a quarter live in the metropolitan area of the capital and largest city, San José.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish.   - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - Viverravidae is an extinct family within the superfamily Miacoidea. They are related to carnivorans, and lived from the early Palaeocene to the Eocene.  - Theriiformes is a subclass of mammals. The term was coined in 1997 by McKenna & Bell in their classification of mammals.  - Panama, officially called the Republic of Panama, is a country usually considered to be entirely in North America or Central America. It is bordered by Costa Rica to the west, Colombia (in South America) to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the south. The capital and largest city is Panama City, whose metropolitan area is home to nearly half of the country's 3.9 million people.

In front of the Louvre Museum. Under the Eiffel Tower. In the Luxembourg Gardens. In front of luxury hotels and mansions. Sometimes even in parking lots.      A rage, a trend, a new tradition feeding a lucrative branch of the tourism industry and spreading not only around the most romantic city of the world, but to many other places in France, Great Britain, Greece, Italy and other European countries.      Traveling from all over Asia, including Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Indonesia and Malaysia, brides and grooms arrive by the hundreds every month to pose in their wedding outfits for romantic photos alongside some of the most famous landmarks - and lately next to less well-known sites.      In Paris, they're becoming as ubiquitous as street vendors.      Although they look like newlyweds, clad in white wedding dresses, veils, tuxedos, flowers and all the accoutrements, they are, in fact, \\"pre-wedding\\" events organized just for the photos. The real wedding takes place back home, sometimes months later, where showing the portraits as slide shows, posters and videos on big screens is an important part of the celebration.      “Most couples take the wedding photos months before the wedding, and it can be a complicated and arduous process that demands days of effort, numerous costume changes, exotic locations and a huge budget, with some shoots costing as much as 15,000,\\" according to research on the pre-wedding industry by Li Zhaoping at China’s Saimaa University. \\"As opposed to Western couples who seek wedding pictures that capture real moments, Asian couples want elaborate photos that reflect their romantic fantasies.”      It's not a new fad. In reality, affluent Asian couples have been doing it for years. What's new is that thanks to cheaper travel, their numbers have been steadily growing, creating a prosperous industry that now offers one or multiple photographers, many choices of romantic sites throughout Europe and more than just stylish photos in wedding finery.      Florists, hair dressers, makeup artists, brand party gowns, shoes, limos and vintage cars are part of the packages destined to fulfill couples' most romantic dreams - at least in pictures.      “A love dream that has a price of about €2,000 to travel to Paris from miles away to take dozens of photos in one day and bring them back home,” explains France 2.      An article in Le Monde about the particular tourist wave reports that there are several “wedding agencies” in Paris where the couples can rent either red dresses, which is traditional Chinese, or bride white dresses “a la Parisienne,” shoes, tuxedos, jewels, lace and veils, and arrange hairdressing and makeup.      “In the basement, the brides can try hairstyles and have makeup tests,\\" one such agency manager told the paper. \\"On the day of the photos, they will be manicured and adorned with false eyelashes.”      Many choose to change multiple times during shoots and appear in glamorous gowns and chic outfits to obtain dreamy images against romantic backdrops like England's White Cliffs of Dover, lavender fields in the south of France, the island of Santorini in Greece and Big Ben in London.      A beautiful, 13th-century Cotswold parish church, for example, got caught up in the fad after a couple took beautiful quintessentially English photos there. Bath and the Lake District are also very popular.      Some of the expanding services offer elaborate extremes in sessions that can last several days, with lavish photos in flimsy frocks on location such as famous ski resorts for photos in the snow, or at places where popular movies or TV series were filmed.      In a South China Morning Post article about the popular tradition it calls “The Downton Abbey effect on Chinese pre-wedding photo shoots,” the paper finds that “fueled by the popular period drama, hundreds of middle-class couples fly to Britain every year and spend thousands of pounds to hire teams of photographers for shoots in locations such as Oxford, Cambridge, Brighton, York and Cornwall’s Land’s End.”      The trend, according to the paper, “has been fueled in part by the popularity of Downton Abbey, which drew 160 million viewers in China, and by a Chinese superstar singer-actor, Jay Chou, who married in Yorkshire's Selby Abbey, then held a reception in Castle Howard, made famous by the 1980s TV adaptation of Evelyn Waugh’s Brideshead Revisited.\\"      A £5,000 fee at Castle Howard, which is one of the high-end packages, includes entry and a day of shots inside and outside. A carriage and horse costs another £550.      An average package starts at €1,000 for basic nuptial photos at a landmark. Adding two other locations can cost an additional €500 to €1,000, depending of the distance.      “On a sweltering hot July afternoon,” describes the South China Morning Post, “they spend four hours earnestly kissing, holding hands, striking film-star poses and running through lavender in what looks like an exhausting session. For one series of shots, the groom carries his betrothed in his arms for 30 paces.”      Many other places in France, Britain and other countries are aspiring to achieve a spot on the map of pre-wedding photos choices.      According to Le Monde, the booming Asian pre-wedding industry in France - “homeland of romanticism, offering its most beautiful shots to couples from the Far East, among pigeons flying in front of Notre-Dame, dancing in a French garden, at a Bateau-Mouche sailing in front of the illuminated Eiffel tower, at a castle of the XV century or among fields of lavender” - is estimated to be worth more than €1 billion per year. ||||| A couple is photographed in June 2015 at Inside Only Photo Studio on the outskirts of Shanghai. The studio houses three floors of sets for wedding photos, including rooms of dresses and suits.      Red dresses, stylists, camera crews and a perfect kiss in front of a sandstone building. On any given weekday, The Bund in Shanghai looks like a scene from a European rom-com. Couples dressed in colorful, elaborate formalwear bustle from site to site, enacting fairytale scenes of marriage, with a team of stylists and photographers in tow.      Intrigued by the enchanting entourage, passerby and photographer Olivia Martin-McGuire inquired about the phenomena only to learn that it was not a mass wedding or movie, but a rather common pre-wedding photo shoot. “I was enchanted by an entire nation of adults dressing-up in fantasy attire as part of a new national ritual,\\" she says as she started documenting the shoots.      Pre-wedding photography is a lucrative, multi-billion dollar industry in China, adding a playful, new custom to a country deeply rooted in ancient traditions. Martin-McGuire was drawn to the fantasy shoots that gave “a view into another facet of China not so readily portrayed by the media – color, optimism, enthusiasm and a unique ability to play.” In decades past, Martin-McGuire says wedding photos served primarily as proof of the marriage, consisting of a single black-and-white photograph. Now, the pre-wedding photo shoot involves multiple backdrops, settings and costumes.      Positioning herself behind the wedding photographer, Martin-McGuire looks to make photos from the vantage point of a choreographer. “I am fascinated by the entire set-up,” she says, “and that obviously includes the image-makers themselves.”      The lengths a couple will go to for a perfect shoot are extensive. One high-end studio provides three floors of sets and rooms of wardrobe changes. Others venture out into exotic locations, even those that seem unreachable. Martin-McGuire recalled a November outing to see the famous misty valleys in Guilin, enduring an hour climb in the rain to reach the summit. “Of course, here at the summit I discovered a team of pre-wedding photographers and a couple with a ballooning gown and bags of outfits. They had somehow carried everything up for the shoot!”      The photo shoots, which Martin-McGuire says can surpass 100,000 for high-end productions, are ultimately displayed prominently during the betrothed’s wedding. But, the parade of photography does not stop then as the couple is also expected to take a portrait with each of their guests.      Olivia Martin-McGuire is an an Australian photographer based in Shanghai.      Chelsea Matiash is TIME's Deputy Multimedia Editor.

Subject: A woman 2. Action: Giving a presentation 3. Recipients: A group of people sitting in chairs Meanwhile, the second statement \\"a man gives a long lecture\\" involves a different scenario with different subjects and actions: 1. Subject: A man 2. Action: Giving a long lecture (which can be slightly different from a presentation) 3. Recipients: Not specified in this statement To determine if the second statement logically follows the first, one must analyze the connections or relationships between the subjects, actions, and recipients involved in both statements. In this case, there are no direct connections or relationships between the two statements: - The subject in the first statement is a woman, while the subject in the second statement is a man. - The action in the first statement is giving a presentation, whereas the action in the second statement is giving a long lecture. While lectures and presentations can be similar in certain contexts, they are not synonymous and can have differences in purpose, format, length, and style. - The recipients in the first statement are people sitting in chairs, while the recipients in the second statement are not specified.

Sometimes it may be hard to get into a book, even if you have a comfy spot, good lighting, and no distractions. If there aren’t any immediate time constraints, consider putting down the book and coming back to it at a later time. Try to choose a more relaxing time to revisit the book. For instance, you may find that you are better able to focus early in the morning, after working out, or when all your chores or tasks are done for the day. Your brain absorbs the unfolding of the story and information better when you read paper books. This is because you can observe the thickness of the book and use your body to interact with it (turning the pages, for example) while reading. If you prefer e-readers, that’s okay too! However, if you are struggling to understand books, try reading a paper one and take note of any changes that occur in your comprehension. When you get to the end of a chapter or section of a book, stop and ask yourself if you understand the major themes and events. If you recall what happened and have a good understanding, feel free to proceed. If you don’t, though, you should refresh your memory by going back over the previous pages, chapters, or sections. Keep a notebook next to you while you read. Use several different pieces of paper to keep track of main characters or key terms, major plot points, big-picture questions, and things that confuse you. You can refer to these notes later to remember what the book was about. This is especially helpful for academic texts. When reading a book for pleasure, however, frequently stopping can disrupt the flow of your reading. Talking about books is a great way to really understand them. Other people may notice things you didn’t, and vice versa. Talk to your friends or go to your local library to join or organize a club.

Unlike \\"ante,\\" which simply refers to the initial bet placed by each player, \\"skill\\" encompasses a wide range of abilities that contribute to consistent success in poker. These skills include, but are not limited to: 1. Understanding the rules and mechanics of the game: This foundational knowledge is essential to making informed decisions at the poker table. 2. Reading opponents: Skilled players can assess their opponents' playing styles, strengths, and weaknesses, allowing them to make better decisions about how to counter their moves. 3. Hand reading: This involves estimating the likely strength of an opponent's hand based on their actions and betting patterns. 4. Mathematical knowledge: Knowing the odds of hitting certain hands or outs (cards that will improve a player's hand) is crucial for making smart decisions about whether to call, raise, or fold. 5. Emotional control: Staying calm under pressure and avoiding \\"tilt\\" (making poor decisions due to emotional responses) can help a player maintain their strategic edge. 6. Bankroll management: Understanding how to manage one's funds is crucial to avoiding large losses and staying in the game. 7. Strategy and adaptability: A skilled poker player constantly adjusts their strategy based on the game's dynamics, their opponents, and changing situations.

Shocked to see his \\"Evil Master\\", Burch drives off a bridge and into the river. Elliot emerges from the accident scene, only to learn that he is a ghost when a police officer fails to notice him and a speeding bus goes straight through him. When he gets home he discovers that his three children can see him, but only in a totally dark room, and they can't hear him at times. He struggles to tell them what happened when he is whisked away to London by paranormal researcher Sir Edith, who tells him he is a ghost who has yet to enter the afterlife because \\"they screwed up\\"; his soul will not cross over until Thursday. The pressures of work and family life lead to many comedic events, as Elliot attempts to renew his life insurance policy and complete his company's merger, so his family will be provided for once he crosses over. One day, he must choose between staying in an important work meeting and helping his son with a magic trick at school. He eventually decides that his family's happiness is more important and walks out on his furious boss, Mr. Collins, who later smugly fires him. Dejected, Elliot reveals himself as a ghost to his love interest, Joan, whose initial shock soon turns to sympathy.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is some data:  YEAR 1970; 1970 JANUARY Jill Taylor;   List of Playboy Playmates of the Month 1970-1979. Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"The data provided indicates information relating to Playboy Magazine's Playmates of the Month for the decade of 1970-1979. This would be a ten-year span of monthly features carried out by Playboy, a popular adult entertainment magazine that's prominent for its provocative photography and cultural impact.  One key piece of information mentioned in the data is the year 1970 and the specificity of '1970 January Jill Taylor'. This implies that Jill Taylor was the playmate for the month of January in 1970, i.e., she was the model featured in Playboy Magazine's centerfold and main pictorial for that upcoming month. Playboy, founded by Hugh Hefner in 1953, is an American men's lifestyle and entertainment magazine that has played a substantial part in the sexual revolution and remains an influential platform in modern America's societal standards for beauty and attractiveness.  The Playboy Playmates of the Month are a characteristic aspect of Playboy Magazine. Every month, a young woman is chosen to be a Playmate and is featured in the magazine with a centerfold picture and a detailed pictorial. These Playmates are often up-and-coming models or actresses, but occasionally they include celebrities too. The selected Playmate of the Month is also considered for the prestigious title of 'Playmate of the Year'.  The 'Playmates of the Month' for the 1970-1979 decade would signify a comprehensive list of all the women who held the title during these years. Such a list would encapsulate a detailed dossier of 120 models (12 months x 10 years), chronicling an era significant for its contributions to evolving cultural norms and acceptance of societal nudity. It should be noted that such compilations not merely represent the aesthetic trends of the time and the evolving perceptions of beauty, but they also indicate other societal changes, such as shifting attitudes towards women's autonomy. Each entry in this data, structured as 'Year Month Name', would likely represent the Playmate for the specified month and year, indicating her ascendancy to the Playboy pantheon during this period. Studying the data provides a reference point for understanding the zeitgeist of the era, the shifting sociocultural context, and the evolving standards of beauty and sexuality in society. Furthermore, it represents the professional trajectory and public recognition of the individuals featured.  To summarize, this data signifies a list documenting the Playboy Playmates of the Month for each month from 1970-1979, with the month, year, and name of the playmate. For instance, the mention of '1970 JANUARY Jill Taylor' indicates that Jill Taylor was the feature in the January 1970 issue of Playboy Magazine."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Eric asked Ian to teach their child how speak Spanish because","output":"he believed in the benefits of raising a bilingual child. Ian, who was fluent in Spanish, agreed and started devising a plan, step by step, to help their young child learn the language. Step 1: Language Exposure First, Ian decided to expose their child to Spanish by creating a language-rich environment at home. He made it a point to speak to the child in Spanish for certain parts of the day. He also played Spanish music, put up posters with Spanish words, and replaced commonly used items in the house with ones labeled in Spanish. By doing so, Ian believed that the child would naturally associate objects and emotions with their Spanish terms. Step 2: Vocabulary Building Once their child became familiar with the sounds of the Spanish language, Ian started focusing on building their vocabulary. He taught the child commonly used nouns, verbs, and adjectives in Spanish. Ian would show flashcards, name objects in both English and Spanish, and engage the child in simple conversations to reinforce the new words they've learned. Step 3: Sentence Construction Building on the vocabulary that the child now knew, Ian began to teach them how to construct simple sentences. He started by teaching the child basic grammar rules and conjugations. To make it more engaging, Ian created fun activities and games to provide ample practice for sentence construction. Step 4: Interactive Learning To help immerse their child further into the Spanish language, Ian sought out opportunities to engage in conversations with native speakers. They visited local Spanish-speaking communities and used video calls to communicate with Spanish-speaking relatives. This gave the child a chance to practice their newfound skills with a variety of different people and accents. Step 5: Bilingual Media Consumption Ian encouraged the child to consume media in Spanish, such as cartoons, movies, and books, to reinforce the language and develop listening comprehension skills. This allowed the child to gain familiarity with conversational Spanish and everyday language used by native speakers. Step 6: Regular Practice Finally, Ian emphasized the importance of regular practice and made a schedule to ensure that their child spent enough time learning and practicing Spanish. Consistency was key in helping their child become a proficient Spanish speaker. Though the process was slow and steady, Ian's dedication and patience paid off as the child progressively became more and more comfortable speaking Spanish. Eric admired the hard work and effort Ian put into teaching their child a second language, and they both knew that the linguistic abilities would open up a world of opportunities for their child's future."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

'Prostitute' accused of injecting Google executive with lethal dose of heroin Alix Tichelman appears at Santa Cruz superior court following the death of Forrest Hayes, a Google executive. Photograph: Shmuel Thaler/AP An alleged prostitute, accused of injecting heroin into a Google executive on his yacht in California and leaving him to die when he overdosed, appeared in court on Wednesday on manslaughter and heroin charges. Alix Tichelman, 26, in handcuffs and a red jumpsuit, did not enter a plea and was appointed a public defender. She is being held on 1.5m (£900,000) bail. Surveillance footage from the yacht shows Tichelman gather her belongings, including the heroin and needles, step over the 51-year-old victim's body to finish a glass of wine and then lower a blind before leaving the boat, Santa Cruz police said. Police said Tichelman did not provide first aid or call emergency services as the man, identified as Forrest Timothy Hayes, suffered medical complications and lost consciousness during the November overdose aboard his 50ft (15-metre) yacht, Escape. His body was discovered the next morning by the boat's captain, police said. Police are also investigating Tichelman in connection with a similar incident in another state, the Santa Cruz deputy police chief, Steve Clark, said. \\"There's a pattern of behaviour here where she doesn't seek help when someone is in trouble,\\" he said. Tichelman's lawyer, Diana August, did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Assistant district attorney Rafael Vazquez said authorities are still investigating the case and may file more serious charges. Tichelman was arrested on 4 July after police said a detective lured her back to the Santa Cruz area by posing as a potential client and reaching agreement on a price of more than 1,000. Police said Tichelman, who boasted she had more than 200 clients, met her clients through the website SeekingArrangement.com, which purports to connect wealthy men and women with attractive companions.

Located east-northeast of Charing Cross, it is one of the locally important district centres identified in the London Plan, and comprises a number of shopping streets and a large residential area. It was historically, a rural village in Essex and formed an ancient parish. Although peripheral to London, the town has good transport links; it was first connected to central London by rail in 1885 and has a terminal station on the London Underground network. The economic history of Upminster is characterised by a shift from farming to garden suburb. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Upminster significantly expanded and increased in population, becoming part of Hornchurch Urban District in 1934, and has formed part of Greater London since 1965.  - Earl's Court is a district in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in central London, bordering the sub-districts of South Kensington to the east, West Kensington to the west, Chelsea to the south and Kensington to the north.

The line is owned and maintained by Network Rail and London Overground.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Buckinghamshire (or ), abbreviated Bucks, is a county in South East England which borders Greater London to the south east, Berkshire to the south, Oxfordshire to the west, Northamptonshire to the north, Bedfordshire to the north east and Hertfordshire to the east.  - Paddington is an area within the City of Westminster, in central London. Formerly a metropolitan borough, it was integrated with Westminster and Greater London in 1965.

Its head office is in Windsor House in the City of Westminster.  - In Great Britain, National Rail is the trading name licensed for use by the Rail Delivery Group, an unincorporated association whose membership consists of the passenger train operating companies (TOCs) of Great Britain that run the passenger services previously provided by the British Railways Board, from 1965 using the brand name British Rail. National Rail generally does not include services that do not have a BR history; this distinction is important because National Rail services share a ticketing structure and inter-availability that do not necessarily extend to other services. The name and the accompanying double arrow symbol are the intellectual property of the Secretary of State for Transport.  - The Piccadilly line is a line of the London Underground, coloured dark blue on the Tube map. It is the fourth busiest line on the Underground network on the basis of the number of passengers transported per year with 210,000,000. It is mainly a deep-level line, running from the north to the west of London via Zone 1, with a number of surface sections, mostly in its westernmost parts. It is named after the road above it between Hyde Park Corner and Piccadilly Circus. Some of its stations are shared with the District line and some are shared with the Metropolitan line. It is the second longest line on the system, after the Central line, and has the second most stations, after the District line. It serves many of London's top tourist attractions including Harrods (Knightsbridge), Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace (within walking distance from Green Park), Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square and Covent Garden, as well as London Heathrow Airport, the busiest airport in Europe. The line shares tracks with the Metropolitan line between Uxbridge and Rayners Lane, and with the District line between Hanger Lane Junction and Acton Town, then runs parallel with the District line between Acton Town and Barons Court.  - Edgware Road is a major road through north-west London, starting at Marble Arch in the City of Westminster (south end) and running north-west to Edgware in the London Borough of Barnet. It is also a boundary between several North London boroughs. The route has its origins as a Roman road (part of Watling Street) and therefore runs for 10 miles in an almost perfect straight line, which is unusual in London. It is part of the modern A5 road. It undergoes several name changes along its length, including Maida Vale, Kilburn High Road, Shoot Up Hill and Cricklewood Broadway; but the road is, as a whole, known as the Edgware Road, as it is the road to Edgware.  - The London Borough of Hounslow is a London borough in west London, England, forming part of Outer London. The borough stretches from near Central London in the east to the border with Surrey in the west, covering Chiswick, Brentford, Isleworth and Feltham in addition to Hounslow itself; it borders the boroughs of Richmond upon Thames, Hammersmith and Fulham, Ealing and Hillingdon, plus the Surrey borough of Spelthorne. Landmarks include Osterley Park, Gunnersbury Park, Syon House, the London Museum of Water & Steam and Chiswick House. The local authority is Hounslow London Borough Council.  - The London Overground (also known as the Overground) is a suburban rail network in the United Kingdom. Established in 2007, it serves a large part of Greater London and parts of Hertfordshire, with 112 stations on several routes. The network forms part of the National Rail network, but under the franchise control and branding of Transport for London (TfL). Operation has been franchised to Arriva Rail London since 13 November 2016.  - Network Rail is the owner (via its subsidiary Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd which was known as Railtrack plc before 2003)) and infrastructure manager of most of the rail network in England, Scotland and Wales. Network Rail is an arms length public body of the Department for Transport with no shareholders, which reinvests its income in the railways.  - The District line is a London Underground service that crosses Greater London from east to west. From Upminster, the eastern terminus, the line runs through Central London to Earl's Court before dividing into three western branches, to Ealing Broadway, Wimbledon and Richmond. There is a short branch that goes from Earl's Court to . A branch also runs north from Earl's Court to Edgware Road via Paddington. Coloured green on the tube map, the line serves 60 stations in , and with bridges across the Thames on the Wimbledon and Richmond branches is the only London Underground line to cross the river in this way. The track and stations between Barking and Aldgate East are shared with the Hammersmith & City line, and between Tower Hill and Gloucester Road and on the Edgware Road branch with the Circle line. Some of the stations are shared with the Piccadilly line. Unlike London's deep-level tube railways, the railway tunnels are just below the surface, and the trains are of a similar size to those on British main lines.  - Gunnersbury station is a London Underground and London Overground station in Gunnersbury in west London . The station , managed by London Underground , is served by District line trains to and from Richmond , and by London Overground trains on the North London Line .

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Market research firm IDC has raised  its 2004 forecast for global personal computer sales growth to  14.2 percent from 13.5 percent, driven by high commercial  demand, it said on Monday.","output":"This passage is about the International Data Corporation (IDC), an American market research firm, revising its global personal computer (PC) sales growth forecast for the year 2004. In this revision, IDC increased its projection of PC sales growth from 13.5 percent to 14.2 percent. The reason behind this growth adjustment is the high commercial demand for PCs during that period.  To provide a detailed analysis, let's break down the key aspects of this passage: 1. International Data Corporation (IDC): IDC is a premier global market research firm that specializes in providing market intelligence and advisory services for the information technology, telecommunications, and consumer technology markets. Founded in 1964, IDC is now a subsidiary of International Data Group (IDG), and its analyses and insights help industry leaders make informed business decisions about their products, services, and strategies. 2. 2004 Forecast: The year mentioned in the passage is 2004, which is a specific time period that this news is focused on. The PC market has always been affected by various factors, and over the past decades, there have been significant changes and developments in technology that impact the growth of the industry. During the 2000s, there was a wide adoption of computers and the internet, and businesses started increasingly relying on them for their operations. It is crucial to mention the year, as this context provides information on the state of the industry and market trends during that time. 3. Global Personal Computer Sales Growth: Personal computers allow users to perform various tasks, such as word processing, accessing the internet, and managing data. The worldwide sales growth of PCs is an important indicator of the health of the technology sector and the overall economy. In this context, IDC's projection is not just limited to a particular region or country but covers the entire global market for PC sales. 4. 14.2 percent from 13.5 percent: IDC increased its forecast for the growth of PC sales in 2004 to 14.2 percent, up from the previously predicted 13.5 percent. This represents a 0.7 percent increase in the expected growth. The change in the forecast signifies that IDC expects the industry's sales to perform better than initially anticipated. 5. Driven by High Commercial Demand: The main reason behind this increase in the forecasted PC sales growth is attributed to high commercial demand. This suggests that businesses and organizations were one of the key drivers for increased PC sales. The growing dependence on computers for the smooth functioning of businesses could have contributed to this higher demand. This also implies that the commercial sector was a significant factor in the growth of the PC market during that year. In conclusion, this passage is about IDC revising its 2004 global personal computer sales growth forecast to 14.2 percent, citing the reason behind this increase as high commercial demand for PCs. This showcases the importance of continuous analysis and monitoring of market trends for accurate forecasts, as well as the industry's reliance on commercial buyers for sustainable growth."},{"instruction":"The input is a tweet which can be Hate Speech or Offensive.

But if you want to raise new fish, you may want to add 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water to everything. Determine how many bodies of water to add per month, and how your tank will match those numbers.. 2). For their number, you should provide about 2-4 dead per gallon. They can live in a normal tank (if that is one), but aren't as likely to become aggressive with other fish.. 3).

Determine what size tank you want to place your fish in.. 4). Size your tank based on the adult size of the fish, not their current size. Platies get up to 2 inches (5.1 cm) long as adults..","output":"4). Size your tank based on the adult size of the fish, not their current size. Platies get up to 2 inches (5.1 cm) long as adults. To breed and care for platies, it is important to take into consideration their adult size, as this will directly affect the tank size, water quality, and overall health of the platies. Once you've determined the appropriate size of the tank based on the adult size of the fish, follow these steps to successfully breed and care for your platies: 1. Set up the tank: Prepare the tank with a filter, heater, and some stones or decorations to create a comfortable environment for your platies. The ideal temperature for platies is between 72°F to 78°F (22°C to 25°C). Make sure to cycle the tank for at least a month before introducing the fish to establish a stable environment. 2. Choose the ratio of male to female platies: The ideal ratio for breeding platies is one male per two or three females. This will prevent the females from becoming overly exhausted by continuous courtship and ensure a greater chance of successful breeding. 3. Provide hiding spots: Since platies are livebearers and can potentially eat their own fry (baby fish), it is crucial to provide hiding spots for the little ones to increase their chances of survival. This can be done with plants, rocks, or other decorations in the tank. 4. Feed a balanced diet: To encourage breeding and keep your fish healthy, provide high-quality flake or pellet food, as well as live or frozen foods, such as brine shrimp and daphnia, which can promote breeding behaviors. 5. Monitor water parameters: Regularly test your tank's water for ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels, and maintain a consistent pH of 7.0-8.2. Conduct a 10-20% water change weekly to keep the water parameters stable. 6. Watch for signs of pregnancy: Female platies can become pregnant shortly after being introduced to a male. A pregnant female will have a visibly rounder belly, and you may notice a dark spot near the anal fin, known as the gravid spot, which is an indicator that she is carrying eggs. 7. Separate pregnant females (optional): If you want to increase the survival rate of the fry, consider setting up a separate breeding tank or using a breeder net to accommodate the pregnant female. This will help protect the fry from being eaten by other tank mates once they are born. 8. Care for the fry: Once the fry are born, they must be fed a diet suitable for their size. Crushed flakes, infusoria, or other small and easily digestible foods are ideal for fry. As the fry grow and become more nimble, they can be transferred to the main tank. 9. Repeat the process: Platies can breed every month, so by maintaining a stable environment and appropriate breeding conditions, you will be able to continuously raise new generations of platies. By following these steps and providing the necessary care and attention to your platies, you can successfully breed and maintain a healthy population of these colorful and hardy fish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: More and more people are trying to learn English than any other language in the world. English is the world language of politics and international business. It becomes the international language of science, medicine, sports, travel and so on. In most schools in Asia, English is taught as the main foreign language. School children in China and Japan begin to learn English at an early age. English is the official language of more than seventy-five countries including Britain, Canada, the United States and Australia. Many different languages are spoken in some countries. However, English is often used as an official language to help people communicate with each other. India is a good example. English is the common language in this country, but at least twenty-four languages are spoken there. Do you know the history of English? Old English took many words from the French language. Most English words came from French, especially those words used for describing the law and the government, such as \\"damage\\",\\" prison \\"and \\" marriage\\". Then, English became what language experts   called Middle English. The history of English continues as Middle English, and then it becomes Modern English, and it is spoken today. ,. Question: What can we learn from the passage? Options: A: Students in Japan begin to learn English when they are young. B: English is the official language of all the countries in the world. C: English is used as an official language in many countries but not in India. D: Some words in English are only used for describing those people in prison and in marriage. Answer:","output":"From the passage, we can learn several key points about the English language. It informs us about the prominence of English in the global arena, its widespread use, its history, and how it's considered a vital language to learn, particularly in Asian countries such as China and Japan. According to option A, \\"students in Japan begin to learn English when they are young.\\" This statement aligns with the information given in the text. The passage clearly states, \\"School children in China and Japan begin to learn English at an early age.\\" Therefore, we can infer that this option accurately represents a fact from the passage. Option B states, \\"English is the official language of all the countries in the world.\\" This is incorrect. Although the text emphasizes the widespread usage of English, saying that it is the official language of more than seventy-five countries including Britain, Canada, the United States, and Australia, it does not claim that it is the official language of all the countries globally. Option C, \\"English is used as an official language in many countries but not in India,\\" is also incorrect. As per the passage, English is indeed used as a common language in India, even with the existence of over twenty-four other spoken languages in the country.  Lastly, option D, \\"Some words in English are only used for describing those people in prison and in marriage,\\" is not supported by information provided in the passage. The text states that certain English words, particularly those related to the law and government, have French roots; however, it does not suggest that these words are exclusively used to describe people in prison or marriage. In conclusion, out of the four options given, option A: \\"Students in Japan begin to learn English when they are young,\\" is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

To mark the anniversary, it has planted a \\"celebration woodland\\" of 50 new trees on the grounds of long-standing client Crieff Hydro. The firm has also published a book which recalls the company's history. Managing director Ralland Browne said: \\"It is striking how our own history has mirrored that of forestry in Scotland. \\"We became a commercial company in 1967, the year of the last Forestry Act - and as we turn 50, a new Forestry Bill is coming before the Scottish Parliament. \\"There have been ups and downs along the way, but the company and the wider forestry and wood-processing industry are both in good health in 2017 - and we are optimistic for the future, with a strong focus on driving up tree planting rates.\\"","output":"In the financial year ending on 30 September, Scottish Woodlands reported a nearly £1 million increase in turnover, reaching £70.3 million, and a 20% growth in pre-tax profits amounting to £1.75 million. The company attributes these positive results partly to the strengthening of the euro due to Brexit, making domestic processors more competitive. The employee-owned company, with 80% ownership by its staff, is headquartered in Riccarton, Edinburgh, and operates offices in Scotland, England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Currently celebrating its 50th year in business, Scottish Woodlands employs over 140 people. To commemorate this milestone, they have planted a \\"celebration woodland\\" comprising 50 new trees at the property of their long-term client, Crieff Hydro. Additionally, the firm has published a book recounting the company's history. Managing Director Ralland Browne acknowledges the mirroring of Scottish Woodlands' history with that of forestry in Scotland, as the company was established as a commercial entity in 1967, the same year as the last Forestry Act. Now, as the company turns 50, a new Forestry Bill is being put forth by the Scottish Parliament. Despite challenges faced along the way, Browne states that both Scottish Woodlands and the broader forestry and wood-processing industry are in good health in 2017. The company looks towards the future with optimism and intends to focus on increasing tree planting rates."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

While walking through the resort and exploring, I came across American fish and saw that they had happy hour pricing for appetizers and cocktails and decided to come back and try it between 5-7pm. My perfect date, my sister and I checked out both the menus for here and Sirio across the way and decided on staying and found ourselves a nice spot at the bar. The girls got vodka collins to drink and I opted for the diablo- a tequila drink. Not my usual but it was my birthday so branched out a little. The girls said that the drinks were good but that they were very tart- my sister went so far as to add water to hers to tone it down. For the apps we chose a little of this and a little of that- What stood out was the lobster rolls- very tasty and all of the apps were good as well. The service behind the bar was excellent- the bartenders were fun and quick with service.

Harvey had been the last to speak to Oates . Oates had been the last person to speak to Harvey . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","output":"No, these sentences do not convey the exact same meaning. The sentence \\"Harvey had been the last to speak to Oates\\" suggests that Harvey was the last person to have any conversation with Oates. This implies an instance of conversation that occurred between multiple people and Oates, where Harvey happened to be the last person in that sequence to speak. The focus here is on Harvey's action of speaking to Oates. On the other hand, \\"Oates had been the last person to speak to Harvey\\" implies that Oates was the last one to have a conversation with Harvey. This suggests a scenario where several people, including Oates, have had some form of communication with Harvey and Oates ended up being the last person in that sequence to communicate. Here, the emphasis is on Oates' action of speaking to Harvey. So, while both sentences talk about a communication that occurred between Harvey and Oates, they differ in who is presented as the last speaker and the listener. The first sentence focuses on Harvey as the last speaker to Oates, while the second sentence assigns that role to Oates in a conversation with Harvey. The ordering of communication and the roles of Harvey and Oates as speaker and listener change between the two sentences, hence they are not equivalent in meaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Are world in 90 mins Awesome\\" A:","output":"To evaluate the review, \\"Are world in 90 mins Awesome\\" on a scale of 1-5, we should consider several factors, such as clarity, informativeness, relevance, grammar, and comprehensiveness. Let's analyze this review through these lenses: 1. Clarity: The review is slightly unclear as to what the subject under analysis is. \\"Are world in 90 mins\\" might refer to a show, presentation, or event related to world geography, history, or culture. However, without a better understanding of the specific subject matter it is difficult to gauge the clarity of the review. Rating: 1.5/5 2. Informativeness: The review lacks substantial information about the event, experience or product. Apart from using the word \\"Awesome,\\" which might imply that the reviewer had a positive experience or enjoyed it, there is limited insight as to why the experience, event or product should be rated that way. Rating: 1/5 3. Relevance: While there is limited information available, we can assume that the review is targeted toward something that can be experienced in a short 90-minute timeframe. However, it would've been helpful if the review had mentioned how the world (which could refer to history, geography, or major events) is presented in the given time. Rating: 2/5 4. Grammar: The review suffers from improper grammar and punctuation. For instance, it starts with \\"Are world\\" instead of \\"Our world,\\" and it is missing a comma between \\"90 mins\\" and \\"Awesome\\", which could have made it easier to understand. The lack of proper grammar disrupts the flow of the review. Rating: 1/5 5. Comprehensiveness: The brevity of the review poses issues in comprehensiveness. The word \\"Awesome\\" is an opinion and doesn't provide any constructive feedback or analysis of the content of the event, experience, or product. Ideally, a more comprehensive review would include essential highlights, specific praises, and recommendations for improvement. Rating: 1/5 Upon considering these five factors, I would give this review an overall rating of 1.5/5. The review could benefit from improvements in clarity, informativeness, grammar, and comprehensiveness. The reviewer should focus on providing more context and specific insights into the experience or product being reviewed, as well as adherence to proper grammar to effectively communicate their opinion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Horror-meister, Stephen King calls George Pelecanos \\"perhaps the greatest living American crime writer.\\" His stories are set in Pelecanos' hometown of Washington, D.C., but this is not the side of the U.S. capitol that you see portrayed on TV with white marble monuments, lawyers and lobbyists. Pelecanos is more interested in working families struggling to get by, the racial tensions in its ethnic neighborhoods and the low-lifes on the edges. His crime-writing peers call Pelecanos the \\"undisputed poet\\" of Washington's gritty side. The best-selling and award-winning author is out this week with his 17th and latest novel, \\"The Cut.\\" It's the first in a new series featuring Iraq war veteran and private investigator Spero Lucas. When he's not working for a Washington defense attorney, Lucas recovers stolen property for a 40% cut. Now, a high-profile crime boss hires Lucas to find out who's been stealing from him, and it could turn out to be Lucas' biggest payday or an untimely end. While Pelecanos made his bones in the noir tradition, there's a definite \\"Western\\" feel to \\"The Cut.\\" The new novel takes place in a morally gray and often violent world. It's peppered with pitch-perfect dialogue and captures the sights, sounds and taste of Washington in rich detail. In short, Pelecanos reads like the real deal. Pelecanos knows a thing or two about capturing the authenticity of urban America with an ethnically and socially diverse cast. In addition to his success as a novelist, Pelecanos is a producer and writer for HBO's New Orleans-set, \\"Treme.\\" He was previously a producer and Emmy-nominated writer on the hit series \\"The Wire\\" and the miniseries \\"The Pacific.\\" Read an excerpt from \\"The Cut\\" CNN recently spoke to Pelecanos about his new novel.

Possible Outcomes: 1. Opponents want to exploit Tracy. 2. Opponents want to hide from people. 3. Opponents want to cover up her mistake. Step-by-step analysis: 1. Since Tracy's actions have left the secret strategy exposed, it becomes beneficial for opponents to take advantage of the situation. Exploiting Tracy would mean exploiting the weakness her actions have created in her team's strategy. 2. Hiding from people might be relevant in cases where opponents want to avoid exposing their own plans or intentions.

A pre-war critic of Nazism, Pius XII lobbied world leaders to avoid war and, as Pope at the outbreak of war, issued \\"Summi Pontificatus\\", expressing dismay at the invasion of Poland, reiterating Church teaching against racial persecution and calling for love, compassion and charity to prevail over war.  - Pope Pius XI, born Ambrogio Damiano Achille Ratti (31 May 1857  10 February 1939), reigned as Pope from 6 February 1922 to his death in 1939. He was the first sovereign of Vatican City from its creation as an independent state on 11 February 1929. He took as his papal motto, \\"Pax Christi in Regno Christi,\\" translated \\"The Peace of Christ in the Kingdom of Christ.\\"  - Francis Konrad Schuckardt ( July 10 , 1937 -- November 5 , 2006 ) was an American Traditionalist Catholic independent bishop and the first known bishop of the sedevacantist movement in the United States . Sedevacantism holds that Pope Paul VI -- sometimes going back to include John XXIII -- and his successors are not valid Popes . Schuckardt founded the Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen ( CMRI ) and the Tridentine Latin Rite Catholic Church ( TLRCC ) .  - The Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen (CMRI) (Latin: \\"Congregatio Mariae Reginae Immaculatae\\") is a Sedevacantist Traditionalist Catholic religious congregation that rejects the authority of the recent Popes, including Benedict XVI and Francis, and is dedicated to promoting the message of Our Lady of Fátima and devotion to the Virgin Mary according to the teachings of St. Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort (1673-1716), whom they regard as their spiritual founder. Over the years, the Congregation has also been known as the Fatima Crusaders and Oblates of Mary Immaculate Queen of the Universe.  - Traditionalist Catholics are members of the Catholic Church who believe that there should be a restoration of many or all of the customs, traditions, liturgical forms, public and private devotions and presentations of the teaching of the Church before the Second Vatican Council (196265). They are commonly associated with an attachment to the Eucharistic liturgy often called the Tridentine, Traditional Latin or extraordinary form of the Mass.  - Our Lady of Fátima (formally known as Our Lady of the Holy Rosary of Fátima \\"\\" ), is a Roman Catholic title of the Blessed Virgin Mary based on the famed Marian apparitions reported in 1917 by three shepherd children at the Cova da Iria, in Fátima, Portugal. The three little children were Lúcia Santos and her cousins Jacinta and Francisco Marto.   - Pope Paul VI, born Giovanni Battista Enrico Antonio Maria Montini (26 September 1897  6 August 1978), reigned as Pope from 21 June 1963 to his death in 1978. Succeeding Pope John XXIII, he continued the Second Vatican Council which he closed in 1965, implementing its numerous reforms, and fostered improved ecumenical relations with Eastern Orthodox and Protestants, which resulted in many historic meetings and agreements. Montini served in the Vatican's Secretariat of State from 1922 to 1954. While in the Secretariat of State, Montini and Domenico Tardini were considered as the closest and most influential colleagues of Pope Pius XII, who in 1954 named him Archbishop of Milan, the largest Italian diocese. Montini later became the Secretary of the Italian Bishops Conference. John XXIII elevated him to the College of Cardinals in 1958, and after the death of John XXIII, Montini was considered one of his most likely successors.  - In ecclesiastical heraldry, papal coats of arms (those of individual popes) and those of the Holy See and Vatican City State include an image of crossed keys to represent the metaphorical keys of the office of Saint Peter, the keys of heaven, or the keys of the kingdom of Heaven, that, according to Roman Catholic teaching, Jesus promised to Saint Peter, empowering him to take binding actions. In the Gospel of Matthew , Jesus says to Peter, \\"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven.\\" The keys of heaven or keys of Saint Peter are seen as a symbol of papal authority: \\"Behold he [Peter] received the keys of the kingdom of heaven, the power of binding and loosing is committed to him, the care of the whole Church and its government is given to him [cura ei totius Ecclesiae et principatus committitur (Epist., lib. V, ep. xx, in P.L., LXXVII, 745)]\\".  - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments.  - Jesus (; c. 4 BC  c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.  - Pope Saint John XXIII (born Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, ; 25 November 18813 June 1963) reigned as Pope from 28 October 1958 to his death in 1963 and was canonized on 27 April 2014. Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli was the fourth of fourteen children born to a family of sharecroppers who lived in a village in Lombardy. He was ordained to the priesthood on 10 August 1904 and served in a number of posts, including papal nuncio in France and a delegate to Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey. In a consistory on 12 January 1953 Pope Pius XII made Roncalli a cardinal as the Cardinal-Priest of Santa Prisca in addition to naming him as the Patriarch of Venice.  - The College of Cardinals, formerly styled Sacred College of Cardinals, is the body of all cardinals of the Catholic Church. Functions. A function of the college is to advise the pope about church matters when he summons them to an ordinary consistory, a term derived from the Roman Emperor's crown council. It also attends various functions as a matter of protocol, for example, during the canonization process. It also convenes on the death or resignation of a pope as a papal conclave to elect a successor, but is then restricted to eligible Cardinals under the age limit, which was set for the first time in 1970 by Pope Paul VI at 80.  - The Nicene Creed (Greek: or, , Latin: \\"\\") is a Symbol of faith widely used in Christian liturgy.  - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.  - Domenico Tardini (29 February 1888  30 July 1961) was a longtime aide to Pope Pius XII in the Secretariat of State. Pope John XXIII named him Cardinal Secretary of State and, in this position the most prominent member of the Roman Curia in Vatican City.

There are multiple reasons why concluding such a connection between these two statements is not feasible: 1. Lack of context: The statements do not provide enough information about the circumstances, location, or the individuals involved. It is unclear if the man in the tank top is the same man who is going to ask out a woman or if these are two separate situations. Similarly, the woman near the water sculpture may or may not be the same woman being asked out. Additional context is required to establish a connection between these two events. 2. Inference limitations: While it is possible that a man asking out a woman could look at her beforehand, the statement \\"A man in a tank top looks at a woman near a water sculpture\\" does not indicate intent or action in asking someone out. We would need more information to support the assumption that the man looking at the woman is the same man who plans to ask her out. 3. Unrelated events: It's entirely possible that these two statements describe two unrelated events. The man in the tank top looking at a woman near a water sculpture could simply be admiring her or the water sculpture itself without any intention of asking her out. Without sufficient information to link these two events, we cannot conclude that they are related. 4. Different timeframes: The two statements could be occurring at different moments. The man might be planning to ask out a woman later in the day or week, while the scene described in the first statement could be simply coincidental and not related to the act of asking someone out. 5. Alternative scenarios: There may be other crucial details left out of the statements that would significantly alter their meaning or context. For example, the man in the tank top might be glancing at the woman while jogging by, unrelated to any plans to ask her out. Or the man intending to ask the woman out might be hesitating and not necessarily looking at her.  In conclusion, without more context or information about the individuals, location, intent, or circumstances, it is not possible to definitively conclude that a man in a tank top looking at a woman near a water sculpture is the same man who is going to ask out a woman. These events may be connected or entirely unrelated, and additional information is necessary to draw a connection between them."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Context: One student started packing up at the beginning of a lab exercise. I asked him where he was going. He said “I’m going to fail this class anyway, so I have other things to do.” It was true that he wasn’t doing well, and we had addressed this previously, but his attitude was completely defeatist. He had given up. So, there, in the middle of class, before he could get away, I said “Well, yeah. You will certainly fail if you don’t even try. I thought you were graduating at the end of this semester.” “I’m supposed to, but I won’t, because I’m going to fail physics. All I need is a D.” (He was right; his major didn’t require knowing any physics but they put it in the curriculum as a kind of gatekeeper course. Most students took physics much earlier in their studies than he did.) “If you have already decided to fail, I can’t stop you; you’re an adult. But you can make an appointment with me anytime. You already know that. You can email me. It’s my job to help you understand, but you have to come to me. You are an adult. It would be very inappropriate of me to follow you around, inviting you to office hours. And you must do the homework and the labs.” He stayed for the lab. I notified his counselor about what was going on, and she called him in and said the same things that I said. Next class he moved from the seat at the edge of my peripheral vision, to the middle, started working his ass off, and he passed. For a while I thought he was closing in on a C, but he got his D and graduated. And I didn’t give him anymore of a grading break than I give any of my students. Question: Why did the student think he wasn't going to graduate? Answer: Answer:","output":"The student thought he wasn't going to graduate because he was struggling with and expected to fail his physics class. As mentioned earlier, even though his major did not require expertise in physics, it was a gatekeeper course – meaning it was a requirement for graduation. This particular student had procrastinated taking the physics class and took it much later in his studies, which was one of the reasons he was having challenges with the subject. Additionally, the student seemed to have adopted a defeatist attitude and had given up on trying to pass the course. His lack of effort and self-belief played a significant role in his expectation of failure. Despite knowing that he could reach out to his professor for assistance and attending extra office hours, he had yet to take any steps towards improving his grades. It was only after his conversation with the professor and a follow-up meeting with his counselor that the student decided to change his perspective and invest more effort into the course. He started attending classes regularly, participating more and completing his assignments, which subsequently lead to him passing the course with a grade of D and ultimately graduating."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  A: as normal  B: as fine  C: as sick Answer:","output":"Based on the given context, the most appropriate answer to the question of how Kendall would feel afterwards is C: as sick. Since Kendall took snake poison and ended up getting sick forever, it is logical to assume that they would continue to feel sick in the aftermath of this experience. Taking snake poison could have significant and long-lasting effects on Kendall's body and overall well-being. Snake venom contains a variety of toxic substances that can cause severe damage to an individual, including problems with the cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous, and muscular systems. Depending on the type of snake venom that Kendall ingested, they might experience any combination of the following symptoms: 1. Pain, swelling, and bruising around the bite area or ingestion site 2. Difficulty breathing due to paralysis of the respiratory muscles or constriction of the airways 3. Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain as a result of digestive system disruptions 4. Weakness and muscle pain due to the breakdown of muscle tissue 5. Seizures, paralysis, and other neurological symptoms as the venom interferes with the nervous system 6. Bleeding disorders such as internal bleeding or uncontrolled bleeding from wounds 7. Kidney failure or other organ damage due to the destructive effects of the venom on tissues In Kendall's case, the severe and enduring nature of their sickness would likely contribute to a number of persistent issues affecting their daily life. Chronic pain, fatigue, and mental health challenges such as anxiety and depression may arise as they grapple with their new reality. Additionally, they might need ongoing medical care and support to manage their symptoms and limit their exposure to potential triggers or complications. As a result of these factors, it's clear that option C: as sick best answers the question in accordance with the context presented.

He has been seen sitting in court this week with two men who have had altercations with Pistorius in the past. Pistorius was acquitted of murder for the Feb. 14, 2013 killing and found guilty of the lesser crime of negligent killing. Masipa has wide latitude when deciding on a sentence for culpable homicide, and could order a suspended sentence and a fine, house arrest, or send him to prison for up to 15 years. Testimony in the sentencing hearing ended Thursday. The prosecution and defense said they would deliver final arguments on Friday, clearing the way for the judge to deliver the sentence at a date yet to be announced. Defense lawyers have argued for a sentence of three years of house arrest with community service. In the first part of the sentencing hearing, they called a psychologist and social workers, who said that Pistorius should not go to prison because of his ongoing emotional suffering. They also said his disability as a double amputee who needs prosthetic legs would leave him vulnerable in jail. Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel has called suggestions of a house arrest sentence as \\"shockingly inappropriate\\" and wants Pistorius to be sent to prison. Martin, the cousin, said a prison sentence would be appropriate for Pistorius and that she understood the rehabilitation program in jail to be humane and dignified, contrary to allegations by one of the social workers who testified for the defense. In her sometimes emotional testimony, Martin said many people had suffered because of Pistorius, including his own family, and that a sentence that excludes jail time would encourage the athlete to \\"feel within himself that what he's done is all right.\\" Zach Modise, the acting national commissioner for correctional services, testified after Martin, saying that the South African prison system compared favorably with prisons he had visited in Britain and the United States. He acknowledged problems such as overcrowding and gang activity, but said officials had made progress in combatting those problems and that some prison facilities can cater to disabled criminals, including Pistorius. \\"We will be able to accomodate him,\\" Modise said. However, defense lawyer Barry Roux referred to reports of an increase in alleged torture in South Africa's prison system. He also said an imprisoned gang leader alleged that Pistorius would be under threat if he is incarcerated; Modise said he was not aware of any threat. At the beginning of Thursday's proceedings, Nel congratulated Judge Masipa on her birthday and people in the courtroom applauded. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article revolve around the sentencing portion of Oscar Pistorius' trial. Key points include: 1. Reeva Steenkamp's cousin, Kim Martin, testified that Pistorius' apology to the Steenkamp family was not genuine, and that he must \\"pay for what he's done.\\" 2. Martin stated that the family is not seeking revenge, but feels that \\"to take somebody's life, to shoot somebody behind the door who is unarmed, who is harmless, needs sufficient punishment.\\" 3. The prosecution and defense are expected to deliver their final arguments on Friday, with the judge delivering the sentence at a later date. 4.

Reinhold Hanning was found guilty of being an accessory to the murder of at least 170,000 people. He was an SS guard at Auschwitz from 1942 to 1944. He has said he knew what was going on at the camp but did not act to stop it. The Nazis killed about 1.1 million people - mostly Jews - at Auschwitz in occupied southern Poland. The verdict came after a trial lasting nearly four months in the western German city of Detmold. Observers said Hanning, in a wheelchair, remained silent and emotionless for much of the trial, avoiding eye contact with anyone in the courtroom. It could be one of the last trials of Nazi officials involved in the Holocaust. Camp guard apologises Will Hanning be last Holocaust-era case? There were just four people in the courtroom today who perhaps truly understand the significance of this verdict. Hedy Bohm, Erna de Vries, William Glied and Leon Schwarzbaum sat, straight backed, in the front row surrounded by friends and family, and listened intently. Each of them endured and survived the unimaginable horror of Auschwitz. By giving evidence during the trial and describing some of their experiences in harrowing detail, they helped to secure this conviction. Mr Glied, a dignified man with thick white hair and a ready smile, now lives in Canada. He was accompanied today by his daughter and granddaughter. Before the verdict he told me that the actual sentence was immaterial. \\"What matters,\\" he said \\"is that he is convicted by a German court for what he did.\\" At the trial, about a dozen elderly Auschwitz survivors testified against Hanning, giving harrowing accounts of their experiences. Prosecutors said he met Jewish prisoners as they arrived at the camp and may have escorted some to the gas chambers. Hanning's lawyers had argued that he had never personally killed or beaten anyone. He told the court in April: \\"I want to say that it disturbs me deeply that I was part of such a criminal organisation. \\"I am ashamed that I saw injustice and never did anything about it and I apologise for my actions. I am very, very sorry.\\" German prosecutors were required, until recently, to provide evidence that defendants were directly involved in the killings. That changed with the 2011 conviction of John Demjanjuk, when a judge concluded that his activities as a camp worker in Nazi-occupied Poland amounted to complicity in mass murder. Last year a German court sentenced Oskar Groening, 94, to four years in jail as an accessory to the murder of at least 300,000 people at Auschwitz. Known as the SS \\"book-keeper of Auschwitz\\", Groening was allegedly responsible for counting banknotes confiscated from prisoners.

Following the game, Stallings learned from a Tennessee assistant that Commodores player Wade Baldwin IV had taunted one of the Tennessee players as the final few seconds ticked off the game clock. Angrily pulling Baldwin out of the postgame handshake line by his arm, Stallings led him toward the Tennessee player he had taunted. A television camera caught Stallings yelling several profanities at Baldwin that were beeped out. Stallings can then be heard screaming, “We don’t do that!” Coach Stallings is the best coach in America. I felt no offense to anything. We are both fiery people and that's why I chose Vandy ⚓️👇 Walking behind Baldwin in the handshake line, Stallings then screams toward the player, “I’ll f---ing kill you!” Turning to walk off the floor as Baldwin followed close behind, Stallings yelled more profanities toward no one in particular before turning toward Baldwin again and yelling, “I told you a hundred times!” In a statement released by Vanderbilt after the game, Stallings apologized for his behavior. “After the game, an incident occurred in which I need to apologize for,” Stallings wrote in the statement. “One of our players acted inappropriately and violated what we believe is good sportsmanship following the game. “In my haste to resolve the situation, I made a very inappropriate comment... I apologized to the player immediately following the game, although displaying good sportsmanship is of the highest priority in our program.” As the final second ticked off the clock at the end of the game, an ESPN camera caught Baldwin clapping in the face of a Volunteer player who was walking off the court. A few seconds later, Stallings went ballistic. Stallings later told ESPN he did not mean his words “literally.” “I handled it completely inappropriately and I apologized to Wade — and I need to apologize to our fans and the Vanderbilt administration,” Stallings told ESPN. “Having said that, and it may seem as though I’m trying to rationalize my behavior, sportsmanship will continue to be a high priority. I did not mean it in the literal sense and I’ve never touched a player in all my years as a coach. That’s not me.
