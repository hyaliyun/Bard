How do I start eating non veg? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"No, those questions do not have the same meaning. The first question pertains to Swami Vivekananda's choice of consuming non-vegetarian food despite Bhagavad Gita's classification of it as Tamasic food, while the second question seeks guidance on how to begin consuming non-vegetarian food. Let us address each question individually to provide a detailed response. 1. Why did Swami Vivekananda eat non-vegetarian food when it is classified as Tamasic food in Bhagavad Gita? Swami Vivekananda (1863–1902) was a prominent figure in India's spiritual and philosophical landscape. He was a disciple of the renowned mystic Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and carried forward his guru's teachings. Vivekananda became well-known for his oratory skills and ability to convey complex philosophies to people of different backgrounds and cultures. It is essential to understand Swami Vivekananda's larger context before delving into his specific dietary preferences. Born and raised in Bengal under a colonial milieu, Vivekananda grew up amidst a blend of traditional Indian values and modern Western influences. He strongly believed in the need for India to make progress in science, technology, and overall development. These ideals shaped his views on various topics, such as education, social reform, and spirituality. Regarding food habits, the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Hindu scripture, classifies food into three categories: Sattvic, Rajasic, and Tamasic. According to this classification, Tamasic foods are considered to generate ignorance, inertia, and dullness. Non-vegetarian food falls under Tamasic food in this context. Swami Vivekananda was not dogmatic about food habits and believed that food choices should be driven by individual needs and environmental factors. His focus was on practicality, and he dealt with issues in a realistic manner. The reason for consuming non-vegetarian food, despite knowing its classification as Tamasic, may stem from the belief that there are more pressing issues to address in order to uplift the human condition. It is also worth mentioning that India has diverse cultural and religious practices, along with regional variations in dietary habits. Swami Vivekananda aimed to promote unity among these diverse groups, and his embrace of various food traditions could have been an attempt to foster understanding and empathy among people. 2. How do I start eating non-vegetarian food? If you would like to start eating non-vegetarian food, there are certain steps you can follow to make the transition in a gradual and healthy manner: a. Reflect on your reasons: Start by understanding your motivation for including non-vegetarian food in your diet. It could be for health reasons, variety, social reasons, or personal preference. b. Educate yourself: Learn about the different types of non-vegetarian food and the nutrients they provide. Look up recipes, cooking processes, and techniques to help you understand how to prepare and consume these foods properly. c. Start with the basics: Begin with simple, familiar meals that may already be a part of your cultural or regional food practices. For instance, if you come from a predominantly fish-eating community, start by trying fish before moving on to other meats. d. Gradual transition: Avoid making drastic changes to your diet overnight. Transition gradually by incorporating smaller portions of non-vegetarian food into your meals and observing how your body responds to the change. e. Source ethically and practice moderation: Be mindful of the sources of your non-vegetarian food, choosing ethically raised and sustainable options whenever possible. Remember, moderation is key – maintain a balanced diet that includes fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes along with non-vegetarian options. f. Consult a professional: If you have concerns or health issues, consult a registered dietitian, nutritionist, or healthcare professional before making significant changes to your diet. In conclusion, while Swami Vivekananda's personal choice to consume non-vegetarian food despite its classification as Tamasic food in Bhagavad Gita may be seen as controversial, his broader perspective and practical approach to life can offer valuable insights. On the other hand, if you wish to include non-vegetarian food in your diet, take a mindful, gradual, and well-informed approach to ensure a healthy transition. The two questions, while related, bear distinct meanings and require separate analyses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Context: Larry Martin Hagman (September 21, 1931 November 23, 2012) was an American film and television actor, director and producer best known for playing ruthless oil baron J.R.

Step 3: Draw the conclusion The context does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that Larry Martin Hagman acted mostly in the 1980s. It only explicitly mentions that his best-known role was in a series that aired during that time along with another role in the 1960s.

We have two groups of things:  1. 40 * q and 31 * q 2. -137 and -5 We're trying to find the value of 'q', the unknown number. First, let's deal with the two groups on the left side (40 * q and 31 * q). They are both multiplied by q, so we can add them together. 40 * q + 31 * q = (40 + 31) * q = 71 * q Now our equation looks like this: 71 * q = -137 - 5 Next, let's solve the group on the right side (-137 and -5). They're both negative numbers, and when we add them together, they become a bigger negative number: -137 - 5 = -142 Now our equation looks like this: 71 * q = -142 To find the value of 'q', we need to get rid of the 71 that's multiplying it. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 71: (71 * q) / 71 = -142 / 71 Since 71 / 71 is equal to 1, the left side becomes: 1 * q = -142 / 71 Now, when we divide -142 by 71, we get: q = -2 So, the value of 'q' we were looking for is -2."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  Little is known for certain of the life of Hieronymus Bosch or of the commissions or influences that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history. Although Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.José de Sigüenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome. He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels \\"are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind\\". The art historian Carl Justi observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by \\"the news of recently discovered Atlantis and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise\\".

By ethnicity there were 1,397,851 (80.8%) Hungarians, 19,530 (1.1%) Romani people, 18,278 (1.0%) Germans, 6,189 (0.4%) Romanians, 4,692 (0.3%) Han Chinese and 2,581 (0.1%) Slovaks. 301,943 people (17.5%) did not declare their ethnicity. In Hungary people can declare more than one ethnicity, so the sum of ethnicities is higher than the total population. The city is home to one of the largest Jewish communities in Europe. Based on the above article, answer a question. How many more Romanian people were there than Slovaks?","output":"Based on the article, there were 6,189 Romanians and 2,581 Slovaks living in Budapest at the time of the 2011 census. If we take away the number of Slovaks from the number of Romanians, we get the difference. So, 6,189 (Romanians) - 2,581 (Slovaks) equals 3,608. This means there were 3,608 more Romanians than Slovaks in Budapest at that time. Just think of it like if you had 6 toy cars and gave 2 away, you would have 4 left.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person whose paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance?  Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article in one sentence. Speeches don't have to be invented from scratch. Telling a personal story is a great way to come up with something quickly: since you already know what happened, you'll know what to say. For example:  At a wedding, you could tell a funny story about growing up with the bride or groom. At a funeral, you could tell a story about how kind or generous the deceased was, or about how they influenced you. This is another way to rely on something that's already out there, rather than having to come up with something on the spot. Think of an inspiring quotation, some lyrics to a song, or a famous saying that applies to the situation when you're speaking. Start off with that, and then discuss it a bit. For example, imagine you're giving a toast at Frank's 70th birthday. You could say something like: “They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Frank here's proving them wrong. Who else would have the courage to start running marathons in retirement?” Rambling on too long is the number one thing that can go wrong when giving a personal speech. It's much better to avoid saying too much. Keep your speech brief, focusing on two to five main points or examples.  For example, if you're toasting the groom at a wedding, stick to just two good stories about your friendship. If you see people in the audience do things like turn away, talk to each other, check their phones or watches, or fidget in their seats, you might be rambling on and losing their attention. If this happens just quickly cut to your main point and say “thank you” as a way to close. Even practiced speakers can get nervous when asked to give a talk on the spot. Control your nerves by taking a deep breath before you begin, and taking brief pauses every so often while you are talking. Focus on pronouncing your words clearly, and not speaking too quickly. Many people feel nervous about giving a speech, especially with little notice. But if you show the confidence to give one, they'll applaud you. Plus, they'll all be so happy not to be the ones giving the speech that they'll probably be super supportive!  Simple ways to find your confidence before giving a speech include taking some deep, slow breaths, or closing your eyes and visualising a happy place before you begin. You can also look out in the audience and find a few friends or people who seem supportive, and focus on them. If you're nervous, you could also try the old standby of imagining everyone in the audience naked! Above all, just remind yourself that most people will naturally admire the courage of someone who shows the confidence to get up and speak in front of a crowd. Summary:","output":"The article suggests effective speech making tips, such as telling personal stories or using famous quotes, keeping it short and focused, controlling nerves through deep breaths and clear pronunciation, and building confidence by visualizing a supportive audience or a happy place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the version of the following sentence with correct punctuation? In decorative and fruit gardens this is certainly not desirable since correctly formed trees are essential  either for aesthetic reasons or for the fruit yield","output":"\\"In decorative and fruit gardens, this is certainly not desirable, since correctly formed trees are essential, either for aesthetic reasons or for the fruit yield.\\" Justification of punctuation: 1. After \\"In decorative and fruit gardens\\": I put a comma here because the phrase \\"In decorative and fruit gardens\\" is an introductory clause, which sets the context for the main clause that follows. According to general grammar rules, it's usual to use a comma after an introductory word, phrase or clause. 2. After \\"not desirable\\": The comma after \\"not desirable\\" is used to separate the main clause \\"this is certainly not desirable\\" from the subordinate (dependent) clause \\"since correctly formed trees are essential\\". This helps in making the sentence more clear and easy to understand. 3. After \\"essential\\": This comma is used to separate two independent clauses \\"correctly formed trees are essential\\" and \\"either for aesthetic reasons or for the fruit yield\\". These two thoughts could work as two separate sentences hence, they are independent clauses but since they are closely related they can be separated by comma."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which south eastern suburb in Adelaide, South Australia provided the bricks to build the Old Government House in Belair National Park?","output":"The suburb that provided the bricks to build the Old Government House in Belair National Park, located in Adelaide, South Australia, is Blackwood. Blackwood is situated in the Adelaide Hills region and is part of the south-eastern suburbs of Adelaide.  The Old Government House, built in 1860, was originally conceived as a summer residence for the Governor of South Australia. It is an outstanding example of early colonial architecture in South Australia and is an important historical site. The bricks for the construction of the house were sourced from Mitcham clay deposits, which were abundant in the nearby Blackwood area. During the 19th century, the Adelaide Hills region was home to several brickmaking sites, with the clay deposits in the Blackwood area providing high-quality materials for building purposes. Brick-making was a vital part of the region's economy at that time, and Blackwood's contribution to the construction of prestigious buildings like the Old Government House is a testament to the quality of its clay and brick workforce. Over time, many structures in the region have been built using Blackwood bricks, leaving a lasting legacy for the suburb and its historical importance in the Adelaide Hills region. Today, the Old Government House stands inside the Belair National Park as a testament to the craftsmanship of the brickmakers from Blackwood and plays a crucial role in preserving the history and heritage of the area."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Underworld Movie plot: Background: 1,400 years ago, Vampires had decided that the best way to ensure the survival of their species was for three Elders--Viktor, Marcus, and Amelia--to 'leap frog' through time, one ruling while the other two slept, each being awakened at their appointed time according to a never-to-be-broken covenant. 1,000 years ago, during the reign of Viktor, the oldest and strongest of the Elders, the Vampire-Lycan War began. 600 years ago, Kraven set the 'great blaze' which killed Lucian, the leader of the Lycans. Kraven brought back a brand cut from Lucian's arm as proof of his death, a deed which earned Kraven high favor with Viktor, who put Kraven in charge of their coven. The great blaze caused the Lycans to scatter. Vampire Death Dealers, armed with silver bullets and shuriken, have been picking Lycans off one by one until very few remain.Present time: Three Death Dealers--Selene, Rigel, and Nathaniel -- follow two Lycans into a subway station in an unnamed European city. A firey gun battle ensues in which Rigel is killed, one of the Lycans gets away, and Nathaniel comes up missing. In the chaos, Selene (Kate Beckinsale) makes two discoveries: 1) the Lycans have devised an ultraviolet bullet that can kill vampires, and 2) there appears to be a large band of Lycans amassing under the subway.Selene hurries back to alert the Vampires at Kraven's luxurious masnion that sits on the outskirts of the city, but they are more interested in the clothes they are going to wear at tonight's formal party with the coven from across the 'great ocean' in celebration of the upcoming awakening of Marcus by Amelia, the current reigning Elder. Not interested in their gaities, Selene views some digital photos Rigel took of the Lycans and notices that they appear to have been following a human. A computer search reveals the human is Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), an intern at a local hospital.Meanwhile, the wounded Lycan has returned to the Lycan den with the bad news that he lost the candidate he was tailing, as well as to...

After the failure of the coup in Kaunas, there were numerous small border incidents. On September 19, 1919, Polish troops attacked Gelvonai and encroached towards Ukmergė. On several occasions fights broke out regarding strategically important bridge over the Šventoji River near Vepriai. In October, when main Lithuanian forces were deployed against the Bermontians in northwestern Lithuania, the attacks intensified. Poles captured Salakas on October 5 and attacked Kapčiamiestis on October 12. The front stabilized, but harassment of border guards and local villagers continued throughout late 1919 and early 1920. In March 1920, the Poles attacked along the railroad stations in Kalkūni and Turmantas. The situation was investigated by British and French observers and reported to the Entente. The situation somewhat improved only in late spring 1920 when most Polish troops were deployed in Ukraine during the Polish-Soviet War. At the time Lithuania faced a severe budget crisis - in 1919 its revenue was 72 million while expenses reached 190 million German marks. While the government was struggling to obtain financial assistance and loans, deep cuts affected the army. Instead of increasing its armed forces to 40,000 men, Lithuania was forced to cut them to about 25,000. Answer this question: How many marks difference was there between the Lithuanian revenue and expenses in 1919?","output":"In 1919, there was a significant difference between Lithuania's revenue and expenses. The revenue amounted to 72 million German marks, while the expenses reached 190 million German marks. The difference between the two figures is 118 million German marks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer based on context: But its success depended greatly on the use of Portuguese mercenaries who proved unreliable and troublesome. Arakan lost the port city of Syriam in Lower Burma in 1603 when its Portuguese governor Filipe de Brito e Nicote declared that he was now loyal to the Portuguese viceroy of Goa. After two failed expeditions by the Arakanese navy to retake the port in 1604 and 1605, Arakan gave up its claims on the Lower Burma coastline. Arakan's Portuguese troubles were not yet over. In 1609, its northern territories at the edge of Ganges delta and off Chittagong came under threat by the Portuguese mercenaries and the Mughal government in Bengal. In March 1609, 400 Portuguese mercenaries, led by Sebastian Gonzales Tibao, seized the Sandwip island. Meanwhile, the Mughal governor of Bengal tried to take over Noakhali District. Min Yazagyi was forced to enter into an alliance with the Portuguese to drive out the Mughals. After the Mughals were driven out, Gonzales promptly seized the Arakanese navy, and began raiding as far south as Lemro river. Later, the Portuguese viceroy at Goa sanctioned an attack on Mrauk-U itself. In November 1615, a fleet of 14 Portuguese galliots and 50 smaller war boats led by Francis de Meneses sailed up the Lemro. Alas, the fleet was driven back by Arakanese defences, which included broadsides of a few Dutch ships. Two years later, King Min Khamaung finally captured Sandwip, and put most of its inhabitants to death. What happened first: seized the Sandwip island or seized the Arakanese navy?","output":"Seized the Sandwip island happened first.

Q:Background: Located mostly in the Arctic north polar region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic Ocean is almost completely surrounded by Eurasia and North America. It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years.  Paragraph: The Madrigal Ocean and the Listy Ocean are two bodies of water currently under observation by scientists on a planet nearly identical to Earth. Although the studies have just started, the scientists have already discovered that the salinity of the Madrigal Ocean is much lower than that of the Listy Ocean. This isn't much information, but it's progress and the scientists are not going to stop their studies until they learn all that they can about these waters.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Is the Madrigal Ocean probably connected to more or less rivers than the Listy Ocean? A:","output":"Given the information provided, it is plausible to assume that the Madrigal Ocean is likely connected to more rivers than the Listy Ocean. In the context provided, the Arctic Ocean on Earth, with a relatively lower salinity compared to other major oceans, receives heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams. A similar analogy is being drawn for the Madrigal Ocean on the other planet, which has a lower salinity than the Listy Ocean. The lower salinity level could be due to more freshwater influx, possibly from a larger number of rivers flowing into the Madrigal Ocean as compared to the Listy Ocean. However, it is important to note that the final conclusion should be made based on more direct scientific observations and data, because several factors can influence ocean salinity levels, including evaporation, ice melting and freezing, and underwater currents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He is best known for the song \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\", a No. 1 hit on both the Billboard Hot 100 and R&B singles charts in 1966. It was awarded a million-selling, Gold-certified disc from the RIAA. Having previously worked as a hospital orderly in the early 1960s, Sledge achieved his strongest success in the late 1960s and early 1970s with a series of emotional soul songs. Sledge was born on November 25, 1940, in Leighton, Alabama. He worked in a series of agricultural jobs in the fields in Leighton before taking a job as an orderly at Colbert County Hospital in Sheffield, Alabama. Through the mid-1960s, he toured the Southeast with the Esquires Combo on weekends, while working at the hospital during the week. A former patient and mutual friend of Sledge and record producer Quin Ivy introduced the two. An audition followed, and Sledge was signed to a recording contract.  Sledge's soulful voice was perfect for the series of soul ballads produced by Ivy and Marlin Greene, which rock critic Dave Marsh called \\"emotional classics for romantics of all ages\\". \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\" was Sledge's first song recorded under the contract, and was released in March 1966. According to Sledge, the inspiration for the song came when his girlfriend left him for a modelling career after he was laid off from a construction job in late 1965, and, because bassist Calvin Lewis and organist Andrew Wright helped him with the song, he gave all the songwriting credits to them. It reached No. 1 in the US and went on to become an international hit. When a Man Loves a Woman\\" was a hit twice in the UK, reaching No. 4 in 1966 and, on reissue, peaked at No. 2 in 1987. The song was also the first gold record released by Atlantic Records. The soul anthem became the cornerstone of Sledge's career, and was followed by \\"Warm and Tender Love\\" (covered by British singer Elkie Brooks in 1981), \\"It Tears Me Up\\", \\"Take Time to Know Her\\" (his second biggest US hit, reaching No. 11; the song's lyric was written by Steve Davis), \\"Love Me Tender\\", and \\"Cover Me\\".  Sledge charted with \\"I'll Be Your Everything\\" and \\"Sunshine\\" during the 1970s, and became an international concert favorite throughout the world, especially in the Netherlands, Germany, and on the African continent; he averaged 100 concerts a year in South Africa. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: When did he get into music?","output":"Percy Sledge got into music in the mid-1960s.

His professional musical career truly began when a mutual friend introduced him to record producer Quin Ivy.

It is possible that Sasha believes the only way to have a conversation with Robin is to violate the restraining order, thinking that their message is crucial enough to warrant such a step. However, it's important to consider that the decision to get a restraining order is not taken lightly, and any attempt to contact the protected person directly, even for a seemingly valid reason, is an infringement of their personal safety and legal boundaries. b) Did this out of love: Love can sometimes manifest in irrational behaviors and actions that defy logical reasoning. If Sasha's feelings towards Robin have not subsided, they might have felt compelled to get close to them out of a sense of love, affection, or attachment. However, it is essential to understand that true love respects boundaries and the well-being of the other person, and violating a restraining order is a clear breach of trust and security. It is crucial for Sasha to consider different ways of expressing their love or emotions without compromising Robin's safety and autonomy. c) Stalk Robin: Stalking is a pattern of unwanted, obsessive attention or surveillance that could involve following the victim, contacting or visiting them without permission, or monitoring their behavior through physical or digital means. It is a severe violation of privacy and personal space, and it can have significant consequences for the victim's mental and emotional well-being. If Sasha is stalking Robin despite the restraining order, it indicates an unhealthy fixation that is detrimental to both parties involved. In this case, it is crucial for Sasha to seek professional help to address their behavior and for Robin to take the necessary measures to protect themselves further. In conclusion, while I cannot predict Sasha's intentions or next actions accurately, it is essential to acknowledge the gravity of violating a restraining order and the potential harm it can cause to both parties. Furthermore, it is crucial to respect personal boundaries and prioritize the emotional and physical well-being of the individuals involved, offering support and resources accordingly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - The Tharsis Montes are three large shield volcanoes in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. From north to south, the volcanoes are Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons and Arsia Mons. Mons (plural \\"montes\\") is the Latin word for mountain. It is a descriptor term used in astrogeology for mountainous features in the Solar System.  - Biblis Tholus is an extinct Martian volcano located at 2.55 ° N 235.62 ° E , one of two volcanoes near the center of the Tharsis volcanism . Along with Ulysses Tholus , it is almost midway between Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes . It is approximately 170 kilometers ( 110 mi ) long and 100 kilometers ( 62 mi ) wide , rising about 3 kilometers ( 1.9 mi ) from its surroundings . In the middle of the volcano is a caldera , named Biblis Patera , believed to have formed as the result of collapse of the magma chamber during eruptions of the volcano . The caldera is 53 kilometers ( 33 mi ) in diameter and four kilometers ( 2.5 miles ) in depth .  - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.  - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from .   - Mount Everest, also known in Nepal as Sagarmth and in China as Chomolungma/, is earth's highest mountain. Its peak is above sea level. Mount Everest is in the Mahalangur Range. The international border between China (Tibet Autonomous Region) and Nepal runs across Everest's summit point. Its massif includes neighbouring peaks Lhotse, ; Nuptse, , and Changtse, .  - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.  - A magma chamber is a large underground pool of liquid rock found beneath the surface of the Earth. The molten rock in such a chamber is under great pressure, and given enough time, that pressure can gradually fracture the rock around it creating outlets for the magma. If it finds a way to the surface, then the result will be a volcanic eruption; consequently many volcanoes are situated over magma chambers.  Magma chambers are hard to detect, and most of the known ones are therefore close to the surface of the Earth, commonly between 1 km and 10 km under the surface. In geological terms, this is extremely close to the surface, although in human terms, it is considerably deep underground.  - The Tharsis quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Tharsis quadrangle is also referred to as MC-9 (Mars Chart-9).  - Ascraeus Mons is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the northernmost and tallest of three shield volcanoes collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The volcano's location corresponds to the classical albedo feature Ascraeus Lacus.  - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface.  - Olympus Mons (Latin for Mount Olympus) is a very large shield volcano on the planet Mars. By one measure, it has a height of nearly 22 km (13.6 mi). Olympus Mons stands about two and a half times as tall as Mount Everest's height above sea level. It is the youngest of the large volcanoes on Mars, having formed during Mars's Hesperian Period. It is currently the largest volcano discovered in the Solar System and had been known to astronomers since the late 19th century as the albedo feature Nix Olympica (Latin for \\"Olympic Snow\\"). Its mountainous nature was suspected well before space probes confirmed its identity as a mountain.  - A space probe is a robotic spacecraft that leaves Earth orbit and explores space. It may approach the Moon; enter interplanetary space; flyby, orbit, or land on other planetary bodies; or approach interstellar space.  - Magma (from Ancient Greek  (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock.  - Pavonis Mons (Latin for \\"peacock mountain\\") is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the middle member of a chain of three volcanic mountains (collectively known as the Tharsis Montes) that straddle the Martian equator between longitudes 235°E and 259°E. The volcano was discovered by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1971 and was originally called Middle Spot. Its name formally became Pavonis Mons in 1973.  - Ulysses Tholus is a Martian volcano. It is located in the Tharsis quadrangle at 2.89° north latitude and 121.55° west longitude. It is 58 km across and is named after a classical albedo feature name. Ulysses Tholus is immediately east and slightly north of another volcano, Biblis Tholus.   - Mount Olympus (also transliterated as Olympos, and on Greek maps, Oros Olympos) is the highest mountain in Greece and the second highest mountain in the Balkans. It is located in the Olympus Range on the border between Thessaly and Macedonia, between the regional units of Pieria and Larissa, about southwest from Thessaloniki. Mount Olympus has 52 peaks, deep gorges, and exceptional biodiversity. The highest peak \\"Mytikas\\", meaning \\"nose\\", rises to . It is one of the highest peaks in Europe in terms of topographic prominence.  - Tharsis is a vast volcanic plateau centered near the equator in the western hemisphere of Mars. The region is home to the largest volcanoes in the Solar System, including the three enormous shield volcanoes Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons, which are collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The tallest volcano on the planet, Olympus Mons, is often associated with the Tharsis region but is actually located off the western edge of the plateau. The name Tharsis is the Greco-Latin transliteration of the biblical Tarshish, the land at the western extremity of the known world.  - Arsia Mons is the southernmost of three volcanos (collectively known as Tharsis Montes) on the Tharsis bulge near the equator of the planet Mars. To its north is Pavonis Mons, and north of that is Ascraeus Mons. The tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, is to its northwest. Its name comes from a corresponding albedo feature on a map by Giovanni Schiaparelli, which he named in turn after the legendary Roman forest of Arsia Silva.  - Tarshish occurs in the Hebrew Bible with several uncertain meanings, most frequently as a place (probably a large city or region) far across the sea from the Land of Israel and Phoenicia. Tarshish was said to have supplied vast quantities of important metals to Israel and Phoenicia. The same place-name occurs in the Akkadian inscriptions of Esarhaddon (the Assyrian king, d. 669 BC) and also on the Phoenician inscription on the Nora Stone, indicating that it was a \\"real\\" place; its precise location was never commonly known, and was eventually lost in antiquity. Legends grew up around it over time so that its identity has been the subject of scholarly research and commentary for more than two thousand years. Its importance stems in part from the fact that Hebrew biblical passages tend to understand Tarshish as a source of King Solomon's great wealth in metals - especially silver, but also gold, tin and iron (Ezekiel 27). The metals were reportedly obtained in partnership with King Hiram of Phoenician Tyre (Isaiah 23), and the fleets of Tarshish-ships. However, Solomon's Temple was destroyed by the Babylonians, thus archaeological evidence has been difficult to uncover.     What is the relationship between 'biblis tholus' and 'tharsis quadrangle'? The answer to this question is:","output":"Biblis Tholus is a volcano located in the Tharsis Quadrangle region of the planet Mars. The Tharsis Quadrangle, also referred to as MC-9 (Mars Chart-9), is used by the U.S. Geological Survey Astrogeology Research Program.

I stood at the bar (dead center, with no one standing in front of me) for over 5 minutes before the bartender even took my order. It was not busy, and there is no excuse for the wait - I had to watch the male bartender flirt and laugh with the female waitstaff the entire time.

Davis, she says she's going to do something, she gets it done.\\"      The daughter of a single mom, Davis, 50, overcame her own hardships as a divorced teenage mother to graduate with honors from Harvard Law School.      At 19, Davis decided to become the first member of her family to go to college after hearing of a two-year paralegal program from a co-worker.      At the time, she was in a trailer park and raising her daughter by herself. \\"We were the working poor,\\" she told The New York Times.      Davis clerked for a federal judge, practiced law and was CEO of a title company before getting into politics with her election to the Fort Worth City Council in 1999.      After unseating a longtime Republican incumbent in 2008 for state senator from Fort Worth, Davis, a Democrat, was named \\"Rookie of the Year\\" by Texas Monthly magazine and was re-elected in 2012.

Fifteen minutes before midnight, the Senate chamber's packed gallery erupted in raucous shouting, disrupting the proceedings and effectively killing the bill when the midnight deadline for passage came and went.      \\"I'm rising on the floor today to humbly give voice to thousands of Texans who are being ignored,\\" she said when her speech began, later adding: \\"These voices have been silenced by a governor who made blind partisanship and personal political ambition the priority of our state.\\"      Texas Sen.

(Photo: Eric Gay, AP)      With each passing hour, Davis' livestreamed filibuster attempt turned into Twittermania as thousands of people followed online and her Twitter following jumped from 1,200 to 20,000.      \\"My back hurts. I don't have a lot of words left,\\" Davis said after being showered with cheers by activists at the Capitol.      Among political junkies who had never heard of the two-term senator, Davis is suddenly being hailed as a comer for statewide office.      It was not the first filibuster victory for the fearless legislator, who is an avid runner and cyclist.      In 2011, she clogged up the legislative gears with her filibuster of a budget bill that cut 4 billion from public education in Texas.      \\"I know the economy is important to Gov. (Rick) Perry. Obviously, he likes to talk about what a great place Texas is and what a wonderful climate we've created here for that,\\" Davis told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram in January. \\"But if we don't have an educated workforce, it won't be long before we lose our footing there.\\"      Her rookie talkathon then ran out the clock and forced the Republican governor to call a special session.      The high-profile stunt not only put a big spotlight on the freshman senator. It also made her a big political target for unhappy Republican power brokers.      Perry took a swipe at the first-term senator for upending his budget maneuvers in the 2011 legislative session: \\"We come here to work. We don't come here to be show horses.\\"      But the cool and collected Davis, who has championed women's issues in the Legislature, shrugged off any worry of repercussions.      \\"I've never worried about payback,\\" she told The New York Times.\\"People are hungry for leadership that's not afraid of political consequence.\\"      Before Tuesday night, Davis was known among Texas political insiders and Austin-based activists but generally unknown throughout the state, said James Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas.      In a poll conducted by UT/Texas Tribune earlier this month, more than half of respondents said they had never heard of Davis, while 11% had a favorable opinion of her and 12% had an unfavorable opinion of her, Henson said.      That changed Tuesday night.      \\"Those numbers are immediately obsolete,\\" he said. \\"My suspicion is that those numbers are going to be up – on both ends.\\"      It might also open up new political avenues for Davis.      The progressive political blog Daily Kos took note of her new high-profile and began asking readers whether it should start a draft movement for Davis to run against Perry in 2014 if he seeks a fourth term as governor.      Public Policy Polling had taken a sounding in January about just such a matchup and found that the largely unknown Davis even then was only trailing Perry 47-41.      \\"Wendy Davis would nationalize that Texas governor's race, and help accelerate the state's transition to Purple (and eventually Blue) status,\\" Daily Kos founder Markos Moulitsas wrote in a post.

Webster      Wednesday, June 26, 2013 0:46 EDT      Update: Davis filibuster succeeds amid chaos as Republicans fail to legally pass anti-abortion bill      Gilberto Hinojosa, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, said he hopes that Sen. Wendy Davis (D), who conducted a 10-hour filibuster against a bill that would close all but five abortion clinics in the state and ban all abortions after 20 weeks, will run for statewide office. Speaking to Raw Story from the Texas Capitol on Tuesday night, Hinojosa said she would likely win a bid for the governor’s office thanks to her marathon filibuster.      “I’m so proud of her effort and what she’s showed Texas,” Hinojosa said. “Women deserve, in this state, to be treated with dignity. I think that she’s taken it to the Republicans in a way that was not expected. She has put them to shame and made us all very, very, very proud.”      Asked about her potential political future, Hinojosa cracked a wide grin. “Wendy is not only extremely intelligent and articulate, she’s great on the issues and she’s got a great personal story — a single mother who made it out of a life of poverty to go to Harvard law school, then gets elected to the city council and the Texas Senate by beating an incumbent Republican,” he said. “She is someone that can really, really excite people across the state of Texas, who really shows true leadership.”      “She doesn’t play games or worry about what’s going to get her votes,” Hinojosa continued. “She does what she believes is right. We’ve been sorely lacking that kind of leadership in the state of Texas for more than 20 years. So, yeah. I’m hoping she runs for statewide office, and I know that should she decide to, all of these women and men that are here today, young and old, will work their hearts out for her. She’d probably get elected governor, or whatever other office she wants to run for.”      Davis’s filibuster unceremoniously ended just after 10 p.m. CST when Republicans cited her on a third “point of order” for allegedly going off-topic by mentioning Planned Parenthood in her filibuster of S.B. 5. At the time of this writing, fellow Texas Democrats were pulling out all the stops to block a full vote on S.B. 5 by using arcane parliamentary tactics to delay until midnight, when the special session officially ends.      S.B. 5 would ban all abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy — well before medical experts say a fetus is viable outside the womb — and force all but five of the abortion clinics in Texas to shut their doors by 2014.      If they succeed, it’s still possible that the bill could come up again in the days to follow if Gov. Rick Perry (R) decides to call another special session, which he could do tomorrow if he desires. Perry initially placed the anti-abortion measure on the legislature’s docket as an “emergency” provision, and said at the time he would like to see the right to abortion completely revoked in the state.      ——      [Photo: Screenshot via YouTube.] ||||| Texas on Tuesday night stole the national spotlight as a state senator led nearly 13 hours of filibuster in protest of a controversial abortion measure — and succeeded in killing the bill. Here’s what you need to know about the Austin showdown:      1. Who led the charge? State. Sen Wendy Davis, a Democrat from Fort Worth, spoke for close to 13 hours on Tuesday as she voiced her opposition to the abortion legislation during the end of a special session of the state legislature.      Text Size -      +      reset PHOTOS: Wendy Davis's filibuster Play Slideshow More from Davis after filibuster      ‘’What I think it accomplished is what I hoped it would and that was to inspire people to understand that there are voices here on the senate floor that represent them,” she told reporters. “And I felt empowered by their presence, by their support, by the letters …. They made a difference and they are what makes Texans so amazing. And I am proud to be a Texan tonight.”      (PHOTOS: Longest filibusters in history)      Davis, raised by a single mother, was by age 19 a single mom herself after being married and divorced. She earned her family’s first bachelor’s degree from Texas Christian University before attending Harvard Law School. First elected to the state senate in 2008, she has had a briefer experience with filibustering before: in 2011, she took to the floor over public education cuts.      2. What was the legislative fight about? At issue was Senate Bill 5, which according to the Texas Tribune “would have banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, required physicians to have hospital admitting privileges within 30 miles of an abortion facility, required abortions — even drug-induced ones — to be performed in ambulatory surgical centers and required doctors to administer drugs that induce abortion in person.”      “Thanks to the powerful voices of thousands of Texans, #SB5 is dead,” Davis tweeted early Wednesday morning. “An incredible victory for Texas women and those who love them.”      (Also on POLITICO: Texas filibuster nets national attention)      At 3:01 a.m., Republican Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said that the bill had passed after the special session had expired, and therefore couldn’t be signed into law.      “An unruly mob, using Occupy Wall Street tactics, disrupted the Senate from protecting unborn babies,” he told reporters, according to the Austin American-Statesman.      3. What’s next for Davis? She received a massive outpouring of support from national figures via social media, sparking some to ponder her next steps. Tweets linked Davis to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (“Hillary Clinton/Wendy Davis 2016” read one popular tweet) and she got nods of support on Twitter from leading Democratic accounts including those belonging to President Barack Obama, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand.      (Also on POLITICO: Texas abortion bill falls)      A column in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram asked, “Is Wendy Davis ready for a bigger stage?” and explored the possibility of a gubernatorial run in 2014.      “She doesn’t play games or worry about what’s going to get her votes,” Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa told the progressive outlet the Raw Story. “She does what she believes is right. We’ve been sorely lacking that kind of leadership in the state of Texas for more than 20 years. So, yeah. I’m hoping she runs for statewide office, and I know that should she decide to, all of these women and men that are here today, young and old, will work their hearts out for her. She’d probably get elected governor, or whatever other office she wants to run for.” ||||| A      Have more to add? News tip? Tell us      For state Sen. Wendy Davis, daughter of a stage director, her Tuesday soliloquy stirred matinee-idol talk about a potentially dramatic run for governor.      With more than 90,000 viewers watching worldwide on YouTube and stars like Lena Dunham and Julianne Moore egging her on via Twitter, Davis took the Capitol floor to filibuster an abortion bill only two hours after the U.S. Supreme Court made her return to the Senate unlikely.      Davis has said only that she’ll run for re-election. But depending on what Gov. Rick Perry and Attorney General Greg Abbott do with old and new election maps, she might find more support running statewide, particularly with national Democrats pushing her to help nudge Texas from red toward blue.      If Perry steps down to focus on a 2016 presidential campaign, the likely Republican nominee is Abbott, one of the party’s staunchest opponents of abortion, even in cases of rape or incest.      An Abbott-Davis race for governor would win Texas Democrats more attention. And more votes.      But the question is whether she could win.      “The biggest question is whether Democrats are really ready to compete statewide,” Southern Methodist University political science professor Matthew Wilson said in an email.      Eight months before the March primary, no prominent Democrat is running at any level in an election where all statewide offices will be on a ballot led by U.S. Senate and congressional seats, not a presidential campaign.      “There’s not a lot of value in just being the party’s latest sacrificial lamb,” Wilson wrote, adding that although Abbott would have an edge, “a Davis candidacy would make things livelier than they’ve been in a while.”      Rice political science department Chairman Mark P. Jones, who has written for the online Texas Tribune about the more-purple-than-red nature of Texas government, was much more emphatic.      Davis would have “no chance whatsoever,” he said in an email, describing a campaign where Abbott would campaign against Washington Democrats without Perry’s baggage or history of missteps.      A campaign might tarnish her future and also get in the way of San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro’s hopes, Jones wrote.      Even the filibuster video will be used against her in a state where most voters oppose abortion, he wrote.      It’s tough doing a one-woman show.

Q: What doesn;t a player need to touch a disc?, Context: LaserDiscs potentially had a much longer lifespan than videocassettes. Because the discs were read optically instead of magnetically, no physical contact needs to be made between the player and the disc, except for the player's clamp that holds the disc at its center as it is spun and read.

By contrast, a VHS tape held all of its picture and sound information on the tape in a magnetic coating which is in contact with the spinning heads on the head drum, causing progressive wear with each use (though later in VHS's lifespan, engineering improvements allowed tapes to be made and played back without contact). Also, the tape was thin and delicate, and it was easy for a player mechanism, especially on a low quality or malfunctioning model, to mishandle the tape and damage it by creasing it, frilling (stretching) its edges, or even breaking it.

Write a summary based on this article: BY Dan Friedman      New York and New Jersey lawmakers said they will turn the other cheek and support aid for tornado recovery in Oklahoma, whose lawmakers want federal emergency aid for tornado relief even though all but tow opposed aid for Hurricane Sandy.      Those pledges came after conservative Oklahoma senator Jim Inhofe’s said Tuesday that he voted against aid for Sandy victims but wants it for his state because the two situations are “totally different.”      Inhofe said Hurricane Sandy bill was loaded with pork.      “They had things in the Virgin Islands,” Inhofe said on MSNBC. “They were fixing roads there, they were putting roofs on houses in Washington, D.C. Everybody was getting in and exploiting the tragedy that took place. That won’t happen in Oklahoma.      Inhofe got his facts partly wrong. The Sandy relief bill initially contained money for projects outside of areas damaged by Sandy, with the hope of attracting enough votes to get it through Congress.      That spending represented a small portion of the massive bill - and much of it eventually was dropped from the legislation after objections by Republicans in the House.      The Sandy relief legislation did not contain money to put roofs on homes in Washington, but there were funds to repair museum roofs damaged by the hurricane.      Oklahoma’s other senator, Tom Coburn, a Republican, wants any federal aid for victims of Monday’s tornado to be offset by cuts elsewhere in the federal budget, his spokesman said Tuesday.      Democrats, who oppose offsets emergency disaster aid, said Coburn will have to vote against help for his own constituents if he wants to stick to his position.      \\"I am gonna go with no offsets,\\" said Senate Appropriations Chair Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.)who said lawmakers are starting to assess how much aid Oklahoma will need.      \\"Sen Coburn is consistent in his views and he is consistently wrong,” Mikulski said.      Both of Oklahoma’s senators and three of its five House members voted against the 60.2 billion aid package for Sandy victims.      Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), whose district includes the tornado-shattered town of Moore, Okla., voted for the Sandy package.      Rep. Peter King (R-L.I.) who helped move Sandy aid through the House, declined to address Inhofe’s statements but said that he would never deny the state aid because of its elected officials’ opposition to the Sandy aid.      “I don’t want the people of Oklahoma to suffer for something politicians have done,” King said. “I’ve been through this. I will support them 100 percent.”      -With Joseph Straw      dfriedman@nydailynews.com      @dfriedman33 ||||| New York Rep. Peter King on Tuesday said he’s willing to overlook the “hypocrisy” of lawmakers who opposed aid for his state in the wake of Superstorm Sandy but might support funding for tornado-stricken Oklahoma.      “I think there’s a lot of hypocrisy involved here, [Sen. James] Inhofe saying Sandy aid was corrupt but Oklahoma won’t be,” King (R-N.Y.) told POLITICO. “But I don’t want to hold the people of Oklahoma responsible for what elected officials are saying, for the husband and wife without a home, for the people who lost all their worldly possessions.”      Text Size -      +      reset Peter King unloads on John Boehner over Sandy bill Obama: Nation stands with Okla.      King, who stressed that he wasn’t looking for a fight, emphasized that aid should be provided to Oklahoma — which sustained a deadly tornado on Monday — without the requirement of budgetary offsets.      (PHOTOS: Oklahoma tornado)      “I’ve always believed that but certainly, going through it myself [during Sandy], seeing the devastation a national disaster brings to a district…it’s a [national issue], not a local issue, like Sandy wasn’t a New York, New Jersey issue,” he said. “It’s an American issue, we have an obligation to come forward.”      Inhofe (R-Okla.), for his part, said on MSNBC on Tuesday that he had wanted reduced Sandy aid because “everyone was getting in and exploiting the tragedy taking place” by adding funding for unrelated projects to the measure, but said “that won’t happen in Oklahoma.” Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) indicated early on Tuesday that he would support offsets for Oklahoma aid.      King was a vocal critic of those in his own party who didn’t back full Sandy funding.      “I won’t hold it against anyone,” King said of lawmakers who opposed Sandy aid but could support Oklahoma help without offsets. “I don’t want suffering people in Oklahoma to be held hostage while we engage in political fights, saying ‘I told you so.’ I want to deal with it on the merits.” ||||| Summary:","output":"New York and New Jersey lawmakers have promised to support aid for tornado recovery in Oklahoma.

The lawmakers believe that the situations in Oklahoma and the areas affected by Hurricane Sandy are different. They say that the aid provided for Sandy had additional unrelated expenses, while Oklahoma aid will not have this. The decision to provide aid to Oklahoma is a sign of goodwill from the politicians who support it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Aside from the tastelessness of having a sitcom about Hitler, it just isn't funny or entertaining in any way. It is very similar to a 1950's sitcom in its cornball humor and contrived situations, but while it can be well done like in I Love Lucy, it's just not funny here. I think the show was based around the novelty \\"look, it's Hitler as a bumbling sitcom figure\\" but it just fell flat in every regard. The guy playing Hitler is so hammy that its hard to sit through that alone. I wonder what could have possibly made the network think this was a good idea to air. I thought America had some tasteless show, but the Brits had us beat this time. America would never air a sitcom about Hitler, although we did have that show about Lincoln's slave, The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer.

Triton is the largest Neptunian moon, comprising more than 99.5% of the mass in orbit around Neptune,[e] and it is the only one massive enough to be spheroidal. Triton was discovered by William Lassell just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself. Unlike all other large planetary moons in the Solar System, Triton has a retrograde orbit, indicating that it was captured rather than forming in place; it was probably once a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt. It is close enough to Neptune to be locked into a synchronous rotation, and it is slowly spiralling inward because of tidal acceleration. It will eventually be torn apart, in about 3.6 billion years, when it reaches the Roche limit. In 1989, Triton was the coldest object that had yet been measured in the Solar System, with estimated temperatures of 38 K (−235 °C).

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The pro-decolonisation Labour government, elected at the 1945 general election and led by Clement Attlee, moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire: that of Indian independence. India's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to how it should be implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 1948. When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan. Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of the British Raj, and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.  Question: \\"Why is there a perception that Californians are more health conscious?\\" Answer: \\"Californians rank 10th for physical activity and progressive legislation that aids in obesity prevention and public health promotion\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"Yes, the answer is correct. The perception that Californians are more health-conscious can be attributed to their higher rankings in physical activity, healthy blood pressure, and a diet rich in fruits and vegetables compared to other states. Additionally, California has been known for its progressive legislation in areas such as tobacco control, environmental protection, and obesity prevention, all of which contribute to public health promotion. This combination of healthy lifestyles and forward-thinking policies reinforces the perception that Californians are more health-conscious overall."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The U.S. Supreme Court signaled Wednesday it may be open to new limits on the government's ability to track someone's movements by accessing data on that person's cellphone.  A case before the high court could result in a landmark decision in the ongoing debate over civil liberties protections in an era of rapid technological change.  At issue is whether law enforcement will be able to access cellphone data that can reveal a person's whereabouts without having to first obtain a court-issued search warrant.  The case stems from the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. On Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information.  They also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  \\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \\"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\\"  Some of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age.  \\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said.  Chief Justice John Roberts, who often sides with conservatives on the court, said the central question was whether the cellphone information should be accessible to the government \\"without a warrant.\\" How long after Timothy Carpenter was convicted did he continue to rob people? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. 100 days  B. 10 days  C. 0 days  D. not enough information","output":"C. 0 days The case before the U.S. Supreme Court concerns the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. After his conviction, Carpenter did not continue to rob people, so the correct answer is 0 days. The main issue being discussed in the high court is whether law enforcement should be able to access cellphone data without a court-issued search warrant. The American Civil Liberties Union argues that this would violate the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits unreasonable search and seizures. Several justices raised concerns about privacy in the digital age, making it clear that there is a need to balance civil liberties with the demands of law enforcement in this era of rapid technological change. A landmark decision on this issue may set new precedents in how the government can track individuals using their cellphone data and could potentially change the way law enforcement gathers evidence for cases like Carpenter's. As the ongoing debate over civil liberties and technological advancements continues, the Supreme Court's ruling on this case could have significant implications for privacy rights in the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Biletnikoff (born February 23, 1943) is a former gridiron football player and coach. He was a wide receiver for the Oakland Raiders in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL) for fourteen seasons and later an assistant coach with the team. He retired as an NFL player after the 1978 season, and then played one additional season in the Canadian Football League (CFL) for the Montreal Alouettes in 1980. While he lacked the breakaway speed for deep pass receptions, Biletnikoff was one of the most sure-handed and consistent receivers of his day. He was also known for running smooth, precise pass routes. He is a member of both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and College Football Hall of Fame.  - Florida State University (commonly referred to as Florida State or FSU) is an American public space-grant and sea-grant research university. Its primary campus is located on a 1,391.54-acre (5.631 km2) campus in Tallahassee, Florida, United States. It is a senior member of the State University System of Florida. Founded in 1851, it is located on the oldest continuous site of higher education in the state of Florida.  - The Fred Biletnikoff Award is presented annually to the outstanding receiver in American college football by the Tallahassee Quarterback Club Foundation, Inc. (TQCF), an independent not-for-profit organization which created the award in 1994 and has sponsored it since. The award is named for Fred Biletnikoff, who played college football at Florida State University and professionally with the Oakland Raiders. Any NCAA Division I FBS player who catches the football through the forward pass is eligible to be selected as the award winner, although every winner since 1994 has been a wide receiver. A national selection committee consisting of over 540 journalists, commentators, broadcasters, and former players selects the award winner. No member of the board of trustees of the foundation has a vote.  - History. Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S.  Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs  the highest level  playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities  Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University  consist entirely of chairback seating.)  - A wide receiver (also referred to as wideouts or simply receivers) is an offensive position in American and Canadian football, and is the key player in most of the passing plays. They get their name because they are split out \\"wide\\" (near the sidelines), furthest away from the rest of the team. Wide receivers are among the fastest players on the field. The wide receiver functions as the pass-catching specialist.  - The Oakland Raiders are a professional American football franchise based in Oakland, California. The team commenced operations in 1960 as a member of the American Football League (AFL); they are currently members of the National Football League (NFL), which merged with the AFL in 1970. The Raiders currently compete in the NFL as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) West division and play their home games at the OaklandAlameda County Coliseum. At the end of the NFL's 2015 season, the Raiders boasted a lifetime regular season record of 444 wins, 397 losses, and 11 ties; their lifetime playoff record currently stands at 25 wins and 18 losses.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose fanbase was alienated by her image as a militant and extremist? , can you please find it?   Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; this caused her popularity in the US to decline markedly. Conservatives came to regard her as a militant and an extremist, an image which alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite her efforts to portray her marriage as apolitical. White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government took an interest in her activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her under surveillance. While she and her husband were travelling in the Bahamas, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Touré. Makeba did not return to the US until 1987.Guinea remained Makeba's home for the next 15 years, and she and her husband became close to President Ahmed Sékou Touré and his wife, Andrée. Touré wanted to create a new style of African music, and all musicians received a minimum wage if they practised for several hours every day. Makeba later stated that \\"I've never seen a country that did what Sékou Touré did for artists.\\" After her rejection from the US she began to write music more directly critical of the US government's racial policies, recording and singing songs such as \\"Lumumba\\" in 1970, (referring to Patrice Lumumba, the assassinated Prime Minister of the Congo), and \\"Malcolm X\\" in 1974. Answer:","output":"The name of the person whose fanbase was alienated by her image as a militant and extremist is Miriam Makeba. Makeba's marriage to Stokely Carmichael in March 1968 caused her popularity in the United States to decline significantly. As a result, conservatives viewed her as a militant and extremist, leading to the alienation of much of her fanbase. Due to this image, her performances were canceled, her press coverage declined, and support from white American audiences decreased. The United States government also began to take an interest in her activities, with the CIA and FBI placing her under surveillance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: By 2050 there will have been an extra 2.5 billion people on earth. And what will they eat? To solve the problem, we should have to double our food production. We can also develop a diet of algae , insects and meat grown in laboratories. Algae can grow very quickly at sea, in polluted water and in places that would normally kill food crops. They are already eaten widely in Japan and China and they are eaten by almost everything from shrimps to blue whales. They can fix CO2 in the atmosphere and provide fats and sugars. Man-made meat looks like meat, feels like meat and it is meat, although it's never been from a living, breathing animal. Instead, it is grown from cells in big containers. Moreover, studies show that producing man-made meat will use far less water, energy and land. China has developed \\"green super rice\\", a series of rice types which produce more grain and have stronger ability to fight against floods, salty water, insects and disease. We used traditional plant breeding techniques to cross-breed more than 250 rice types. Green super rice, which is enough to feed an extra 100 million people, will be planted widely in the coming years. Insects like ants are not on most European menus but at least 1,400 kinds are eaten across Africa, Latin America and Asia. Now, with rising food prices and worldwide land shortages, such insects are getting more and more popular. Not only are many insects rich in protein , low in fat and high in Ca and Fe, but insect farms need little space. And they can grow well on paper, algae and industrial wastes. Question: What can we learn from the passage? Answer: Choices:  1). Green super rice is delicious but high in price.  2). In Asia about 100 million people may be faced with food shortages.  3). Man-made meat doesn't look like meat but has the same taste as real meat.  4). One of the reasons why many people begin to eat insects is their rich food value. The answer is:","output":"4). One of the reasons why many people begin to eat insects is their rich food value. From the passage, we learn that with the increasing global population, there is a need to double our food production by 2050 to accommodate the extra 2.5 billion people on earth. To address this concern, various solutions are being explored, such as developing a diet consisting of algae, insects, and laboratory-grown meat. Algae have the potential to be a sustainable food source as they can grow rapidly in diverse environments and provide essential nutrients. They are already consumed in countries like Japan and China. Man-made meat also shows promise as it can be grown from cells in big containers, using far less water, energy, and land compared to traditional meat production. Another important development mentioned is China's \\"green super rice,\\" which is a series of rice types created through traditional plant breeding techniques. This rice has a higher grain yield and can better withstand floods, salty water, insects, and diseases. Green super rice could potentially feed an extra 100 million people in the future. The passage also highlights that insects, such as ants, are consumed in many countries across Africa, Latin America, and Asia. These insects are gaining popularity, especially considering the rising food prices and global land shortages. One of the reasons for this growing popularity is the rich food value of insects. They are high in protein, low in fat, and contain essential minerals like calcium and iron. Moreover, insect farms require minimal space and can thrive on paper, algae, and industrial wastes. In conclusion, the passage provides information about various innovative and sustainable solutions for addressing the growing global food demand, including algae, laboratory-grown meat, green super rice, and insects. One of the reasons why many people are turning to eat insects is their rich food value."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Movie title: Jason and the Argonauts Movie plot: Pelias (Douglas Wilmer), misinterpreting the prophecy given to him by the god Zeus (Niall MacGinnis), usurps the throne of Thessaly, killing King Aristo and most of his family. The infant Jason is spirited away by one of Aristo's soldiers. Pelias slays one of the king's daughters, Briseis (Davina Taylor), as she seeks sanctuary in the temple of the goddess Hera (Honor Blackman). Because the murder has profaned her temple, the angry Hera becomes Jason's protector. She warns Pelias to beware \\"of a man wearing one sandal\\". Twenty years later, Jason (Todd Armstrong) saves Pelias from drowning (orchestrated by Hera), but loses his sandal in the river; Pelias recognizes him from the prophecy. Learning that Jason intends to find the legendary Golden Fleece, he encourages him, hoping Jason will be killed in the attempt. Jason is brought to Mount Olympus to speak with Zeus and Hera. Hera tells him Zeus has decreed he can only call upon her for aid five times. She directs him to search for the Fleece in the land of Colchis. Zeus offers his direct aid, but Jason declares he can organize the voyage, build a ship, and collect a crew of the bravest men in all Greece. Men from all over Greece compete for the honor. Because their ship is named the Argo after her builder, Argus (Laurence Naismith), the crew are dubbed the Argonauts. Among them are Hercules (Nigel Green), Hylas (John Cairney), and Acastus (Gary Raymond), the son of Pelias, sent by his father to sabotage the voyage. Hera guides Jason to the Isle of Bronze, but warns him to take nothing but provisions. However, Hercules steals a brooch pin the size of a javelin from a treasure building, surmounted by a gigantic statue of Talos, which comes to life and attacks the Argonauts. Jason again turns to Hera, who tells him to open a large plug on Talos' heel, to release the giant's ichor. Talos falls to the ground, crushing Hylas, hiding his body. Hercules refuses to leave until he ascertains the fate of his friend. The other Argonauts refuse to abandon Hercules, so... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Jason and the Argonauts,\\" it is Jason who is brought to Mount Olympus to speak with the gods Zeus and Hera. This event occurs after Jason saves Pelias from drowning – in fact, it is during this rescue that Jason loses his sandal, an incident which fulfills the earlier prophecy that Pelias had been warned about. Once on Mount Olympus, Jason has a conversation with both Zeus and Hera. The goddess Hera expresses her displeasure with Pelias for having profaned her temple years before and decides to become Jason's protector. She warns Jason that he can only call upon her for help five times during his quest for the legendary Golden Fleece, which is said to be located in the land of Colchis. Meanwhile, Zeus offers his direct assistance to Jason, but Jason is determined to prove his capabilities by organizing the voyage, building a ship, and gathering a crew of brave men from all over Greece. These men, named after the ship's builder, Argus, come to be known as the Argonauts. The crew includes many notable figures, such as Hercules, Hylas, and Acastus, the latter of whom is the son of Pelias, sent to jeopardize the journey. During the epic journey, Jason and the Argonauts encounter various challenges and obstacles, including facing a gigantic statue of Talos on the Isle of Bronze. Throughout these trials, Jason calls upon Hera for assistance, making use of her five offers of aid. To sum up, Jason is the main character in the movie \\"Jason and the Argonauts\\" who is brought to Mount Olympus to speak with Zeus and Hera. During this encounter, the gods offer their support and protection to Jason as he embarks on a perilous quest to find the Golden Fleece, and Hera allows him to call on her help five times during the voyage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

According to Louis Fisher in The Politics of Shared Power, Ronald Reagan said to Congress in his 1986 State of the Union address, \`\`Tonight I ask you to give me what forty-three governors have: Give me a line-item veto this year. Give me the authority to veto waste, and I'll take the responsibility, I'll make the cuts, I'll take the heat.'' Bill Clinton echoed the request in his State of the Union address in 1995. Congress attempted to grant this power to the president by the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 to control \`\`pork barrel spending'', but in 1998 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the act to be unconstitutional in a 6-3 decision in Clinton v. City of New York. The court found that exercise of the line-item veto is tantamount to a unilateral amendment or repeal by the executive of only parts of statutes authorizing federal spending, and therefore violated the Presentment Clause of the United States Constitution. Thus a federal line-item veto, at least in this particular formulation, would only be possible through a constitutional amendment. Prior to that ruling, President Clinton applied the line-item veto to the federal budget 82 times.

A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is prepared for by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night; in some traditions, Christmastide includes an Octave. The traditional Christmas narrative, the Nativity of Jesus, delineated in the New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies; when Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then disseminated the message furthermore. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world's nations, is celebrated religiously by the vast majority of Christians, as well as culturally by a number of non-Christian people, and is an integral part of the holiday season, while some Christian groups reject the celebration.

It will come as no surprise to those working in the UK’s higher education (HE) sector that universities are currently suffused with anxiety. The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states: “Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.” Yet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour. In 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time-management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with...

Title: Excellent text for the Sermon on the Mount Review: Charles Talbet's book on the Sermon on the Mount is highly recommended for understanding the Sermon on the Mount within its context of The Gospel of Matthew and the cultural background of the first century. While not necessarily agreeing with Talbert's view of the development of Christianity he does seem to have a good grasp of how the Sermon fits into Matthew's gospel. I would recommend it for preachers and adult Bible class teachers who want to go a little deeper and can understand an author who goes a little deeper than usual biblical studies. It is not for the average Christian but a good preacher can use the material to shape lessons that will be helpful to the average Christian. It is a book I'm glad is now in my library.

Once our Vet determined that there was nothing further that could be done she showed me how to give pain meds and fluids at home to keep her comfortable in hopes that she would live long enough to allow my daughter to say goodbye after her graduation. The entire week I stayed with our cat around the clock. She had completely stopped eating and drinking and was slowly dying before my eyes. She slept most of the time except when I had to put the needle in between her shoulder blades to give her fluids. Then she would cry quietly and look at me with pleading eyes. Her breathing was becoming so shallow that I had to get close to her and listen to see if she was still alive. After a week of this I began to realize that the most unselfish thing I could do for this beautiful creature was to let her go. I wrapped her in her favorite blanket and and drove her to our Vets office after they had closed for the day. She was so skinny and frail but when I held her close she still purred.

Since you mentioned that you haven't had rest recently, it is quite likely that your body and mind feel worn out from the continuous work and lack of proper relaxation. Exhaustion is a state where one feels both physically and mentally drained due to prolonged or intense activity without adequate rest. This state can manifest as a feeling of tiredness, weak muscles, difficulty concentrating, irritability, and an overall sense of being overwhelmed. Option A, \\"were very tired,\\" may not fully capture the extent of your fatigue, as exhaustion goes beyond regular tiredness and signifies a more severe state. Option B, \\"rested,\\" contradicts your statement about not having had rest recently, so it cannot accurately describe how you feel. Option C, \\"worked all day,\\" is an action, not a feeling, and therefore is unsuitable for describing how you feel at the moment. Finally, option E, \\"muscles tired,\\" touches upon only one aspect of exhaustion, which is physical fatigue, and doesn't account for the mental exhaustion that occurs from a lack of rest.

Question: I read this background article the other day: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  I am facing a new situation today: Roger and Samantha are brother and sister. Both of them perform roughly the same amount of physical activity on a day-to-day basis. Roger, however, eats a lot more food relative to the amount he needs given his activity levels. Samantha, on the other hand, eats the appropriate amount of food given her level of activity.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who is more likely to develop hypertension in the future? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the given situation, Roger is more likely to develop hypertension in the future as compared to Samantha. The reasoning behind this conclusion can be understood through the connection between excess food energy consumption, obesity, and the risk of health problems such as hypertension. According to the article, when a person consistently consumes more food energy than they need, the unused energy is stored in the body as fat. This additional fat accumulation can eventually lead to obesity. Obesity is defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30.0 kg/m² or greater, and it is a significant factor associated with an increased risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. In the given situation, Roger and Samantha both have similar activity levels. However, Roger consistently eats more food relative to the amount he needs concerning his activity levels, while Samantha consumes an appropriate amount based on her activity level. This suggests that Roger is more likely to accumulate excess body fat and possibly become obese in the long term. As obesity is intimately related to the increased risk of hypertension, and given that Roger is at a higher risk of becoming obese due to his overconsumption of food energy in comparison to his physical activity levels, it can be concluded that Roger is more likely to develop hypertension in the future as compared to Samantha. Samantha's balanced approach to eating and physical activity will likely help her maintain a healthier body composition and weight, ultimately reducing her risk of developing hypertension."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The documentaries are varied and deal with all sorts of concepts, the only thing being shared is 9/11 as a theme (very minor in some cases). Some of the segements are weak while others are very strong; some are political, some are not; some are solely about 9/11, some simply use 9/11 as a theme to touch on human feelings, emotions and tragedies that are universal; some are mainstream while others are abstract and artistic). This film has not been censored in any fashion by anyone so the thoughts that you see are very raw and powerful. This is a very controversial film, especially for conservative Americans. I think two segments might really tick off the right wingers (one from Egypt where a dead American soldier and a dead Palestinian bomber come back as spirits; another from UK which recounts the US-backed overthrow of Chile on Sept 11, 1973, which resulted in 50,000 deaths and horrible atrocities). The segment from Mexico was the most powerful, recounting the fall of the towers and the resulting death in vivid fashion (you have to see it to believe it).

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First question: How can I edit a vector image in .ai (Adobe Illustrator) on a Mac? To edit a vector image in Adobe Illustrator on a Mac, follow these detailed steps: 1. Install Adobe Illustrator: If you haven't already, download and install Adobe Illustrator from the Adobe website. You may need to sign up for an account and purchase a subscription. 2. Launch Adobe Illustrator: Once installed, open Adobe Illustrator on your Mac by clicking on its icon in your Applications folder or dock. 3. Open the vector file: To open the vector image you'd like to edit, go to the menu bar and click on \\"File,\\" then \\"Open,\\" navigate to the location of your file, select it, and click \\"Open\\" again. 4. Familiarize yourself with the interface: Adobe Illustrator uses an array of tools and panels. On the left side, you'll find the toolbar with tools for selecting, drawing, and manipulating objects. On the right side, panels display information related to the selected objects like color, stroke, and appearance. The top menu contains functions organized in categories like File, Edit, Object, Type, Select, and more. 5. Selection: Choose the \\"Selection Tool\\" (V) or \\"Direct Selection Tool\\" (A) from the toolbar on the left. The Selection Tool is for selecting and moving entire objects, while the Direct Selection Tool allows you to select individual anchor points and manipulate them. 6. Edit objects: To edit an object, click on it with the appropriate Selection Tool, and then manipulate the control points, handles, or bounding box to alter the shape, size, or position of the object. You can also use the \\"Pathfinder\\" options to combine or divide objects or the \\"Shape Builder Tool\\" (Shift + M) to merge and subtract shapes more intuitively. 7. Adding or changing text: To work with text, use the \\"Type Tool\\" (T). Click and drag to create a text box, then type your desired text. With your text selected, you can adjust font, style, and size from the floating \\"Character\\" panel or the top control panel. 8. Change colors and strokes: Select an object, and then modify its fill color, stroke color, and stroke weight using the \\"Color\\" or \\"Swatches\\" panels on the right side of the screen. You can also apply gradients, patterns, or transparency using the \\"Gradient\\" and \\"Transparency\\" panels. 9. Layers: Illustrator organizes objects in layers, which can be accessed in the \\"Layers\\" panel on the right side of the screen. Use layers to manage the arrangement and visibility of objects within your artwork. 10. Saving your work: To save your edited vector image, click \\"File\\" from the top menu, and then \\"Save\\" or \\"Save As\\" to choose your desired file format, such as .ai, .eps, .pdf, .svg, or .png, depending on your needs. Second question: Why Airtel still not launched fiber broadband? Airtel has been launching fiber broadband services under the brand name \\"Airtel Xstream Fiber\\" in many cities across India. However, the rollout might not yet have reached your specific location for several reasons: 1. Infrastructure development: The deployment of fiber broadband networks is a significant undertaking that demands time, resources, and adequate infrastructure. Airtel may still be in the process of building or upgrading its network in your area. 2. Prioritization of markets: Airtel may opt to prioritize markets based on factors such as demand, market maturity, and competition when launching their fiber broadband services. Consequently, some regions could experience delays in receiving access to the fiber broadband network. 3. Regulatory obstacles: The launch of fiber broadband can be impeded by permits, licensing requirements, or other regulatory issues specific to your region. Airtel may be working to address these challenges before they can proceed with the fiber broadband rollout. 4. Cost considerations: The expense of deploying and maintaining fiber broadband networks can be substantial, prompting Airtel to act prudently in terms of where they launch the service. Market factors, such as return on investment and the potential user base, can influence Airtel's decision to delay the rollout in some regions. In conclusion, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question inquires about editing vector images in Adobe Illustrator on a Mac, while the second question pertains to the rollout of Airtel's fiber broadband services. Both topics are unrelated to each other as one discusses graphic design software, and the other pertains to a telecom company's broadband services."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Owen inherited two pieces of land.

USC freshman QB Barkley is the real deal The prodigy and the powerhouse, a coming-of-age story that's about to hit a stadium near you this fall. In a stunning decision Thursday, Pete Carroll announced that 18-year old Matt Barkley would be his starting quarterback. True freshmen just don't win jobs like that at top-shelf programs with national championship hopes. Barkley, however, is not your ordinary freshman, something the rest of the country is about to learn. Yes, the door on the depth chart widened after third-year sophomore Aaron Corp fractured a bone in his leg, but Barkley took this job and made the decision for the coaching staff surprisingly clear. He was simply better. Better than Corp. Better than Mitch Mustain. Better than anyone in the program expected and that's why he's starting the opener against San Jose State. Since arriving in the spring, it was obvious Barkley was different than any rookie Trojan in recent memory. And it wasn't his physical skills that drew the most attention. Sure, Barkley has remarkable arm strength and accuracy, but those alone wouldn't have made the leap from high school star to USC starter possible. Barkley is unique in ways that stand out most to coaches. He's mature beyond his years, competitive and has already earned the respect of veteran teammates. He has a quiet confidence and a swagger that will settle down even the most skittish huddle. And he possesses the instincts and feel for the position that cannot be taught. Simply, he was born to be a big-time quarterback. That he was born in 1990 makes his development so remarkable. Does Barkley remain in the driver's seat for all 13 games? It's up to him. The schedule has plenty of landmines, beginning with the Week 2 trip to Ohio State. There's no manual to prepare a young quarterback for a night game at the Horseshoe. He has tested the boundaries of expectations throughout his brief athletic career, meaning you might not want to doubt him. And what about Corp? So impressive in beating Mustain for the No. 2 spot a year ago and seemingly the heir apparent once Mark Sanchez bolted, he's left to wonder if his window of opportunity is about to shut. Although Carroll considers competition a cornerstone of his program, a successful Barkley might not look back until after declaring early for the 2012 NFL draft. So, one of the highest-profile programs in the country has a true freshman as its quarterback. Now what? The playbook won't be compromised, or else the kid wouldn't have gotten the nod. It's business as usual at USC until proven otherwise. For Carroll, who has as much goodwill as any coach this side of Gainesville, it's a low-risk move, with an awful lot to gain. If Barkley can't deliver, the coach has a couple of five-star recruits waiting in the wings. Plus, he knows this youngster won't be shaken by a rough start. If the kid flourishes, Carroll becomes the genius coach, who was not afraid to give the ball to a rookie, another huge talking point on the recruiting trail. Heck, this is the same Carroll, who was ready to pull the trigger on starting a young John David Booty a few years ago before injuries changed the blueprint? It turns out that the buzz surrounding Barkley in the spring was real and just a sneak peek of what was about to come. Now that he's earned his first start a few days before his 19th birthday, things are about to get real interesting for the boy wonder and everyone that follows his budding career. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses the surprising decision by Coach Pete Carroll to select 18-year-old Matt Barkley as the starting quarterback for USC. Barkley, a true freshman, outperformed his competitors Aaron Corp and Mitch Mustain, despite the traditionally high stakes in top-tier college football programs. The article highlights Barkley’s maturity, competitiveness, instincts, and natural talent as key factors in his success. It also speculates about Barkley's potential future with the team, as well as the possible implications for Corp and Mustain. Overall, the article suggests that Barkley's decision to start is not only a testament to his abilities but also represents a potentially exciting moment in the future of USC football."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ray Charles Robinson (September 23, 1930 - June 10, 2004), known professionally as Ray Charles, was an American singer-songwriter, musician, and composer. Among friends and fellow musicians he preferred being called \\"Brother Ray\\". He was often referred to as \\"The Genius\\". Charles was blind from the age of seven. In June 1952, Atlantic Records bought Charles's contract for 2,500 (US23,039 in 2017 dollars). His first recording session for Atlantic (\\"The Midnight Hour\\"/\\"Roll with My Baby\\") took place in September 1952, although his last Swingtime release (\\"Misery in My Heart\\"/\\"The Snow Is Falling\\") would not appear until February 1953.  In 1953, \\"Mess Around\\" became Charles's first small hit for Atlantic; the following year he had hits with \\"It Should've Been Me\\" and \\"Don't You Know\\". He also recorded the songs \\"Midnight Hour\\" and \\"Sinner's Prayer\\".  Late in 1954, Charles recorded \\"I've Got a Woman\\". The lyrics were written by Ray's bandleader, Renald Richard. Ray claimed the composition. They later openly admitted that the song went back to The Southern Tones' \\"It Must Be Jesus\\" (1954, Duke 205). It became one of his most notable hits, reaching number two on the R&B chart. \\"I've Got a Woman\\" included a mixture of gospel, jazz and blues elements that would later prove to be seminal in the development of soul music. In 1955, he had hits with \\"This Little Girl of Mine\\" and \\"A Fool for You\\". In upcoming years, he scored with \\"Drown in My Own Tears\\" and \\"Hallelujah I Love Her So\\". In 1959, \\"What'd I Say\\" reached the #6 position on the Billboard Pop chart (and #1 on the Billboard R&B chart).  During his career, Charles also recorded instrumental jazz albums, such as The Great Ray Charles (1957). During this time, he also worked with the jazz vibraphonist Milt Jackson, releasing Soul Brothers in 1958 and Soul Meeting in 1961. By 1958, Charles was not only headlining black venues such as the Apollo Theater, in New York, but also bigger venues, such as Carnegie Hall and the Newport Jazz Festival (where his first live album was recorded in 1958). In 1956, Charles recruited a young all-female singing group, the Cookies, and reshaped them as the Raelettes.

The authorities set up a series of visits to Rahway State Prison, in which juvenile delinquents were introduced to “lifers” serving time for offenses ranging from bomb building to selling information to the Mafia. The visits were designed to be as traumatic as possible; inmates swore, screamed and regaled their pupils with graphic accounts of life on the inside – including embellished tales of rape, suicide and murder. The programme became known as “Scared Straight”. Before long it was being copied across the globe, including in over 30 states and Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada. The introduction of seatbelts had resulted in either no change or a net increase in road accident deaths It was popular, it was intuitive and it was cheap. There was just one problem: no one ever checked if it actually worked. In 1982, a follow-up study of the young subjects revealed the truth: not only did the programme fail to reduce their likelihood of turning to crime, it actually increased it. Scared Straight is by no means the only policy which has backfired. Take seatbelts. Before they became mandatory back in the 1980s, many expected them to save countless lives – after all, how could safety harnesses possibly be harmful? Some suggested they’d save as many as 1,000 people in their first year. When they were finally introduced, the number of cyclists killed on the roads is estimated to have risen by 40%, while pedestrian deaths increased by one in five. A subsequent analysis of the legislation in 18 countries found that the introduction of seatbelts had resulted in either no change or a net increase in road accident deaths. The counter-intuitive effect has been attributed to “risk compensation”; people typically change their behaviour in response to the perceived level of risk. When the risk is low, people are more reckless. “Sometimes what seems like a fairly good plan may become problematic due to factors you’re not aware of,” says Michael Hallsworth, who works at the UK government’s “Nudge Unit” – but more on that later. In the real world, our actions are a minefield of hidden motivations and psychological quirks. “We used to think that people take into account all of the available information and then weigh up the costs and benefits of different options. And there’s increasing evidence from the last 40 years that that’s not correct,” says Hallsworth. Perhaps the visits to Rahway made the delinquents feel that ending up in prison was inevitable, or merely desensitised them to its horrors. Worse, the programme may have helped to romanticise the “lifers” or set up the harsh realities of incarceration as a challenge. Many nudges take merely minutes, yet their effects may last for decades But it’s not all bad news. As it happens, there may be a way to use these idiosyncrasies to the public advantage. Enter “wise psychological interventions”, popularly known as “nudges”; techniques to bump people’s decision-making in the right direction by unlocking how we really think. They’re subtle, they’re ordinary, they certainly wouldn’t make a compelling documentary – but, crucially, each is rigorously tested to make sure it actually works. The result is an extraordinarily powerful technique which can raise millions or save lives. Many nudges take merely minutes, yet their effects may last for decades. In one study, completing a single one-hour exercise improved students’ grades for three years. In another, citizens were asked about their motivations for voting the day before an election. Simply changing the phrasing of the question increased voter turnout by 11%. This is big: for the 2016 US presidential election, it’s estimated a staggering 4bn will be spent on TV advertising. But even among those who spend the most time glued to their sets, adverts only increase turnout by around 10%. Back in 2010, former UK prime minister David Cameron set up the “Nudge Unit”; a crack team of scientists, psychologists and policy experts tasked with using the technique to improve education, health and the state of public finances. Governments have had difficulty getting people to pay their taxes for millennia – every advanced civilisation has grappled with this question – John List, University of Chicago To solve the latter, they found themselves pondering a perennial problem. They say only two things in life are certain: death and taxes. So why do so many people delay paying them – and how can they be coaxed to cough up? “Governments have had difficulty getting people to pay their taxes for millennia – every advanced civilisation has grappled with this question,” says John List, an economist from the University of Chicago who was involved in the study. In ancient Rome, farmers suffering under their tax burden would abandon their land and flee to the city of Constantinople (now part of Turkey), which was an early tax haven. By the Middle Ages, many men had resorted to joining monasteries – resigning themselves to a life of servitude not out of religious devotion, but the desire to avoid paying tax. With this long history in mind, the team decided to take a fresh approach. At the time, indebted UK citizens could expect to receive a letter telling them how much they owed and how to pay. It wasn’t working. Though the UK has one of the lowest “tax gaps” in the world, last year the amount of unpaid tax was still a hefty £34bn. That’s nearly enough to pay for the UK’s contributions to the European Union three times over. The HMRC could have tried to claw it back by sending people out to bang on doors, pleading with the “criminals” over the radio or spamming their letterboxes with ever more threatening letters. But they didn’t. Instead they took the standard letter and made some subtle additions. To the team’s surprise, this modest increase also occurred when people were reminded of what they gain from taxes In August 2011, around 100,000 people woke up to an envelope on their doorstop. They had all opted to self-report their taxes – rather than the money coming directly out of their pay packet – and owed the HMRC between £400 and £100,000. In case you were wondering, most of the debtors were men of about 50 years old. While one half of the group received the usual letter, the others received a copy with a single extra sentence. The team tried several options, each intended to invoke a different psychological quirk. One of these was “loss aversion”, or the tendency to feel losses more keenly than gains. It has plagued public policy for years: citizens who stand to lose 100 as a result of new legislation are likely to be disproportionately more vocal than those who stand to gain 100. When not paying their taxes was framed in terms of loss “Not paying tax means we all lose out on vital public services like the NHS, roads, and schools”, payment rates increased by 1.6%. That’s equivalent to around £760,000 of extra taxes. To the team’s surprise, this modest increase also occurred when people were reminded of what they gain from taxes. “Paying tax means we all gain from…” Though it wasn’t the result they expected, this is the entire point of testing out policies in clinical trials first. The next set aimed to trigger the citizen’s deep, in-built fear of being different, known as conformity bias. It’s thought to stem from the desire to avoid being rejected by our social group – a factor which had life-or-death significance in our evolutionary past. They noted; “Nine out of 10 people pay their tax on time”. The real breakthrough came from making these statements even more specific But the real breakthrough came from making these statements even more specific. In a later experiment, when the team observed that not only had most people paid, but most people in their area – ie their neighbours – payments shot up. Adding that most people with similar debts had also paid increased their earnings even further. Compared to the control group (who received the normal letter), adding this message – just 26 extra words – increased payment rates by 15%; equivalent to an extra £15.4m in just 23 days. When they were rolled out across the UK, the letters raised an extra £210m in their first year. Based on that estimate, as of today they’ve raised more than £630m. “What’s new about this approach is not just the knowledge of human psychology but it’s that it’s evidence-based policy making,” says List. Since the tax experiment, the team has applied the letters to solve numerous other problems, including tackling the over-prescription of antibiotics by doctors, which is thought to be contributing to rising antibiotic resistance. Discovering that their levels of prescribing were abnormal was so powerful, it reduced the number of prescriptions by 3.5% that winter The traditional approach to encourage doctors to use fewer antibiotics is to pay them. “That’s what we do when we want GPs to do anything right now – we pay them,” says Hallsworth. Instead, the team wondered if they could achieve equivalent results with their letter technique. “So we wrote to them at the start of flu season and told them that they were high prescribers,” he says. Incredibly, discovering that their levels of prescribing were abnormal was so powerful, it reduced the number of prescriptions by 3.5% that winter – equivalent to around a 1% reduction over the course of the year. “That same year we spent £23m on payments to GPs to get the same result,” he says. As of 2016, Nudge Units have been set up in the US, Canada, Australia, Singapore and Germany. And unlike the Scared Straight program, this time there won’t be any surprises.

They have spent about £40m on strikers since being relegated from the Premier League last season, much of it by previous Villa boss Roberto di Matteo last summer. Ross McCormack joined from Fulham for £12m before the start of the campaign, closely followed by Jonathan Kodjia, who arrived from Bristol City for a fee which could rise to £15m. Steve Bruce's side are 14th in the Championship table, 10 points below the play-off places. BBC Sport reporter Ian Westbrook Scott Hogan has made a remarkable recovery from two serious knee injuries to become one of the deadliest strikers in the Championship. He joined Brentford in the summer of 2014 for £750,000 from Rochdale, but in his second appearance as a substitute suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in his left knee in a match at Rotherham. He broke down again during his recovery period and, after 18 months out, was eased back into the side with two full and five substitute appearances at the end of last season, in which he scored seven goals. Hogan continued his prolific form this season and, proving his fitness, played every minute of Brentford's first 25 Championship games of the season, barring injury time at Birmingham on 2 January, scoring 14 goals in the process and attracting growing attention from other clubs.

Movie title: Shutter Island Movie plot: In 1954, two U.S. Marshals â Edward \\"Teddy\\" Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule â travel to the Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island located in Boston Harbor. They are investigating the disappearance of patient Rachel Solando, who was incarcerated for drowning her three children. Their only clue is a cryptic note found hidden in Solando's room: \\"The law of 4; who is 67?\\" They arrive just before a storm hits, preventing their return to the mainland for a few days. Daniels and Aule find the staff confrontational; Dr. John Cawley, the lead psychiatrist, refuses to turn over records, and they learn that Solando's doctor, Dr. Lester Sheehan, left the island on vacation immediately after Solando disappeared. Though they are given access to the hospital, they are told Ward C is off limits, while the lighthouse has already been searched. Whilst being interviewed, one patient secretly writes the word \\"RUN\\" in Daniels' notepad. Daniels starts to have migraine headaches from the hospital's atmosphere and experiences waking visions of his involvement in the Dachau liberation reprisals. He has disturbing dreams of his wife, Dolores Chanal, who was killed in a fire set by Andrew Laeddis, a local arsonist. In one instance Chanal tells Daniels that Solando is still on the island somewhere. The same applies to Laeddis who everyone claims was never there to begin with. Daniels later explains to Aule that locating Laeddis was an ulterior personal motive for taking the case. During their investigation Daniels and Aule find that Solando has abruptly resurfaced with no explanation as to her former whereabouts or how she escaped. This prompts Daniels to break into the restricted Ward C. There he encounters George Noyce who is a patient in solitary confinement. Noyce warns Daniels that the doctors are performing questionable experiments on the patients, some of whom are taken to the lighthouse to be lobotomized. Noyce warns Daniels that everyone else on the island, including Aule, is playing an... Answer:","output":"In the film, Shutter Island, the protagonist, Teddy Daniels, begins to unravel a complex web of conspiracies and hidden motives. As he gets closer to the truth, it becomes apparent that someone needs to leave the island before the situation spirals out of control. The main turning point which suggests leaving Shutter Island is necessary occurs when Teddy, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, discovers the experimentation on patients. He realizes that the doctors are conducting unethical and controversial procedures on the patients, including lobotomies — psychiatric treatments which involve severing the connections to the brain's prefrontal cortex. It is George Noyce, a patient from the restricted Ward C who tells Teddy about the experimentation. Teddy also begins to suspect that the staff and people on the island are involved in a conspiracy. Moreover, he believes that they are all in on a game to toy with his mind and prevent him from discovering the truth. There are several characters in the movie who could potentially foresee the need to leave the island. Teddy himself is the most apparent, as his life is at risk, and he cannot trust anyone around him. His partner, Chuck Aule, played by Mark Ruffalo, could also realize that their mission on the island is becoming increasingly dangerous and the best way to protect Teddy is to leave. Dr. John Cawley, the lead psychiatrist (played by Ben Kingsley), might think Teddy leaving the island is ideal if he believes that Teddy is too close to uncovering their secrets and would put their operation at risk. The staff and doctors who have hidden motives would also want Teddy to leave to preserve their operations and prevent authorities from getting wind of their controversial practices. The story reaches its climax when the storm prevents Teddy and Chuck from leaving the island immediately, entangling them further into the hospital's dark secrets. In the end, it is revealed that Teddy Daniels is, in fact, Andrew Laeddis, a patient at Ashecliffe. The entire plot is an elaborate role-play scenario designed by Dr. Cawley to help Teddy/Andrew regain his sanity. In conclusion, the character that suggests the need to leave the Shutter Island is Teddy Daniels/Andrew Laeddis, as he believes he is in danger, and his investigation into the island's secrets puts the hospital's practices at risk. However, leaving the island is complicated because the whole movie is a fabricated scenario created by the doctors as a part of Teddy's therapy. Therefore, throughout the movie, Teddy's need to leave the island serves as a representation of his desire to escape from his own internal struggles and the horrors of his past."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Halting just outside the village, Harry formed his men with a front across the whole road, and directed the lines to advance, twenty yards apart. Then, placing himself at their head, he gave the word, and charged down the street upon the Roundheads. The latter, occupied by their attack upon the houses, were unconscious of the presence of their foe until he was close upon them, and were taken utterly by surprise. The force of the charge was irresistible, and the Roundheads, dispersed and on foot, were cut down in all directions. Groups of twos and threes stood together and attempted resistance, but the main body thought only of regaining their horses. In three minutes after the Royalists entered the village the surviving Roundheads were in full flight, hotly pursued by the victorious Cavaliers. These, being for the most part better mounted, overtook and slew many of the Roundheads, and not more than half the force which had set out returned to their quarters at Didcot. The pursuit continued to within half a mile of that place, and then Harry, knowing that there was a force of Roundhead infantry there, drew off from the pursuit, and returned to Chalcombe. He found that more than half of Sir Ralph Willoughy's men had been killed, many having been cut down before they could betake themselves to their arms, those quartered in the inn, and at two or three of the larger houses, having alone maintained a successful resistance until the arrival of succor.

Q: Question: what happened to lynne on real housewives of orange county? Would \\"The series is a voyeuristic look into the wealthy lives of these housewives, as they shop, get plastic surgery, gossip, fight and live lavishly.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","output":"Answer: Lynne Curtin appeared as a regular cast member on Seasons 4 and 5 of the reality television series \\"The Real Housewives of Orange County\\" (RHOOC). The show provides a behind-the-scenes look into the luxurious lifestyles and interpersonal relationships of a group of wealthy women living in Orange County, California. During her time on the series, viewers witnessed various aspects of her life, including her relationships with her husband, Frank Curtin, and her two daughters, Alexa and Raquel. Lynne was initially portrayed as a laid-back, fun-loving mother who owned her own business, Lynne Curtin Designs, focusing on creating handcrafted cuffs and accessories. As the show's 4th and 5th seasons progressed, Lynne faced a series of personal and financial challenges. In 2009, it was revealed that she and her husband were experiencing financial troubles, including being served with an eviction notice for failing to pay several months' rent on their oceanfront home. Furthermore, the couple filed a lawsuit against the property owners, claiming that they were unlawfully evicted and that their belongings had been unlawfully seized. In regard to her personal life, Lynne struggled with disciplining her daughters and parenting them through their own challenges. Her daughters faced various issues, such as reckless behavior and substance abuse problems, which led to several confrontations between them and their parents throughout the show. Lynne's time on RHOOC came to an end after Season 5 when she was not asked to return for Season 6. The reasons behind her departure from the series have not been explicitly stated; however, it could be assumed that it was in part due to the increasing intensity of her personal and financial problems, which had become central to her storyline on the show. Since leaving RHOOC, Lynne has continued to focus on her business, while also dealing with the repercussions of her public life. In 2012, she and her husband Frank officially filed for divorce after 22 years of marriage. Her daughters have also faced various legal issues in the years following their time on the show. In summary, a more accurate answer to the question, \\"What happened to Lynne on the Real Housewives of Orange County?\\" would be: Lynne Curtin was a cast member on Seasons 4 and 5 of RHOOC, during which she faced numerous personal and financial struggles, including foreclosure and eviction, as well as difficulties in parenting her daughters. After leaving the show, she continued to deal with the consequences of her public life, including a divorce from her husband and ongoing challenges related to her daughters. While your suggested answer, \\"The series is a voyeuristic look into the wealthy lives of these housewives, as they shop, get plastic surgery, gossip, fight and live lavishly.\\" does generally describe the premise of \\"The Real Housewives of Orange County,\\" it doesn't directly address the specifics of Lynne Curtin's time on the show or the subsequent events in her life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First, we will tackle the left side of the equation: -73 + 31 = -42 Now we have the simplified equation -42 = -69x + 96. In order to isolate x and solve for it, we need to perform the following steps: Step 1: Move the constant term from the right side of the equation to the left side by subtracting 96 from both sides: -42 - 96 = -69x + 96 - 96 -138 = -69x Step 2: Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of x, which is -69: -138 / -69 = -69x / -69 x = 2 Therefore, the solution for the given equation -73 + 31 = -69*x + 96 is x = 2."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's delve deeper into all the associated factors. Blood sugar, or glucose, is a primary source of energy for the body's cells, including the cells in a bird's body. Lower glucose levels, hypo-glycemia, could have a direct impact on a bird's energy levels. For birds, energy is expended not only in daily survival but also in activities such as nest-building. Building a nest (especially larger ones or a higher quantity) is a demanding task that requires substantial energy. Birds gather materials like sticks, grass, leaves, mud, and spider webs, and then delicately construct their nests in an elevated, safe location. This entire process is energy-consuming. Hence, birds with lower blood sugar levels may struggle to acquire the necessary energy to build nests. As a result, they might not be able to construct as many nests or make them as large as birds with higher or normal blood sugar levels. Therefore, it's likely the answer would be B: \\"less.” However, this could also vary depending on various other factors like the bird's overall health, adaptive capabilities, the availability of food sources to restore energy, and so on. Also, it's important to note that birds are equipped with natural coping mechanisms to balance their energy expenditure and can adjust their behavior based on their energy reserves. Still, in a hypothetical situation where the only considerable change is a decrease in blood sugar levels, the answer would be B: \\"less\\". This is based on our current understanding that lower glucose levels equate to lower energy, which consequently could lead to lesser or smaller nests being built.

How to root forsythia  Root forsythia after the bush has finished blooming and all of its flowers have fallen off.  Most garden experts recommend rooting forsythia indoors between december and february. The plant is dormant during this time, so the plant will be in the hardwood stage and cuttings will be less perishable. Available options: [a]. You can root forsythia year-round, but cuttings taken when the bush isn't dormant will be more fragile and require more care and attention. Grow forsythia in well-drained, acidic soil and lots of shade. [b]. Determine if the plant has been kept indoors, or if you need to create an area that will be livened up by new plants.

It's best to do this when it's cold outside like during winter. Now let's see what we should do next: [a] This tells us that you can grow forsythia any time of the year, but it's a bit harder to do when it's not cold outside.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: Who taught and accepted the belief that biologically distinct races were isomorphic?  A: A significant number of modern anthropologists and biologists in the West came to view race as an invalid genetic or biological designation.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: The concept of viewing biologically distinct races as isomorphic - i.e., defining categories of people with distinct physical and genetic traits - has its roots in the field of anthropology and various scientific disciplines over the past centuries, as well as in the history of racial classification. From the late 17th century onwards, European thinkers and scientists began to grapple with the concept of race and the classification of various groups of people. The Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, for example, developed a classification system that included four human \\"races\\" based on both physical and geographic differences: Europeans, Asiatic (Asian), Americans (Indigenous), and Africans. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, many scientists, influenced by social Darwinism, accepted the belief that different racial groups were distinct and that some races - particularly those of European descent - were considered superior to others. This perspective, known as scientific racism, was often used to justify unequal treatment of people from various racial backgrounds. Notable proponents of the idea of distinct races being isomorphic were figures such as Robert Knox (an anatomist), Samuel George Morton (an American physician), and Paul Broca (a French physician and anthropologist), who conducted research on human skulls and attempted to draw conclusions about the intelligence and capabilities of different racial groups. These researchers believed in the hierarchy of races, with white Europeans being at the top of this hierarchy, and often claimed that other races exhibit various inferior characteristics. Over time, however, scientific understanding and research in the fields of anthropology, biology, and genetics has demonstrated that the concept of distinct and isomorphic races is not supported by empirical evidence. Furthermore, the idea of \\"race\\" as a biological concept has been widely rejected, and contemporary scientists tend to focus on examining genetic variation within and between populations. One of the key figures in debunking the idea of distinct races being isomorphic was the anthropologist Ashley Montagu, who published the book \\"Man's Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race\\" in 1942. Montagu's research and arguments presented compelling evidence against the concept of distinct racial groups with fixed hereditary differences. In recent decades, geneticists have further elucidated the complex nature of human genetic diversity, showing that there is more genetic variation within racial groups than between them, and that there is no consistent link between shared ancestry and the physical traits that have been traditionally used to define races. For example, studies by geneticists Richard Lewontin, Luca Cavalli-Sforza, and others have shown how simplistic and misleading the notion of \\"race\\" as a biological category really is. In summary, while many scientists and thinkers in history accepted the belief that biologically distinct races were isomorphic, contemporary research in anthropology, biology, and genetics has revealed that this way of categorizing human populations is scientifically invalid. Instead, most modern scholars prefer to view human diversity through a more nuanced lens, recognizing that the idea of race is more fluid and complex than simple categorizations based on physical appearance or genetic traits."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Casey robbed the cradle dry and left without a trace.

Information:  - The Sinai Peninsula or simply Sinai ('; ', ; \\"\\") is a peninsula in Egypt, situated between the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the south, serving as a land bridge between Asia and Africa. It is the only part of Egyptian territory located in Asia. Sinai has a land area of about and a population of approximately 1,400,000 people. The bulk of the peninsula is divided administratively into two of Egypt's 27 governorates (with three more straddling the Suez Canal area).  - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.  - Afri (singular \\"Afer\\") was a Latin name for the inhabitants of Africa, referring in its widest sense to all the lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya). Latin-speakers at first used \\"afer\\" as an adjective, meaning \\"of Africa\\". As a substantive, it denoted a native of \\"Africa\\", i. e., an African.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - The African bush elephant (\\"Loxodonta africana\\") is the larger of the two species of African elephant.  - The African forest elephant (\\"Loxodonta cyclotis\\") is a forest-dwelling species of elephant found in the Congo Basin. It is the smallest of the three extant species of elephant, but still the third-largest living terrestrial animal. The African forest elephant and the African bush elephant, \\"L. africana\\", were considered to be one species until genetic studies indicated that they separated an estimated 27 million years ago. Due to a slower birth rate, the forest elephant takes longer to recover from poaching, which caused its population to fall by 65% from 2002 to 2013.   - Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Two species are traditionally recognised, the African elephant (\\"Loxodonta africana\\") and the Asian elephant (\\"Elephas maximus\\"), although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (\\"L. africana\\" and \\"L. cyclotis\\" respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons. Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of and weigh . All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.  - So - called pygmy elephants live in both Africa and Asia . The African pygmy elephant , formerly described as \`\` Loxodonta pumilio '' , is currently considered to be a tiny morph of the African forest elephant ( L. cyclotis ) . The Borneo elephant ( Elephas maximus borneensis ) , a well - documented variety of elephant , is also called \`\` pygmy elephant . '' This elephant , inhabiting tropical rainforest in north Borneo ( east Sabah and extreme north Kalimantan ) , was long thought to be identical to the Asian elephant and descended from a captive population . In 2003 , DNA comparison revealed them to be probably a new subspecies . The term pygmy elephant should not be confused with \`\` dwarf elephant '' , which is used for a number of extinct species of elephants that evolved their size due to island dwarfing .  - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.  - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - Modern humans (\\"Homo sapiens\\", primarily ssp. \\"Homo sapiens sapiens\\") are the only extant members of Hominina tribe (or human tribe), a branch of the tribe Hominini belonging to the family of great apes. They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; manual dexterity and increased tool use, compared to other animals; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies.  - The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern.

Article: My dad was a plumber  for the public works department in our town, so from time to time he came into my school. Can you imagine sitting in class and seeing your dad walk past the door of your classroom and wave his hand at you? In junior high? One girl in our class always made fun of me because my dad was a plumber and hers was a lawyer , and she would say things like, \\"Ew, that's gross !\\" I must admit I was sometimes embarrassed by what my dad did, especially in my early teens, when the only thing I really cared about was what the other girls thought. The girl lived a few streets away from us, and one winter day---the day her elder sister was getting married---the toilet in their main upstairs bathroom broke and there was water everywhere. Her father, the lawyer called every plumber in the Yellow Page, but nobody would come and because we were having a major snowstorm. Her daughter told him that my father was a plumber, and he called, and my dad went right over---and took me with him.(Maybe he was hoping that the lawyer's daughter would be nicer to me.) My father fixed the toilet, help them clean up everything, and didn't take much time for his trouble. But as we were leaving, he told the girl, \\"If I ever need a lawyer, I'll be happy to call your dad.\\" As we walked to our car, he said to me, \\"Do you believe he didn't know where the main shut-off valve  was? What a dumb ass!\\" From that point on, her dad was known in school as Lawyer Dumb Ass. When my husband and I bought our house, the first thing my dad showed him was the main shut-off valve.

Icy and lethal ace hit-man Tony Arzenta (a divinely smooth and commanding performance by Alain Delon) wants to quit the assassination business, but the dangerous mobsters he works for won't let him. After his wife and child are killed, Arzenta declares open season on everyone responsible for their deaths.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of keeping insects out of a garden, I would recommend combining multiple methods. Each of these methods targets various types of insects and ensures comprehensive protection for your garden. Here are the steps I would take: 1. Choose insect-resistant plants: By planting insect-resistant varieties, the garden becomes less attractive to unwanted pests. Research on local plant species and consult with experienced gardeners or your local nursery to find out which plants are more resistant to insects. 2. Encourage beneficial insects: Not all insects are harmful to your garden. Some insects, like ladybugs, lacewings, and ground beetles, can be beneficial, as they feast on harmful pests. Planting flowers and herbs that attract these beneficial insects can help keep pests in check. 3. Maintain a clean garden: Remove dead leaves, excess weeds, or debris from your garden regularly. This reduces hiding places for insects, making it less inviting for them to lay eggs. 4. Use physical barriers: Installing physical barriers like insect netting or floating row covers can be an effective way to keep insects out of your garden. Additionally, copper tape can be used around plant pots and raised beds to deter slugs and snails. 5. Manual removal: As soon as you spot harmful insects, manually pick them off and dispose of them appropriately. This reduces the chances of infestations growing further. 6. Use organic insecticides and repellents: If you're experiencing a larger insect problem, consider using organic insecticides and repellents like neem oil, diatomaceous earth, or insecticidal soap. These products are less harmful to the environment and beneficial insects, while still being effective against pests. 7. Rotate crops: Planting the same crops repeatedly in the same area can lead to an increased buildup of pests over time. Crop rotation disrupts the life cycle of pests, making it more difficult for them to establish populations. By following these steps, a combination of preventative and responsive measures can be employed, making it more likely to keep insects out of the garden efficiently."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he urged North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to directly engage with Washington to salvage the June 12 nuclear summit with the U.S., when the two leaders held a surprise second inter-Korean summit Saturday. “I emphasized that the two sides must directly communicate in order to eradicate any misunderstandings, and preliminary talks through working-level negotiations on key agendas are necessary,” said President Moon at a press briefing in Seoul Sunday. North Korea requested the meeting between Kim and Moon after U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled the Singapore summit. Trump said his decision was based on the “tremendous anger and open hostility displayed” by North Korea officials recently over U.S. demands that Pyongyang follow the Libya denuclearization model. North Korea sees that model for rapid and complete denuclearization as a threat to the Kim government’s security, since Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi was later overthrown and killed by his own people, with support from a multinational military coalition that included the U.S. Pyongyang has called for a more incremental process that links concessions to partial nuclear reductions and postpones complete denuclearization until the North’s security demands are met. Moon met with Kim on the North side of the inter-Korean border, in the same village of Panmunjom where the two leaders held a summit in April. At that meeting, on the south side of the border, the two leaders jointly declared their support for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. On Saturday Moon said Kim reaffirmed his commitment to end his country’s nuclear weapons program, but shared his key concern that the U.S. would work to destabilize his rule despite any security guarantees it offers. “What is uncertain for Chairman Kim Jong Un is not his willingness for denuclearization, but he has concerns over whether North Korea can trust the fact that Washington will end its hostile relations, and guarantee the security...

Given the task definition and input, reply with output. In this task, you're given a fill-in-the-blank question that contains two object names. Additionally, you're given one answer which is one of the objects present in the question. In this task, you need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to another object in the question. Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \\"small\\" to \\"big\\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question.

(II) yes.","output":"Both questions essentially ask the same thing, which is to find the best way to say \\"no\\" to someone.  Answering these questions together, the best way to say \\"no\\" depends on the situation, cultural context, and relationship with the person you are addressing. The primary goal when saying \\"no\\" is to be clear and assertive while maintaining a sense of empathy and respect for the other person. Here are some effective strategies and tips to consider in different situations: 1. Be direct and clear: Sometimes, it's better to be direct and not beat around the bush. Firmly yet politely express your refusal, e.g., \\"I am sorry, I cannot do this.\\" 2. Provide a reason (if possible): If there is a valid reason for your refusal, offer it briefly. Doing so can help people understand and feel respected, but be cautious not to provide excessive or unnecessary information. 3. Prioritize your needs: It's important to acknowledge your limitations and prioritize your own well-being. For instance, if a colleague asks for help with a project, and you already have a heavy workload, you could say, \\"I appreciate that you need assistance, but I won't be able to help because of my current workload.\\" 4. Offer alternatives or solutions: While saying \\"no,\\" it can be helpful to suggest other options or solutions to show that you still care about the outcome. For example, \\"I can't do it right now, but maybe we can find someone else to help you\\" or \\"I won't be able to help with this specific task, but I can assist with XYZ instead.\\" 5. Be polite and respectful: Using phrases like \\"I'm sorry\\" or \\"I appreciate the offer\\" can demonstrate empathy and appreciation, even as you decline the request.  6. Practice assertiveness without aggression: Speak clearly and calmly, maintaining a neutral tone to show respect and professionalism. Avoid raising your voice, blaming, or sounding overly emotional. 7. Take time if necessary: Sometimes, it's better to gather your thoughts before providing a response. If you think you need time to decide, politely request some time to consider the request and respond later. 8. Establish boundaries: In personal or professional relationships, setting boundaries can help avoid potential conflict or resentment later on. Be clear about what you're willing and not willing to do. Remember that context, tone, and choice of words can greatly impact how your refusal is perceived. Learning to say \\"no\\" effectively helps maintain healthy relationships, manage workload, and prioritize your tasks and responsibilities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If so, you probably noted the V-shaped formation of the birds or the birds flying in a ball-like formation. Why do birds fly this way? Many theories have been developed to explain the formation patterns of different types of birds.   One theory is that birds fly in certain formations to take advantage of the laws of nature. The birds know that flying in a V-shaped pattern will save energy. Like the lead cyclist in a race who decreases wind force for the cyclists who follow, the lead bird cuts wind force for the birds that follow. This decrease in wind force means that the birds use up to 70 percent less energy during their flight. When the lead bird becomes tired, a more rested bird takes over that position.   But saving energy is important for more than one reason. Sometimes food is short during migration flights. Keeping energy enables the birds to fly longer distances between meals.     When food is sighted, the birds guide one another in a different way. When a bird identifies a familiar feeding area, it might turn around in order to signal the group to change direction. Then, this bird becomes the new leader. It helps guarantee that other birds will know exactly where it is going. Then the whole group makes a change in direction, gently streaming from the sky down to the ground. This formation is like an arrow pointing to the location of food.   Scientists have also studied the birds that sometimes fly in a ball-like formation. Researchers believe that the birds come together if a predator  is spotted. The predator may then become impatient waiting for a single bird to fly away from the group. The birds will often dip and dive as a group, frustrating even the most persistent enemy. Scientists report that this is a very effective method of defense against an attack.   The birds care for their fellow fliers through teamwork. As transportation expert Henry Ford once said, \\"If everyone is moving forward together, then... Which is the best title for the passage? A) A Bird's-Eye View of Teamwork.

Authorities with the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation said they believe two shootings along a remote stretch of highway are related and that the killings may be the work of someone posing as law enforcement. The revelation has since terrified Mississippi drivers, who are being urged to pull over only if they are being followed by a marked police car and to call 911 if they become suspicious. Thomas Schlender, 74, of Raymond, Neb., was found shot dead in his car on Interstate 55 in nearby Panola County on May 8. Three days later, Lori Anne Carswell, 48, of Hernando, was found dead near her car on Mississippi Highway 713 in Tunica County. Authorities announced this week that they believe Schlender and Carswell are victims of the same killer or killers. The two were shot after they pulled over on the highway, but neither vehicle appeared to have mechanical problems. \\"There are a lot of similarities, namely the fact that the shootings occurred on the side of the road,\\" Mississippi Department of Public Safety spokesman Warren Strain told FoxNews.com. Police are investigating a number of leads in the case, including a woman's claim that she was pulled over in Tate County last month by someone posing as a police officer. Tate County is located between Panola and Tunica counties, where the other two murders took place. The woman told authorities that she was being tailed by a car with a \\"white flashing light on the dashboard,\\" Tate County Sheriff Brad Lance told Fox affiliate WHBQ-TV. When the woman pulled over on the side of the highway, a man, who appeared disheveled, got out of his car and told her she was speeding, according to authorities. \\"She just did not feel comfortable, she did not roll the window down, she cracked it to talk to him,\\" Lance said. The man then asked for her driver's license, which she told him was in her purse inside the trunk. When she refused to get out of the vehicle to retrieve the bag, the man became \\"agitated\\" and \\"hit the side of her car,\\" telling her \\"just go on,\\" Lance said. The woman was unable to see the man's license plate number, but told police that he was driving a gold sedan. She said he appeared to be in his 40s and was seen wearing an untucked plaid shirt and tan pants. He also had sunglasses on, she said. \\"In light of these events, we re-interviewed her, made other agencies aware of what we had happen,\\" said Lance.

Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof.

Originally commissioned in 1892 as the \\"Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup\\", the trophy is named for Lord Stanley of Preston, thenGovernor General of Canada, who awarded it to Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club, which the entire Stanley family supported, with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game. The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC, and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play. Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906. In 1915, the two professional ice hockey organizations, the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), reached a gentlemen's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup. After a series of league mergers and folds, it was established as the \\"de facto\\" championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the \\"de jure\\" NHL championship prize in 1947.  - The Edmonton Oilers are a professional ice hockey team based in Edmonton, Alberta.

He recently lost his mother due to a sudden illness, leaving him and his father, Jack, to carry on. The relationship between Chris and Jack is strained, as Jack is focused on his work as a biologist studying the natural wildlife in the area. Chris, on the other hand, can't help but feel neglected. One day, Chris stumbles upon a hidden entrance to a large underground labyrinth beneath their house while exploring the basement. In this mysterious space, he finds strange and otherworldly-looking slugs in various sizes. Chris is both fascinated and terrified by these creatures. Act 2: One evening after dinner, Chris spots more of these bizarre slugs racing towards the basement. He quickly alerts his father, who is initially skeptical but becomes alarmed at the sight of the creatures. Jack realizes that his research may have inadvertently attracted these slugs to their home by tampering with the ecosystem. Jack and Chris reluctantly team up to investigate the slugs and discover that they evolve and rapidly grow in size when they come into contact with a glowing substance leaking from the underground labyrinth. The substance is a chemical byproduct of a secret government project that was abandoned in the 1960s. As the slugs continue to grow and spread in number, threatening to overrun the town, Chris and Jack reach out to Jack's old mentor Dr. Andrea Reynolds, an expert in alien life forms, to help find a way to stop the slugs. Act 3: Aided by Dr. Reynolds, Chris, and Jack develop a plan to neutralize the slugs by creating a formula based on the glowing substance, which will cause the slugs to disintegrate. Racing against time, they navigate the labyrinth, now infested with monstrous-sized slugs, to reach the source of the glowing substance and deploy their formula. As they battle the slugs, Chris and Jack share heartfelt conversations as they understand the need to rely on each other. In a thrilling and desperate finale, they successfully apply the formula and eliminate the slugs. However, the final showdown leaves Dr. Reynolds fatally wounded. In the aftermath, Chris and Jack grow closer as father and son, honoring the memory of Dr. Reynolds and continuing her work on researching and protecting other life forms yet to be discovered. The government takes responsibility for their past actions and seals off the underground labyrinth to ensure such an event never takes place again. The town now refers to Chris and Jack as the heroes who saved them from the terrifying basement slugs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The answer to the question: Who created a textile design in 1947? is inside the article: Bellette and Haefliger returned to Australia just before the outbreak of World War II. Shortly after her arrival, Bellette held an exhibition at Sydney's Macquarie Galleries. The couple became influential members of the Sydney Art Group, a network of \\"fashionable\\" moderns whose membership included William Dobell and Russell Drysdale. Bellette painted and held regular shows – \\"a solo show every second year and a group show every year at the Macquarie Galleries\\". Her husband served as art critic for The Sydney Morning Herald for a decade and a half.In 1942, Bellette won the Sir John Sulman Prize with For Whom the Bell Tolls. She won it again in 1944 with her painting Iphigenia in Tauris, inspired by Euripides' play. The composition is set in a dry, open landscape, with several riders on horses whose appearance suggests \\"the Australian present, rather than Greek antiquity\\". The judge awarding the prize actually preferred another of her entries, Electra, depicting the sister of Iphigenia also prominent in Greek tragedy – but it failed to meet the size requirements. Both Iphigenia in Tauris and Electra were among the many works created by Bellette in the 1940s that were inspired by the tragedies of Euripides, Sophocles and Homer. Her choice of subject matter and approach placed her at odds with mainstream modernism, while she seemed to shun explicit links between the classical and the Australian. Bellette reasoned that she preferred to choose her palette and the spatial arrangements of her compositions to evoke a place's atmosphere. Critics identified the influence of European modernists Aristide Maillol and Giorgio de Chirico, as well as Italian Quattrocento painters Masaccio and Piero della Francesca, about some of whom Bellette wrote articles in the journal Art in Australia.The most distinctive feature of the artist's work was this choice of classical subjects. In 1946, Bellette's paintings were hung in at least four separate exhibitions. Reviewers commented on her synthesis of \\"the impulsiveness of romanticism..., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"Margaret Olley created a textile design in 1947. This information is not explicitly mentioned in the given article text, which focuses on the artistic journey of Margel Hinder and Frank Hinder.

To do this, we will first move the term '24 * x' to the left side by subtracting it from both sides. 56 * x - 24 * x = -96 (56 - 24) * x = -96 Step 3: Simplify the equation Now we can simplify the equation by performing the subtraction on the left side. 32 * x = -96 Step 4: Solve for x Now we need to isolate x by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient 32. x = -96 / 32 Step 5: Simplify the fraction Now we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which in this case is 8. x = (-96 / 8) / (32 / 8) x = -12 / 4 Step 6: Simplify further Now we can simplify the answer one more step. x = -3 So, the solution to the algebraic equation 56 * x = 24 * x - 96 is x = -3."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lateef's job is to serve tea and prepare food for the workers with whom he is always quarrelling. The workers come from all parts of Iran, particularly from Iranian Azerbaijan (Azeris are referred as \\"Turks\\" in the film). Some workers are Afghan refugees from war-torn Afghanistan. They have no identity cards and are employed illegally as cheap labour. When the labour inspectors show up, the Afghan workers must hide. As the story starts, an Afghan worker, NAJAF, falls from the building and breaks his leg. He is taken to the hospital. The next day, SOLTAN, another Afghan worker, brings in RAHMAT, Najaf's son, who is around 14 years old, to replace his father. Memar soon realizes that Rahmat is not fit for such hard work, and decides to switch the jobs between Rahmat and Lateef. Lateef is furious, threatens Rahmat, tries to sabotage his work and spies on him. One day, by looking through the door where Rahmat works, he is totally shocked to discover that Rahmat is a girl. As he watches her comb her hair, he finds himself in a strange state, surrounded by unusual sounds.

The Choke starts as a rock band known as The Choke prepare for a gig at a nightclub called 'Club 905' owned & run by Guy Johnson (Andrew Parker). Lead singer Dylan (Sean Cook) & guitar player Mike (Jason McKee) plan to tell the other band members, bass player London (Brooke Bailey) & drummer Nancy (Tom Olson), that they are both going solo & their services won't be needed any longer. Once at the club Dylan prepares but Mike doesn't show up & the gig turns into a disaster. Then just as the band think things couldn't get any worse they find a dead body in the cellar, that all the doors have been locked so they can't get out & that they can't trust anyone as a mysterious killer begins picking them off one-by-one... Produced & directed by Juan A. Mas The Choke is a standard by-the-numbers teen slasher that really doesn't have anything going for it. The script by Jessica Dolan & Susannah Lowber (not too many horror films out there penned by ladies...) has some surprisingly good character's in it & some nifty dialogue but while it's much better than a lot of modern shot on a camcorder type horror in that respect it's so slow & boring that even a few interesting character's can't come anywhere close to saving it. As one would expect all the usual teen slasher clichés are used, from the isolated location the victims can't escape from, the cast of good looking teenagers who keep splitting up, a few murders & a really poor twist ending that tries to mimic something like Scream (1996) & be surprising but doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you think about it logically (they couldn't have done some of the things they were supposed to) & to make matters even worse I guessed who the killer was fairly early on & even though I don't want to boast I was spot on. Then there's the fact that the makers of The Choke felt that it's audience would be entertained by showing endless (well it feels endless while watching it) scenes of teenagers walking around dark corridors doing nothing in particular, I am sorry but there is only so many scenes like this that I can take before it starts to become tedious. The kill count is low, at first they all decide to stick together (good idea) but then they all just randomly decide to split up & go their separate ways (bad idea when there's a killer on the loose), the pace is lethargic, the kill scenes are unimaginative & to top it all off the twist ending is poor. Director Mas does alright, the film looks OK for the most part although there are the odd occasions where he uses some annoying post production editing technique like slow motion or frame skipping. The gore levels aren't really up to scratch, there's some blood splatter, a guy with a hole in his chest, a few dead bodies & someone impaled on some metal poles. Most of the kills happen off screen with the axe kill at the end a good example of the film not actually showing anything. Since the film is about a rock band there's quite a rock orientated soundtrack with some truly horrible, horrible rock songs used on it. I am sorry rock fans but to my ears this crap is just noise pollution. It's not scary, there's no real atmosphere & the lack of blood & gore is just inexcusable when the rest of the film is so bad. With a supposed budget of about 1,000,000 The Choke is well made with reasonable production values, it looks cheap to be sure but not as cheap as many low budget horror films look. Shot in a place called Spokane in Washington apparently. The acting is one of the films strongest points as it's generally pretty good all round, I mean no-one is going to win an Oscar but it ain't half bad. The Choke is a throughly routine Scream style teen slasher that has one of the weakest twist endings ever & a criminal lack of blood, gore, violence, nudity & dead bodies.

This game, Super Bowl XXXVII, was held at the Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California. The Oakland Raiders faced off against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who were led by head coach Jon Gruden, a former Oakland Raiders head coach himself. This added an intriguing storyline to the championship game. The Raiders entered the game with an impressive regular-season record of 11-5, securing the first seed in the AFC playoffs. Led by head coach Bill Callahan, the team had a powerful offensive lineup, including quarterback Rich Gannon, who was named the NFL's Most Valuable Player of the 2002 season. The Raiders' potent offense also featured wide receivers Jerry Rice and Tim Brown, as well as running back Charlie Garner. In comparison, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers had a 12-4 regular season record and were the second seed in the NFC playoffs. Known for their dominant defensive unit, the Buccaneers roster boasted talents like defensive tackle Warren Sapp, linebacker Derrick Brooks, and defensive back John Lynch. One of the most notable players was cornerback Ronde Barber, who played an essential role in Tampa Bay's success that season. Despite high expectations for the Raiders, the game proved to be a one-sided affair in favor of the Buccaneers, who won with a score of 48-21. The Raiders struggled throughout the match, with their offense thwarted by Tampa Bay's crushing defense. Buccaneers' defensive back Dexter Jackson was named the game's Most Valuable Player after securing two interceptions, while linebacker Derrick Brooks and cornerback Dwight Smith each returned interceptions for touchdowns. Overall, Super Bowl XXXVII remains the last time the then-Oakland Raiders made an appearance in the championship game. Their fans continue to hope that the team, now based in Las Vegas, can recreate the success of previous years and once again compete for the coveted Super Bowl title."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

O'Rourke, believing that his contract with Waters had been terminated illegally, sued Waters for £25,000 of back-commission. In a late-1986 board meeting of Pink Floyd Music Ltd (Pink Floyd's clearing house for all financial transactions since 1973), Waters learnt that a bank account had been opened to deal exclusively with all monies related to \\"the new Pink Floyd project\\". He immediately applied to the High Court to prevent the Pink Floyd name from being used again, but his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed. Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to gain a veto over further use of the band's name.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A debate in the House of Lords is the last place you expect to hear someone fantasise about making love to George Clooney. But it is precisely what cheeky typist-turned-Tory Minister Tina Stowell did when she persuaded fuddy-duddy peers to back gay marriage laws. Lords Leader Baroness Stowell used Clooney to explain how a man who married another man could only sue for adultery if his partner had sex with a woman, not a man. For example, she told dumbstruck peers, if Clooney married a gay man and then had a fling with her – ‘and who could blame him?’ she added coyly – Clooney’s ‘husband’ could sue him for adultery with her. Crush: Baroness Stowell, who referred to George Clooney in a debate, with a cardboard cut-out of the actor. Sure enough, a photo of Stowell alongside a life-sized cardboard cut- out of the star has pride of place in her tennis court-sized, red leather and wood-panelled Lords office, where we chatted. ‘I’ve had a soft spot for him ever since I saw him in ER,’ she says. ‘I needed to relax peers who were tense about gay marriage, so I thought, “I’ll bring in George Clooney.” ’ And fantasise about having sex with him? ‘A bit of humour helps,’ she smiles. Stowell is to extend the gay marriage laws in the next few weeks, allowing gay people who took part in civil partnerships before gay marriage was legalised to ‘upgrade’ it into a formal marriage. ‘It’s important for them to say not “I’m sort of married” but that they are married,’ she says. When Stowell was made Lords Leader – a Cabinet Minister in all but name – in July, some grandees were appalled, even more than when she was ennobled three years ago. They reacted with the same haughty disdain that Downton Abbey’s Earl of Grantham showed sparky kitchen maid Daisy on learning she was studying maths instead of washing dishes. ‘Tina should be pushing the tea trolley at Cabinet, not sitting at the table,’ scoffed one, a reference to her having been PA to John Major and William Hague. In truth, ‘the Earl of Downing Street’ David Cameron had exposed her to such insults by denying Stowell full-blown Cabinet status – and £22,000 extra pay – given to her predecessor. Stowell, 5ft 1in, faced a revolt led by Baroness Betty Boothroyd, who accused the PM of ‘trampling on the constitution’. Didn’t little Tina feel cowed by all these people fulminating at her? ‘I don’t feel intimidated by anybody. I was brought up to believe I’m as good as anyone else.’ Spoken like Daisy. Stowell's doggedness and impish charm was widely credited with wooing reluctant peers to her cause. Stowell, 47, whose dad Dave was a painter and decorator and mum Margaret worked in a factory in the same street as their terrace house in Beeston, Nottinghamshire (‘it was posh, we had an inside loo’, she laughs) left her local comp aged 16 with five O-levels. She showed her gritty determination aged 14, landing a weekend job at a cake shop. ‘They said I couldn’t work out front until I knew the price of all 100 cakes,’ she says. ‘When I went back the next week, they couldn’t believe I knew them all.’ How much was a doughnut? ‘12p,’ she answers. ‘If I saw a big queue outside I’d try my hardest to get it down and it brought a big smile to my face when I did.’ Doesn’t it require loftier thinking to be a Cabinet Minister? She swats it away like a fly on a sticky bun. ‘The Lords may seem a million miles from the cake shop, but those people in the queue are who I think of when I do my job here,’ she says. Her cool confidence and prim porcelain glamour is a far cry from the unworldly lass mistaken for a hooker when, aged 18, she was dropped off by mum and dad at a hostel in London, for her first Civil Service job as a secretary. ‘I was stopped by a bloke who said “Are you looking for business?” I said “Sorry?” I didn’t know what he was on about. When I told the girls in the hostel, they said “Didn’t you know? This a red light area”.’ Her horizons widened with a stint at the British Embassy in Washington, and she joined Downing Street when John Major was Prime Minister. She recalls her rage when she overheard a plummy-voiced Tory sneer at ‘ignorant’ Major, unaware his loyal PA was listening. ‘The very things people criticised him for like his humble background are why I admired him. I don’t like snobs,’ she says. She formed the same bond with the next Tory leader William Hague, adding: ‘When he stepped down, I sobbed my heart out.’ But there were tears of joy when, a decade later, now a Minister with her own PA, she piloted the gay marriage laws through the Lords. ‘I was choked with happiness,’ she says. Baroness Stowell told dumbstruck peers that if Clooney married a gay man and then had a fling with her, Clooney's 'husband' could sue him for adultery with her. First she had to persuade crusty peers to take notice of someone who had never been married herself. Again she deployed her ‘friend’ George Clooney, telling the Lords bold as brass in her broad Nottinghamshire accent: ‘I’m single but as long as George Clooney is available I’m prepared to wait.’ Even peers who raged about the ‘evils of buggery’ softened. Stowell’s doggedness and impish charm was widely credited with wooing reluctant peers to her cause. That was a year ago. Clooney is married now. ‘It’s his loss, there you go, no more excuses,’ she grins. She has never been short of male admirers, so why no marriage? ‘No one ever asked me!’ You have to go looking. ‘Maybe I’ll start.’ Mmm. Perhaps it is the price she has paid for her career? ‘No,’ she says firmly, ‘I don’t rule it out, though I’m probably past having children. Mum drilled it into me never to be financially dependent on a man, get a job, fend for yourself.’ The gay marriage law made her a gay icon, leading to awards from Pink News and Spectator magazine. Stowell’s, dare I say it, rather raunchy, pixie-like Twitter photo has a hint of the Judy Garland in it. She is dolled up, albeit on a budget. Her black and berry Precis Petite jacket is £79 from the suitably conservative House of Fraser. Some gay rights campaigners have speculated whether petite Stowell is gay? ‘Oh really?’ she replied. Is she? ‘No,’ she says, her bright blue bush baby eyes gleaming. And she is again quick to scotch any idea that she may never marry. ‘If a fantastic guy turned up and offered me a life better than the one I have now, why would I say no?’ she says. ‘Now George Clooney is taken, I’m back on the market.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article is about Baroness Tina Stowell, who used a humorous example with George Clooney to help explain the concept of adultery within gay marriage laws during a debate in the House of Lords. She wanted to relax the tense atmosphere and thought that by bringing in a bit of humor, it would help. Stowell played a crucial role in the passing of the gay marriage laws and used her charm to win over some hesitant peers during the debate."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is something far less pleasant, like being called in by your boss to explain why you did this or that, and why you did not do this or that. Sour(; )music, indeed, but it has to be faced. The phrase \\"to face the music\\" is familiar to every American, young and old. It is at least 100 years old. Where did the expression come from? The first information comes from the American writer James Fennimore Cooper. He said in 1851 that the expression was first used by actors while waiting in the wings to go on stage. After they got their cue(,) to go on, they often said, \\"It's time to go to face the music.\\" And that is exactly what they did--- face the orchestra   which was just below the stage. An actor might be frightened or nervous as he moved on to the stage in front of the audience that might be friendly or perhaps unfriendly especially if he forgot his lines. But he had to go out. So, \\"to face the music\\" came to mean having to go through something, no matter how unpleasant the experience might be, because you knew you had no choice. The other explanation comes from the army. Men had to face inspection by their leader. The soldiers worried about how well they looked. Was their equipment clean--shiny enough to pass inspection? Still, the men had to go out, and face the music of the band, as well as the inspection. What else could they do?

This type of dominant pose also reduces cortisol and increases testosterone, which will add to your confidence. Take a moment to duck into bathroom stall or empty room and power pose for a minute before you need to walk confidently. Occupying more space will make you seem larger and more confident to others. Use your arms and legs to claim more of the territory around you.  When you are standing, place your hands on your hips and stand with your legs about shoulder width apart. When you are sitting, lean back and stretch your legs out in front of you and rest one or both arms on the backs of the seats next to you. If there is a table or desk in front of you, you can place your arms on the table and spread them out and away from your body. A hunched appearance projects a lack of confidence. Instead, walk straight and tall to seem confident. As you walk, keep your shoulders back and lift up your chin slightly. Test your posture by holding a pencil in each hand and making a fist. Let your arms fall loosely at your sides. If the pencils face inward (towards you), then you are hunching your shoulders. Shift your shoulders back until the pencils face forward to see how your ideal posture should be while you walk. Directing your body towards the person you are talking to demonstrates your respect for them as well as interest in what they have to say, but it also contributes to an appearance of confidence. People who lack confidence may find it harder to face other people directly during a conversation. Fidgeting makes you look nervous and uncomfortable, which makes you seem like you lack confidence. Train yourself to keep still when you are standing or sitting.  If you are standing, place your hands on your hips or hold something in one or both of your hands. You can hold a mug, clipboard or notepad, a pen, or something else that is appropriate for your situation. Just make sure that you don’t fidget with the object. If you are seated, firmly plant your hands on the arms of a chair or on top of a table. Just remind yourself not to tap your fingers on the table. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article is as follows: Adopting a dominant power pose, such as standing tall with your arms and legs spread wide, can help boost confidence by reducing cortisol levels and increasing testosterone. Taking a moment to power pose before entering a situation where confidence is needed can be beneficial. Maintaining a straight posture and facing towards the person you are conversing with further enhances the appearance of confidence. To avoid projecting a lack of confidence, refrain from hunching and fidgeting, and train yourself to stay still, either by placing hands on hips or holding an object without fidgeting.

To bad for this fine film that it had to be released the same year as Braveheart. Though it is a very different kind of film, the conflict between Scottish commoners and English nobility is front and center here as well. Roughly 400 years had passed between the time Braveheart took place and Rob Roy was set, but some things never seemed to change. Scottland is still run by English nobles, and the highlanders never can seem to catch a break when dealing with them. Rob Roy is handsomely done, but not the grand epic that Braveheart was. There are no large-scale battles, and the conflict here is more between individuals. And helpfully so not all Englishmen are portrayed as evil this time. Rob Roy is simply a film about those with honor, and those who are truly evil. Liam Neeson plays the title character Rob Roy MacGregor. He is the leader of the MacGregor clan and his basic function is to tend to and protect the cattle of the local nobleman of record known as the Marquis of Montrose (John Hurt). Things look pretty rough for the MacGregor clan as winter is approaching, and there seems to be a lack of food for everyone. Rob Roy puts together a plan to borrow 1000 pounds from the Marquis and purchase some cattle of his own. He would then sell them off for a higher price and use the money to improve the general well-being of his community. Sounds fair enough, doesn't it? Problems arise when two cronies of the Marquis steal the money for themselves. One of them, known as Archibald Cunningham, is perhaps the most evil character ever put on film. Played wonderfully by Tim Roth, this man is a penniless would-be noble who has been sent to live with the Marquis by his mother. This man is disgustingly effeminate, rude, heartless, and very dangerous with a sword. He fathers a child with a hand maiden and refuses to own up to the responsibility. He rapes Macgregor's wife and burns him out of his home. This guy is truly as rotten as movie characters come. Along with another crony of the Marquis (Brian Cox) Cunningham steals the money and uses it to settle his own debts. Though it is painfully obvious to most people what happened, the Marquis still holds MacGregor to the debt. This sets up conflict that will take many lives and challenge the strengths of a man simply fighting to hold on to his dignity. Spoilers ahead!!!!! Luckily for the MacGregor's, a Duke who is no friend to the Marquis sets up a final duel between Rob Roy and Cunningham to resolve the conflict one and for all. This sword fight has been considered by many to be one of the best ever filmed. Cunningham is thought by many to be a sure winner with his speed and grace. And for most of the fight, it looks like these attributes will win out. Just when it looks like Rob Roy is finished, he turns the tables in a shockingly grotesque manner. The first time you see what happens, you will probably be as shocked as Cunningham! Rob Roy is beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, and perfectly paced. The score is quite memorable, too. The casting choices seem to have worked out as Jessica Lange, who might seem to be out of her element, actually turns in one of the strongest performances as Mary MacGregor. The film is violent, but there isn't too much gore. It is a lusty picture full of deviant behavior, however. The nobility are largely played as being amoral and sleazy. The film has no obvious flaws, thus it gets 10 of 10 stars. The Hound. What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is positive.

United sit fourth in the table after an inconsistent start of three wins, two draws and two losses, but will be heartened by their last result - a 2-1 win over Everton at Old Trafford. And while Neville, who spent 19 years as a player at United, believes the future is bright for his old side, he feels the coming month will prove how good Van Gaal's fledgling side is compared with their rivals. The next month will show the true measure of Louis van Gaal's new-look United side, says Gary Neville. 'I think it's an exciting time,' Neville told United's official website. 'It's going to be an important few weeks but exciting as well.

At this moment in time, we're in the places in fourth spot but we'll find out where we're at in the next few weeks. 'We've not really played anybody really strong yet.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"No, you should not validate this answer as it does not directly address the question about the cost of setting up hydroelectric power. Instead, I would suggest the following answer: Setting up hydroelectric power typically involves significant initial financial investments, as the process includes dam construction or other types of infrastructure, equipment procurement, and installation, among others. The overall cost for a hydroelectric project can vary widely and depends on factors such as the project's scale, location, and complexity. Also, local regulations and environmental policies can impact the costs. Small-scale hydroelectric projects, such as micro-hydro and small-hydro systems, generally have lower costs, ranging from 1,000 to 8,000 per kilowatt (kW) installed capacity. Medium and large-scale hydroelectric projects, on the other hand, can have costs ranging from 2,000 to 5,000 per kW installed capacity. While the initial investment is relatively high, the operational and maintenance costs for hydroelectric power plants tend to be lower compared to other power generation methods. Additionally, hydroelectric power is a renewable and clean source of energy, which can provide social and environmental benefits in the long run. Keep in mind that these cost estimates may not cover every single factor, and individual project costs can vary. Furthermore, it is essential to consider the project's environmental impact, as mentioned in the original answer, along with any potential community displacement or other social consequences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Sasha already has a boyfriend, but she decides to send Alex a message too.  Given the context: How would you describe Sasha?  Possible answers: that she has let her boyfriend down, a sneaky person, that she has betrayed her boyfriend Answer:","output":"Sasha's decision to send Alex a message despite being in a relationship with her current boyfriend can be painted in several lights. Although the question provides a few possible answers—implying that she has let her boyfriend down, is sneaky, or has betrayed her boyfriend—it is difficult to pinpoint exactly which of these characterizations is correct without comprehensive knowledge of the situation. However, we can still analyze Sasha's behavior through the lens of these possible answers and come to a nuanced conclusion. Firstly, we can discuss the possibility that Sasha has let her boyfriend down. This characterization suggests that she has negatively impacted her boyfriend by not meeting his expectations for loyalty and commitment. It implies that she has disappointed him, imparted a sense of failure, and possibly damaged their relationship. While this may be true, it is important to remember that we do not know the contents of the message or the nature of their relationship. If, for instance, the message was innocent and friendly rather than suggestive and inappropriate, it may be that she has not let her boyfriend down at all. Secondly, we can consider the characterization of Sasha as a sneaky person. This implies that she is intentionally covert and deceitful in her actions, specifically to avoid getting caught. This suggests that she is knowingly engaging in behavior that her boyfriend would disapprove of or that goes against the boundaries of their relationship. If Sasha is indeed being sneaky, it is important to recognize that such behavior can ferment distrust and harm relationships. However, once again, we do not know the specifics of their relationship and the extent to which her communication with Alex infringes on its boundaries. Finally, we can examine the idea that Sasha has betrayed her boyfriend by sending Alex a message. Betrayal is a powerful term and implies a breach of trust, an emotional wound, and a violation of expectations. To characterize her behavior as betrayal, we would have to assume that her boyfriend would consider her actions with Alex to be unacceptable and disloyal. Furthermore, it would imply that the message carried a certain level of intimacy or emotional weight that would be considered inappropriate given the existing relationship. While this may be true in some contexts, it is essential to consider various factors such as the message's content, her communication frequency with Alex, and her boyfriend's reaction. In conclusion, without a thorough understanding of the situation and the dynamics between Sasha, her boyfriend, and Alex, it is difficult to definitively declare Sasha's behavior as one of the given characterizations. It is possible that she has let her boyfriend down, acted sneakily, or betrayed her boyfriend, but there may also be more context and nuance to the situation than we are aware of. To accurately describe Sasha, it is crucial to gather more information and evaluate her behavior considering the specific boundaries and expectations that exist within her relationship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For the first question: \\"I want to get into the export business.

Not only that, but the powers that be could \\"put Hillary Clinton’s brain in a jar in the Oval Office and she would be elected.\\"      The media needs to wake up and do its job before that happens, he said.      Story Continued Below      \\"If your calling is media, fine, if your calling is sports, whatever it is, but you've got to be the greatest you can be now, now, before this country is so completely altered and we're left with Hillary's brain in the Oval Office in a jar, 'cause that's what we're getting,\\" Drudge said.      At the start of the segment, Jones said Drudge had surprised the Austin, Texas-based show with his appearance but only his voice is present throughout the 46-minute video, standing behind the camera holding a microphone. Drudge tore into Clinton at parts of the interview, calling her \\"old\\" and \\"sick\\" and only a contender because the media are making her so.      \\"They're making her a contender with these propped-up 'Saturday Night Live' things. It's like a head on a stick,\\" he said. \\"She is not a viable, vibrant leader for this country of 300-including the illegals-380 million Americans. So the media is trying to put us asleep. You're not letting them, Alex.\\"      Drudge also decried a \\"cover-up\\" on \\"seeing Hillary's lovers\\" and a variety of \\"so many issues that are suppressed on a daily basis.\\"      “Where I’ve had a lot of success is I’m getting people from both sides of the aisle. They’ve always said, ‘Oh, he’s a right-wing gossip monger,’ mainly because of Lewinsky and those years–which, by the way, are back,\\" he said.      On the Democratic candidacy of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who turned 74 in September, Drudge wondered aloud if Democrats could \\"find anybody under the age of 70.\\"      \\"What is this oldness in a vibrant country that needs to go forward to a new century?\\" he asked.      Drudge also talked about the success of his website in sharing and spreading stories with a greater reach than Facebook or other social-media platforms, which he called \\"bogus.\\"      \\"It's just a lot of gnats, a lot of confusion. The reality of the situation is life on Earth has not changed. We need facts, we need events, we need specifics on things. Not all this confusion. It’s almost, they’ve made the Internet over in their image, these corporations,\\" he remarked, \\"and I think they’re failing.\\"      Drudge also hinted that because of forthcoming court rulings on copyright, his site's days might be numbered.      He recounted an exchange with an unnamed Supreme Court justice who he says told him, \\"Matt, it's over for you. They’ve got the votes now to enforce copyright law. You’re out of there. They’re gonna make it so ... you can’t even use headlines.\\"      \\"Wait until these copyright laws work their way up, and the Supreme Court decides you cannot have a website with news headlines linking across the board.

I feel completely — I have gone as far out of the galaxy as I can on this. I still wanna stay out here. But I have gone pretty damn far for what one individual can do in this culture. But I’m talking about the future.      \\"So I don’t know why they’ve been successful in pushing everybody into these little ghettos of these Facebooks and these tweets and these Instagrams — these instas. This is ghetto. This is corporate. They’re taking your energy. They’re taking your energy and you’re getting nothing in return. Nothing,\\" Drudge said. \\"Ultimately, it’s boring, and the kids are always off to something new. Except for the something new is owned by the same freakin' company or financed by the same banking system.” ||||| Matt Drudge, one of the most influential people in the news business, gave a rare interview — to a self-identified libertarian radio host — on Tuesday.      The reclusive founder of the Drudge Report spoke with Infowars' Alex Jones on Jones' namesake radio show. And for a full 45 minutes, the two addressed a wide range of topics while Drudge sat off-camera.      Among other things, they talked about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the broader 2016 presidential race, the corporatization of the media landscape, world-government conspiracies, and the future of humanity.      Some of the highlights are below.      Hillary Clinton      Drudge, who busted open the Lewinsky scandal, apparently thinks there's a media cover-up of another Clinton sex scandal.      \\"They've always said, 'Oh, he's a right-wing gossip-monger,'\\" Drudge said of his critics. \\"Mainly because of Lewinsky and those years — which by the way, are back. Why aren't we seeing Hillary's lovers? Excuse me, why aren't we seeing Hillary's lovers? Where's the cover-up on this?\\"      He also argued that Clinton was not physically healthy:      You've got to be the greatest you can be now — now! — before this country is so completely altered and we're left with Hillary's brain in the Oval Office in a jar. Because that's what we're getting: She's old and she's sick. She's not a contender. They're making her a contender with these propped-up 'Saturday Night Light' things. It's like a head on a stick.      But he predicted she would still win:      How sick are the American people right now? I've been saying they could put Hillary Clinton's brain in a jar in the Oval Office and she'd be elected. People are really sick. I think you know this deep in your soul, and this is why you get demoralized here on this very set. People are sick.      While he warned about the future Clinton administration:      Hillary Clinton with the NSA? Good luck if you dissent. Good luck if you dissent. [Edward] Snowden, I'll switch places with you: You can come over here and rot in hell, because that's what it's going to be.      The 2016 race      Drudge name-checked a few other presidential candidates throughout the discussion, including real-estate mogul Donald Trump, Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Rand Paul (R-Kentucky), former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont):      Trump comes along, says a few things — just a few things! — and soars to the top of the list. That's profound. Imagine if we actually had a good selection of candidates who were saying a lot. And I know Cruz and Rand and all the rest ... Where it's going to end up, I don't know. I'm very pessimistic — I'm very pessimistic — on this race because I'm just not sure it's not going to end up with the dreaded brain in the jar in the Oval Office once known as Hillary Clinton.      He further complained that the Democrats weren't offering any top-tier candidates who were relatively young:      Can the Democrats find anybody under the age of 70? What is this oldness in a vibrant country that needs to go forward to a new century? So I don't know. I'm hoping for surprises. I'm hoping for some jolts. We'll have to see.      Social media      Drudge was clearly not a fan of Twitter and Facebook:      I'm not on Facebook. I don't do the socials. I've got that little Twitter thing — even that's kind of disgusting. ... I'm just warning this country that yes, don't get into this false sense that you are an individual when you're on Facebook. No, you're not. You're a pawn in their scheme.      He also slammed \\"meaningless\\" tweets as a distraction from more important news events:      In the beginning, they were dismissing the internet. They were pooh-poohing it … Now they make it over in their image. Now it's these endless, monotonous tweets. Meaningless — meaningless! — to me. It's just a lot of gnats, a lot of confusion. When the reality of the situation is life on earth has not changed. We need facts. We need events. We need specifics on things. Not all this confusion.      Corporate influence over the media      One of the most consistent themes of the interview was Drudge's dystopian view of the media landscape:      Drudge [Report], to me, when I look at it right now is a correction to this groupthink. There's no difference from any of these websites. You go up and down — we talk about this — what's the difference between the websites? Between a Slate or a Salon or a BuzzFeed or a HuffPo — what is the difference? There isn't any! And this is travesty. It's almost like a weird conglomerate of groupthink that has developed in a dynamic era that should be vibrating.      Drudge claimed to have talked to a Supreme Court justice who said the high court had the votes to rule against news aggregators like him:      They're getting ready for these decisions to come. You thought Obamacare was shocking? You thought some of these other decisions were shocking? Wait until these copyright laws work their way up and the Supreme Court decides you cannot have a website with news headlines linking across the board. Then that will end for me. Fine, I've had a hell of a run.      The future of humanity      Jones directly asked Drudge whether, in his heart, he felt that humanity was going to \\"make it the next 100 years.\\" Drudge answered affirmatively but then mused about what natural disasters or the government could do to prevent that:      Of course — unless Mother Nature decides. I'm a big fan of letting Mother Nature decide some of this too. We can't control a lot of this. There is a law to the universe. There just is. There's just a law to the universe. We could have the San Andreas [Fault] rip tonight … Will we survive? I'm sure we will. Will we be not allowed to speak as we are today? Well, we'll have it documented that we were allowed to speak that way once.      So I don't know. Am I optimistic? For myself, personally, yes I'm strong. There's not much they can do. They could laser beam me, they could drone me, they can plutonium me, they could do whatever they wanted. But spiritually, I'm set.      Watch below: ||||| Conservative media entrepreneur Matt Drudge gave a very rare public interview on Tuesday in which he lashed out at Hillary Clinton, mainstream media and the uniformity of American culture in the digital age.      The exchange provided a glimpse into the mind of one of the most influential yet reclusive figures in American political media today.      In a rambling, wide-ranging discussion with Alex Jones, a radio show host and conspiracy theorist, Drudge admonished \\"the sickness of the American people,\\" who he said were forfeiting individual thought and becoming slaves to Internet companies.      Blind to the realities of the current political situation, Drudge said voters were now likely to install \\"Hillary's brain in the Oval Office in a jar.\\"      The founder of the Drudge Report also called Clinton \\"old and sick,\\" and blamed the media for covering up stories about extramarital affairs.      \\"Why aren't we seeing Hillary's lovers?\\" Drudge asked Jones. \\"Why aren't we seeing Hillary's lovers?\\"      Related: Fox News sees 'no need' for Trump meeting      The nearly 45-minute rant oscillated wildly between familiar critiques of the establishment and paranoid conspiracy theories with little basis in reality. At one point, Drudge suggested that the Obama administration came up with the name \\"ISIS\\" -- for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria -- because it sounded like the last name of Rep. Darrell Issa, the Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.      Drudge also refused to appear on camera for Jones' live stream, his disembodied voice issuing pronouncements, Wizard-of-Oz like, from beyond the void.      \\"You're playing in Google's Hell pit!\\" Drudge said of people who used various digital and social media services, instead of creating their own individual platforms on the Internet. \\"The Internet is what you make of it.\\"      Drudge has wielded immense influence over American political media for two decades. In 1995, he launched The Drudge Report, a simple webpage that aggregates the day's news under sensational headlines, often fueling conservatives' worst fears about the left, the media and, at times, the decline of American civilization.      The Drudge Report's obituary has been written many times by members of the mainstream media, and yet Drudge Report always reasserts its influence. The site draws more than 2 million unique viewers a day and remains the No. 1 site for referrals to political news sites. Getting \\"Drudged\\" -- that is, having your story linked to by Drudge Report -- remains one of the most coveted goals for media organizations seeking web traffic.      But Drudge's influence goes beyond that: Politico, which recently named Drudge one of the top 50 most influential figures in American politics, notes that Drudge \\"helps to write the narrative\\" of each presidential campaign -- which is why his critiques and conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton are so notable.

Jackson faced the threat of secession by South Carolina over what opponents called the \\"Tariff of Abominations.\\" The crisis was defused when the tariff was amended, and Jackson threatened the use of military force if South Carolina attempted to secede. In Congress, Henry Clay led the effort to reauthorize the Second Bank of the United States. Jackson, regarding the Bank as a corrupt institution, vetoed the renewal of its charter. After a lengthy struggle, Jackson and his allies thoroughly dismantled the Bank. In 1835, Jackson became the only president to completely pay off the national debt, fulfilling a longtime goal. His presidency marked the beginning of the ascendancy of the party \\"spoils system\\" in American politics. In 1830, Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, which forcibly relocated most members of the Native American tribes in the South to Indian Territory. The relocation process dispossessed the Indians and resulted in widespread death and disease. Jackson opposed the abolitionist movement, which grew stronger in his second term. In foreign affairs, Jackson's administration concluded a \\"most favored nation\\" treaty with Great Britain, settled claims of damages against France from the Napoleonic Wars, and recognized the Republic of Texas. In January 1835, he survived the first assassination attempt on a sitting president.  Passage 2:Autechre use many different digital synths and a few analogue synths in their production, as well as analogue and digital drum machines, mixers, effects units and samplers. They have also made extensive use of a variety of computer based sequencers, software synthesisers, and other applications as a means of controlling those synths and processing the synthesised sounds. Much of the hardware and software they use has been customised by the band themselves. Autechre have also experimented in depth with development environments such as Max/MSP, and Kyma, amongst others, from 1997 onwards. From 2005 until 2009, they have used the Elektron Machinedrum and Monomachine, alongside Akai MPC and Nord Modular in their live performances. It has also been rumoured that Autechre have used military equipment in their work. In 2008, Sean Booth reported that if he were locked in a cell for a year with only one piece of software and one piece of hardware, he'd \\"probably take a copy of Digital Performer and an AKG C 1000 microphone.\\" Other machines that Autechre have repeatedly mentioned in interviews are appreciated for their interface and aesthetics as much as their sound, including the Roland TR-606 and MC-202, and the Nord Lead. According to the 2016 interview to Resident Advisor, both members haven't bought a piece of equipment \\"in the last 5 years\\", making MAX/MSP a primary production method, with Sean Booth stating that \\"in Max I can generally build the thing I need, and if I don't know how to do that it'll generally be worthwhile learning.\\"  Passage 3:Hasan was born in Medina around 844. Hasan's father was a descendant of Husayn ibn Ali, the grandson of Muhammad and third Shi'a Imam, via his eldest son Zayn al-Abidin, while his mother was an unnamed Khurasani slave. When Hasan ibn Zayd, a descendant of Husayn's brother Hasan, established his rule over Tabaristan in the 860s, Hasan joined him there. However, he eventually fell out with Hasan ibn Zayd's brother and successor, Muhammad ibn Zayd, who distrusted him. Hasan left Tabaristan and tried to set up a realm of his own in the provinces further east. To this end, he allied himself with the ruler of Khurasan, Muhammad ibn Abdallah al-Khujistani, who was an enemy of Muhammad ibn Zayd.

Firstly, let's simplify the equation. We notice that there are multipliers of the same variable on both sides of the equation. We can combine these together. This gives us:     -31*x + 12*x = (-31 + 12)*x     -19*x = 0 2. In the next step, we will divide both sides of the equation by -19, to isolate x on one side of the equation. We do this because, algebraically, we can get rid of a coefficient in front of a variable by performing the inverse operation (in this case, division if the original operation was multiplication).      So, x = 0 / -19 3. Finally, any number divided by a non-zero number still results in zero, so our final answer is      x = 0  So, according to the given equation \\"-31*x + 12*x = 0\\", the solution is x = 0."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person that the money-hungry man engaged to? from the following article ?  The backstory takes place in 12th century England, where Lord Thibault Malféte is about to marry Princess Rosalind, the daughter of the reigning King. At the wedding banquet, by mistake, an enemy known as the Earl of Warwick gives Thibault a potion which makes him hallucinate (and which was actually intended for Rosalind by a witch hired and paid by the Earl), and under its influence, he kills his own bride (rather than her father, as in the French version) believing she is a ferocious monster. While under sentence of death, he asks his servant, André Le Paté to find a wizard to help him. The wizard gives him a potion that will send him back to the moment before he killed Princess Rosalind. The incompetent wizard botches the spell, and instead, Thibault and Andre are sent into the 21st century. They end up in a museum in Chicago where they are arrested by the police. They are rescued by Julia Malféte, a museum employee who closely resembles Princess Rosalind. She thinks that Thibault is her distant French cousin who drowned while yachting a couple of years ago. Thibault soon finds out that Julia is descended from his family and realizes he must return to the 12th century to correct the past. Julia introduces them to the modern American style of life where norms from medieval times no longer apply. Before the return to his time, Thibault decides to protect Julia from her money-hungry fiance, Hunter. Meanwhile, Andre falls for a pretty gardener, Angelique who presents him with the world of equal rights for all people.

Given the question: Given the following context:  11-year-old Annie Parker is living the perfect young life, loved by all, and especially by her mother, father, and older sister. But none of them knows that something horrible is stalking their perfect family. On a fall afternoon in 1976, young Annie hears a noise from upstairs. Her mother has collapsed and died, and an agonizing downward spiral begins. At UC Berkeley a brilliant research geneticist named Mary-Claire King is embarking on something of a personal crusade to uncover the genetic roots of breast cancer. While still in her twenties, she has already made a famous discovery that made the cover of Science—quantifying the genetic variation between humans and chimpanzees. But her conviction that there is a hereditary basis to at least some forms of breast cancer is not widely shared. Nevertheless, her tireless research throughout the 1980s would end in a medical breakthrough—the discovery of the location of the BRCA1 hereditary breast cancer gene—considered one of the most important scientific discoveries of the twentieth century.At the age of 19, after the sudden death of her father, Anne marries Paul and soon is pregnant. She struggles to find a way in the world with her equally young but misguided husband and her older sister, Joan Parker who tries to become a surrogate parent to Anne. But, cruelly, Joan contracts the same cancer that killed their mother, and in a few months, she, too, is dead. Annie is diagnosed with the same disease that killed her mother and sister—breast cancer. It is severe, and surgery and chemotherapy, with all its accompanying difficulties, soon follows. She loses her hair, and if that wasn't enough to endure, her husband, never really mature or stable, has begun an affair with Anne's closest friend Louise, and leaves her. Paul is soon diagnosed with cancer and expires shortly before she is diagnosed with a second cancer.  answer the following question:  What is the full real name of the person that has hair loss?

(CNN) -- Hurricane season will soon be upon the Caribbean -- a time of year when storms and strong winds lash many of the islands so popular as vacation destinations for travelers across the world. Currently, however, a different tempest is raging between two neighboring countries over something far more trivial, but no less volatile -- soccer. Haiti and Jamaica are the latest nations to become embroiled in an unseemly spat that was born on the football field but quickly escalated to dominate and strain diplomatic channels. Not in doubt is the fact that Haiti's under-17 team had their dream of reaching the soccer World Cup crushed after being forced to withdraw from a qualifying tournament hosted by Jamaica. As soon as the OPTIONS: - CNN contingent landed back on home soil, the crisis escalated and both governments became involved. - Caribbean contingent landed back on home soil, the crisis escalated and both governments became involved. - Haiti contingent landed back on home soil, the crisis escalated and both governments became involved. - Haitian contingent landed back on home soil, the crisis escalated and both governments became involved. - Haitians contingent landed back on home soil, the crisis escalated and both governments became involved. - Jamaica contingent landed back on home soil, the crisis escalated and both governments became involved. - World Cup contingent landed back on home soil, the crisis escalated and both governments became involved.","output":"- Haitian contingent landed back on home soil, the crisis escalated and both governments became involved. The Haitian under-17 team, feeling humiliated and disappointed by their withdrawal from the qualifying tournament, was warmly welcomed by their nation upon their return. The emotional reaction back in Haiti fueled the ongoing tension between the two neighboring countries as people rightfully questioned the decisions made by Jamaica. In an attempt to reduce the mounting strain on diplomatic channels, a series of meetings were arranged between top officials from both Haiti and Jamaica. These meetings were aimed at discussing the issue and finding solutions to prevent such unfortunate events from occurring in the future. After several intense discussions, the officials agreed on implementing a series of measures to prevent such situations from arising in the future. Firstly, the establishment of a joint Haitian-Jamaican soccer committee would focus on improving cooperation and communication between the two nations when it comes to organizing and conducting soccer tournaments and events. Secondly, both governments decided that strengthening cultural ties between the two countries would help in reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings and promoting a more collaborative and friendly atmosphere during competitions. This would be achieved through cultural exchange programs and events, bringing people from both nations together in an effort to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation for each other's cultures and backgrounds. Lastly, Jamaica agreed to compensate the Haitian soccer team for their financial losses incurred due to their forced withdrawal from the qualifying tournament. Acknowledging their part in the unfortunate events, Jamaica also expressed its support for Haiti's soccer development by offering resources and training opportunities to Haitian teams. As time passed, the implemented measures began showing positive results. The joint Haitian-Jamaican soccer committee started functioning smoothly, and various recommendations were made to enhance match regulations and improve the overall soccer experience for players, officials, and spectators alike. The cultural exchange programs and events successfully bridged the gap between residents of both countries and nurtured an environment of friendship and mutual respect. This eventually led to a reduction in tension between the two governments and created a more collaborative atmosphere in different areas, including sports. A few years later, as another hurricane season approached the Caribbean, Haiti and Jamaica stood together in unity and partnership, weathering the storms, both literal and metaphorical, and proving the power of collaboration and understanding in overcoming even the most trivial of differences. In the end, both countries were able to turn a volatile and unfortunate situation into a learning experience and an opportunity to strengthen friendship, cooperation, and solidarity. The lasting positive effects of these efforts, both on and off the soccer field, continued to flourish and serve as a shining example of how sports can transcend borders and unite nations in a common cause."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","output":"The actress who portrayed the character of Mrs. June Monsoon, also known as Mother, in the television series 'Absolutely Fabulous' is June Whitfield. June Rosemary Whitfield was a renowned English radio, television, and film actress who worked in the British entertainment industry for several decades. Born on November 11, 1925, in Streatham, London, June Whitfield began her acting career in the late 1940s. She rose to prominence through her work on radio, partnering with comedians Tony Hancock and later, with Terry Scott for the show \\"Happy Ever After\\" and \\"Terry and June.\\" 'Absolutely Fabulous,' often abbreviated as 'Ab Fab,' was a British television sitcom created by Jennifer Saunders. The show originally aired on BBC from 1992 to 1996 and was later revived for a few more seasons from 2001 to 2004. Additionally, some special episodes were also made between 2011 and 2012. The sitcom is centered around the lives of the highly eccentric Edina Monsoon, played by Jennifer Saunders, and her outrageous best friend, Patsy Stone, played by Joanna Lumley. In 'Absolutely Fabulous,' June Whitfield starred as June Monsoon, Edina's unassuming and often bewildered mother. The character is quite different from her daughter and has a more modest and traditional outlook on life, often trying to make sense of Edina's and Patsy's wild and erratic behavior. June Monsoon provides a humorous contrast in the series and reveals the stark generational gap between her age group and her daughter's. Across the years, June Whitfield received critical acclaim for her role in 'Absolutely Fabulous,' and the show itself became a cult classic. Whitfield contributed to the show's immense success, and her performance as June Monsoon went on to become one of her most memorable roles in her prolific career. June Whitfield passed away on December 29, 2018, leaving behind a legacy of exceptional performances and a successful career in the British television, radio, and film industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Zeus visits Perseus and asks for his help, saying that humans are not praying to the gods and as a result the gods are losing their power and becoming mortal and can no longer sustain the walls of Tartarus which are crumbling, and the imprisoned Titan Kronos will soon be free. Perseus, valuing his family's safety, refuses to get involved. Zeus meets his brothers Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Poseidon (Danny Huston), and his son Ares (Ãdgar RamÃ­rez) in Tartarus. He asks Hades's help in rebuilding Tartarus's walls, but Hades rejects the offer and attacks Zeus. Ares betrays Zeus, imprisoning him and stealing his thunderbolt. Hades and Ares plan to make a deal with Kronos: in exchange for remaining immortal, they will drain Zeus's divine power to revive Kronos. The walls of Tartarus break, unleashing monsters onto the world. After killing a Chimera that attacked his village, Perseus travels to meet his father. He instead finds a dying Poseidon who informs him of the circumstances and tells him to find his Demigod son Agenor (Toby Kebbell) who will lead him to Hephaestus, who knows the way into Tartarus. Poseidon then gives Perseus his trident and succumbs to the injuries he sustained when meeting Hades and dissolves into dust. Perseus, Andromeda (Rosamund Pike), and Agenor set out to find Hephaestus on a hidden island. Agenor explains that Hephaestus created three weapons which Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon wield: Zeus's thunderbolt, Hades's pitchfork, and Poseidon's trident, and that these weapons can jointly form the Spear of Trium, the only weapon that can defeat Kronos.

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the doctor that commented on a symphony written by a man who based it on works of a 13th century poet? is inside the article: Rachmaninoff's choral symphony The Bells reflected the four-part progression from youth to marriage, maturity, and death in Poe's poem. Britten reversed the pattern for his Spring Symphony—the four sections of the symphony represent, in its composer's words, \\"the progress of Winter to Spring and the reawakening of the earth and life which that means.... It is in the traditional four movement shape of a symphony, but with the movements divided into shorter sections bound together by a similar mood or point of view.\\"The gestation of Shostakovich's Thirteenth Symphony, Babi Yar, was only slightly less straightforward. He set the poem Babi Yar by Yevgeny Yevtushenko almost immediately upon reading it, initially considering it a single-movement composition. Discovering three other Yevtushenko poems in the poet's collection Vzmakh ruki (A Wave of the Hand) prompted him to proceed to a full-length choral symphony, with \\"A Career\\" as the closing movement. Musicologist Francis Maes comments that Shostakovich did so by complementing Babi Yar's theme of Jewish suffering with Yevtushenko's verses about other Soviet abuses: \\"'At the Store' is a tribute to the women who have to stand in line for hours to buy the most basic foods,... 'Fears' evokes the terror under Stalin. 'A Career' is an attack on bureaucrats and a tribute to genuine creativity\\". Music historian Boris Schwarz adds that the poems, in the order Shostakovich places them, form a strongly dramatic opening movement, a scherzo, two slow movements and a finale.In other cases, the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures. Havergal Brian allowed the form of his Fourth Symphony, subtitled \\"Das Siegeslied\\" (Psalm of Victory), to be dictated by the three-part structure of his text, Psalm 68; the setting of Verses 13–18 for soprano solo and orchestra forms a quiet interlude between two wilder, highly chromatic martial ones set for massive choral and orchestral forces.

He signals his intentions by swimming around the female with flared fins, attempting to draw her to the nest where he will continue his courting display. If the female accepts the male she will begin swimming in circles with the male beneath the bubble nest. When she is ready to spawn she touches the male on either the back or the tail with her mouth. Upon this signal the male will embrace the female, turning her first on her side and finally on her back. At this point the female will release approximately five dozen clear eggs, which are immediately fertilized by the male. Most of the eggs will float up into the bubble nest. Eggs that stray are collected by the male and placed in the nest. Once all the eggs are secured in the nest, the pair will spawn again. If more than one female is present in the breeding tank, the male may spawn with all of them. The spawning sessions will continue for two to four hours, and produce between 300 and 800 eggs.

For a snakebite from a venomous snake, keeping your cat calm and quiet is the best first aid that you can administer to your cat before she receives veterinary care. The more agitated and active she is, the more quickly the venom could spread through her body and make her even sicker. It is actually recommended that keeping your cat calm and quiet is the  only  first aid that you should administer on your own.  Do not allow your cat to walk or run around as this will increase her heart rate and stimulate more blood circulation. Keep in mind that your cat may snap at you or try to bite you because of the amount of pain that she’s in. Gentle pressure will help control the bleeding from the bite wound. An example of first aid that you should  not  administer is cutting the wound open to suck out the venom or drain the wound. Not only is this ineffective, you would cause more pain and suffering for your cat. In addition, the venom could be venomous to you.  Do not apply a tourniquet or compression bandage in the area near the bite wound. Do not apply ice to the bite wound. The ice does not slow the spread of the venom and can actually damage the skin. Do not wash the wound if the bite was from a venomous snake. Washing the wound could increase the absorption of the venom. The action most likely to save your cat's life is getting her to your veterinarian as soon as possible. If possible, transport your cat in her carrier or a large box in which she can comfortably lie down. To help keep her calm and still during the drive to the veterinarian, loosely wrap your cat in a large towel or sheet. The effects of snake venom are usually irreversible and often begin immediately after the snakebite. To increase the chances of your cat’s survival and treat the effects of the snake venom, your cat will need immediate veterinary treatment. Your veterinarian may have a snakebite detection kit, which would allow him or her to identify what type of snake bit your cat. However, in the event that your veterinarian does not have the kit, you will need to provide as much information as you can about the snake bite, such as a description of the snake, how much time has passed since the snakebite, and what clinical signs your cat started to show after being bitten. Although clinical signs and the appearance of the snakebite may seem like enough to start treatment, your veterinarian will want to run diagnostic tests to fully assess the severity of the snakebite. For example, your veterinarian will run blood tests to see how well (or poorly) your cat’s blood is clotting. He or she may also take a urine sample (snakebites can lead to blood being in the urine). Depending on how well-equipped the veterinary clinic is, your veterinarian may want to perform an electrocardiogram to assess your cat’s heart beat. Because of how quickly snake venom can spread and cause damage in your cat’s body, your veterinarian may want to begin some forms of treatment immediately to stabilize your cat. Do not be surprised if your veterinarian needs to start treatment to stabilize your cat before he or she gets a more detailed history from you. One form of immediate treatment is intravenous fluids, which will bring your cat’s blood pressure back up (very important if your cat has gone into shock).  Antivenin works by neutralizing the snake’s venom and is most effective when administered within the first six hours of a snakebite. It can help to prevent bleeding disorders and reduce the amount of swelling at the bite wound. Keep in mind that antivenin is not a vaccination and will not protect your cat from future snakebites. Your veterinarian will likely administer a steroid, which will minimize further tissue damage, control shock, and prevent a possible allergic reaction from antivenin administration. Steroids are usually given only in the first 24 hours after a snakebite.  Your cat may also need oxygen supplementation and additional breathing support, depending on her level of respiratory distress when you get her to your veterinarian.  If your cat is suffering from serious blood circulation problems (little to no clotting, low blood cell counts), she will need to be treated with blood replacement products and other appropriate treatments.  Antibiotics are usually not necessary, since wounds from snakebites rarely become infected. The prognosis for your cat varies depending on how much venom was injected, the species of snake, and how time has passed since the snakebite happened. Fortunately, nearly 80% of pets will survive snakebites if they receive immediate veterinary treatment. Provided that your cat has a good prognosis, she will likely recover in 24 to 48 hours. This recovery may take longer (at least several days) depending on the extent of tissue damage. Your veterinarian may recommend that your cat stay at the hospital overnight for an observation. She would need stay overnight if she needs continued intensive treatment. Once your veterinarian is confident that your cat has recovered well from the snakebite, he or she will send her home with you. When your cat is well enough to come home, you will need to be responsible for her at-home care. Your veterinarian will probably prescribe a pain medication to control the pain from the snakebite. Your cat may need additional medications, depending on her clinical signs and results of the diagnostic tests. Summary:","output":"In summary, the best first aid for a snakebite in your cat is to keep her calm and quiet, and get her to a veterinarian as soon as possible. Do not attempt to cut the wound, suck out the venom, apply a tourniquet, or use ice. At the veterinary clinic, your cat will need immediate treatment, such as intravenous fluids and possibly antivenin and steroids. Diagnostic tests will be run to assess the severity of the snakebite and monitor your cat's heart and blood condition. Oxygen supplementation and additional treatments may be necessary, depending on your cat's condition. Your cat's prognosis will depend on several factors such as the amount of venom injected, the species of snake, and the time since the snakebite. Most pets will survive if they receive prompt veterinary care. Recovery will take 24 to 48 hours or longer, with some cats needing to stay overnight at the hospital. Follow your veterinarian's instructions for at-home care and medications once your cat is well enough to come home."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The band is composed of vocalist Liam Cormier, guitarist Scott Middleton, drummer Mike Peters and bassist Jaye R. Schwarzer. Cancer Bats take a wide variety of influences from heavy metal subgenres and fuse them into hardcore and punk rock, and also include elements of Southern rock. Cancer Bats was founded in May 2004 by singer Liam Cormier and guitarist Scott Middleton, a former member of Toronto heavy metal band At the Mercy of Inspiration. The two wanted to form a project that combined their favorite parts of bands like Entombed, Refused, Black Flag, Led Zeppelin and Down, among others. The lineup was completed with the addition of Andrew McCracken on bass and Joel Bath on drums, with Cormier moving to vocals. The four-piece wrote and recorded songs for a self-released demo that saw light in January 2005, and led to Canadian independent record label Distort Entertainment signing the band.  The story is that the band considered the names Cancer Bats and Pneumonia Hawk after deciding that a combination of illness and animal name would give the best band name. Soon after, Mike Peters replaced Bath on the drums and the band began playing throughout Southern Ontario, playing live shows with bands like Billy Talent, Every Time I Die, Nora, Alexisonfire, Haste the Day, It Dies Today, Bane, Comeback Kid, Buried Inside, Attack in Black, Misery Signals, This Is Hell, Rise Against, The Bronx and Gallows.  On June 2, 2006, the band took part in a short interview and then played a free CD release show at The Edge 102.1 (CFNY-FM) and then on June 6 Birthing the Giant was released into major record stores. The album includes guest vocals by George Pettit of Alexisonfire. On June 7, 2006 they hosted All Things Rock, a show on MTV Canada, and had their own video played at the end of the show. How many copies did it sell","output":"I'm sorry, but I don't have the exact number of copies that Cancer Bats' album \\"Birthing the Giant\\" sold.

Andrzej Żuławski (] ; 22 November 1940 – 17 February 2016) was a Polish film director and writer. He was born in Lwów, Poland (now Ukraine). Żuławski often went against mainstream commercialism in his films, and enjoyed success mostly with European art-house audiences. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Żuławski's films were only shown in European art-houses.","output":"While the statement that \\"Żuławski's films were only shown in European art-houses\\" may suggest a limited context, it is essential to provide a more detailed and long answer to best exhibit Andrzej Żuławski's career, the reach of his films, and their reception in different regions. Andrzej Żuławski was a prolific director and writer known for his distinctive approach to storytelling, often exploring themes of emotional turmoil, interpersonal relationships, politics, and existentialism. His films were marked by their intense visuals and often provocative narratives, which led to a unique and controversial cinematic identity. This characteristic made his work simultaneously complementary and challenging to European art-house audiences, who were engaged in exploring unconventional cinema. Although Żuławski's success was primarily seen in European art-house circles, it is not accurate to say that his films were \\"only\\" shown in European art-houses. His work had an international presence, and it was appreciated by cinephiles and critics across multiple continents. Some of his most notable films, such as \\"The Third Part of the Night\\" (1971), \\"The Devil\\" (1972), \\"Possession\\" (1981), and \\"The Silver Globe\\" (1988), garnered both acclaim and criticism around the world. In fact, \\"Possession\\" was not only screened and received awards at the Cannes Film Festival, but also gained notoriety in the United States and the United Kingdom due to its graphic content, which led to it being labeled as a \\"video nasty\\" in the UK. This instance, along with other international screenings of Żuławski's films, demonstrates that his work was not confined solely to European art-houses. Furthermore, the advent of home video and digital streaming platforms has allowed for a wider audience to access Żuławski's films, introducing them to viewers who might not necessarily attend art-house screenings. As his work becomes more readily available and easier to discover, the notion that his films were exclusively shown in European art-houses becomes increasingly outdated. In conclusion, while Andrzej Żuławski’s films found significant success with European art-house audiences, it would be inaccurate to imply that they were restricted exclusively to these venues. His films have been screened and appreciated in varied settings around the globe, and their accessibility has continued to grow in the digital age, reaching an ever-widening audience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Don’t give up easily.\\"","output":"Title: The Power of Assertive Communication: Making Decisions, Working Hard, And Never Giving Up  Introduction At the core of human interaction lies communication - a fuel that drives relationships, success, self-expression and overall human understanding. Effective communication encapsulates a balance of assertiveness, empathy and focused listening. Assertiveness stands as a pivotal element that shapes our daily decisions, drives our will to work harder, and propels us to persevere in the face of challenges. This article aims to delve into the concept of assertive communication, the steps towards making assertive decisions, the importance of hard work, and the strength of resilience. Assertive Communication Assertive communication is a skill rooted in the balance of respect for oneself and for others. It is the ability to speak up for oneself, express one's ideas and feelings openly, respectfully, and directly, without infringing on the rights of others. Remember, being assertive isn't about being aggressive or self-serving, it's about being honest and direct, sticking up for what you believe while considering and respecting others' points of view. Making Assertive Decisions Assertive decision-making is a significant aspect of assertive communication. It helps in developing a mindset that mitigates indecisiveness and enhances confidence. This process starts by acknowledging one's ability to make decisions and upholding the responsibility for their consequences.  Data gathering and evaluation play a key role in assertive decision-making. Thoroughly understanding the implications, pros, and cons of each option is vital. It empowers individuals to make well-informed, assertive decisions that align with their values and goals. Working Hard Once a decision has been made, turning the decision into action requires hard work. Working hard is the process of dedicating time, effort, and resources to achieve a set goal. With a firm decision in place, the path becomes clearer, but the journey demands perseverance, commitment, and hard work.  Hard work often involves stepping out of comfort zones, embracing new learning opportunities, and maintaining a degree of flexibility and adaptability. It's more about being smarter in the how, what, and when of work than merely increasing the hours worked. Hard work also entails understanding one's strengths and weaknesses and capitalizing on them effectively to improve productivity. Don’t Give Up Easily The journey to any worthwhile achievement is often fraught with challenges. Despite well-informed decisions and hard work, stepping stones may appear as stumbling blocks. The phrase 'Don't give up easily' rings a bell in such instances. Resilience is an ingredient that should never be overlooked. With it, setbacks are merely setups for grand comebacks. Embracing mistakes as learning opportunities, maintaining a positive mindset, continuously aiming for self-improvement, and never losing sight of the ultimate goal, are all elements of the 'never give up' principle.  Conclusion Assertive communication, astute decision-making, commendable hard work, and relentless resilience all combine to forge formidable characters and successful individuals. It's about placing value on oneself, making informed decisions, committing to the actions necessary to effect those decisions, and never allowing any form of setback to dampen one's spirit.  In a nutshell, mastering these attributes won't just result in achieving success; they will cultivate a deep-rooted, enduring growth mindset, setting a path of lifetime accomplishments. This journey transforms not just oneself, but also paints a canvas of inspiration for others to follow. Remember, it starts by speaking up, deciding wisely, working diligently, and never backing down at the first or even subsequent hurdles. The world always makes way for the man who knows where he is going and isn't afraid to assert it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Information:  - Itchen Valley is a civil parish in the English county of Hampshire.  - Uppark is a 17th-century house in South Harting, Petersfield, West Sussex, England and a National Trust property.  - Eastbourne is a large town, seaside resort and borough in the non-metropolitan county of East Sussex on the south coast of England, east of Brighton. Eastbourne is immediately to the east of Beachy Head, the highest chalk sea cliff in Great Britain. With a seafront consisting largely of Victorian hotels, a pier and a Napoleonic era fort and military museum, Eastbourne was developed by the Duke of Devonshire from 1859 from four separate hamlets. It has a growing population, a broad economic base and is home to companies in a wide range of industries.  - An escarpment is a steep slope or long cliff that forms as an effect of faulting or erosion and separates two relatively level areas of differing elevations. Usually \\"escarpment\\" is used interchangeably with scarp (from the Italian \\"scarpa\\", shoe). But some sources differentiate the two terms, where \\"escarpment\\" refers to the margin between two landforms, while \\"scarp\\" is synonymous with a cliff or steep slope. The surface of the steep slope is called a scarp face.This (escarpment) is a ridge which has a gentle(dip) slope on one side and a steep (scarp) slope on the other side.  - Beachy Head is a chalk headland in East Sussex, England. It is situated close to Eastbourne, immediately east of the Seven Sisters.  - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not.  - The South Downs National Park is England's newest National Park, having become fully operational on 1 April 2011. The park, covering an area of in southern England, stretches for from Winchester in the west to Eastbourne in the east through the counties of Hampshire, West Sussex and East Sussex. The national park covers the chalk hills of the South Downs (which on the English Channel coast form the white cliffs of the Seven Sisters and Beachy Head) and a substantial part of a separate physiographic region, the western Weald, with its heavily wooded sandstone and clay hills and vales. The South Downs Way spans the entire length of the park and is the only National Trail that lies wholly within a national park.  - Hampshire (; abbreviated Hants, archaically known as the County of Southampton) is a county on the southern coast of England in the United Kingdom.

It has a number of stately homes including Goodwood, Petworth House and Uppark and also castles such as Arundel Castle and Bramber Castle. Over half the county is protected countryside, offering walking, cycling and other recreational opportunities.  - An Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) is an area of countryside in England, Wales or Northern Ireland which has been designated for conservation due to its significant landscape value. Areas are designated in recognition of their national importance, by the relevant public body: Natural England, Natural Resources Wales, or the Northern Ireland Environment Agency. In place of AONB, Scotland uses the similar national scenic area designation. Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty enjoy levels of protection from development similar to those of UK national parks, but unlike with national parks the responsible bodies do not have their own planning powers. They also differ from national parks in their more limited opportunities for extensive outdoor recreation.  - A national scenic area (NSA) is a conservation designation used in Scotland, and currently administered by Scottish Natural Heritage. NSAs are defined as having outstanding scenic interest or unsurpassed attractiveness. There are 40 national scenic areas (NSAs) in Scotland, covering 13% of the land area of Scotland.  - Petworth House in the parish of Petworth, West Sussex, England, is a late 17th-century Grade I listed country house, rebuilt in 1688 by Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset, and altered in the 1870s to the design of the architect Anthony Salvin.

Often it is a reserve of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that a sovereign state declares or owns. Although individual nations designate their own national parks differently, there is a common idea: the conservation of 'wild nature' for posterity and as a symbol of national pride. An international organization, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its World Commission on Protected Areas, has defined \\"National Park\\" as its \\"Category II\\" type of protected areas.  - Shoreham-by-Sea (often shortened to Shoreham) is a seaside town and port in West Sussex, England.  - Winchester is a city and the county town of Hampshire, England.

Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - Dean \\"Deano\\" Butterworth is a British-American drummer who is noted for working with English singer Morrissey, and in 2005 became the drummer for American band Good Charlotte after they parted with their previous drummer, Chris Wilson.  - Eric Dodd, known professionally as Eric Valentine, is an American record producer, who began his career as drummer and producer in the heavy metal band T-Ride.  - Maryland is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, bordering Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and Delaware to its east.

The state is named after Henrietta Maria of France, the wife of Charles I of England.   - Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the Western world as a softer alternative to rock and roll. The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other.  - Pop punk (also known as punk-pop) is a punk rock music genre and a fusion genre that combines elements of punk rock with elements of pop music. Pop punk typically combines fast punk rock tempos, power chord changes and loud, distorted electric guitars with pop-influenced melodies and lyrical themes.  - Good Morning Revival is the fourth studio album by American pop punk band Good Charlotte and the follow-up to the 2004 release \\"The Chronicles of Life and Death\\". It is the first album to feature Dean Butterworth on drums, who joined the band in March 2005 after former drummer Chris Wilson departed in 2005. Billy Martin has mentioned in an interview that Benji Madden came up with the name for the album. This style can be heard in the album's third single, \\"Dance Floor Anthem\\", which is the most successful song on the album by debuting at No. 2 on the Australian charts and reaching No.25 on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100.

Tempo is related to meter and is usually measured by beats per minute, with the beats being a division of the measures, though tempo is often indicated by terms which have acquired standard ranges of beats per minute or assumed by convention without indication. Tempo may be separated from articulation, or articulation may be indicated along with tempo, and tempo contributes to the overall texture. While the ability to hold a steady tempo is a desirable skill, tempo is changeable, and often indicated by a conductor or drummer. While practicing, an electronic or mechanical device, a metronome, may indicate the tempo, as one usually works one's way up to being able to perform at the proper tempo.

Given the question: Article: Today we bring you an old tale. It's the story of the three little pigs and the big bad wolf that blew down a house made of straw and one made of sticks. The only house left standing was the one made of bricks. Now there is new evidence to suggest that houses built with bales of straw can be very strong. They are also very environmental. Pete Walker is a professor at the University of Bath in Britain. He and a team of researchers there have built a house made out of straw bales and hemp material. During the next twelve months the team will study the effectiveness of these materials in home building. Professor Walker says there are many good reasons for using straw. Professor Walker: \\"One of the benefits is it's a relatively inexpensive renewable material that's readily available.\\" He also agrees that straw takes in carbon dioxide as it grows and helps the environment in other ways. So it can be seen as having no harmful effects on the environment. Professor Walker: \\"The straw bale walls are relatively thick and so all that straw provides very good thermal insulation. So we make buildings that require very little heating in the winter or indeed very little cooling in the summer. So they require very little additional energy.\\" Professor Walker says this reduces home operating expenses. It also reduces the effect on the environment. He says the current interest in straw bale houses is a direct response to the problem of climate change. David Lanfear owns an eco-friendly home building service in the United States called Bale on Bale Construction. He says he laughed when some friends first told him about houses built of straw. But after doing his own research, he learned that building with straw bales made a lot of sense. He has now helped to build more than ten straw bale houses and says the building material is becoming more widely accepted. To build the houses, he fills a wood frame with tightly packed bales of straw. Next he coats the walls inside and out with layers of clay plaster. He says the common ideas...

Theodore VanKirk, also known as \\"Dutch,\\" died Monday of natural causes at the retirement home where he lived in Stone Mountain, Georgia, his son Tom VanKirk said. He was 93.      VanKirk was the navigator of the Enola Gay, a B-29 Superfortress aircraft that dropped \\"Little Boy\\" — the world's first atomic bomb — over the Japanese city of Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945. The bomb killed 140,000 in Hiroshima and 80,000 in Nagasaki three days later. VanKirk was 24 years old at the time.      Tom VanKirk said he and his siblings are very fortunate to have had such a wonderful father who remained active until the end of his life.      \\"I know he was recognized as a war hero, but we just knew him as a great father,\\" he said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday.      In a 2005 interview with the AP, VanKirk said his World War II experience showed that wars and atomic bombs don't settle anything, and he'd like to see the weapons abolished.      A funeral service was scheduled for VanKirk on Aug. 5 in his hometown of Northumberland, Pennsylvania. He will be buried in Northumberland next to his wife, who died in 1975. The burial will be private. |||||Summary:","output":"Theodore \\"Dutch\\" VanKirk, the last surviving member of the crew that dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, passed away due to natural causes at the age of 93 in Stone Mountain, Georgia.

Nine families displaced by a fire at Alamo Hills Apartments in March filed lawsuits Wednesday against the apartment complex. They allege that the complex could have done more to protect belongings they were forced to abandon in the aftermath of the blaze. Bernard Dempsey Jr., an attorney with Western Michigan Legal Services, the group that represents the tenants, said Alamo Hills gave the displaced families very limited opportunity to remove belongings. \\"They were given three days to get their stuff out, and if they couldn't get moved out in three days, their stuff was discarded,\\" Dempsey said. \\"Alamo Hills just threw it out.\\" Others, he said, lost possessions to looters after the March 23 blaze, which left 78 people temporarily homeless. According to the lawsuit, the tenants were prohibited from entering their apartments to retrieve possessions and were promised that the complex would provide security. A spokesperson for PM One, the company that manages Alamo Hills, could not be reached for comment. Nine separate suits were filed in 8th District Court, which handles civil claims of less than 25,000. \\"We're asking for the reimbursement of the value of their property and a small amount for stress -- 3,000 on top of their out-of-pocket expenses for their lost stuff,\\" Dempsey said. \\"They're not looking to get rich off this.

Answer:","output":"While your provided information about Tycho Brahe is correct, it does not fully answer the question of where he was when he discovered Mars. Tycho Brahe was an influential Danish astronomer known for his accurate and comprehensive observations of the celestial bodies during the late 16th century. In order to provide a more detailed answer to the question, let us first clarify the concept of \\"discovering Mars.\\" Mars, through human history, has been largely visible to the naked eye due to its bright red appearance. It could be seen as far back as ancient civilizations, and its discovery cannot be attributed to any particular individual, including Tycho Brahe. However, Brahe made significant contributions to our understanding of Mars by observing and recording its positions with unprecedented accuracy, which helped with the development of early scientific theories on the celestial bodies' movements. Tycho Brahe conducted his astronomical observations primarily from two locations. The first was his observatory and castle, called Uraniborg, built on the island of Hven, which is a part of modern-day Sweden. The second was his observatory at Benátky nad Jizerou in the Kingdom of Bohemia, now part of the Czech Republic. As far as his observations of Mars are concerned, Tycho started making detailed measurements of its position in the night sky during his time at Uraniborg in 1576. Over two decades, Brahe observed and documented Mars' positions, which gained significant importance in proving the accuracy of his instruments and producing an extensive body of astronomical data. To provide a more fitting answer to your question, while Tycho Brahe did not \\"discover\\" Mars in the traditional sense, his critical observations of the planet took place primarily at his observatories on the island of Hven and later in the Kingdom of Bohemia. His work laid the foundation for the groundbreaking work of Johannes Kepler, who used Brahe's observations to develop his laws of planetary motion, which helped pave the way for modern astronomy and our current understanding of the solar system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

GREAT train robber Ronnie Biggs was fighting for life last night after a massive heart attack . Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs was back in jail tonight after being treated in hospital for pneumonia . OPTIONS: (A). no; (B). yes;...I think the answer is","output":"(A). no. These two sentences do not mean the same thing, although they both discuss Ronnie Biggs, one of the notorious Great Train Robbers. There are significant differences in the information conveyed by each sentence. The first sentence states that Ronnie Biggs was fighting for his life after suffering a massive heart attack. This suggests that he was in a critical condition and faced a life-threatening event due to the heart attack. The primary focus is on the severity of his health situation and the potentially fatal consequences. The second sentence, on the other hand, informs us that Ronnie Biggs was back in jail after being treated for pneumonia in a hospital. Here, the emphasis is on his recovery from pneumonia and his subsequent return to jail. Although pneumonia can be a serious health issue, it is not explicitly mentioned whether his life was in danger, unlike the first sentence, which specifically highlights the severity of the heart attack. In conclusion, the two sentences do not mean the same thing. While both sentences involve Ronnie Biggs and his health issues, the focus of the first sentence is on the life-threatening nature of the heart attack, whereas the second sentence emphasizes his recovery from pneumonia and his return to jail.

Firstly, the initial statement provides minimal information about the appearance of the person. It does not mention their attire, specifically a beige jacket and a helmet, which are both mentioned in the second statement. Therefore, we cannot assume these details based on the provided information. Secondly, the mode of transportation is different between the two statements. In the original statement, the person is described as walking to the store with empty shopping bags. Conversely, the second statement describes a person riding a bicycle with filled bags on each handle. A direct correlation between these two scenarios cannot be established without additional context or information. It is worth noting that the given statement only describes the person walking to the store, while the mode of transportation returning from the store is not specified. Additionally, the description of empty shopping bags in the initial statement does not necessarily imply that they will be filled at the store. However, even if we were to assume that the shopping bags would be full upon return, it would still be impossible to conclude that the person would be riding a bicycle, given the information provided. Lastly, the two statements imply different timings. The initial statement depicts a person walking to the store, presumably prior to shopping. On the other hand, the second statement portrays a person riding a bicycle, presumably after shopping, with filled bags on each handle. Connecting these two situations directly would be inaccurate without further information or context to link them. In conclusion, based on the given statement, \\"A person walks to the store with empty shopping bags,\\" it is not possible to conclude that \\"A person wearing a beige jacket and a helmet is riding a bicycle with a filled bag on each handle.\\" The information provided in the initial statement is insufficient for making such a conclusion, as it lacks details about the person's appearance, mode of transportation, and the sequence of events."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I didn't mean to hurt my aunt's feelings, but it did.I spent the evening in an ugly blue telephone booth  . crying as I spoke to a family friend who lived in England. When I left the phone booth, I went back to a silent house with three closed bedroom doors. In the morning, I heard everyone get up and leave for work and school. I wrote a note to say sorry and pulled my bags to the train station. When I got into London, I had to take the underground to Angel Station to get to my family friend's house. I was familiar with the underground, but at the time, it was just endless white tiles .Coming to England seemed like a bad decision. Crying yet again, I tried to lift my suitcase up the stairs. When I was trying hard to walk forward, there were hands. Each time I faced another group of steps,a hand would lift the suitcase. At the top of the steps, the hand would let go, and I'd pull the suitcase to the next group. And just as I wanted to try again,another hand would appear. It happened several times. I never looked up, because I couldn't stop crying.Each hand looked different, and many different people helped me, without asking or saying anything. I couldn't look up. I wasn't able to say thank you. I went on to have an amazing year studying in England, but that was the last time I saw or spoke to any of my uncle's family.

Premise: \\"um-hum and then the Cadillac is is definitely a used car or uh-huh\\" Hypothesis: \\"The Cadillac is at least five years old.\\" In the premise, there are a few expressions, \\"um-hum\\" and \\"uh-huh\\", which are colloquialisms that generally indicate agreement or affirmation. The key information provided in the premise is that the Cadillac is definitely a used car. This means that the car has been previously owned and is not new.  The hypothesis suggests that the Cadillac is at least five years old. This statement refers to the age of the car, proposing that it is a minimum of five years old. Now, to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, it is important to assess if the information provided in the premise necessitates the truth of the hypothesis. In other words, can we conclude that the Cadillac car must be at least five years old based on the information stating that it is definitely a used car? The simple fact that the Cadillac is a used car does not entail that it must be at least five years old. A used car could be any vehicle that has been previously owned or driven, regardless of its age. There is a wide range of possibilities for the age of a used car, from just a few months old to several years or even decades old. The premise only confirms the car is used and does not specify or imply a particular age or range of ages. Considering this, the hypothesis that \\"The Cadillac is at least five years old\\" is not entailed by the premise stating that the Cadillac is definitely a used car. Although the car is confirmed to be used, the premise does not provide enough information to draw the conclusion regarding its age."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, I was wrong. My next dog came into my life when I was married. My husband traveled for a living. and I was often lonely. This dog taught me to be patient. He always stayed at my side until the children were born, and then he became their guardian , too. When he passed away, my heart broke. I was sure I would never love another dog as much as I loved him. I was wrong again. We got the next one when the children were little. When he played with the children, he made them laugh.

Not only the monstrous anger of the guns nor the stuttering rifles’ rapid rattle, but now an epic four-minute, eye-wateringly expensive commercial for a supermarket chain. There is no disputing that the new Sainsbury’s ad is, on its own terms, a masterpiece. The cinematography is breathtaking. Without saying a word, the young cast conveys a startling array of emotional depth within a few short minutes. The simple narrative, built around the near-mythical Christmas truce between the trenches of 1914, has just the right blend of poignancy and sentimentality to bring a tear to the most cynical eye. So why does the advert leave me feeling so unsettled, so uncomfortable, even a touch nauseous? The first answer has to be that for all the respectful tone, the centennial occasion and the endorsement of the Royal British Legion, the ultimate objective here is to persuade us to buy our tinsel, our crackers and our sprouts from one particular supermarket. Perhaps the greatest truism, even cliche about the first world war is that nobody ever really understood why it happened, what it was all about. Those in the trenches never understood what they were giving their lives for, beyond a vague commitment to king and country, and a hundred years later most of us still don’t really understand. The sheer futility of the slaughter is what made the truce possible and also what makes the recounting of the tale so heartwarming and heartbreaking to this day. That vacuum of sense provides all the more reason for caution when co-opting the events for a purpose as crass as flogging groceries. Of course many film-makers, writers and other artists have made good money from representing the horrors of war. Some do so with respect and artistry, some exploit shamelessly. But there is a key difference, I would suggest, between selling representations of war as a product, and using representations of war as a means to another end. Somewhere close to 40 million young men were killed, lost or mutilated in the first world war. Sainsbury’s has all but dressed them in a sandwich board. Donating profits to the Royal British Legion from the sale of the special chocolate bar that appears in the advert doesn’t change that. In helping to launch the ad today, the legion’s head of fundraising praised the film’s historical accuracy and attention to detail. How true can this be? While there were certainly varying conditions on the frontline from place to place and year to year, reading contemporary accounts from either side of the trenches, in the poetry of Owen and Sassoon or the prose of Remarque, the details that stick in the mind are horrific. Nowhere in the new advert do we see the blood and entrails, the vomit and faeces, the rats feasting on body parts. The response might be “well they can hardly put that in a Christmas advert can they?” and that would be entirely true. Which is why the scene is entirely inappropriate for a Christmas advert in the first place. The trench warfare of 1914-18 sits near the top of the list of horrors that humanity has inflicted upon ourselves and each other. Although it has recently slipped out of the range of living memory, it remains an iconic scar. Like the Nazi Holocaust or the dropping of atomic bombs on Japan, it lives on as a vivid phantom in our culture, a constant reminder of our capacity to inflict incomprehensible degrees of violence and suffering upon innocent individuals. It surely behoves us as a society to retain those deaths with respect and a degree of reverence. Would we welcome an advert next Christmas showing a touching little scene between a Jewish child and a disabled child in Auschwitz, swapping gifts for Christmas and Hanukah on their way to the gas chambers? I would hope not, yet I fail to see any great moral difference. Exploiting the first world war for commercial gain is tasteless. This, however, is not what disturbs me most. The really upsetting details are the stunning shot of the robin on the wire, the actors’ trembles as they cautiously emerge from the trenches, half expecting a sniper’s bullet, the flicker of understanding in the eyes as the young soldiers reach into their pockets at the end. The film-makers here have done something to the first world war which is perhaps the most dangerous and disrespectful act of all: they have made it beautiful. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"1. The Sainsbury's Christmas ad is considered a masterpiece in terms of cinematography and storytelling, depicting the 1914 Christmas truce during World War I. 2. Despite the ad's quality, it leaves the author feeling unsettled due to its ultimate objective: promoting a supermarket chain and driving consumerism. 3. The use of war events for commercial purposes is seen as tasteless and exploitative, even if profits are donated to the Royal British Legion. 4. The ad's emphasis on beauty and lack of gruesome details downplays the horrific realities of war, making it seem more romantic than it actually was.

John Owen Brennan (born September 22, 1955) was the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from March 2013 to January 2017. He served as chief counterterrorism advisor to U.S. President Barack Obama; his title was Deputy National Security Advisor for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, and Assistant to the President. His responsibilities included overseeing plans to protect the country from terrorism and respond to natural disasters, and he met with the President daily. Previously, he advised President Obama on foreign policy and intelligence issues during the 2008 presidential campaign and transition. In April 2012, Brennan was the first Obama administration official to publicly acknowledge CIA drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Libya, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. In his speech he explained the legality, morality, and effectiveness of the program. The ACLU and other organizations disagreed. In 2011-2012, he also helped reorganize the process, under the aegis of the Disposition Matrix database, by which people outside of war zones were put on the list of drone targets. According to an Associated Press story, the reorganization helped \\"concentrate power\\" over the process inside the White House administration.  In June 2011, Brennan claimed that US counter-terrorism operations had not resulted in \\"a single collateral death\\" in the past year because of the \\"precision of the capabilities that we've been able to develop.\\" Nine months later, Brennan claimed he had said \\"we had no information\\" about any civilian, noncombatant deaths during the timeframe in question. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism disagreed with Brennan, citing their own research that initially led them to believe that 45 to 56 civilians, including six children, had been killed by ten US drone strikes during the year-long period in question. Additional research led the Bureau to raise their estimate to 76 deaths, including eight children and two women. According to the Bureau, Brennan's claims \\"do not appear to bear scrutiny.\\" The Atlantic has been harsher in its criticism, saying that \\"Brennan has been willing to lie about those drone strikes to hide ugly realities.\\"  According to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, Brennan's comments about collateral death are perhaps explained by a counting method that treats all military-aged males in a strike zone as combatants unless there is explicit information to prove them innocent.

Information:  - Nostoc is a genus of cyanobacteria found in various environments that forms colonies composed of filaments of moniliform cells in a gelatinous sheath.  - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies.  - Glomeromycota (informally glomeromycetes) is one of seven currently recognized divisions within the kingdom Fungi, with approximately 230 described species. Members of the Glomeromycota form arbuscular mycorrhizas (AMs) with the roots or thalli (e.g. in bryophytes) of land plants. \\"Geosiphon pyriformis\\" forms an endocytobiotic association with \\"Nostoc\\" cyanobacteria, and is the only member of the Glomeromycota known not to form arbuscular mycorrhiza in association with plants. AM formation has not yet been shown for all species. The majority of evidence shows that the Glomeromycota are symbionts with land plants (\\"Nostoc\\" in the case of \\"Geosiphon\\") for carbon and energy, but there is recent circumstantial evidence that some species may be able to lead an independent existence. The arbuscular mycorrhizal species are terrestrial and widely distributed in soils worldwide where they form symbioses with the roots of the majority of plant species (>80%). They can also be found in wetlands, including salt-marshes, and associated with epiphytic plants.  - An arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (plural \\"mycorrhizae\\" or \\"mycorrhizas\\", a.k.a. \\"endomycorrhiza\\", \\"AM fungi\\", or AMF) is a type of mycorrhiza in which the fungus penetrates the cortical cells of the roots of a vascular plant.  Arbuscular mycorrhizas are characterized by the formation of unique structures, arbuscules and vesicles by fungi of the phylum Glomeromycota. AM fungi help plants to capture nutrients such as phosphorus, sulfur, nitrogen and micronutrients from the soil. It is believed that the development of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis played a crucial role in the initial colonisation of land by plants and in the evolution of the vascular plants.  - The Diversisporales are an order of generally hypogeous ( underground ) arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi within the division Glomeromycota . Many have vesicles for energy storage , or auxiliary cells . Species produce a wide range of spore types , hence the name .  - Bryophyte is a traditional name used to refer to all embryophytes (land plants) that are non-vascular plants, namely the mosses, hornworts, and liverworts. The defining features of bryophytes are that their life cycles are dominated by the gametophyte stage, that their sporophytes are unbranched and that they do not have a true vascular tissue containing lignin, although some have specialized tissues for the transport of water. Bryophytes are usually considered to be a paraphyletic group and not a natural (monophyletic) group, although some studies have produced contrary results. Regardless of their status, the name is convenient and remains in use as an informal collective term. Bryophytes produce enclosed reproductive structures (gametangia and sporangia), but they produce neither flowers nor seeds, reproducing via spores. The term \\"bryophyte\\" comes from Greek , \\"bryon\\", \\"tree-moss, oyster-green\\" +   \\"phyton\\" \\"plant\\".  - A wetland is a land area that is saturated with water, either permanently or seasonally, such that it takes on the characteristics of a distinct ecosystem. The primary factor that distinguishes wetlands from other land forms or water bodies is the characteristic vegetation of aquatic plants, adapted to the unique hydric soil. Wetlands play a number of roles in the environment, principally water purification, flood control, carbon sink and shoreline stability. Wetlands are also considered the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as home to a wide range of plant and animal life.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction.  - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix.    What entity does 'diversisporales' has the relation 'parent taxon' with?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Does char A represent longer or shorter time period than char B?  Rob always confuses the terms climate and weather. He found it's better to compare them if he needs to learn more about their characteristics. To make things easier, he labeled the weather of his city as char A. Then he labeled the climate of this city as char B. Once finished with learning their characteristics, Rob focused on climate change issues. For that, he labeled the climate of present time as char C and climate just before industrial revolution as char D.  Hint: Weather conditions include air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. Weather is temporary. People in many states have the joke, \\"if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes and it will change.\\" One way to change the weather is to have a different air mass move over the region. Interactions between air masses bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes form along a front. A front is where air masses meet. Fronts can bring about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather. Weather prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due in part to information from satellites. Climate is the long-term average of weather. The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position relative to the atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the same climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a climate zone create a unique biome. Earth's climate has changed throughout the planet's history. Earth was frigid at the end of the Pleistocene ice age, but has been warming since then. Since the Industrial Revolution the pace of warming has increased. In the past few decades the rate has really intensified. This is related to greenhouse gas emissions, primary from fossil fuel burning. The destruction of forests also increasing warming. The effects of global warming are already being seen. Treaties and voluntary actions are needed to reduce emissions to lessen the amount of global warming that will take place in the future. A:","output":"Char A represents a shorter time period than char B. In the paragraph, it is mentioned that Rob labeled the weather of his city as char A and the climate of his city as char B. Weather refers to temporary atmospheric conditions such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. These conditions can change frequently, sometimes within minutes or hours. On the other hand, climate refers to the long-term average of weather conditions, which can include factors like latitude, position relative to atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Climate takes into account weather patterns over extended periods of time, often spanning years, decades, or even centuries.

Matthew Fontaine Maury (January 14, 1806 - February 1, 1873) was an American astronomer, United States Navy officer, historian, oceanographer, meteorologist, cartographer, author, geologist, and educator. He was nicknamed \\"Pathfinder of the Seas\\" and \\"Father of Modern Oceanography and Naval Meteorology\\" and later, \\"Scientist of the Seas\\" for his extensive works in his books, especially The Physical Geography of the Sea (1855), the first such extensive and comprehensive book on oceanography to be published. Maury made many important new contributions to charting winds and ocean currents, including ocean lanes for passing ships at sea. Maury was a descendant of the Maury family, a prominent Virginia family of Huguenot ancestry that can be traced back to 15th-century France. His grandfather (the Reverend James Maury) was an inspiring teacher to a future US president, Thomas Jefferson. Maury also had Dutch-American ancestry from the \\"Minor\\" family of early Virginia.  He was born in 1806 in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, near Fredericksburg; his parents were Richard Maury and Diane Minor Maury. The family moved to Franklin, Tennessee, when he was five. He wanted to emulate the naval career of his older brother, Flag Lieutenant John Minor Maury, who, however, caught yellow fever after fighting pirates as an officer in the US Navy. As a result of John's painful death, Matthew's father, Richard, forbade him from joining the Navy. Maury strongly considered attending West Point to get a better education than the Navy could offer at that time, but instead, he obtained a naval appointment through the influence of Tennessee Representative Sam Houston, a family friend, in 1825, at the age of 19.  Maury joined the Navy as a midshipman on board the frigate Brandywine which was carrying the Marquis de La Fayette home to France, following La Fayette's famous visit to the United States. Almost immediately, Maury began to study the seas and to record methods of navigation. One of the experiences that piqued this interest was a circumnavigation of the globe on the USS Vincennes, his assigned ship and the first US warship to travel around the world.

While he maintains an outward façade of control and efficiency, his mental state unravels as he struggles with a demanding career, a failing marriage, and a dark secret from his past. Luis Martinez, a street-smart, charismatic hustler in his early 30s, is in search of an opportunity to advance his life. Despite his troubled childhood, Luis dreams of making a fresh start by leaving his checkered past behind. With ample charm and quick wit, he schemes and manipulates his way through New York City's elite social circles, becoming a mystery to those he encounters. Act 2: The Deadly Plan and The Unlikely Meeting As Jeffrey's life deteriorates, he becomes increasingly obsessed with exacting vengeance on his estranged wife, Linda. Overwhelmed by a deep-seated rage, he meticulously formulates a plan to murder Linda in an upscale New York City restaurant, 'The Ruby Chalice.' On the night of the planned murder, Luis - with the help of an acquaintance - becomes employed in the restaurant as a waiter. He befriends the staff and integrates himself seamlessly into the establishment, strategically positioning himself to swindle and steal from the wealthy clientele. As the night unfolds, Luis takes notice of Jeffrey, who is acting peculiar and exhibits erratic behavior while waiting for Linda. Curious and suspicious, Luis keeps a watchful eye on Jeffrey, sensing a potential danger to the restaurant and its patrons. Act 3: The Climactic Encounter and The Unraveling Plan Linda finally arrives, and Jeffrey's plan is set into motion. As they engage in a tense and uncomfortable meal, Jeffrey convinces Linda to meet him in the restroom for the sake of confidentiality. Luis, alert to the suspicious situation, excuses himself from the dining area. In the restroom, Jeffrey prepares to kill Linda with a concealed knife but is interrupted when Luis barges in and witnesses the scene. A struggle ensues and ultimately culminates in Luis saving Linda's life, thwarting Jeffrey's plan. Amid the pandemonium, the restaurant staff and patrons become alerted to the situation and call the police. In the aftermath, Jeffrey is arrested and taken into custody. As the police question the witnesses, they find out that Luis had been stealing credit card information from the restaurant patrons. Despite his criminal actions, Luis becomes an unlikely hero for saving Linda, and the restaurant’s management opts not to press charges.

The only home Hamilton ever owned was a Federal style mansion designed by John McComb Jr., which he built on his 32-acre country estate in Hamilton Heights in upper Manhattan. He named the house, which was completed in 1802, the \\"Grange\\" after his grandfather Alexander's estate in Ayrshire, Scotland. The house remained in the family until 1833 when his widow sold it to Thomas E. Davis, a British born real estate developer, for 25,000. Part of the proceeds were used by Eliza to purchase a new townhouse from Davis (Hamilton-Holly House) in Greenwich Village with her son Alexander. The Grange, first moved from its original location in 1889, was moved again in 2008 to a spot in St. Nicholas Park on land that was once part of the Hamilton estate, in Hamilton Heights, a neighborhood in upper Manhattan. The historic structure was restored to its original 1802 appearance in 2011, and is maintained by the National Park service as Hamilton Grange National Memorial. Alexander Hamilton served as one of the first trustees of the Hamilton-Oneida Academy in New York state. Later the Academy received a college charter in 1812, and the school was formally renamed Hamilton College.Columbia University, Hamilton's alma mater, has official memorials to Hamilton on its campus in New York City. The college's main classroom building for the humanities is Hamilton Hall, and a large statue of Hamilton stands in front of it.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose not as much of the water will be able to be heated happens, how will it affect the pancreas working HARDER.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this context is not directly related to the pancreas or its functions. However, to give a comprehensive response to this, we must first understand the process mentioned and examine any potential indirect effects of the perturbation on the pancreas. The process described is related to the role of the small intestine and pancreas in digesting food and regulating blood sugar levels. Here is a summary of the process: 1. Food enters the small intestine, where it is broken down further. 2. The small intestine produces hormones in response to the presence of food. 3. These hormones signal the pancreas to produce enzymes for digestion. 4. Enzymes travel from the pancreas to the small intestine through ducts. 5. Enzymes help digest food in the small intestine. 6. The pancreas also produces the hormones insulin and glucagon. 7. Insulin and glucagon control the amount of sugar in the blood. Now, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that \\"not as much of the water will be able to be heated.\\" Without further context or clarification, we can interpret this statement as a general reduction in the availability of an optimum water temperature for performing certain bodily functions. Still, it is not directly related to the pancreas or its enzymatic and hormonal production. However, let us consider some potential indirect effects of this perturbation on the pancreas. 1. Reduced water temperature could affect the body's overall hydration and thermoregulatory processes. This could lead to a series of compensatory physiological changes, which might indirectly cause the pancreas to work harder to maintain homeostasis within the body. 2. If the temperature of the ingested food is affected by the reduced water temperature, it might become more challenging for the small intestine and the pancreatic enzymes to break down the food effectively. In this case, the pancreas might need to produce more enzymes to compensate for the decreased efficiency of digestion. Despite these considerations, it remains unclear how the perturbation hypothesis could specifically cause the pancreas to work harder. The pancreas primarily functions to support the digestive system and maintain blood sugar levels. It is not directly involved in the processes of heating water or regulating an organism's body temperature. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation does not have a direct effect on the process of food digestion and blood sugar regulation involving the small intestine and pancreas. Although there may be some indirect effects resulting from reduced water temperature, the exact impact of such a perturbation remains speculative and uncertain without more context and information."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: La. parents poisoned infant son with hand sanitizer, rum and perfume to end suffering of Down syndrome: deputies Lucas Ruiz died of alcohol poisoning on Jan. 24 after his mother allegedly fed him Germ-X to end his suffering. The 17-month-old had Down syndrome and three holes in his heart. The only mercy he could have received would be losing parents like these. A Louisiana father and mother are accused of poisoning their infant son who had Down syndrome with hand sanitizer, rum and perfume in what's now being described as a mercy killing. Erika Wigstrom's 17-month-old son had a blood-alcohol level of 0.280 — more than three times the state's legal driving limit — when he died on Jan. 24, an autopsy report found. Deputies say the 20-year-old Belle Chasse woman confessed this week to having administered Germ-X, an ethyl alcohol solution, in his feeding tubes the day before he died. \\"God called upon Lucas to don his angel wings and return back to his forever home while cradled in the arms of his beloved mother,\\" the child's obituary read. Wigstrom, who additionally confessed to feeding the infant perfume, defended that both she and the child's father simply didn't want their son to suffer anymore, according to the Plaquemines Parish Sheriff's Office. RELATED: TEEN JAILED AFTER SPIKING TEACHER'S DRINK WITH HAND SANITIZER In addition to being born with Down syndrome, little Lucas also had three holes in his heart. Tragically for the child, a previous charge against his father appears to show that these weren't the only times he was poisoned. The infant's father, Cesar Ruiz, was arrested in October 2012 after allegedly pouring rum in the baby's hospital feeding tube while the child was awaiting heart surgery. RELATED: AUSTRALIAN DOG HOSPITALIZED AFTER LICKING COOLANT SAVED BY DRINKING VODKA The disturbing discovery of the then 2-month-old child's astonishing 0.289 blood-alcohol content came after the infant began suffering seizures while at Ochsner Hospital in Jefferson, said deputies. Wigstrom allegedly claimed that Ruiz told her the baby would be \\"better off dead\\" and that \\"he wished [the child] would die during his upcoming heart surgery,\\" NOLA.com reported.

Paul Reynolds crisscrossed his sketchbook with furious strokes, filling the pages with images of the vengeance he would take on his former coworkers at Fear and Loading Games. He'd founded the company three years back and, just a few hours ago, his partners and erstwhile friends had fired him without cause or warning.

Elsewhere on the page, computers assembled themselves into 21st century Golems, rising up against traitorous CEO's and producers to crush them to bloody pulp as they cowered beneath their desks. Sitting at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge. Not wanting to succumb to the former, and not quite wanting to find a gun and go back to the office, he instead drew.

Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"How do affirmative action programs disincentivize poor white people to work harder?\\" is in \\"Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \\"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147\\".

For non-preferred groups, such as poor white people, working harder may prove futile because affirmative action policies may provide advantages to preferred groups, even if they are more fortunate (e.g., upper and middle class blacks).

Thanks to the efforts of men like Hubert Walter, this trend towards improved record keeping continued into his reign. Like previous kings, John managed a peripatetic court that travelled around the kingdom, dealing with both local and national matters as he went. John was very active in the administration of England and was involved in every aspect of government. In part he was following in the tradition of Henry I and Henry II, but by the 13th century the volume of administrative work had greatly increased, which put much more pressure on a king who wished to rule in this style.

Please answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The Van de Graaff Generator Van de Graaff generators (or Van de Graaffs) are not only spectacular devices used to demonstrate high voltage due to static electricity—they are also used for serious research. The first was built by Robert Van de Graaff in 1931 (based on original suggestions by Lord Kelvin) for use in nuclear physics research. Figure 18.38 shows a schematic of a large research version. Van de Graaffs utilize both smooth and pointed surfaces, and conductors and insulators to generate large static charges and, hence, large voltages. A very large excess charge can be deposited on the sphere, because it moves quickly to the outer surface. Practical limits arise because the large electric fields polarize and eventually ionize surrounding materials, creating free charges that neutralize excess charge or allow it to escape. Nevertheless, voltages of 15 million volts are well within practical limits.   Q: Practical limits of van de graaff generators arise because the large electric fields polarize and eventually do what to surrounding materials?   Choices:  - displace  - isolate  - decompose  - ionize  A: Answer:","output":"Ionize Explanation: In the given paragraph, it is mentioned that \\"practical limits arise because the large electric fields polarize and eventually ionize surrounding materials.\\" Hence, the correct choice is ionize."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Stony Stratford (often shortened to Stony) is a constituent town of Milton Keynes (in north Buckinghamshire, England) and is a civil parish with a town council within the Borough of Milton Keynes.

Summarize this article: Aloe has remarkable natural healing properties and is a great natural remedy to use on unwanted sunspots. If you’re using a cream, apply a generous amount to the skin of your face, arms, and other sunspot-afflicted areas once in the morning and once in the evening. If you’re using the leaves of an aloe plant, squeeze the pith out from a 1 inch (2.5 cm) section and smear it directly onto your sunspots.  Look for aloe vera gels at health-food stores or in homeopathic medicine sections. Large pharmacies may also carry aloe vera gel. Look near the sunscreen and other skincare products. If you’d prefer just to purchase an aloe plant, look at a large plant nursery. Vitamin E has been proven to help lighten dark spots on the skin, including unwanted sunspots. Swallow 1 vitamin E tablet in the morning and 1 more at night to help lighten sunspots. Or, add vitamin E to your diet by upping your consumption of foods rich in vitamin E. These include foods like citrus fruits, papaya, spinach, broccoli, and tomatoes You can purchase both vitamin E oral tablets and liquid gel at a large pharmacy or drugstore. Cut 1 large lemon into quarters and hold a lemon section against your sunspots for 10–15 minutes per day. Lemons are mildly acidic, and the acid in the fruit aids in lightening dark sunspots. You’ll begin to notice that your sunspots are visibly lighter after about 2 months of daily use.  Rather than throwing away the sections of lemon that you don’t use each day, store them in a plastic bag in your refrigerator and use them the next day. Daily lemon application can also help to remove any dead skin cells from your face, arms, and shoulders. Take a sharp kitchen knife and chop 1 large red onion up into 6-8 large chunks. Pick up 1 of the onion chunks and rub it across a dark sunspot for about 30 seconds. The acid in the onion helps to lighten up the dark color of sunspots. Because the onion’s acid is relatively weak, you’ll need to continue the home treatment for months before you see much of a result. Summary:","output":"Aloe vera has natural healing properties that can help reduce sunspots by applying aloe cream or aloe leaf pith directly to the affected areas twice a day. Vitamin E can also contribute to lightening sunspots by taking tablets or increasing consumption of vitamin E-rich foods. Additionally, using lemon sections and red onion chunks can assist in lightening sunspots due to their mild acidic content. For effective results, these treatments need to be carried out consistently over several months."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Tanya was looking forward to this gathering, as she had spent the past week contemplating what to wear and whom she might meet while there. Felicia, on the other hand, had no obstacles in her path and was able to go without any problems. Leading up to the day of the party, Tanya had experienced a particularly hectic week at work. Several high-priority projects landed on her desk, requiring her to put in extra hours to meet the tight deadlines. Despite her fatigue, Tanya vowed to attend the party as a way to let off steam and unwind with her friends. The day of the party arrived, and Tanya was determined to join the festivities. However, as she was getting ready, she realized that she could not find the chic outfit she had meticulously planned out days prior. After searching her wardrobe from top to bottom, Tanya discovered that her perfect party attire had inadvertently been mixed in with a pile of donations she had dropped off at a local charity earlier that week. Disappointed but undeterred, Tanya decided to wear another dress she found in her closet. As she prepared to leave, she suddenly received a call from her younger sister, who informed her that their mother had been involved in a minor car accident and needed Tanya's assistance to deal with the aftermath. Tanya was relieved to learn that her mother was not seriously injured, and she immediately rushed to her side. While Tanya tended to her mother's needs, Felicia was enjoying the lively atmosphere at the party. She mingled with friends and acquaintances, savoring the appetizers and drinks that flowed throughout the evening. Felicia felt a twinge of guilt, knowing that Tanya would have loved being there, but she understood that family responsibilities sometimes trumped social engagements. As the night wore on, Tanya helped her mom settle back into her home and ensured that she had everything she needed. She tried to keep her spirits up, even though she knew she had missed an opportunity to de-stress and reconnect with friends like Felicia. After saying goodbye to her mother, Tanya headed home, deciding to order some takeout and have a quiet night in. In the end, Tanya, but not Felicia, had to miss the party because life threw Tanya a curveball in the form of work stress, a lost outfit, and a family emergency. While she would have much preferred to let loose and enjoy herself with her friends, Tanya knew that sometimes such sacrifices were necessary to deal with these urgent matters. Thankfully, Felicia could still attend and help bring back stories and memories to share with Tanya, giving her a glimpse of the lively soiree that she could not experience firsthand."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

NASA, the American space agency, has developed a machine that \\"prints\\" food. They showed a model of the printer in Austin, Texas last month. How does it work? Cartridges  filled with powdered dough , cheese, sauce, water and oil put the ingredients layer by layer onto a printer bed. The printer bed, which gets hot from below, cooks the food as it's being printed. Since most of the ingredients are powdered, they can be sent into space and stored for many years without going bad. Water makes food go sour, so the food powders are mixed with water and oil only when they are being printed. \\"Long-distance space travel requires more than 15 years of shelf life for food.\\" says Anjan Contractor, whose company developing the printer. \\" We take water out, and in that form, food will last maybe 30 years.\\" In outer space, there are far fewer choices for astronauts for dinner. Most of their foods--even things like beef or shrimp--are eaten from bags as powders . Scientists hope the new food printer can be used to make more delicious food in outer space, keeping astronauts healthier and happier. But the printer is not limited to use in outer space.

John had to remove the computer virus from the program because the","output":"system had been compromised, and the performance of the network had significantly declined. To thoroughly make sure all traces of the malware were erased, John took several precautions and followed a series of steps. Step 1: Disconnect the infected computer John first disconnected the infected computer from the internet and any other networks to prevent the further spread of the virus throughout the system. He justified this action by ensuring that the malware couldn't exfiltrate sensitive data or infect other devices on the network. Step 2: Boot the computer in Safe Mode After disconnecting the computer, John booted it up in Safe Mode. Safe Mode is a diagnostic mode of operation that only loads the most basic and essential files. This allowed him to minimize the risk of unwittingly running the virus while trying to remove it from the system. Step 3: Identify the malware and its location Using his knowledge of programs and networks, John carefully examined the system logs and the list of running processes to identify any suspicious files and their locations. He consulted online databases for known viruses and compared this information with what he found on the infected computer. Step 4: Disable system restore In some cases, malware can take advantage of the computer's system restore feature. As a precautionary measure, John disabled the system restore to reduce the chances of the virus reactivating itself after its removal. Step 5: Use a malware removal tool John then selected a reputable malware removal tool, which he installed on a clean, uninfected USB drive. He plugged the USB drive into the infected computer and ran the malware removal tool, allowing it to scan and clean the computer. John justified using a specialized tool, as they are designed to detect and eliminate malware. Step 6: Run a thorough antivirus scan After the malware removal tool completed its task, John ran a thorough antivirus scan on the entire system to double-check for any remaining traces of the virus. He ensured that the antivirus database was up-to-date to maximize its effectiveness in detecting and eliminating any potential threats. Step 7: Re-enable system restore and create a restore point Once John was confident that the malware had been effectively removed, he re-enabled the system restore feature and created a new restore point. This action would allow him to restore the computer to a malware-free state in case of future issues. Step 8: Monitor the system Finally, John carefully monitored the system for signs of abnormal behavior or performance issues. He kept an eye on the logs and the status of the antivirus software to ensure that there were no reappearance of the virus or other malware infections. Through these eight steps, John successfully removed the computer virus from the program, restoring the performance and security of the network. By acting promptly and methodically, he prevented significant damage and potential data loss, ensuring the swift return to normal operations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Different colors: The information provided only tells us about a female dancer wearing a red dress, but in the scenario described, we have one dancer in white and another in green — there is no mention of a red dress. The female dancer wearing a red dress could be a completely separate individual or not relevant to the situation described. 2. Missing details: The information about the female dancer in a red dress does not include any other details such as the type of dance she is performing, the location, or whether she is dancing with a partner. Therefore, the connection between this dancer and the detailed scene description cannot be established based on the given information. 3. Ambiguity in the term \\"dancer\\": The term \\"dancer\\" is vague, as it could apply to various types of dances, like ballet, contemporary, or even social dances. On the other hand, the detailed scenario specifically describes ballet dancers. The connection between the female dancer in a red dress and the ballet dancers cannot be inferred without further information specifying that the female dancer in a red dress is also a ballet dancer. 4. Background inconsistency: There is no mention of a columned building or the dancers performing arm-in-arm in the information about the female dancer wearing a red dress. Without any additional background information about the female dancer in a red dress, it is not possible to establish a relationship between her and the described scene. To sum up, the given information about a female dancer wearing a red dress is insufficient to reach the described conclusion about ballet dancers in white and green. Further details about the type of dance, the dancers' actions, and the location would be necessary to make any connection between the female dancer in a red dress and the scenario involving ballet dancers in white and green.

The reason is… April 2, 2014 was the day my 53 year old wife found out that she had metastasized lung cancer. A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends.

Like a real mouse!\\" he remarks). When he hears signing coming from what appears to be a gift-wrapped bird cage and sees that it is labeled for Granny, he switches the tags. Granny gives the cage to Sylvester and opens the box with the rubber mouse. Believing it to be a mix-up, she goes to give Sylvester his box and correct the mistake, but once she sees a satisfied Sylvester hiccup Tweety's feathers, she immediately gets wise and makes the cat spit up the bird. After a thorough scolding, Granny insists that Sylvester kiss Tweety under a sprig of mistletoe, but the now-sulking cat eats Tweety again, leading to another forced regurgitation. Granny places Tweety's cage on a pole where she thinks Sylvester won't be able to reach it, but the cat is determined to get at his meal. On his first attempt, Tweety points out a huge present waiting under the Christmas tree, labeled for Sylvester. Sylvester immediately runs to the package to open it with relish, only to find it is Hector the Bulldog, who promptly eats Sylvester. Granny immediately forces Hector to spit out Sylvester and drags him out of the room. Meanwhile, Sylvester resumes his attempts to get to Tweety with the following tricks all ending in failure:  A toy steam crane at the top of the staircase landing. An angry Granny, armed with a broomstick is waiting on at the end of the scoop, and chases Sylvester off with it.

Question: Why did the Addamses throw a large party? Movie plot title: The Addams Family Movie plot: Gomez Addams laments the 25-year absence of his brother Fester, who disappeared after the two had a falling-out. Gomez's lawyer Tully Alford owes money to loan shark Abigail Craven, and notices that her son Gordon closely resembles Fester. Tully proposes that Gordon pose as Fester to infiltrate the Addams household and find the hidden vault where they keep their vast riches. Tully and his wife Margaret attend a sÃ©ance at the Addams home led by Grandmama in which the family tries to contact Fester's spirit. Gordon arrives, posing as Fester, while Abigail poses as psychiatrist Dr. Pinder-Schloss and tells the family that Fester had been lost in the Bermuda Triangle for the past 25 years. Gomez, overjoyed to have Fester back, takes him to the family vault to view home movies from their childhood. Gordon learns the reason for the brothers' falling-out: Gomez was jealous of Fester's success with women, and wooed the conjoined twins Flora and Fauna Amor away from him out of envy. Gomez starts to suspect that \\"Fester\\" is an impostor when he is unable to recall important details about their past. Gordon attempts to return to the vault, but is unable to get past a booby trap. Gomez's wife Morticia reminds \\"Fester\\" of the importance of family amongst the Addamses and of their vengeance against those who cross them. Fearing that the family is getting wise to their con, Abigail (under the guise of Dr. Pinder-Schloss) convinces Gomez that his suspicions are due to displacement. Gordon grows closer to the Addams family, particularly the children Wednesday and Pugsley, whom he helps to prepare a swordplay sequence for a school play. The Addamses throw a large party with their extended family and friends to celebrate Fester's return, during which Abigail plans to break into the vault.

In the years following the Ancestral Puebloan's departure from Chaco Canyon, several migrations to the region occurred. During the 15th century, Navajo people emigrated to the area from northwestern Canada, and in the 18th century Spanish explorers and settlers came from the south. The Spanish investigated parts of the San Juan Basin, but there is no record of them ever finding Chaco Canyon. When cartographer Bernardo de Miera y Pacheco drew a map in 1774 of Spanish land holdings in the region, he labeled Chaco Canyon with the word Chaca, but it is unlikely he ever visited the area. In 1823 the governor of New Mexico, José Antonio Vizcarra, discovered ancient ruins in the canyon during a military campaign against the Navajo. Vizcarra's account is the first historical record of the Chacoan great houses that were \\"of such antiquity that their inhabitants were not known to Europeans\\". In 1844, Josiah Gregg made the first published reference to Chaco Canyon in his popular book, Commerce of the Prairies. The United States started exploring the region following the Mexican–American War of 1846–48 and the acquisition of the New Mexico Territory. During a military campaign against the Navajo in 1849, Lieutenant James Simpson of the United States Army Corps of Engineers became interested in the canyon's ruins. A group led by the governor of Jemez Pueblo, Francisco Hosta, explored the canyon; its members included Simpson and the brothers Richard and Edward Kern, who were respectively an artist and a cartographer. Simpson was impressed by Chetro Ketl's masonry, which he described as \\"a combination of science and art which can only be referred to a higher stage of civilization and refinement than is discoverable in the works of Mexicans or Pueblos of the present day.\\" Simpson and company documented their findings, noting the location and style of the great houses, taking measurements, and sketching the canyon's major ruins.

Historically, Melungeons were associated with the Cumberland Gap area of central Appalachia, which includes portions of East Tennessee, Southwest Virginia, and eastern Kentucky. Tri-racial describes populations thought to be of mixed European, African and Native American ancestry. Although there is no consensus on how many such groups exist, estimates range as high as 200. According to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, which Virginia incorporated into law in 1662, children were assigned the social status and ethnicity of their mother, regardless of their father's ethnicity or citizenship. This meant the children of African slave mothers were born into slavery. But it also meant the children of free white or mulatto women, even if fathered by enslaved African men, were born free. The free descendants of such unions formed many of the oldest free families of color. Early colonial Virginia was very much a \\"melting pot\\" of peoples, and some of these early multiracial families were ancestors of the later Melungeons. Each family line has to be traced separately. Over the generations, most individuals of the group called Melungeon were persons of mixed European and African descent, whose ancestors had been free in colonial Virginia.  Edward Price's dissertation on Mixed-Blood Populations of the Eastern United States as to Origins, Localizations, and Persistence (1950) stated that children of European and free black unions had intermarried with persons of Native American ancestry. These conclusions have been largely upheld in subsequent scholarly and genealogical studies. In 1894, the U.S. Department of the Interior, in its \\"Report of Indians Taxed and Not Taxed,\\" noted that the Melungeons in Hawkins County \\"claim to be Cherokee of mixed blood\\". The term Melungeon has since sometimes been applied as a catch-all phrase for a number of groups of mixed-race ancestry.  In 2012, the genealogist Roberta Estes and her fellow researchers reported that the Melungeon lines likely originated in the unions of black and white indentured servants living in Virginia in the mid-1600s before slavery became widespread. They concluded that as laws were put in place to prevent the mixing of races, the family groups could only intermarry with each other. They migrated together from western Virginia through the Piedmont frontier of North Carolina, before settling primarily in the mountains of East Tennessee.

Possible star ratings:    - Taking the interpretations above into consideration, \\"Ok\\" could potentially be associated with 2 different star ratings:       a) ★★☆☆☆ - Two stars: If the reviewer meant that the product or service was mediocre, then a two-star rating may be appropriate. It indicates that the product or service is below average but not the worst possible option.       b) ★★★☆☆ - Three stars: If the reviewer felt indifferent towards the product or service, a neutral three-star rating might be fitting. It signifies an average experience - not great, but not particularly bad either. 3. Factors to consider:    - If additional context or reviewer's history is available, this information could be used to further refine the star rating. For instance, if the reviewer has a pattern of leaving brief, undetailed reviews, then the single word \\"Ok\\" might not be an accurate representation of the actual rating they intend to give. Alternatively, if their other reviews are detailed and only this one is brief, it may provide more insight into how the reviewer might rate the experience. In conclusion, based on the vague nature of the word \\"Ok\\" in this review, it is difficult to pinpoint an exact star rating.

But he went to London anyhow. Gandhi believed in fighting without weapons or force. He called his method non-violence . He would simply disobey any unfair law or policy. He was willing to be punished for his actions. Gandhi thought that the law would be changed if enough people protested   in this way. It would show how strongly the people felt about his beliefs.

When a rubber band is stretched and released, it quickly returns to its original shape, which produces the snapping sound.

Afterwards, he directly addresses the audience, and gives them a tour of Cherry Tree Lane, stopping outside the Banks family's home. George Banks returns home to learn from his wife, Winifred, that Katie Nanna has left their service after Jane and Michael ran away again. They are returned shortly after by Constable Jones, who reveals the children were chasing a lost kite. The children ask their father to help build a better kite, but he dismisses them. Taking it upon himself to hire a new nanny, Mr. Banks advertises for a stern, no-nonsense nanny. Instead, Jane and Michael present their own advertisement for a kinder, sweeter nanny.

Strauss-Kahn had secret flat in Paris to hide group sex from wife, court hears Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund, has told a court how he rented a luxury flat in Paris under an acquaintance’s name because he was married and wanted somewhere discreet to meet women for group sex. Strauss-Kahn is on trial for alleged “aggravated pimping” – aiding and abetting the prostitution of seven women – and could be jailed for up to 10 years if convicted. While leading the IMF in Washington, he allegedly had group sex with prostitutes specifically brought to him in Europe and the US, organised by French businessmen friends at his instigation. He strongly denies knowing the women were prostitutes and maintains he thought they were just “swingers”, like himself. He denies all pimping charges. Related: Dominique Strauss-Kahn’s pimping trial: who’s who The judges in Lille focused on the apartment in a smart area of Paris because if Strauss-Kahn had made a private flat available for prostitution, this would fall under the crime of aiding and abetting prostitution. Strauss-Kahn said private “swingers’ evenings” took place at the flat and that he was always present and participating, but insisted he was not the organiser of those evenings. He has denied knowing, or suspecting, that there were any prostitutes or paid women at those events. People who were at the events told the court they had not sensed the presence of any prostitutes. Asked by a judge why the flat was rented under an opaque setup, Strauss-Kahn said: “I was a politician, I was married. I needed a discreet place to meet politicians, and to meet young women I wanted to meet.” The judge questioned Strauss-Kahn over a large number of text messages exchanged between 2009 and 2011 with his businessman friend, Fabrice Paszkowski, who is accused of recruiting paid women for group sex with him. In one message in 2009, Strauss-Kahn asked Paszkowksi if he wanted to accompany him to a “magnificent” swingers club in Madrid and bring “material” – meaning women. Strauss-Kahn had told the investigation that the term “material” was unfortunate and ill-chosen, but that in other text messages he had referred to women by name and that there was no mention of prostitutes. Paszkowski denies the charges and has told the court Strauss-Kahn did not know any women he introduced him to were paid. Earlier this week, the court heard two women break down in tears describing how they were subjected to a sex act by Strauss-Kahn that they had not wanted or agreed to. One said the ex-IMF chief had known of her distress but had smiled and gone ahead “with force”. Strauss-Kahn told the court he had not been aware of the women’s “refusal” and was sorry they viewed the events that way. “I’m not for doing things that are disagreeable for partners,” he said. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of the text are as follows: 1. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), is on trial for alleged \\"aggravated pimping\\" - aiding and abetting the prostitution of seven women. He could be jailed for up to 10 years if convicted. 2. Strauss-Kahn rented a luxury flat in Paris under an acquaintance's name because he was married and wanted somewhere discreet to meet women for group sex.

He strongly denies knowing that the women involved were prostitutes and maintains he thought they were just \\"swingers\\" like himself. He also denies all pimping charges. 4. The court questioned Strauss-Kahn about a large number of text messages exchanged between him and his businessman friend, Fabrice Paszkowski, who is accused of recruiting paid women for group sex with Strauss-Kahn. 5.

Sentence 2: Reactance is defined as the imaginary part of Electrical impedance , and is equal but not generally analogous to the inverse of the susceptance . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","output":"Yes, both sentences convey the same information, but they are structured differently with some slight variations in the choice of words and phrasing. Both sentences mention that reactance is the imaginary part of electrical impedance, indicating that it is an essential aspect of understanding electrical impedance. The first sentence states that the reactance is \\"equal, but not generally analogous to reversing the susceptance.\\" Here, \\"reversing the susceptance\\" is a bit vague and may leave the reader with some confusion about the relationship between reactance and susceptance. However, the important aspect of this sentence is that they are not generally analogous, which communicates that reactance and susceptance are related but distinct concepts. The second sentence is more clearly structured and explicitly states the relationship between reactance and susceptance. In this sentence, the reactance \\"is equal but not generally analogous to the inverse of the susceptance.\\" By using \\"inverse of the susceptance,\\" the sentence is more specific and educates the reader about the mathematical relationship between the two concepts—that is, that they are equal but not generally analogous.

USO often brings thoughts of Bob Hope, but organization well beyond that. Group offers technology, entertainment to troops overseas. USO played key role in arranging \\"Colbert Report\\" from Iraq. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: The USO: Entertainment, Technology, and Support for US Troops Overseas Introduction: The United Service Organizations (USO) has been at the forefront of providing entertainment, support, and technology to American troops stationed overseas for decades. Though one might instantly think of Bob Hope when mentioning the USO, the organization extends its services well beyond iconic performances by famous comedians. From offering wholesome entertainment to facilitating communication with loved ones back home, the USO plays a pivotal role in boosting morale for US military personnel. Bob Hope and the USO Connection: Bob Hope, a legendary comedian and actor, had an enduring partnership with the USO that spanned five decades. With his performances, he brought laughter and cheer to American troops far away from home during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and other conflicts. While the USO is often associated with Bob Hope, its impact extends beyond his shows and has evolved over the years to suit the needs of the modern military. The USO's Offering Technology and Support: As technology has advanced, so has the USO's ability to provide comprehensive support to troops abroad. Among its many initiatives, the USO has set up internet connectivity in its centers, allowing service members to access emails, social media, and communication platforms to stay in touch with their family and friends thousands of miles away. In addition, the USO offers counseling services and resources to help military personnel navigate challenges faced during their time away. Entertainment for Soldiers Abroad: One of the primary missions of the USO is to provide quality entertainment for troops overseas. To achieve this goal, the organization has brought numerous artists, musicians, actors, and comedians to perform for military personnel in active-duty zones. One memorable occasion was when Stephen Colbert's \\"Colbert Report\\" was filmed in Iraq in 2009. The USO played a crucial role in arranging this landmark event, transporting Colbert and his team to the war-torn country, and providing a much-needed distraction for soldiers on the front lines. A Key Figure in Military Morale: The USO has consistently worked towards easing the burden and hardships that come with deployment by ensuring service members feel connected to their homeland. Through entertainment, technology, and support, the USO has helped uplift the spirits of millions of American troops stationed overseas. While Bob Hope might be a symbol of the USO's impact, the organization's work is a testament to its unwavering commitment to these brave men and women.  Conclusion: The role of the USO goes beyond providing entertainment and technology for troops overseas, encompassing broader support and care initiatives. As military personnel continue to face the challenges of serving their nation away from home, the USO's dedication to improving their quality of life serves as a vital and appreciated resource."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What album spawned number one singles \\"Hand on Your Heart\\" and \\"Tears on My Pillow\\"?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  During a Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert with other Neighbours cast members, Minogue performed \\"I Got You Babe\\" as a duet with actor John Waters, and \\"The Loco-Motion\\" as an encore. She was subsequently signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records in 1987. Her first single, \\"The Locomotion\\", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles charts and became the country's highest-selling single in the 1980s. She received the ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single. Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to England with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" while she waited outside the studio. The song reached number one in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Israel and Hong Kong. Minogue won her second consecutive ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single, and received a \\"Special Achievement Award\\". Minogue's debut album, Kylie was released in July 1988. The album was a collection of dance-oriented pop tunes and spent more than a year on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one. The album went gold in the United States, and the single, \\"The Locomotion\\", reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number one on the Canadian Singles Chart. The single \\"Got to Be Certain\\" became her third consecutive number one single on the Australian music charts. Later in the year, she left Neighbours to focus on her music career. Minogue also collaborated with Jason Donovan for the song \\"Especially for You\\", which peaked at number-one in the United Kingdom and in December 2014 sold its one millionth copy in the UK. Minogue was sometimes referred to as \\"the Singing Budgie\\" by her detractors over the coming years. In a review of the album Kylie for AllMusic, Chris True described the tunes as \\"standard, late-80s ... bubblegum\\", but added, \\"her cuteness makes these...

Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier.

He angrily confronts her, but she distracts him by seducing him in her hotel suite.

He accepts her invitation and bids farewell to Katie, the young niece of his guardian John McCullem who reluctantly says goodbye. Over the following period, Joe grows to become a successful songwriter. Katie follows him to Philadelphia and joins the tour by lying, saying that her uncle has died. Katie's presence distracts Joe, much to Lulu's anger and jealousy. Although Lulu makes sure it obvious to Katie she is not happy about her presence, Katie remains unaffected and continues supporting Joe in his career, rather than working for Lulu. One evening, Lulu tries to cancel Joe's performance, and Katie responds by ruining Lulu's costume, thus making it possible for Joe to perform his latest song, which is received with wild applause. After being fired by Lulu, Joe and Katie form their own group, working for producers Karl and Kassel. However, Joe is later seduced by attractive performer Fritzi Barrington to work for her. They are successful, but their collaboration proves short-lived, as Fritzi's financial supporter, a flame from the past, is jealous of Joe's connection to her and withdraws. Joe and Fritzi are able to perform a show, though, and it proves to be a major success. They eventually make their debut on Broadway and work together for a while, until Fritzi retires to marry Martin Webb. Joe, feeling betrayed, blames Katie for scaring away Fritzi, as Katie is her understudy in the show.

I soon learned that he was hurt physically and mentally as a young child, causing him to have the thought of killing himself. He refuses to talk to others about his depression because he now distrusts adults, especially those in his family. However, he feels as if I understand him and that I know the right words to speak.

Given the question: Information:  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - The England national football team represents England in international football and is controlled by The Football Association, the governing body for football in England.  - The Mayor of London is an elected politician who, along with the London Assembly of 25 members, is accountable for the strategic government of Greater London. The current mayor is Sadiq Khan, who took up office on 9 May 2016. The position had been held by Ken Livingstone from the creation of the role on 4 May 2000 until he was defeated in 2008 by Boris Johnson, who served two terms before being succeeded by Khan.  - Wembley is an area of northwest London, England, and part of the London Borough of Brent. It is home to the Wembley Arena and Wembley Stadium. Wembley formed a separate civil parish from 1894 and was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1937. In 1965, the area merged with the Municipal Borough of Willesden to create the London Borough of Brent, and has since formed part of Greater London.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The Premier League is an English professional league for men's association football clubs. At the top of the English football league system, it is the country's primary football competition. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL; known as \\"The Football League\\" before 201617). Welsh clubs that compete in the English football league system can also qualify.  - Wembley Stadium is a football stadium in Wembley, London, England, which opened in 2007, on the site of the original Wembley Stadium, which was demolished from 20022003. The stadium hosts major football matches including home matches of the England national football team, and the FA Cup Final. The stadium will be the temporary home of Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur while White Hart Lane is being demolished and their new stadium is being constructed.  - The London Assembly is an elected body, part of the Greater London Authority, that scrutinises the activities of the Mayor of London and has the power, with a two-thirds majority, to amend the Mayor's annual budget and to reject the Mayor's draft statutory strategies. The assembly was established in 2000 and meets at City Hall on the South Bank of the River Thames, close to Tower Bridge. The assembly is also able to investigate other issues of importance to Londoners (transport, environmental matters, etc.), publish its findings and recommendations, and make proposals to the Mayor.  - Wembley Stadium / wmbli / ( formerly known as the Empire Stadium ) was a football stadium located in Wembley , London , England , that stood on the site now occupied by the new Wembley Stadium . It was famous for hosting the annual FA Cup finals , five European Cup finals , the 1948 Summer Olympics , the 1966 World Cup Final , the final of Euro 96 , the 1992 and 1995 Rugby League World Cup Finals . Of Wembley Stadium , Pelé said , \`\` Wembley is the cathedral of football . It is the capital of football and it is the heart of football '' in recognition of its status as the world 's best - known football stadium . It also hosted numerous music events , including the 1985 Live Aid concert . The twin towers were an icon for England and Wembley , and their demolition in 2003 upset many members of the public .

BABY FACE is one of the better of the \\"forgotten\\" films before the code. It was shown last night after the 1931 version of WATERLOO BRIDGE on the TURNER CLASSIC NETWORK, so I was able to watch the film as it is now with four plus minutes of it restored.  Stanwyck is living in East St. Louis (where she may have known the drunken parents of \\"Myra\\" - Mae Clarke - in WATERLOO BRIDGE). Her father is Robert Barrett. She has lived with him since the death of her mother, and (in the restored dialog) he has been pimping her since she was 14 years old. Now she is resident waitress and part-time whore in his speakeasy, her closest friend being Chico (Theresa Harris), the African-American servant who Barrett keeps bullying. It is one of the two good points of Stanwyck's personality that she keeps standing up to her father about Harris, threatening to leave if Harris is fired (and since it is the grubby workers like Nat Pendleton, who enjoy seeing Stanwyck serve them, rather than the flavor of the hooch he serves that brings them in, Barrett has to obey her). The one guy who comes to the speakeasy regularly whom Stanwyck likes is the shoemaker and intellectual Adolf Cragg (Alphonse Ethier), who sees great potential in the spirited girl if she will just leave her forsaken home. He is also pushing the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzche, and the idea of the will to power. More about this later. After she knocks out the local political bigwig (Arthur Hohl), and has an argument with Barrett about this, a still explosion kills Barrett, and enables Stanwyck to leave her home town. She and Harris head to New York City, managing to get free transport by a railroad freight car by sleeping with a brakeman (James Murray). They reach New York, and after walking about they see the Gotham Trust Company (established 1873), and the friendly guard tells her where the personnel office is. We slowly watch Stanwyck ascend the corporate ladder to the top, similar (but sleazier) than Robert Morse dared in HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING. But Morse was a man in a man dominated company. Stanwyck knows her sexual allure is her weapon. She goes through John Wayne, Douglas Dumbrille (a section of the film that I always felt was the most shocking - curiously enough - when I watched it), Douglas Wood, Henry Kolker, and finally George Brent. Each ends up falling for her, and either being pushed aside when no longer useful, or destroyed by her. Brent, the new President of the Bank his grandfather founded, eventually marries her - and the crisis of the film is when the bank's economic situation is shaken (especially after Brent buys her a fortune in jewels and gives her valuable bonds). Brent is indicted. Will she stick up for him?  SPOILER COMING UP:  The one thing about these films that is not admitted is that the theatrical and moral conventions of the time still dictated endings. The original ending had Stanwyck boarding a ship for Europe abandoning Brent to his fate, but realizing she can't do it to him, returning to their apartment house, and finding he's shot himself. She is riding with him to the hospital as it ends. Now before the rediscovered footage was found, the film ended with them apparently giving up all their money to the bank to save it, and retiring back to East St. Louis, to live happily if poor. Neither of these are good endings. Stanwyck should continue on her destructive course, with Brent the last of her victims. But even without the Breen office the script writers (one is Darryl Zanuck, by the way) saw fit to have her find a moral center. She has none - at least none for powerful men (whom she hates). I don't think that a depression audience would have tolerated that type of conclusion. There are other problems, due to the changing styles of public opinion and changes in society. It was a man's world in the corporate world in 1933, so Stanwyck has her work cut out for her. Wood (when she is going to be fired for an indiscretion with him) admits that he did not want her to work.  But in 2006, Stanwyck would have been finding woman all over the place. In the film there are nasty, catty remarks (obviously some based on jealousy) towards Stanwyck from other secretaries and female employees at her rapid rise. In 2006, she'd be frequently confronting women superiors, and she would find them cutting her off at the legs very quickly. Of course, if she finds one or two are lesbians she might try that road but it is doubtful. And she also never seems to meet any men who are gay. They do have gay male executives in business, who wouldn't give a damn about her legs or breasts. Then there is her mentor, Mr Cragg. Cragg is remade in the \\"bowdlerized\\" version into trying to make her seek a moral center. In reality he pushes Nieztsche, but the way (in a broader sense) the Nazis pushed Nieztsche - find your way to power and push it. While Nieztsche did stress power sometimes, it wasn't the be-all and end-all of his theories. Otherwise nobody would read him today in college courses. Cragg is obviously self-educated, but only half-educated. In short if somebody who thoroughly studied Nieztsche confronted Cragg he'd make him look like a half-educated fool. And this is Stanwyck's mentor! A good film, and for it's day worth a 10...but seriously flawed. Choose your answer. What is the sentiment of this review?

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Planet Neptune is not only very cold but also farther from the Sun than the Earth. In fact, it is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. On the other hand, the Earth enjoys a close proximity to the Sun. Only Mercury and Venus are closer to the Sun than the Earth.  and a hint : According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements:  Please answer this question : Which planet would travel longer distance, Neptune or Earth? A:","output":"Neptune would travel a longer distance than Earth. This is because Neptune's orbit is larger and farther from the Sun compared to Earth's orbit. As a result, it has a longer distance to travel in its revolution around the Sun. Additionally, Neptune's sidereal period (year) is longer due to its increased distance from the Sun and the slower speed with which it travels in its orbit, as it is less affected by the Sun's gravity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I look down the river, and the brightness of the approaching day blinds me. I see shapes moving behind me and beyond me, but who they are and what they do, I cannot say. I will tell what I know is true, and I will invent what I believe is true, and that, I think, is all you can ask any storyteller to do. I learned the Nix family history from the stories Pa told. Even at the age of four, I suspected that Pa's stories might not be perfectly true. When Pa said we Nixes came to North America as indentured servants working our way out of debtor's prison, Grandma Bette would make a face and say he couldn't know that. When he said we Nixes had Lakota and Ojibwe blood in our veins, Grandma Bette would say she wasn't prejudiced, but it simply wasn't so: she and Pa and his brothers and sisters were dark because her people were Black Dutch, from a part of Holland where everyone had black hair and black eyes.

The process you've outlined describes physical or mechanical weathering, a natural geological process that breaks down rocks into smaller pieces. The missing first step should thus introduce the factors causing the start of the weathering process. Here is a potential first step: \\"The rock is exposed to external environmental and atmospheric conditions, including changes in temperature, wind, water flow (like rivers), wave action, freeze-thaw cycles, or plant and animal action.\\" Let's breakdown this process: 1. \\"The rock is exposed to external environmental and atmospheric conditions, including changes in temperature, wind, water flow (like rivers), wave action, freeze-thaw cycles, or plant and animal action\\": This step exposes the rock to the environment and sets the stage for the weathering process. The rock's exposure is significant because it allows interaction with external forces or factors causing weathering. 2. \\"The particles remove small pieces of the rock each time they touch the rocks\\": This step represents the initiation of weathering. Particles moving against the surface of the rock gradually chip pieces off of the rock surface. This can be due to various actions such as water flow, wind, or even biological activities. 3. \\"The particles continue to hit, brush against, or grow against the rocks\\": This step signifies the continuance of weathering. The constant stress due to the motion of particles against the rock further breaks down its structure. This continues the weathering process, which can last for thousands and even millions of years. 4. \\"The rock eventually is broken apart by this contact\\": Over time, the continuous chipping away at the rock breaks it apart. This is a critical step in the weathering process, representing the transition from the macroscopic scale to smaller and smaller pieces that can readily be eroded. 5. \\"The pieces of the rock are now small rocks\\": This step clarifies the outcome of the weathering stage where the rock is broken apart into smaller rocks or stone fragments. 6. \\"The rock pieces are worn away into smaller and smaller pieces by the same forces\\": The process continues even on these smaller pieces of rocks. They still get broken down further by environmental and atmospheric factors until they become tiny grains of sediment. This is how the process of mechanical or physical weathering works, starting from the exposure of rocks to the elements, to the constant wear and tear, leading to the breakdown of large rocks into tiny sediment grains."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose eating less foods happens, how will it affect less steam is produced.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Step 1: Understand the initial process The initial process involves burning coal in a boiler to produce steam under pressure, which then flows into a turbine causing it to spin and ultimately generate electricity. Step 2: Understand the perturbation hypothesis In this case, the perturbation hypothesis is that eating less food occurs. It is not directly related to the initial process of producing electricity through burning coal. Step 3: Analyze if the perturbation has any direct or indirect effects on the process Direct effect: There is no direct connection between eating less food and the process of burning coal to produce electricity. The coal burning process does not depend on an individual's food consumption, so there is no direct effect on the process from eating less food. Indirect effect: It's possible to consider some indirect effects, although they may be quite remote. For example, if eating less food leads to a decrease in overall energy consumption by individuals, this might reduce the demand for electricity. If the demand for electricity decreases, there might be a reduction in coal being burned to produce electricity in the long term, which could result in less steam being produced. A: The supposed perturbation, eating less food, does not have a direct effect on the coal burning process to produce electricity. However, there may be some distant and attenuated indirect effects, such as reduced electricity demand if food consumption is linked to energy demand in households, leading to potentially less steam being produced."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jim threw out the book and read a letter instead because the","output":"book didn't satisfy his thirst for knowledge on the topic he was seeking. He had always been an avid reader, constantly in search of new and varied information. From the time he was young, he would spend hours in the town's quaint library, devouring knowledge as if it were sustenance for his ever-curious soul. He thrived on intellectual growth and was intentional in expanding his understanding of the world. It was a warm autumn evening when Jim stumbled upon the book in question. After having spent a good portion of the day browsing the shelves of the library, he came across a dusty, forgotten-looking book tucked away in a dimly lit corner. Its faded leather cover caught his attention, and with great anticipation, he picked up the book and skimmed through its contents. The book appeared to be about a range of topics, including philosophy, science, and history. It seemed as though it could provide insights on a multitude of subjects, and with great enthusiasm, Jim decided to borrow it and take it home. That night, he settled into his favorite armchair, a steaming cup of tea by his side – the perfect setting for diving into a new literary adventure. As his eyes raced across the pages, Jim quickly realized that the book was not what he had hoped for. The information within it was outdated, its ideas were unremarkable, and the writing style seemed uninspired. Dissatisfaction quickly began to permeate his thoughts, and in frustration, he threw the book aside. However, before he resigned himself to a disappointing evening, Jim remembered an old letter that he had tucked away in a drawer – the letter he had been meaning to read for ages but had never found the time. The letter was from his grandfather, a brilliant and well-respected man who had made significant contributions in various fields of study. Excited about the prospect of gaining wisdom from his granddad's experiences, Jim carefully unfolded the parchment and began to read. The letter was dated decades ago, and the faded ink told of a legacy that still held substantial meaning today. As he immersed himself in his grandfather's words, Jim was transported to a different time and place. His grandfather recounted tales of exploration and daring feats, of intellectual pursuits, and the value of lifelong learning. The letter contained fascinating anecdotes and profound life lessons that completely enthralled Jim. It was evident that his grandfather had an insatiable hunger for knowledge, much like Jim himself. The letter painted a vivid picture of the kind of person his grandfather was – a man who challenged norms and was constantly seeking new truths in an ever-changing world. As Jim continued reading, he couldn't help but feel a deep sense of connection with his grandfather, despite the vast difference in generations. Their shared love for learning created a bond that seemed to transcend time, bridging the gap between past and present. As Jim absorbed every word, he felt inspired and grateful for the wisdom that was being passed down to him by this remarkable man who had come before him. After carefully reading the entire letter, Jim decided to spend the following weeks delving further into the subjects mentioned by his grandfather, hoping to continue their shared intellectual pursuits, even if it meant doing it in spirit. That evening, the simple act of reading a letter made Jim realize that sometimes valuable knowledge and wisdom can be found in the most unexpected places. So, as Jim continued his own journey in pursuit of knowledge, he became more mindful, pausing to value the words and experiences of those who had lived before him - like his grandfather - and cherishing the precious connections that can shape our lives and help us grow."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: FINAL EXAM  Question 1.

Clean up after yourselves, stay out of the road and stop talking about annoying 'hipster topics'; the neighbours can hear you. A San Francisco coffee shop has laid out a set of rules for its diners that includes a ban on talking about ‘hipster’ things and who they had sex with last night, according to a local blogger's photo that captured it outside. Ironically Four Barrel Coffee, which shows overturned buckets and crates for seating on weekends along its alleged problematic alleyway, is a hipster venue itself. House rules: A posting of rules by a San Francisco coffee shop has asked their outside diners to clean up after themselves, lower their voices and not talk about annoying hipster topics. In contrast to their newly posted rules, their website sells their artisan atmosphere - featuring an assortment of coffees from Africa, Latin America and Indonesia among others - as a place you will likely hear 'a dramatic recounting of last night's scandalous activities.’ But they appear to have turned their ways, at least with the Caledonia alleyway’s neighbours in mind. As the rules go: Keep the alley clear of trash, bring dishes back inside, watch out for traffic in the alley, monitor your voice levels and lastly:. '[Don't talk] about annoying hipster topics, or who you f***** last night. You shouldn't do that anyhow, but our neighbors actually can hear you.' The alley: The rules were posted for diners along this alleyway whose chit-chat is said to be heard by the area's neighbours.

Fancy that: Ironically Four Barrel Coffee describes itself as a place for people to go to hear conversations on what 'scandalous activities' one another got up to the night before. The post signs off: 'mucho smoocho.' What could classify as 'hipster topics' by Four Barrel Coffee’s standards is not clear from the posting. UpTownAlmanac suggests one topic being the customer having to tell the barista what kind of coffee they'd like.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  In the year 1978, Gracie Bowen, a 15-year-old tomboy who lives in South Orange, New Jersey, is crazy about soccer, as are her three brothers and their former soccer star father. Although Gracie wants to join her brothers and neighbor Kyle in the nightly practices her father runs, she is discouraged by everyone except her older brother, Johnny. Johnny, Gracie and Kyle attend Columbia High School, where Johnny is the captain and star player for the varsity soccer team. After missing a shot at the end of a game, the despondent Johnny drives off with a friend's car and dies in a traffic accident. Struggling with grief, Gracie decides that she wants to replace her brother on the team. Her father does not believe that girls should play soccer, telling her she is neither tough nor talented enough. Her mother is a nurse who lacks the competitive drive of the rest of her family and fears for Gracie's safety. Her mother later tells Gracie that she would have liked to become a surgeon, but that option had not been available to her as a woman. Rejected and depressed, Gracie begins to rebel; she stops doing her schoolwork, is caught cheating on an exam, and experiments with wild and self-destructive behavior. She is finally caught by her father almost having sex with a guy she met near the docks after telling her friend, \\"I want to do something that I've never done before.\\" This serves as a wake-up call for her parents, particularly her father. He quits his job to work with her on her soccer training. Answer:","output":"In the given context, after Gracie Bowen's rebellious phase and her determination to replace her brother on the varsity soccer team, it is her father who later trains the tomboy. Initially, her father does not believe that girls should play soccer and thinks that Gracie is not tough or talented enough for the sport. However, when Gracie's wild and self-destructive behavior serves as a wake-up call for her parents, particularly her father, he realizes the importance of supporting his daughter's passion for soccer. Motivated to help Gracie fulfill her dreams and overcome the challenges she faces, her father makes a pivotal decision to quit his job and dedicate his time and efforts to her soccer training. As a former soccer star himself, he has the necessary knowledge, skills, and experience to guide Gracie and help her hone her soccer abilities. By training Gracie, her father not only assists her in navigating the difficulties of pursuing a traditionally male sport as a young girl but also supports her emotional well-being by becoming a pillar of encouragement and understanding. The father's decision to train Gracie signifies a change in his initial beliefs and attitude towards his daughter's ambitions, demonstrating personal growth and recognition of the importance of equal opportunities for both boys and girls. His choice to become Gracie's coach ultimately fosters a supportive relationship between them and allows Gracie to develop her soccer skills, defy gender stereotypes, and work towards achieving her goal of joining the varsity soccer team."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Since Team Plum used gibberellins on their crops, and one of the functions of gibberellins is to stop dormancy of seeds and buds, we can infer that Team Plum stopped the dormancy of buds. Justifying the answer: Given the functions of gibberellins stated in the background and the situation where Team Plum used gibberellins on their crops, we can conclude that Team Plum stopped the dormancy (resting time) of buds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize this article: A total of 228 people have put themselves at the mercy of the voters, and will battle it out for 90 seats split across 18 constituencies. Many eyes will be on the number of female candidates put forward by the parties, and a total of 70 are set to stand, which marks a 4% rise on last year's proportion. There were 276 candidates running in the 2016 assembly poll, which was a significant increase on the 218 who stood in the 2011 election. But directly contrasting those numbers with the figures this year would be like comparing apples and oranges, for a number of factors. Firstly, the cut in the number of assembly seats from 108 to 90 in this election will have had an effect on the amount of candidates the parties feel it is worthwhile to stand. And the short notice at which the election was called means parties have had much less time to organise and raise funding than they would for a poll during the typical five-year election cycle. That will have been a particular challenge for smaller parties and independents, and five parties that stood last time round will be absent from this year's ballot papers. The reasons mentioned will go some way to explaining why each of the larger parties have cut their overall numbers of candidates. The Democratic Unionist Party drops by six to 38 and Sinn FÃ©in goes from 39 to 34. The Ulster Unionists opt for nine fewer runners with 24, the Social Democratic and Labour Party cuts three to run 21 candidates and the Alliance Party has a reduction of two to 21. But looking at the figures a different way, each of those parties has actually increased their proportion of candidates to seats by about a couple of percent. The Green Party continues to run a candidate in every constituency. The UK Independence Party sees the largest fall in candidate numbers, with just a single name on the papers this year after running 13 in 2016. The Progressive Unionist Party drops from six to three this year, while the Citizens Independent Social Thought Alliance, which ran last year as Cannabis Is Safer Than Alcohol, drops one candidate and now runs four. But People Before Profit are looking to capitalise on their success last year, and have expanded their number from three to seven, while the Traditional Unionist Voice, the Conservative Party, the Workers Party and the Cross Community Labour Alternative all increase their offerings by one, to 14, 13, five and four respectively. Rounding off the list are the 22 independents, one fewer than last year's number. You can find a full breakdown of candidates by constituency at the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland website. Theresa May has said she \\"fervently\\" hopes that agreement will be reached between the political parties after the election to form an executive.

She was responding to a question from Ulster Unionist MP Tom Elliott in the House of Commons, who asked if the report's recommendations would be implemented if an executive is put together. Mrs May said she would ensure the findings of the HIA report \\"are taken into account and acted upon\\". \\"I don't want to see the benefits that have come of progress being undone,\\" she added.

Judith Butler FBA (born February 24, 1956) is an American philosopher and gender theorist whose work has influenced political philosophy, ethics and the fields of third-wave feminist, queer and literary theory. Since 1993, she has taught at the University of California, Berkeley, where she is now Maxine Elliot Professor in the Department of Comparative Literature and the Program of Critical Theory. She is also the Hannah Arendt Chair at the European Graduate School. Butler is best known for her books Gender Trouble: Judith Butler was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to a family of Hungarian-Jewish and Russian-Jewish descent. Most of her maternal grandmother's family perished in the Holocaust. As a child and teenager, she attended both Hebrew school and special classes on Jewish ethics, where she received her \\"first training in philosophy\\". Butler stated in a 2010 interview with Haaretz that she began the ethics classes at the age of 14 and that they were created as a form of punishment by her Hebrew school's Rabbi because she was \\"too talkative in class\\". Butler also stated that she was \\"thrilled\\" by the idea of these tutorials, and when asked what she wanted to study in these special sessions, she responded with three questions preoccupying her at the time: \\"Why was Spinoza excommunicated from the synagogue? Could German Idealism be held accountable for Nazism? And how was one to understand existential theology, including the work of Martin Buber?\\"  Butler attended Bennington College and then Yale University where she studied philosophy, receiving her B.A. in 1978 and her Ph.D. in 1984. She spent one academic year at Heidelberg University as a Fulbright-Scholar. She taught at Wesleyan University, George Washington University, and Johns Hopkins University before joining University of California, Berkeley, in 1993. In 2002 she held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the University of Amsterdam. In addition, she joined the department of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University as Wun Tsun Tam Mellon Visiting Professor of the Humanities in the spring semesters of 2012, 2013 and 2014 with the option of remaining as full-time faculty.

But when bad weather gives you trouble, can you still make it before the bell rings? In northern China during spring, big sandstorms often make trouble for students and everyone else. When the sky is dark with sand, buses and cars all move much more slowly. Sometimes, people can't even see for 20 metres. Sandstorms usually happen in spring. This year, sandstorms started in late March. They have happened in more than 10 provinces    in northern China this year. More than 70 million people have had problems in those places because of the sandstorms. People in southern China don't have to worry about this kind of bad weather. Most of the sand comes from Gansu and Inner Mongolia . In northern China, lots of places have few trees and don't get much rain. People there have been cutting down too many trees. When there aren't many trees, the ground can't keep enough water. Over the years, the ground dries up and turns to sand. When spring comes and the ice melts , the ground becomes looser . Strong winds take the loose sand into the sky. Sandstorms are bad for people's health. If people breathe  too much sand, they could cough or have asthma . Sandstorms also give farmers lots of problems. Sometimes their sheep get lost in the storms and never get back home. The winds also tear down farmers' houses. What can you do to stop sandstorms? Here's an idea: Ask you parents to help you plant some trees this spring. If you see people cutting down too many trees, tell them about the dangers of sandstorms, and ask your government to stop them from cutting. Which is not stated in the passage?  _   . A) Trees can help keep enough rain water B) More trees need to be planted C) Some people are doing harm to the environment D) Sandstorms are the main cause of asthma The answer is:","output":"D) Sandstorms are the main cause of asthma. The passage does not specifically state that sandstorms are the main cause of asthma. It does mention that sandstorms are bad for people's health and that if people breathe in too much sand, they could cough or have asthma. However, it does not assert that sandstorms are the primary cause of asthma. Instead, it acknowledges them as one of the contributing factors to respiratory issues. The passage does cover the other options in the question: A) Trees can help keep enough rainwater - The passage explains that when there aren't many trees, the ground can't keep enough water, leading to the ground drying up and turning to sand. B) More trees need to be planted - The passage suggests planting trees as a possible solution to sandstorms, encouraging readers to ask their parents to help them plant trees in the spring. C) Some people are doing harm to the environment - The passage mentions that people in northern China have been cutting down too many trees, contributing to the problem of sandstorms.

We have the equation: -3046*q = 2841*q + 201910 - 31187. First, let's simplify the right side by combining the numbers: 201910 - 31187 = 170723. So now we have: -3046*q = 2841*q + 170723. Now, we want to get all the \\"q\\" terms on one side. Let's move the 2841*q from the right side to the left side by subtracting it: -3046*q - 2841*q = 170723. When we combine the \\"q\\" terms, we get: -5887*q = 170723. Now, to find the value of \\"q\\", we need to divide both sides by -5887: q = 170723 / -5887.

They argue that it hinders reconciliation, replaces old wrongs with new wrongs, undermines the achievements of minorities, and encourages groups to identify themselves as disadvantaged, even if they are not. It may increase racial tension and benefit the more privileged people within minority groups at the expense of the disenfranchised within better-off groups (such as lower-class whites and Asians).There has recently been a strong push among American states to ban racial or gender preferences in university admissions, in reaction to the controversial and unprecedented decision in Grutter v. Bollinger. In 2006, nearly 60% of Michigan voters decided to ban affirmative action in university admissions. Michigan joined California, Florida, Texas, and Washington in banning the use of race or sex in admissions considerations. Some opponents believe, among other things, that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of people who belong to a group it's supposed to help, therefore making affirmative action counter-productive. Furthermore, opponents of affirmative action claim that these policies dehumanize individuals and applicants to jobs or school are judged as members of a group without consideration for the individual person. Question: Which court case featured an unprecedented and controversial decision?","output":"The court case that featured an unprecedented and controversial decision is Grutter v. Bollinger. This case, decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in 2003, involved the University of Michigan Law School's affirmative action policy in its admissions process. The plaintiff, Barbara Grutter, a white woman, claimed that she was denied admission to the law school due to race-conscious admissions policies, which she argued violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court upheld the University of Michigan Law School's affirmative action policy, ruling that race could be considered as one of the many factors in a holistic admissions review process in order to promote diversity within the student body. The Court's decision emphasized the importance of obtaining a diverse student body to achieve a richer educational experience for all students and held that achieving such diversity was a compelling state interest. The Grutter v. Bollinger case marked a turning point in the legal landscape surrounding affirmative action in higher education, as it reaffirmed the constitutionality of using race as a factor in admissions decisions under certain circumstances. This decision was both unprecedented and controversial, as it ignited significant debate over the merit, necessity, and implications of affirmative action policies in education and other areas. As a result, several states, such as Michigan, California, Florida, Texas, and Washington, have since banned the use of race or gender preferences in university admissions through legislative measures or voter-approved constitutional amendments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Background: Pieter Cornelis \\"Piet\\" Mondriaan, after 1906 Mondrian (; Dutch: ['pit 'mondrija:n], later ['mondrijan]; 7 March 1872 - 1 February 1944), was a Dutch painter and theoretician who is regarded as one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. He is known for being one of the pioneers of 20th century abstract art, as he changed his artistic direction from figurative painting to an increasingly abstract style, until he reached a point where his artistic vocabulary was reduced to simple geometric elements. Mondrian's art was highly utopian and was concerned with a search for universal values and aesthetics. He proclaimed in 1914: Art is higher than reality and has no direct relation to reality. Context: When the 47-year-old Piet Mondrian left the Netherlands for unfettered Paris for the second and last time in 1919, he set about at once to make his studio a nurturing environment for paintings he had in mind that would increasingly express the principles of neoplasticism about which he had been writing for two years. To hide the studio's structural flaws quickly and inexpensively, he tacked up large rectangular placards, each in a single color or neutral hue. Smaller colored paper squares and rectangles, composed together, accented the walls. Then came an intense period of painting. Again he addressed the walls, repositioning the colored cutouts, adding to their number, altering the dynamics of color and space, producing new tensions and equilibrium. Before long, he had established a creative schedule in which a period of painting took turns with a period of experimentally regrouping the smaller papers on the walls, a process that directly fed the next period of painting. It was a pattern he followed for the rest of his life, through wartime moves from Paris to London's Hampstead in 1938 and 1940, across the Atlantic to Manhattan.  At the age of 71 in the fall of 1943, Mondrian moved into his second and final Manhattan studio at 15 East 59th Street, and set about to recreate the environment he had learned over the years was most congenial to his modest way of life and most stimulating to his art. He painted the high walls the same off-white he used on his easel and on the seats, tables and storage cases he designed and fashioned meticulously from discarded orange and apple-crates. He glossed the top of a white metal stool in the same brilliant primary red he applied to the cardboard sheath he made for the radio-phonograph that spilled forth his beloved jazz from well-traveled records. Visitors to this last studio seldom saw more than one or two new canvases, but found, often to their astonishment, that eight large compositions of colored bits of paper he had tacked and re-tacked to the walls in ever-changing relationships constituted together an environment that, paradoxically and simultaneously, was both kinetic and serene, stimulating and restful. It was the best space, Mondrian said, that he had inhabited. He was there for only a few months, as he died in February 1944.  After his death, Mondrian's friend and sponsor in Manhattan, artist Harry Holtzman, and another painter friend, Fritz Glarner, carefully documented the studio on film and in still photographs before opening it to the public for a six-week exhibition. Before dismantling the studio, Holtzman (who was also Mondrian's heir) traced the wall compositions precisely, prepared exact portable facsimiles of the space each had occupied, and affixed to each the original surviving cut-out components. These portable Mondrian compositions have become known as \\"The Wall Works\\". Since Mondrian's death, they have been exhibited twice at Manhattan's Museum of Modern Art (1983 and 1995-96), once in SoHo at the Carpenter + Hochman Gallery (1984), once each at the Galerie Tokoro in Tokyo, Japan (1993), the XXII Biennial of Sao Paulo (1994), the University of Michigan (1995), and - the first time shown in Europe - at the Akademie der Kunste (Academy of The Arts), in Berlin (22 February - 22 April 2007). Question: Were their exhibits in other cities? Answer:","output":"Yes, there have been exhibits of Piet Mondrian's works, including \\"The Wall Works,\\" in other cities beyond the ones mentioned in the context. Apart from the exhibitions in Manhattan, Tokyo, Sao Paulo, Michigan, and Berlin, Mondrian's works have been showcased in various museums, galleries, and exhibitions around the world, reflecting his significant contribution to the modern art movement throughout the 20th century. Some notable exhibitions of Mondrian's works held in other cities include: 1. Gemeentemuseum, The Hague, Netherlands (now called Kunstmuseum Den Haag): This museum houses the largest collection of Mondrian's works, including some of his earliest landscape paintings and the progression to his iconic grid-based compositions. The museum often hosts exhibitions of Mondrian's art, providing a comprehensive understanding of his artistic journey. 2. Tate Modern, London, United Kingdom: In 1996, the Tate held a significant retrospective exhibition of Mondrian's works entitled \\"Mondrian: The Path to Abstraction.\\" The exhibition showcased approximately 70 paintings and drawings, exploring the development of the artist's unique abstract style. 3. Centre Pompidou, Paris, France: The museum has presented several exhibitions related to Mondrian's art, including the \\"Mondrian / De Stijl\\" exhibition held in 2010-2011, that focused on the development of the De Stijl movement and the role Mondrian played in its evolution. 4. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York City, United States: In 1998, the museum organized an exhibition titled \\"Mondrian, 1892-1914: The Path to Abstraction\\" that showcased the evolution of Mondrian's style from his early representational work to the beginnings of abstraction. 5. Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, United States: In 2001, the museum held an exhibition named \\"Piet Mondrian: 1905-1944,\\" which featured 44 of Mondrian's paintings and aimed to provide an in-depth look at the development of his art throughout his career. These prestigious exhibitions in various cities around the world demonstrate the widespread recognition and appreciation for Mondrian's artistic contributions. The circulation of his work in different museums and galleries showcases the lasting impact and relevance of Mondrian's art in the global context of the 20th-century avant-garde movement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the reason for WhatsApp sending a text in Android but not on iOS when the Internet is absent? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"Yes, these two questions are paraphrases of each other. Both questions address the issue of the inability to send messages on WhatsApp on iOS devices when there is no internet connection. To provide a detailed answer to this technical issue, let us analyze each platform separately and dig deeper into WhatsApp's functionality on iOS and Android devices. WhatsApp on iOS: WhatsApp on iOS relies heavily on Apple's strict guidelines for app development and user experience standards. One of these guidelines, in particular, is related to the user interface (UI) and how it should reflect the real-time experience of the user. In the case of iOS's WhatsApp, when there is no internet connection, the send button is disabled (grayed out or unresponsive) to indicate that the action cannot be performed. This design choice is aimed at providing a visual feedback to the user that there is no network connection and messages cannot be sent, preventing the user from repeatedly pressing the send button and expecting a different result. This design decision follows Apple's Human Interface Guidelines which emphasize the importance of clear and intuitive interfaces. WhatsApp on Android: On Android devices, WhatsApp's behavior when there is no internet connection differs from its iOS counterpart. When users lose internet connection, they can still see the send button as active, allowing them to type and send messages. However, the messages remain in a queue, denoted with a clock symbol, indicating that it has not been sent yet and is waiting for a network connection. This clock symbol serves the same purpose as the disabled send button in iOS: to provide visual feedback that the message cannot be sent due to network unavailability. Once connection is reestablished, the messages in the queue are sent out automatically. This design choice still adheres to Google's Material Design Guidelines, ensuring that users can understand the app's behavior even without an active internet connection. In conclusion, while both Android and iOS versions of WhatsApp function differently when it comes to handling message sending without an internet connection, the underlying reason is that they each follow their respective platform's guidelines for user interface and user experience. These guidelines contribute to maintaining consistent behavior across different applications on each platform, making it more intuitive and user-friendly. Hence, the send button is disabled or unresponsive on iOS devices, whereas Android devices allow messages to be queued and sent once an internet connection is reestablished."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person is holding their breath happens, how will it affect a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"A person holding their breath can have an effect on the amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream, though in most cases, it does not lead to a greater amount being delivered. When someone holds their breath, the air in their lungs becomes stagnant, with little to no fresh air being brought in to replace it. As a result, the concentration of oxygen in the lungs decreases while the amount of carbon dioxide increases. This leads to a lower partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli (air sacs) of the lungs and a higher partial pressure of carbon dioxide. This imbalance between oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations will eventually cause the concentration gradient of these gases to change. The concentration gradient is what drives the exchange of gases between the air in the alveoli and the blood in the surrounding capillaries. As the concentration of oxygen in the alveoli lowers, so does the driving force for oxygen to move into the blood. Similarly, as the concentration of carbon dioxide in the alveoli increases, there is less of a driving force for it to be removed from the bloodstream. Consequently, by holding one's breath, the perturbation hampers the efficiency of the gas exchange process in the lungs, leading to a lesser amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream, rather than a greater amount.

Johnson is a justice on California's Second District Court of Appeal. Lash and Johnson are co-chairs of the California Commission on Access to Justice. The full report can be viewed at (www.calbar.org). In her year-long odyssey through the California justice system, Katherine, a 35-year-old single mother with three children, experienced failure at every turn. Leaving her abusive husband, she moved into the only apartment she could afford, and soon discovered a broken toilet and non- working oven, rats and roaches, and a fourthfloor landing with no railing. She began withholding rent pending repairs her landlord refused to make, but then her Medi-Cal benefits were cut off when she could not provide rent receipts. She lost health care for her children and herself, although she is a borderline diabetic in need of medication and her children were suffering from rat bites. Katherine tried to seek help through the courts. Representing herself at an administrative hearing, she lost her appeal to restore Medi-Cal benefits because she did not have proper documentation of the rent account. When she went to a courthouse to file a complaint against her landlord, she found the process so confusing that she gave up and went home. According to \\"The Path to Justice: A Five-Year Status Report on Access to Justice in California,\\" prepared by the California Commission on Access to Justice, Katherine is just one of 4.6 million poor Californians whose basic civil legal needs -- often involving such critical needs as housing, health care, education, employment, safety and transportation -- are not being addressed. California has a critical dearth of legal services for the poor, and, as this report makes clear, it is imperative that the state join with the federal government and private funders to increase resources so that all Californians, regardless of income, have equal access to our justice system. Our justice system is predicated on the assumption that both parties will be represented by lawyers who act as gatekeepers and guides through a complex legal system that would otherwise be inaccessible to many of us. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable members of our society are the least able to afford legal services. California does have a strong network of legal aid organizations that try to help meet the needs of the poor, but there's just one legal aid lawyer available per 10,000 poor people. We may promise \\"justice for all,\\" but for those who can't afford a lawyer, that promise is often a lie. In its new report, the Commission on Access to Justice notes some significant steps toward providing equal access to justice for all Californians.  Question: \\"Why is the justice system difficult for poor people?\\" Answer: \\"They cannot afford legal services\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: Pick from: (a). no (b). yes","output":"The answer is correct.

His most notable achievements are the world 's first liver , heart , and lung transplant in 1987 ; the first successful combined stomach , intestine , pancreas , liver , and kidneycluster transplant in 1994 , the first liver transplantation operation in Europe in 1968 , and the first intestinal transplant in the U.K. in 1992 . Calne is a fellow of the Royal Society and was Professor of Surgery at Cambridge University between 1965 and 1998 where he initiated the kidney transplant program . He was Harkness Fellow at Harvard Medical School from 1960 - 61 . Much of his subsequent work has been concerned with the improvement of immunosuppression techniques aimed at prolonging the life of liver transplant recipients . He is currently the Yoah Ghim Professor of Surgery at the National University of Singapore . He was elected to the Royal Society in 1974 . He was awarded the 1984 Lister Medal for his contributions to surgical science . The corresponding Lister Oration , given at the Royal College of Surgeons of England , was delivered on 21 May 1985 , and was titled ' Organ transplantation : from laboratory to clinic ' . He was knighted as Knight Bachelor , in 1986 . In 1990 he received the Ellison - Cliffe Medal from the Royal Society of Medicine . His portrait , commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery , was painted by John Bellany in 1991 . In 2012 , Calne shared the prestigious Lasker Award ( Lasker - DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award ) with Dr. Thomas Starzl ' for the development of liver transplantation , which has restored normal life to thousands of patients with end - stage liver disease . ' . Calne is a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association and he is an Honorary Vice-President of the Cambridge University Lawn Tennis Club .  - The endocrine system is the collection of glands of an organism that secrete hormones directly into the circulatory system to be carried towards distant target organs. The phenomenon of biochemical processes' serving to regulate distant tissues by means of secretions directly into the circulatory system is called endocrine signaling. The major endocrine glands include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, and adrenal glands. The endocrine system is in contrast to the exocrine system, which secretes its hormones to the outside of the body using ducts. The endocrine system is an information signal system like the nervous system, yet its effects and mechanism are classifiably different. The endocrine system's effects are slow to initiate, and prolonged in their response, lasting from a few hours up to weeks. The nervous system sends information very quickly, and responses are generally short lived. In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. The field of study dealing with the endocrine system and its disorders is endocrinology, a branch of internal medicine. Special features of endocrine glands are, in general, their ductless nature, their vascularity, and commonly the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones. In contrast, exocrine glands, such as salivary glands, sweat glands, and glands within the gastrointestinal tract, tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen.  - A hormone (from the Greek participle ) is any member of a class of signaling molecules produced by glands in multicellular organisms that are transported by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behaviour. Hormones have diverse chemical structures, mainly of 3 classes: eicosanoids, steroids, and amino acid derivatives (amines, peptides, and proteins). The glands that secrete hormones comprise the endocrine signaling system. The term hormone is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell (autocrine or intracrine signalling) or nearby cells (paracrine signalling).  - An anesthesiologist (American English) or anaesthetist (British English) is a physician trained in anesthesia and perioperative medicine.  - The pancreas is a glandular organ in the digestive system and endocrine system of vertebrates. In humans, it is located in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. It is an endocrine gland producing several important hormones, including insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide which circulate in the blood. The pancreas is also a digestive organ, secreting pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes that assist digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestine. These enzymes help to further break down the carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids in the chyme. The pancreas is also known as mixed gland.  - The stomach is a muscular, hollow, dilated part of the gastrointestinal tract that functions as an important organ in the digestive system. The stomach is present in many animals including vertebrates, echinoderms, insects (mid-gut), and molluscs. In humans and many other vertebrates it is involved in the second phase of digestion, following mastication (chewing).  - Liver transplantation or hepatic transplantation is the replacement of a diseased liver with some or all of a healthy liver from another person (allograft). The most commonly used technique is phototropic transplantation, in which the native liver is removed and replaced by the donor organ in the same anatomic location as the original liver. Liver transplantation is a viable treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure. Typically three surgeons and two anesthesiologists are involved, with up to four supporting nurses. The surgical procedure is very demanding and ranges from 4 to 18 hours depending on outcome. Numerous anastomoses and sutures, and many disconnections and reconnections of abdominal and liver tissue, must be made for the transplant to succeed, requiring an eligible recipient and a well-calibrated live or cadaveric donor match.  - A cadaver, also called corpse (singular) in medical, literary, and legal usage, or when intended for dissection, is a deceased body. The obsolete British term \\"lich\\" for \\"corpse\\", sometimes spelled \\"lych\\", is no longer even listed in major British dictionaries such as Longman, Macmillan, Cambridge, or Oxford Online Dictionaries. However, the term \\"lich\\" has been revived in modern fantasy fiction for a type of \\"undead\\" creature.  - Echinoderm is the common name given to any member of the phylum Echinodermata (from Ancient Greek, , \\"echinos\\"  \\"hedgehog\\" and , \\"derma\\"  \\"skin\\") of marine animals. The adults are recognizable by their (usually five-point) radial symmetry, and include such well-known animals as sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea cucumbers, as well as the sea lilies or \\"stone lilies\\". Echinoderms are found at every ocean depth, from the intertidal zone to the abyssal zone. The phylum contains about 7000 living species, making it the second-largest grouping of deuterostomes (a superphylum), after the chordates (which include the vertebrates, such as birds, fishes, mammals, and reptiles). Echinoderms are also the largest phylum that has no freshwater or terrestrial (land-based) representatives.  - Pancreatic juice is a liquid secreted by the pancreas, which contains a variety of enzymes, including trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, elastase, carboxypeptidase, pancreatic lipase, nucleases and amylase. The pancreas is located in the visceral region, and is a major part of the digestive system required for proper digestion and subsequent assimilation of macronutrient substances required for living.   - Endocrine glands are glands of the endocrine system that secrete their products, \\"hormones\\", directly into the blood rather than through a duct. The major glands of the endocrine system include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, hypothalamus and adrenal glands. The hypothalamus and pituitary gland are neuroendocrine organs.  Local chemical messengers, not generally considered part of the endocrine system, include autocrines, which act on the cells that secrete them, and paracrines, which act on a different cell type nearby.

A prolonged pattern of overconsumption leads to environmental degradation and the eventual loss of resource bases.  and the situation: The country of Qatar is opulent, to say the least. They have one of the highest per capita income in the world - exceeding that of Western Europe and North America. Over-consumption  is the way of life in Qatar. While similarly small country of Bhutan puts emphasis on the happiness of its citizens in a different way. Bhutan does not give way to material over-consumption like Qatar does - it cares about its citizens' spiritual and social well-being.  Answer the following question: Will Bhutan's environment most likely degrade or sustain? Answer:","output":"To answer the question of whether Bhutan's environment will most likely degrade or sustain, let's analyze the given information and compare it with the concept of overconsumption. Given background: Overconsumption leads to environmental degradation and loss of resource bases. Situation:  1. Qatar indulges in over-consumption and has a high per capita income. 2. Bhutan emphasizes the happiness of its citizens through focusing on their spiritual and social well-being, rather than material over-consumption. By comparing the two countries, we can see that Bhutan has chosen a different path than Qatar, prioritizing its citizens' spiritual and social well-being over material wealth and consumption. This suggests that Bhutan is likely more conscious of the negative impacts of overconsumption and thus may make more of an effort to preserve its environment. Answer: Based on the given information, it can be inferred that Bhutan's environment is more likely to sustain rather than degrade, due to its focus on citizens' spiritual and social well-being rather than material over-consumption, which often leads to environmental degradation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath. Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \\"Well honey? What do you think?\\" And I told her: \\"I love the little guy.\\" He was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man. Steve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things. After he got snipped or when he was stung by bees, down there, in grass that came up to his chin, he would come sit by me, hoping I'd understand. With her, it was everything else.

For his second-in-command he chose lieutenant Charles W. Chipp, who had served with him on the Little Juniata adventure. Another veteran of the Polaris rescue mission, George W. Melville, was appointed as ship's engineer. Other experienced Arctic hands were William F. C. Nindemann, a Polaris survivor, and the ice pilot William Dunbar, who had many years' experience in whalers.The appointment of the expedition's navigating officer was problematic; John W. Danenhower, a young naval officer from a well-connected Washington family, was recommended to Bennett by the former president Ulysses S. Grant. Such sponsorship won Danenhower his place, despite a history of depression that had seen him briefly incarcerated at the Government Hospital for the Insane. On Bennett's request, Danenhower accompanied De Long on the voyage from Le Havre to San Francisco, during which he confided details of his medical history. The navigator's competent performance persuaded De Long that such troubles were in the past.The ship's surgeon, James Ambler, was assigned to the expedition by the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, only because he was next on the list of medical officers available for sea duty. Ambler deduced from Danenhower's medical records that a probable cause of the navigator's medical lapses was syphilis, but Danenhower's influential connections ensured that he kept his place on the expedition.Two others from Jeannette's voyage from Le Havre, carpenter Albert Sweetman and boatswain John Cole, were enlisted, as was the Herald's meteorologist, Jerome Collins.

It is a waste of your time and money'...but I don't. I don't want to cause a scene, or start a barrage of backlash from people claiming that it worked for them. Instead, I will present the facts and let you decide for yourself if it is worth doing. Before I start, I just want to clarify that when I am referring to detox I mean the ones that you buy where you have to take a million various tablets a day and stick to a very restricted diet. If you are going to 'detox' by simply eating healthily then all power to you. That will most definitely do wonders for your body. These detox kits won't. They will produce results; however, the results will be temporary. Why detoxes don't work Firstly, the companies who are marketing the detoxes talk about removing toxins that have built up in the body. So, what are these toxins? They don't say. They remain vague and just leave you to let your imagination run wild. Do they mean chemicals, waste products from digestion, bacteria? I guess I imagined it as the waste products from digestion but it would be interesting to hear what other people perceive as the 'toxins' in their bodies. I read an interesting article on British Beauty Blogger about how Veet gave Chinese women a problem they never had. Chinese women naturally have very little body hair so hair removal products have always been poor sellers. Therefore, Reckitt Benckiser (who own Veet) devised  a marketing campaign to convince Chinese that any body hair is unsightly and released ads equating hair free skin with health, confidence and \\"shining glory\\" (the full marketing concept can be read here). I feel that this is the same as what is happening in regards to detoxes. The marketers of the products have convinced us that our bodies are full of these so called 'toxins', from our unhealthy lifestyles, that need to be removed with a detox. Question: How did Veet convince Chinese women that any body hair was unsightly? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"Veet, owned by Reckitt Benckiser, devised a marketing campaign to convince Chinese women that any body hair is unsightly.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"To provide a detailed and long answer regarding the prevention of cranberry fruitworm, I will first evaluate each solution's naive physics reasoning based on their practicality, simplicity, and effectiveness. With this analysis, I will determine which solution is more sound according to naive physics reasoning. 1. Cultural practices: By maintaining good cultural practices, such as proper sanitation and debris removal, growers can help reduce the chances of harboring cranberry fruitworm. This involves removing leftover fruit, leaf litter, and other organic material on the field that could potentially provide a habitat for overwintering larvae. Additionally, proper pruning techniques for better airflow, timing of fertilizer applications, and planting early-season-blooming varieties can further minimize infestations. Naive physics reasoning: Cultural practices are a straightforward and practical approach to managing cranberry fruitworm, as they require relatively simple methods that can be easily adopted by farmers. By maintaining clean fields and optimal growing conditions, growers are indirectly preventing the fruitworm from thriving. The reasoning is relatively easy to understand, and the simplicity of these practices makes it a viable option for prevention. 2. Pheromone traps and mating disruption: Pheromone traps can be placed in and around cranberry bogs to monitor adult fruitworm population levels. These traps use chemically synthesized pheromones to attract adult male fruitworms, making it easier to detect their presence. In combination, employing mating disruption techniques (e.g., releasing pheromone dispensers) can confuse male fruitworms, disrupting their ability to locate female counterparts, and thus reducing mating success and population growth. Naive physics reasoning: Pheromone traps and mating disruption techniques involve a more complex understanding of the biology and behavior of the cranberry fruitworm. However, the reasoning for their use is still practical and effective when explained. The concept of detecting and controlling the adult population to prevent larvae infestation is relatively easy to grasp, making this solution a sound choice based on naive physics reasoning. 3. Biological control: Introducing beneficial organisms, such as parasitic wasps and predatory beetles, can help manage the cranberry fruitworm population through natural predation. Regularly releasing these beneficial insects in the affected area may provide a sustainable long-term solution. Naive physics reasoning: The idea of biological control would likely be considered sound in terms of naive physics reasoning because it involves using the natural predators of the cranberry fruitworm to control its population. The concept of \\"the enemy of my enemy is my friend\\" is both practical and common-sensical. Implementing biological control is also relatively simple and cost-effective, which adds to its suitability as a prevention measure. 4. Chemical control: Applying insecticides can help minimize cranberry fruitworm populations, but this should be done judiciously targeting the most vulnerable stages of the insect's life cycle. Using selective biological insecticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki, could disrupt larvae feeding and growth without harming many beneficial organisms. However, mismanagement of chemical control can result in insecticide resistance and other harmful side effects to the environment. Naive physics reasoning: Chemical control, when used responsibly and selectively, can be a sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning, as its effectiveness in eliminating the fruitworm population is often easy to understand. However, potential negative consequences like insecticide-resistant pests, the harm to beneficial insects, and environmental issues may cause concerns and should be taken into consideration while evaluating its overall effectiveness. In conclusion, through the lens of naive physics reasoning, among the four solutions discussed above, cultural practices and biological control seem to be the most sound options, as they are relatively simple, practical, and effective. Pheromone traps and mating disruption come in close second due to their comprehensible concept, while chemical control remains a viable option as long as its potential side effects are considered and managed properly."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that Reinhard Keiser was directly instrumental in securing their post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra? from the following article ?  Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig.  In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias.  Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".","output":"The name of the person that Reinhard Keiser was directly instrumental in securing their post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra is George Frideric Handel. The article states that it is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing Handel's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra.

Please answer the following question: The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade.

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","output":"To saute mushrooms in Sherry, you can follow these simple steps: 1. First, clean the mushrooms by gently wiping them with a damp cloth or paper towel. Don't rinse them under water, as they can get soggy. 2. Next, slice the mushrooms if they are large, or leave them whole if they are small. 3. Now, heat a large pan over medium heat. Add a little bit of olive oil or butter to the pan. Just enough to help the mushrooms cook and not stick to the pan. 4. Once the pan is heated, add your mushrooms. Cook them for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they start to soften and turn a nice golden-brown color.  5. At this point, you can add the Sherry. Sherry is a type of wine that adds a sweet and nutty flavor to your mushrooms. Pour a small amount of Sherry into the pan, about 1/4 cup should be enough. If you're unsure, ask a grown-up for help measuring the Sherry. 6. Let the mushrooms cook with the Sherry for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the liquid to reduce a bit and the mushrooms to absorb the delicious flavors. 7. Finally, you can remove the pan from heat and add a little bit of salt and pepper to taste, if you'd like. Just a little sprinkle should do the trick. And there you have it! Delicious sauteed mushrooms in Sherry. Try serving them with some rice or your favorite dish. Enjoy! In conclusion, the more reasonable method for sauteing mushrooms in Sherry is to clean and slice the mushrooms, heat the pan with some oil or butter, cook the mushrooms, add the Sherry and cook for a few more minutes, and season to taste."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Alan Pardew tried to sign Ajax midfielder last season. 25-year-old scored seven times in Dutch league last season. Can play as a playmaker or second striker to boost Pardew's attack.","output":"Title: Alan Pardew's Pursuit of the Dynamic Ajax Midfielder: A Boost for His Attacking Arsenal Last season saw a flurry of activity in the football transfer market, as clubs were eager to strengthen their squads and secure some promising talents. Former West Bromwich Albion manager, Alan Pardew, was no exception, as he tried to lure a dynamic 25-year-old midfielder from Dutch giants, Ajax, to bolster his attacking options. An exciting prospect for Pardew's side, this young talent is notable for scoring seven goals in the Dutch league last season, displaying an innate ability to function as a playmaker or second striker for the team. With his eyes set on the versatile Ajax midfielder, this integral addition could have undoubtedly augmented Pardew's attacking force, providing the necessary depth and flexibility to his squad. Given the player's impressive track record in the Dutch league, it comes as no surprise that Pardew was keen on acquiring the 25-year-old. The young powerhouse's success last season can be attributed to his adaptability on the field, with the capacity to play as both a playmaker and a second striker. This versatility would have offered Pardew multiple tactical approaches in competitions, providing a plethora of options when formulating attack strategies. As a playmaker, the Ajax star would have been responsible for creating goal-scoring opportunities for teammates, utilizing his advanced vision and intelligent gameplay to dismantle defenses and exploit weaknesses. Additionally, his goalscoring prowess would have ideally complemented his playmaking abilities, reflecting the perfect blend of creativity and scoring ability to push Pardew's team forward. Moreover, Pardew's pursuit of this Ajax midfielder highlights his intention to build a well-rounded squad, capable of evolving and adapting to any in-game situation. The inclusion of a dual-role player, such as the 25-year-old, would have afforded Pardew a greater degree of flexibility - granting him the ability to make adjustments based on the opposition's lineup, match scenarios, and other tactical considerations. With the player predominantly operating in the final third of the pitch, his instinctive movement and understanding of the game would have potentially opened up new avenues for Pardew's team to exploit. However, despite the undeniable benefits that this talent would have brought to Pardew's side, the deal ultimately did not materialize. Regardless, the pursuit of the Ajax midfielder highlights Pardew's ambitions and tactical awareness, showcasing his ability to identify and pursue potential targets that would seamlessly integrate into his strategic vision. In conclusion, the interest displayed by Alan Pardew in the Ajax midfielder exemplifies his commitment to developing a dynamic, attack-minded squad. His attempt to sign the 25-year-old, who demonstrated remarkable potential during his time in the Dutch league, signifies his ongoing search for standout performers to further enhance his team's capabilities. Although this specific transfer did not come to fruition, it is evident that Pardew's hunger to strengthen and diversify his roster remains undiminished. With eyes now set on the future, we can certainly anticipate more astute and ambitious moves from the experienced manager, as he continues to scour the footballing world for talented individuals who will fortify his attacking arsenal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Zombies starts with the breaking news that the unidentified disease that is spreading across America leaves the sufferer with homicidal & cannibalistic tendencies... Travis Fontaine (C.S. Munro) & his teenage daughter Jenna (Bonny Giroux) listen to the radio as they drive along the isolated backwoods roads to try & escape the disease when Travis runs over a guy who I assume is meant to be a zombie. Slightly further down the road he stops to help Julia (Brinke Stevens) & her teenage daughter Carmilla (Maratama Carlson) who are waving at the side of the road, at this point there is also a third teenage girl named Tessa (Melanie Crystal) sitting in the back of Julia's car bound & gagged. To me this situation would seem strange but Travis, like the trooper he is, takes it all in his stride & agrees to 'take' Carmilla off Julia's hands &, well I don't know actually. So, with a complete stranger, Travis drives off leaving Julia & Tessa. Carmilla seems like a nice girl but she turns out to be a Vampire & she likes to bite people & turn them into Vampires, oh & she's partial to a bit of lesbianism too. Travis, Carmilla & Jenna continue to travel while some guy who calls himself The General (Peter Ruginis) who appears to be some sort of Vampire killer & probably has something to do with it all but the film is such a mess it doesn't really matter & I really don't know how to carry on this plot outline as my head hurts just thinking about it... Co-edited, co-executive produced, written & directed by the supremely untalented Vince D'Amato Vampires Vs. Zombies is one of the worst horror films ever & therefore one of the worst films ever period. The script by D'Amato was apparently based on a classic story entitled 'Carmilla' by Sheridan Le Fanu (he should sue) & is an absolute mess, the holes in the plot & logic are so big you could drive a tank through them! What is the disease that turns people into zombies? Why is Carmilla a Vampire? Who is Julia to her? Who the hell is The General? What does he want? Where are Travis & Jenna going? How can Travis run a man over & yet not have the slightest bit of human emotion over it? What's with the mental ward at the end? There are also some confusing & unnecessary dream sequences just to annoy the viewer even more. There are just so many things wrong with this film, the narrative doesn't make a blind bit of sense, the concept is terrible & never really explained properly plus it's incredibly boring. I have not one positive thing to say about Vampire Vs. Zombies, not one. Forget about any Vampires fighting Zombies because it just doesn't happen, tell me again why is this film called Vampires Vs. Zombies? Director D'Amato has served up one of the most incompetent, rubbishy, badly made, poorly thought out & excruciatingly painful viewing experiences ever made. Vampires Vs. Zombies really has no redeeming qualities at all, there is not one single aspect that I can praise. The gore is really fake looking, there are some blood splats which look like red water, some really cheap staking effects & a half decent climax where the zombies feast on Carmilla's & Jenna's intestines, this fairly gory scene is probably the best part of the whole wretched film but it only lasts for a couple of minutes & in no way makes up for the other turgid 85. The budget on Vampires Vs. Zombies must have been small, in fact did it even have a budget because most of it is set on a road in a couple of cars. This is one of the most badly made horror films it's been my misfortune to watch, the entire thing just sucks. The acting is predictably awful, & I mean awful. There isn't much else left to say, Vampires Vs. Zombies is easily one of the worst films ever made. The (V) next to the title on the IMDb's main page for Vampires Vs.

What is the sentiment of the following review? Love sushi so I decided to try this place out. Sad to say it was definitely disappointing and a waste of money. Yuck.","output":"The sentiment of the given review appears to be largely negative. One can analyze the sentiment by examining the language the reviewer uses to express their opinion. The reviewer starts by giving some context as to why they went to the restaurant, stating that they \\"love sushi.\\" This provides background information but does not carry a strong sentiment in itself. However, the rest of the review carries a strong negative sentiment. The reviewer then continues by saying they are \\"sad to say\\" that the restaurant was a disappointment. The phrase \\"sad to say\\" gives the impression that the reviewer is expressing genuine regret about their experience. Furthermore, the term \\"disappointing\\" directly conveys that the sushi restaurant didn't meet their expectations. This produces a negative sentiment, as it reflects dissatisfaction with their experience. In the next sentence, the reviewer describes the experience as a \\"waste of money.\\" This indicates that in the reviewer's opinion, the dining experience was not worth the price they paid. People generally view a waste of money as a strong negative point when evaluating any product or service, especially when it comes to dining out. This further contributes to the negative sentiment within the review. Lastly, the reviewer concludes their thoughts by using the word \\"yuck.\\" This word is a common exclamation used when expressing displeasure or disgust regarding taste. Its inclusion in the review strongly suggests a negative sentiment, as it shows the reviewer didn't enjoy the taste of the sushi, which is a crucial factor in any dining experience. In summary, the overall sentiment of the given review is negative. While the reviewer does provide context for their visit by expressing their love for sushi, their opinion of the restaurant itself is one of disappointment, regret, and dissatisfaction. Key phrases like \\"disappointing,\\" \\"waste of money,\\" and \\"yuck\\" emphasize the negative sentiment and paint a stark picture of their dining experience at the sushi restaurant."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The iRobot 510 PackBots, built by Massachusetts-based robotics firm iRobot Defense and Security, have previously served in the war in Iraq and are described as 'multi-mission, battle-tested' robots. They are set to be used during the construction of Olympic stadiums to help clear routes and hunt for explosives. Scroll down for video If communication to the","output":"robots is disrupted or lost, the PackBots are designed to immediately switch to autonomous mode, relying on built-in sensors and algorithms to continue their tasks with as minimal disruption as possible until communication can be re-established. This technology is crucial in ensuring the safety of construction workers, athletes, visitors, and officials during the high-profile events. The Brazilian government's investment in these advanced, cutting-edge robots showcases their commitment to provide a safe and secure environment for the Pope's visit and the Rio Olympics. The decision to utilize battle-tested robots is a strategic move, leveraging their proven reliability and success in past military operations and adapting their usage to fit the need for increased security at these significant global events. The iRobot 510 PackBots will be deployed in teams, working together to provide comprehensive coverage of the construction areas and event venues. With highly sensitive cameras and detection systems, the robots will be able to swiftly identify potential explosives or hazards and relay that information back to their human counterparts, allowing for a swift and efficient response in case of an emergency. In addition to their role in ensuring safety during construction and the events, the PackBots will also serve as a valuable training tool for Brazil's security forces. By working alongside the robots, Brazilian officers will gain valuable experience in working with advanced robotics technology, further enhancing the nation's overall security capabilities. Public reaction to the government's investment in the iRobot 510 PackBots has been largely positive, with many recognizing the need for increased security measures during such high-profile events. However, there have been concerns from some who view the use of these expensive military-grade robots as an unnecessary expenditure, considering the country's ongoing social and economic challenges. As the Pope's visit and the Rio Olympics draw nearer, the iRobot 510 PackBots will be subjected to a series of rigorous tests to ensure their effectiveness and reliability in this new environment. Through successful collaboration between the Brazilian government and iRobot Defense and Security, it is hoped that these versatile, state-of-the-art robots will become a vital component in creating a safe and secure atmosphere for all attendees of these events, while also showcasing Brazil's commitment to technological advancement and innovation on the global stage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Britain should have no fear of quitting the European Union, which could ‘open up opportunities’ for the country, a senior Tory minister says today. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, increasingly tipped as a future party leader, said he was not concerned about Britain’s prospects outside the EU if people voted to leave in a referendum. ‘I think it would open up opportunities. I am not afraid of that at all,’ he told the Daily Mail in a wide-ranging interview. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, increasingly tipped as a future party leader, said he was not concerned about Britain’s prospects outside the EU if people voted to leave in a referendum. He said it could 'open opportunities' The Tories’ pledge to give people their first say on Britain’s place in Europe for nearly 40 years – and a commitment to stop European human rights judges interfering in British law – will be centrepieces of the party’s pitch at next year’s general election. The Prime Minister will unveil plans to curtail the role of the controversial European Court of Human Rights in the UK at the final Conservative Party conference before the election, which starts this weekend in Birmingham. He is expected to pledge to scrap Labour’s Human Rights Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights. Mr Cameron will promise a mechanism which will establish pre-eminence for Britain’s Parliament and Supreme Court, allowing them to over-ride Strasbourg rulings, according to sources. Mr Javid backed the Prime Minister’s plan to renegotiate looser ties with Brussels before holding a referendum by the end of 2017. ‘We have reason to be confident,’ he said. ‘Look at what we have already achieved – getting us out of the EU bailout fund, reducing the budget of the EU, vetoing a treaty.’ But the Culture Secretary went further than Mr Cameron on the possibility of an exit, insisting Britain could prosper outside the EU. ‘If you said to me: “Are you worried or frightened or concerned that the British people might vote to leave?”, that doesn’t frighten me,’ Mr Javid said. The Culture Secretary backed Prime Minister David Cameron’s plan to renegotiate looser ties with Brussels before holding a referendum by 2017. ‘We should have a referendum on in/out, and if the British people decide Britain is better off outside, I would respect that decision. I think it would open up opportunities. I am not afraid of that at all.’ The European Convention on Human Rights, which is enshrined in British law by the Human Rights Act, has become increasingly unpopular with most Conservatives. Critics say the Strasbourg court has roamed way beyond its remit and created new rights never intended by the founders of the convention – such as its recent attempt to insist Britain must overturn a blanket ban on prisoners voting in elections. The ECHR has also been cited by dozens of people fighting deportation, who have argued its provisions mean they are entitled to various rights to be considered, including the right to a family life. Mr Cameron is understood to be convinced that much anti-European sentiment is due to Strasbourg rulings preventing the removal of foreign-born criminals and terror suspects, though the convention and the court in fact have nothing to do with Brussels. Two of the Government’s biggest defenders of the court – former Attorney General Dominic Grieve and veteran Cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke – were sacked in the Prime Minister’s Cabinet reshuffle this summer. ‘This issue is now going to be dealt with,’ said one government source. Tory strategists also hope a harder line on human rights laws will help win over disaffected voters considering backing Ukip. Highlights:","output":"1.

When he passed away, I took a job with the local school district. My client at the school had spastic quadriplegia. He could talk and was actually very smart, but he had no control over his arms or legs. He couldn’t walk. He was never going to walk. The law requires that special education students be put in the least restrictive classroom environment possible. Since this kid was smart and could communicate well, and wasn’t a discipline problem, he had all regular classes. His only accommodation was a one-on-one aide (me), and he was allowed to be late to classes without consequence because we sometimes had to stop in a special room, get him out of his chair, and stretch his legs a little. Basically ten minutes of physical therapy, two or three times per day. Anyway, since this kid was legally required to take all the classes a normal student his age would take, he had to take Physical Education (gym). And, legally, his aide (me) had to accommodate his participation in every class as much as possible, including gym. Most gym classes began with the students doing laps around the track, then participating in a team sport. He couldn’t do the team sport, but, according to the lawyers involved, he should participate in the “laps around the track” part of gym.

To begin with, let us break down the initial sentence: 1. \\"A small white dog is running through the dirt right on the outside of a patch of grass.\\"    This part of the sentence explicitly mentions a small white dog engaging in an activity outside, which indicates that there is at least one animal outdoors.     2. \\"A patch of grass where two people and another small black dog are playing.\\"    This portion of the sentence introduces two more subjects - the two people and an additional small black dog. While it explicitly states that the two people are outdoors (by mentioning that they're on a patch of grass), it is also reasonable to conclude that the small black dog is outdoors too, as it is involved in the activity of playing together with the two people on the patch of grass.     From these two segments of the sentence, we can identify at least two animals: the small white dog and the small black dog. Both of these animals are described as engaging in activities outside (running through the dirt and playing on a patch of grass, respectively). As a result, the assertion that \\"Some animals are outdoors.\\" can be validated as a true statement. In conclusion, given the information provided in the initial sentence and the context it establishes about the small white dog and the small black dog, we can confidently affirm that the sentence \\"Some animals are outdoors.\\" is an accurate and true statement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is the answer?","output":"Windsor, Neuschwanstein, and Blarney are three famous historical castles located in different countries across Europe. Each of these castles has its own history, architectural significance, and cultural impact. Let's explore each one in detail. 1. Windsor Castle: Windsor Castle is a royal residence in Windsor, England. It is the largest and oldest inhabited castle in the world and has been a home to the British monarchy for over 900 years. The castle’s history dates back to the 11th century when it was built by William the Conqueror as a defensive fortification. Since then, it has undergone numerous renovations and expansions under various monarchs. Windsor Castle serves both as a residence for the reigning monarch (currently Queen Elizabeth II) and as a popular tourist attraction. The castle covers an area of 13 acres, encompassing numerous buildings and fortifications. Among its notable features are the Round Tower, St. George's Chapel, the State Apartments, and Queen Mary's Dollhouse. The castle serves as a significant symbol of the British monarchy, showcases impressive architecture, and houses a vast collection of precious artworks and historic artifacts. 2. Neuschwanstein Castle: Neuschwanstein Castle is a 19th-century palace located in the Bavarian Alps, near the town of Füssen, Germany. It was commissioned by Ludwig II of Bavaria as a retreat and an homage to the composer Richard Wagner. The castle is a striking example of German Romantic architecture, which seeks to evoke a sense of fairytale enchantment. Designed by the architect Eduard Riedel and realized with the artistic input of stage designer Christian Jank, the castle’s construction began in 1869 and remained incomplete due to the king’s untimely death in 1886. Neuschwanstein features numerous towers, spires, and balconies, as well as elaborate interior decorations, including murals depicting scenes from Wagner's operas. Today, Neuschwanstein Castle is an iconic tourist destination, attracting millions of visitors worldwide. It has, in fact, inspired the design of the Disneyland's Sleeping Beauty Castle. 3. Blarney Castle: Blarney Castle is a medieval fortress situated in the village of Blarney, near Cork, Ireland. The current structure dates back to the 15th century, built by Cormac Laidir MacCarthy, the then Lord of Muscry. However, the history of the site can be traced back to earlier fortifications, with the first castle on the site built in the 10th century. Blarney Castle is world-renowned for housing the Blarney Stone, a limestone block that is believed to possess mystical qualities. According to legend, anyone who kisses the stone will be granted the \\"gift of gab\\"–the ability to speak eloquently and convincingly. Visitors take part in the ritual of kissing the stone by leaning backward over a gap on the castle's parapet. Apart from the Blarney Stone, the castle features intriguing architectural elements, such as the Badger Cave, the Poison Garden, and the battlements that provide breathtaking views of the castle grounds. In conclusion, Windsor, Neuschwanstein, and Blarney are three historically significant and architecturally fascinating castles located across Europe. Each castle embodies the distinct cultural characteristics, legends, and historical tales that continue to captivate the imaginations of visitors from around the world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: One of the primary symptoms that is so common with a malarial infection is a high fever, at least 102°F (38.9°C). It's also one of the first symptoms to appear as early as seven days (although usually between 10 – 15 days) after getting bitten by an infected mosquito. Often the fever comes and goes randomly. This is thought to be related to the malaria parasites transiently spreading into blood from the liver.  There are at least five types of Plasmodium parasites that infect people, although P. falciparum (mainly in Africa) and P. vivax (mainly in Latin America and Asia) are the most common and deadly. The fever and other initial symptoms may be mild and mimic less serious viral infections, such as the common cold and influenza. Usually symptoms don't appear for about two weeks after being bitten. The other primary symptom of malaria is severe shaking chills with intermittent periods of sweating. Again, shaking chills are typical of many other types of infections, but they are usually more pronounced and severe with malaria. They can cause teeth to chatter and even prevent sleep. When they're severe, the shaking can be mistaken for seizures. The chills from malaria are usually not remedied by blanket cover or by wearing warmer clothes.  Although the primary symptoms of malaria typically begin within a few weeks of being bitten by an infected mosquito, some types of malarial parasites can lie dormant in the body for up to a year or more.  Malarial symptoms are caused by the bites from female Anopheles mosquitoes, which inject the parasite into the host's bloodstream. The parasites then migrate to the liver where they lay dormant for a week or two before causing symptoms. Secondary and less specific symptoms of malaria are moderate-to-severe headaches, often combined with mild muscle aches. These secondary symptoms often occur a short while after the above-mentioned primary symptoms as the parasite needs a little more time to proliferate in the liver and spread around the body in the bloodstream. Headaches and muscle aches are also very common with most other infections, as well as from the bites of other insects and spiders.  The bites from female Anopheles mosquitoes are not very noticeable (a small, red, itchy bump), unlike the bites of some other insects and spiders that can cause similar symptoms. The initial headaches of malaria are typically dull in nature (like a tension headache), but as the parasites start to infect and destroy red blood cells, they can become pounding in nature (more like a migraine). The achy pain is usually most noticeable in the leg and back muscles because they are larger, more active and get more of the infected blood. Other non-specific secondary symptoms of malaria are vomiting and diarrhea, multiple times per day. They often occur in combination with each other, which mimics the initial symptoms of food poisoning and other bacterial infections. The main difference is that the vomiting/diarrhea caused by food poisoning fades away within a few days, whereas it can remain for a few weeks with malaria (depending on treatment).  Unlike the explosive and bloody diarrhea of some bacterial infections, particularly Shigella, there's usually no blood or severe cramping with malaria. Once the primary and secondary symptoms become noticeable, the malaria-causing parasites can be seen under a microscope from a drop of infected blood — especially if the specimen is stained with Giemsa stain. If the advancing primary and secondary symptoms don't prompt the infected person to seek medical attention and get treatment (which may not be possible in the developing world), then symptoms begin to appear that signify serious injury / damage to the body. When these advanced symptoms of malaria appear, the risk of health complications and death significantly increase.  Confusion, multiple convulsions, coma and neurological impairment indicate brain swelling and injury. Severe anemia, abnormal bleeding, deep labored breathing and respiratory distress indicate advanced blood infection and lung involvement. Jaundice (yellowish skin and eyes) is evidence of liver damage and dysfunction.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What singer was going to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman? , can you please find it?   During a Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert with other Neighbours cast members, Minogue performed \\"I Got You Babe\\" as a duet with actor John Waters, and \\"The Loco-Motion\\" as an encore. She was subsequently signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records in 1987. Her first single, \\"The Locomotion\\", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles charts and became the country's highest-selling single in the 1980s. She received the ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single. Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to England with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" while she waited outside the studio. The song reached number one in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Israel and Hong Kong. Minogue won her second consecutive ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single, and received a \\"Special Achievement Award\\". Minogue's debut album, Kylie was released in July 1988. The album was a collection of dance-oriented pop tunes and spent more than a year on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one. The album went gold in the United States, and the single, \\"The Locomotion\\", reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number one on the Canadian Singles Chart. The single \\"Got to Be Certain\\" became her third consecutive number one single on the Australian music charts. Later in the year, she left Neighbours to focus on her music career. Minogue also collaborated with Jason Donovan for the song \\"Especially for You\\", which peaked at number-one in the United Kingdom and in December 2014 sold its one millionth copy in the UK. Minogue was sometimes referred to as \\"the Singing Budgie\\" by her detractors over the coming years.

Sentence 1: The indigents served by the center won't be the only ones to benefit. Sentence 2: They will only help indigents. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"To determine if the second sentence is true given that the first sentence is true, let us analyze both sentences step-by-step. Step 1: Understand the meaning of each sentence. Sentence 1 states that \\"The indigents served by the center won't be the only ones to benefit.\\" This means that the center serves indigents, but they are not the only ones who will benefit from its services. Sentence 2 states, \\"They will only help indigents.\\" This means that the center only serves indigents and no other group. Step 2: Compare both sentences. Comparing both sentences, we see that Sentence 1 implies that there are other groups aside from indigents that may benefit from the center—a more inclusive perspective. On the other hand, Sentence 2 asserts that the center exclusively helps indigents—a more restrictive perspective. Step 3: Assess if the second sentence is true, given that the first sentence is true. Since Sentence 1 mentions that indigents are not the only ones who will benefit, this implies the existence of other groups that the center helps. Therefore, the second sentence, which states that the center only helps indigents, contradicts the information provided in Sentence 1. Conclusion: If the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is not true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Alexander II's death caused a great setback for the reform movement. One of his last ideas was to draft plans for an elected parliament, or Duma, which were completed the day before he died but not yet released to the Russian people. In a matter of 48 hours, Alexander II planned to release his plan for the duma to the Russian people. Had he lived, Russia might have followed a path to constitutional monarchy instead of the long road of oppression that defined his successor's reign. The first action Alexander III took after his father's death was to tear up those plans. A Duma would not come into fruition until 1905, when Alexander II's grandson, Nicholas II, commissioned the Duma following extreme pressure on the monarchy as a result of the Russian Revolution of 1905. The assassination triggered major suppression of civil liberties in Russia, and police brutality burst back in full force after experiencing some restraint under the reign of Alexander II, whose death was witnessed first-hand by his son, Alexander III, and his grandson, Nicholas II, both future emperors who vowed not to have the same fate befall them. Both of them used the Okhrana to arrest protestors and uproot suspected rebel groups, creating further suppression of personal freedom for the Russian people. A series of anti-Jewish pogroms and antisemitic legislation, the May Laws, were yet another result. Finally, the tsar's assassination also inspired anarchists to advocate \\"'propaganda by deed'--the use of a spectacular act of violence to incite revolution.\\" With construction starting in 1883, the Church of the Savior on Blood was built on the site of Alexander's assassination and dedicated in his memory.  Question: \\"Who was the founder of the idea for an elected parliament in Russia?\\" Answer: \\"Nicholas II\\" Is this answer to the question correct? pick from the following. 1. no. 2. yes.","output":"1. no. The correct answer should be Alexander II, as he was the one who drafted plans for an elected parliament or Duma. Though a Duma was eventually commissioned by Nicholas II in 1905, the idea and initial plans were from Alexander II before his death."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"This review can be considered as depicting the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer has expressed dissatisfaction and frustration with the product, stating that it has never worked in their experience. The title summarises their sentiment with the simple phrase \\"never worked.\\" This negative experience has the potential to affect other potential buyers' perception of the product and discourage them from purchasing it. Additionally, the fact that the reviewer claims to have rarely faced problems with software and hardware installations implies that they possess a certain level of technical competency. Therefore, their inability to get the product to work may suggest that there could be inherent issues or complications in the product's design or compatibility. The specific mention of the product not working with their Yamaha keyboard and Mac computer further highlights the limitations the product could have in terms of compatibility with particular hardware brands and operating systems.

Math Problem Solve 40*m + 35*m - 9 = 76*m for m.","output":"To solve the equation 40*m + 35*m - 9 = 76*m for m, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left side of the equation, we have two terms with m: 40*m and 35*m. Add these two terms: 40*m + 35*m = 75*m. Now, the equation is: 75*m - 9 = 76*m. Step 2: Move all terms with m to one side and constants to the other side. We want to get all terms with m on one side of the equation and all constants on the other side. To do this, we'll first subtract 75*m from both sides of the equation to move it to the right side: 75*m - 9 - 75*m = 76*m - 75*m. This simplifies to: -9 = m. Step 3: Check the answer. Substitute m with the value we found, which is -9, to check if the given equation holds true. 40*(-9) + 35*(-9) - 9 = 76*(-9) -360 - 315 - 9 = -684 -684 = -684 The equation holds true, which confirms that the value of m is indeed -9.

Q:Given the following context:  The inaugural games were held, on the orders of the Roman Emperor Titus, to celebrate the completion in AD 80 (81 according to some sources) of the Colosseum, then known as the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium). Vespasian began construction of the amphitheatre around AD 70 and it was completed by his son Titus who became emperor following Vespasian's death in AD 79. Titus' reign began with months of disasters – including the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, a fire in Rome, and an outbreak of plague – he inaugurated the completion of the structure with lavish games that lasted for more than one hundred days, perhaps in an attempt to appease the Roman public and the gods. Little literary evidence survives of the activities of the gladiatorial training and fighting (ludi). They appear to have followed the standard format of the Roman games: animal entertainments in the morning session, followed by the executions of criminals around midday, with the afternoon session reserved for gladiatorial combats and recreations of famous battles. The animal entertainments, which featured creatures from throughout the Roman Empire, included extravagant hunts and fights between different species. Animals also played a role in some executions which were staged as recreations of myths and historical events. Naval battles formed part of the spectacles but whether these took place in the amphitheatre or on a lake that had been specially constructed by Augustus is a topic of debate among historians. Only three contemporary or near-contemporary accounts of the games survive. The works of Suetonius and Cassius Dio focus on major events, while Martial provides some fragments of information on individual entertainments and the only detailed record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena known to survive: the fight between Verus and Priscus.  answer the following question:  What games lasted for more than one hundred days?
