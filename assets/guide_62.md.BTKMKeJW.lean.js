No Answer:","output":"(2). No Step 1: Understand the question The question asks if the answer \\"reproduction\\" is the right term for what sense of smell impacts in an animal, given that it impacts their survival. Step 2: Evaluate the relationship between survival and reproduction Survival and reproduction are both essential aspects of an animal's life. While survival ensures the animal's ability to live, reproduction ensures the continuity of its species. Step 3: Determine the role of sense of smell in survival and reproduction The sense of smell in animals plays a significant role in their survival, as it helps them find food, avoid predators, and locate mates. This supports the notion that the sense of smell impacts an animal's survival. However, it is important to recognize that the sense of smell also impacts an animal's reproduction. Animals rely on their sense of smell to locate and identify suitable mates, which is crucial for successful reproduction. Step 4: Provide the justification for the answer Although sense of smell does impact an animal's survival, it is not accurate to say that the right answer to the question is \\"reproduction\\". The sense of smell affects various aspects of an animal's life, and reproduction is only one of them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Make the content of each page as a point with \\" project number \\". Creating a beautiful and effective PowerPoint presentation involves a well-thought-out process. It starts with formulating a detailed outline of your presentation. This is usually done on paper at first and the more detailed it is, the better. Your outline should chronologically detail the flow of your presentation with each title representing a page on your PowerPoint. Once you have a solid outline, open PowerPoint and avoid using any templates at this point. The focus should be on organizing your ideas and content. Under each title or subject in your PowerPoint, write out or copy content suitable for that particular title. This involves using appropriate graphics, pictures, charts, videos, or any other relevant multimedia that would enhance your presentation. Revise the wording and refine your points. Each slide should not be saturated with too much information. Rather, it should serve as a project number to each specific point or topic in your presentation.  The process of drafting your PowerPoint requires revisiting your progress continually. If necessary, modify your slides to reflect any changes or advancements in your storyline. It's advisable to create more detailed sub-steps once you have a basic presentation structure.  Avoid stuffing your slides with information; simplicity is key in PowerPoint presentations. The slides are meant to guide your audience through your presentation, not provide every detail. The detailed information should come from your narration.  Once your content is well organized, you can then focus on the aesthetics. Make your slides visually appealing but not overbearing. Use short, clear, and concise bullet points, and make sure your font size is big enough to be read from the back of the room. Stick to a limited color palette for consistency and to maintain a professional appearance.  Remember, practice makes perfect. Once your presentation is ready, rehearse it several times to ensure a smooth delivery. Your confidence and familiarity with the material will shine through, resulting in a beautifully made, efficient PowerPoint presentation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He's complained about not getting proper medical treatment while in prison. He says that because of the lack of treatment, he no longer has full use of his right arm. He said he and his colleagues -- Al Jazeera correspondent","output":"Peter Greste and producer Baher Mohamed -- are being targeted not for any crime, but because they were \\"just doing their jobs\\" as journalists, reporting on various stories in Egypt to keep the public informed. Fahmy vehemently maintains that his unyielding commitment to truthful and objective reporting stands as testament to the fact that the charges against him and his fellow journalists are unfounded. He, Greste and Mohamed are facing charges of promoting false news in favor of the Muslim Brotherhood, which Egypt declared a terrorist organization after President Mohamed Morsi's ouster. All three have denied the accusations, insisting that their work was solely focused on providing accurate and unbiased information to their viewers. Al Jazeera has also vehemently denied any wrongdoing, calling the charges baseless and unjust, and has been working tirelessly to secure the release of their reporters. Their trial has drawn sharp criticism from the international community, who argue that the case is just another example of the Egyptian government attempting to stifle press freedom and crack down on dissent in the country. The United Nations, the European Union, and other global organizations have all expressed concern over the condition of press freedom in Egypt, urging the government to drop the charges and release Fahmy, Greste, and Mohamed. Despite the ongoing pressure, the Egyptian government has remained steadfast in their pursuit of the case. Fahmy and his colleagues have spent over 400 days behind bars, as their legal battle continues to unfold. The case has been marked by numerous adjournments, causing further frustration to their friends and families who are eager to see them released. Fahmy's health remains a significant concern, as the deteriorating condition of his shoulder is a constant reminder of the inadequate medical care he has received while in prison. Human rights groups and medical professionals have advocated for Fahmy to receive proper treatment, emphasizing the irreversible consequences of such neglect. As he and his fellow journalists continue to fight for their freedom, their case serves as a stark reminder of the erosion of press freedom in certain parts of the world. The global community of journalists and press freedom advocates remain committed to their cause, hopeful that one day they will be released and reunited with their loved ones, and that this dark chapter in Egypt's history will come to an end. The unwavering support and solidarity from around the world for Fahmy, Greste, and Mohamed demonstrate the vital importance of a free and independent press in maintaining a just and democratic society."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Haseena Aziz arranged to go on the 'date' in order to give her 29-year-old boyfriend Afahan Hussain a chance to rob the victim. The 28-year-old tempted the man to meet her in a park in Birmingham by flirting with him in a series of messages over the social-networking site. Haseena Aziz, 28, pictured left, arranged to go on a 'date' with a man in Birmingham so she and her boyfriend Afahan Hussain, 29, pictured right, could threaten him with a meat cleaver and rob him. The unnamed 25-year-old victim caught a train to Birmingham from his home in London in June this year in the belief Aziz wanted to start a relationship with him. He took a seat on a bench in parkland near a fly-over in Hockley, Birmingham, expecting to meet Aziz for a date. Instead, Hussain - who has a gold tooth - appeared from behind and punched and headbutted the defenceless victim. He then held a meat cleaver to his face and demanded his phone and cash. The court heard how Aziz laughed as she watched the attack and even waded in by kicking the man in the groin. The pair later sent texts to the victim mocking him for falling for their set-up. West Midlands Police launched an investigation. The pair were found through phone and social media enquiries. They were charged with robbery and both found guilty at Birmingham Crown Court. The pair - who later sent texts to the victim mocking him for falling for their set-up - were convicted at Birmingham Crown Court of robbery. Recorder Oscar Del Fabbro. jailed Hussain for a total of 12 years after he was found. guilty of the robbery, as well as a separate crime of wounding with intent to cause GBH.

'The victim suffered significant blood loss, nerve damage and has lost sensation on the left side of his face. It was an outrageous attack. 'Anyone who carries a knife in public is potentially putting themselves and others in danger and can expect to be jailed, even if they don't strike out with it in anger.

When Police Superintendent Benting tries to intervene, Jack Drake, another passenger, knocks him out to save him from being shot. The thieves force the pilot to land so they can dump the passengers. However, the men find the diamonds have already been stolen by someone else (Drake).  Drake is a sort of modern-day Robin Hood. He donates the proceeds of his latest robbery to fund the stalled construction of the \\"New Social Institute\\". He even writes a book, \\"Crackerjack\\": The true story of my exploits., which becomes a bestseller. Everybody is reading it, including the people at Scotland Yard and Baroness Von Haltz, and wondering if it is fact or fiction. The baroness tells her maid Annie that certain passages somehow remind her of Drake, who broke her heart.  By coincidence, she is residing in the same hotel as Drake. He goes to see her, but she does not forgive him for leaving her without a word in Berlin. He explains that he was forced to leave suddenly, but she is not mollified. Meanwhile, Drake instructs Burdge, his secretary, to send a cheque for £10,000 to the Buckingham Hospital for a new wing, even though Burdge informs him he is overdrawn at the bank. Drake tells him that the wealthy Mrs. Humbold's pearls will provide ample funds. The Humbolds are hosting a masquerade ball that night, and the baroness will be there. At the ball, part of the entertainment is a group called the \\"Four Gangsters\\", who have been tied up and replaced by a gang of real gangsters, the same thieves from the aeroplane caper. Sculpie, their leader, kills an unarmed man who foolishly tries to resist. Afterward, however, Sculpie is furious to learn that the pearls he took from Mrs. Humbold are fakes.

Please briefly summarize this news article: 5 things that couldn't happen in 'Gravity' (CNN) -- As far as fans are concerned, \\"Gravity\\" is out of this world. The Sandra Bullock/George Clooney space thriller set an October opening weekend record, surpassing \\"Paranormal Activity 3's\\" 52.6 million debut in 2011, according to EW. Many critics also hailed the film, which centers around characters being set adrift in space. But some in the science community have taken exception to some of the facts presented. Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson took to Twitter over the weekend to offer several \\"Mysteries of #Gravity,\\" including \\"The film #Gravity should be renamed 'Angular Momentum.' \\" He points what the film got wrong, from the fact that Bullock's hair didn't free float to why she, as a medical doctor, was on the mission to start with. So here we offer 5 things that couldn't happen in \\"Gravity.\\" Word to the wise: Stop reading now if you have an issue with spoilers (Seriously. You have been warned). 1. The way the shuttle travels NASA expert Michael A. Interbartolo III didn't even have to wait for the film to come out to dispute this. When the trailer premiered, he wrote that the relative motion of the shuttle in the film appears to be off for the chain of events that follow. \\"The way I am seeing it, the shuttle was wings level, payload bay up (Z), right wing into the orbital velocity vector (X direction of travel), nose in Y,\\" wrote Interbartolo, who said he flew the shuttle in Mission Control for 11 years. \\"The Micrometeoroid and Orbital Debris [MMOD] (though most were not really micro Meteoroid) impact puts it into a roll about Y with it still traveling in the velocity vector X, and why are the Forward and Aft reaction control jets not firing to damp the ramp since they were intact in the trailer?\\" Translation for you non-science types out there: It's more movie magic than actual science that has the shuttle getting smacked with debris and then heading in the direction it is set. Sandra Bullock keeps defying gravity with her career 2. Rendezvousing in space is not as easy -- or as quick -- as the film makes it appear Bullock plays Ryan Stone, a medical engineer on her first mission in space who gets set adrift after an accident. Part of the action involves her trying to make her way back to a fellow astronaut, Clooney's Matt Kowalski. But according to Interbartolo, it's a wonder that Clooney's character doesn't get \\"shredded\\" by all the debris floating around after the incident, let alone that the pair manage to link up again. \\"If it is just her and Clooney, assuming she somehow got back to him after being flung away on the (Remote Manipulator System) free floating trying to get to the space station without a vehicle, that seems unlikely, unless the two orbits just magically intersect at the exact right time for them to be anywhere near the (International Space Station),\\" he said. What Buzz Aldrin thinks of 'Gravity' 3. Kowalski's equipment is outdated Kowalski flies around on a way-cool jet pack that helps him get to Stone when she is in need. Writing for WRAL's science blog, NASA/JPL Solar System Ambassador program volunteer Tony Rice notes that \\"The Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) Clooney's character jets around on in the opening scenes does exist but was used only on three early shuttle missions and not since 1984. \\"You can see space flown MMUs today hanging above space-flown shuttle orbiters at the Air and Space Museum and Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex,\\" Rice wrote. \\"The MMU was capable only of short bursts to move astronauts around the shuttle, not crossing distances portrayed in the film and certainly not in the time presented. But it was certainly a cool way to get Bullock and Clooney into the second act.\\" Read this story or we give away the ending 4. Bullock's astronaut is way more adept than she should be After all the space walking, being flung around and dodging debris, Bullock's Stone is still able to navigate not just one but two spacecraft from other countries: a Russian Soyuz and a Chinese Shenzhou. It's amazing, given that Stone points out that she was not the best in training on the United States spacecraft. \\"She handles both ships with surprising deftness considering she was only lightly trained on the Soyuz and not at all on the Shenzhou,\\" Jeffrey Kluger wrote for Time magazine. \\"And throughout the movie, she and Clooney spend a fair bit of time getting whacked around in space, grabbing onto this or that rail or tether on the shuttle or ISS only at the last second to avoid pinwheeling off into the void. In truth, pressurized space gloves are murderously hard to manipulate, providing only limited grip at best and leaving astronauts' hands cold and very painful after a day of work. Making the kinds of one-handed Cirque du Soleil catches Clooney and Bullock accomplish would be impossible.\\" How Bullock prepared for her role 5. The Hubble, the International Space Station and a Chinese space station are not neighbors In the film, Bullock just needs to hop from space station to space station in order to find a refuge from debris and to make it home to Earth. But as the New York Times pointed out, that's not as easy as it looks. Photos: Sandra Bullock: America's sweetheart \\"As we recall from bitter memory, the Hubble and the space station are in vastly different orbits,\\" Dennis Overbye wrote. \\"Getting from one to the other requires so much energy that not even space shuttles had enough fuel to do it. The telescope is 353 miles high, in an orbit that keeps it near the Equator; the space station is about 100 miles lower, in an orbit that takes it far north, over Russia.\\" \\"To have the movie astronauts Matt Kowalski (Mr. Clooney) and Ryan Stone (Ms. Bullock) zip over to the space station would be like having a pirate tossed overboard in the Caribbean swim to London.\\" The film's director, Alfonso Cuarón, seemed fully prepared for the criticism after \\"Gravity's\\" release. \\"This is not a documentary,\\" the director told collectSPACE.com. \\"It is a piece of fiction.\\"","output":"In the movie \\"Gravity,\\" starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, there are some issues regarding the portrayal of scientific facts. Some of the inaccuracies the film presents include: 1. The way the shuttle travels: The shuttle's movements in the film have been deemed unrealistic by NASA expert Michael A. Interbartolo III, who claims that the way the shuttle gets impacted by debris and heads in a particular direction is more movie magic than actual science. 2. Rendezvousing in space: In the movie, Bullock's character attempts to make her way back to Clooney's character. However, Interbartolo points out the improbability of this scenario, especially considering the debris floating around and the difficulty of two orbits intersecting at the right moment. 3. Kowalski's (Clooney's character) equipment is outdated: Kowalski uses a Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) to fly around. However, this type of equipment was only used on three early shuttle missions and has not been used since 1984. 4. Bullock's astronaut is more adept than she should be: Despite her character admitting to struggling in training, Bullock's Ryan Stone is portrayed as being able to efficiently navigate two spacecraft from other countries. 5. The distance between space stations: In the film, Bullock's character hops from one space station to another. In reality, the Hubble, the International Space Station, and a Chinese space station are not close neighbors, making this an unrealistic scenario. Despite these inaccuracies, it is important to remember that \\"Gravity\\" is a work of fiction, not a documentary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - kitchen - plate - dinning - stomach - pantry  I believe the correct choice is \\"plate\\", here's why: A:","output":"Indeed, the correct choice is \\"plate.\\" When we consider the process of preparing and consuming food, there are several stages involved, including purchasing, storing, preparing, and serving. The last place food is typically found before being eaten is on a plate or other serving dish. Here's a brief overview of the stages mentioned and how they relate to the given options: 1. Pantry: This is where food is stored prior to being prepared. Pantries typically house dry goods, canned goods, and other non-perishable food items. Refrigerators and freezers play a similar role for perishables. 2. Kitchen: This is where food is prepared for consumption, usually by cooking, baking, or otherwise assembling ingredients. The kitchen is equipped with appliances, utensils, and cookware to help create various dishes. 3. Dining: This refers to the act of eating food, whether at a dining table, a restaurant, or elsewhere. This stage comes after food has been served on a plate. 4. Plate: This is the final stage where food is presented, portioned, and consumed. Plates, bowls, and other serving dishes hold the food so that it can be eaten with utensils or by hand. 5. Stomach: This is not a place where food is found before being eaten, but rather the first destination during the digestion process after the food has been consumed. In summary, the last place food is before being eaten is on a plate, where it is typically presented and portioned before consumption. The plate serves as the final stage between food preparation in the kitchen and the act of dining, during which the food is consumed and later digested in the stomach."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On the left-hand side (LHS), we have two terms containing g: -646g and -831g. Let's combine these terms: LHS = (-646 - 831) * g = -1477 * g = -1477g On the right-hand side (RHS), we have two terms containing g, -458g and 1383g. Let's combine these terms too: RHS =(-458 + 1383) * g + 33628 = 925 * g + 33628 = 925g + 33628 Now, the given equation becomes: -1477g = 925g + 33628 Step 2: Move all terms containing g to one side of the equation. To isolate g, we will move the 925g term from RHS to LHS by subtracting 925g from both sides of the equation: -1477g - 925g = 33628 Combine the terms containing g on the LHS: (-1477 - 925) * g = -2402 * g = -2402g Now, the equation becomes: -2402g = 33628 Step 3: Solve for g by dividing both sides by the coefficient of g, which is -2402. g = 33628 / -2402 g ≈ -14 So the solution to the equation -646*g - 831*g = -458*g + 1383*g + 33628 for g is g ≈ -14."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He found it's better to compare them if he needs to learn more about their characteristics. To make things easier, he labeled the weather of his city as char A. Then he labeled the climate of this city as char B. Once finished with learning their characteristics, Rob focused on climate change issues. For that, he labeled the climate of present time as char C and climate just before industrial revolution as char D.  But I can use this background: Weather conditions include air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. Weather is temporary. People in many states have the joke, \\"if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes and it will change.\\" One way to change the weather is to have a different air mass move over the region. Interactions between air masses bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes form along a front. A front is where air masses meet. Fronts can bring about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather. Weather prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due in part to information from satellites. Climate is the long-term average of weather. The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position relative to the atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the same climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a climate zone create a unique biome. Earth's climate has changed throughout the planet's history. Earth was frigid at the end of the Pleistocene ice age, but has been warming since then. Since the Industrial Revolution the pace of warming has increased. In the past few decades the rate has really intensified. This is related to greenhouse gas emissions, primary from fossil fuel burning. The destruction of forests also increasing warming. The effects of global warming are already being seen. Treaties and voluntary actions are needed to reduce emissions to lessen the amount of global warming that will take place in the future.  What is an answer for this question: Does char A represent longer or shorter time period than char B? A:","output":"Char A represents a shorter time period than char B because char A refers to weather, which is temporary and changes frequently, while char B refers to climate, which is the long-term average of weather."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review title: Literate thriller that probes contemporary Russia Product review: I confess that I know very little about what actually is going on in Russia today, so I cannot assess whether or not Robert Harris' appraisal of conditions there is accurate. However, his fictional depiction of the enduring appeal of Stalinism as a possible threat to the (so-called) democratic reforms in Russian society is certainly provocative, and his insights into the internal workings of Stalin's mind and the terrors of his regime make for fascinating reading.There are some sections of the book that drag a bit, but overall, Harris succeeds in creating a slow buildup of tension that keeps the reader turning the pages right up until the final sentence. His depiction of his characters and of geographical locations is skillful and convincing, and overall, the book is impressively well-written. For people interested in historical fiction related to Soviet and Russian history, this book definitely makes for a fine \\"summer read.\\" The answer to this question is:","output":"The given review would likely increase the chances of you buying the product if you are interested in historical fiction related to Soviet and Russian history. The review is predominantly positive, highlighting the book's provocative nature, insights into Stalin's regime, well-written narrative, and the author's skill in creating tension and describing characters and locations.

Premise: \\"A pleasant way to enjoy the lake is to take a trip on the Victorian steamer Gondola.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The Gondolas on the lakes are powered by petroleum.\\" true?","output":"Based on the given premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis \\"The Gondolas on the lakes are powered by petroleum\\" is true. The premise states that the vehicle in question is a \\"Victorian steamer Gondola,\\" implying that the Gondola is an older, Victorian-era vessel powered by steam, not petroleum. While it is possible that some Gondolas on lakes are powered by petroleum, the specific Gondola mentioned in the premise is not. The Victorian era (1837 - 1901) was a period of great innovation and change in terms of transportation technology. While steam power was the dominant form of energy for vehicles on land and water, the use of petroleum (and its derivatives for powering engines) was still in its early stages. Steam-powered engines generally relied on the combustion of coal or wood to heat water and generate steam, which would then drive the engine's pistons, generating the motion necessary to propel the vehicle. The Gondola mentioned in the premise is a Victorian steamer or a steam-powered vessel from this era, possibly designed with a paddlewheel propulsion system and a steam engine. This style of Gondola lacks any reference to using petroleum as a power source, which is a more contemporary approach to fueling engines. Additionally, utilizing petroleum as a fuel source would not have been representative of the Victorian period Gondola and could potentially disregard the historical accuracy and the authentic experience that the vessel may provide to passengers. In summary, based solely on the premise given, we cannot support the hypothesis that the Gondolas on the lakes are powered by petroleum. The Victorian steamer Gondola, as described, would likely be powered by steam rather than petroleum, aligning with the technology and practices during the Victorian era. While it is not impossible that other Gondolas on lakes are petroleum-powered, the specific Gondola mentioned in the premise is not."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Where did the Celts who settled in Galatia pass through? Is \\"The Celts who settled in Galatia came through Thrace under the leadership of Leotarios and Leonnorios circa 270 BC.\\" the correct answer?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"The Celts who settled in Galatia came through Thrace under the leadership of Leotarios and Leonnorios circa 270 BC.\\" is partly correct, but it does not encompass the entire geographical trajectory or provide all relevant historical context. The Celts who settled in Galatia were part of a larger group of Celtic tribes that migrated from central and western Europe in various stages throughout the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. These tribes had earlier dominions in areas now corresponding to modern-day France, Germany, Belgium, and Britain. Their initial migration took them through the Balkan Peninsula, where they caused significant cultural and political changes to existing populations. Their first known encounter was with the Macedonians in 279 BC, where the Celtic tribes, led by Brennus, attempted to plunder the rich city of Delphi. They were ultimately defeated, but in the process, they established themselves as a formidable force. Following Brennus' defeat, the Celts divided into smaller groups and continued their migration across the Balkan Peninsula. One of these groups, led by Leotarios and Leonnorios, aimed to establish a new home in the region known as Thrace, which was inhabited by Thracian tribes. Thrace, located in modern-day southeastern Europe, mainly encompassed territories in present-day Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey. Passing through Thrace, Leotarios and Leonnorios' group defeated the Thracian king Cavaros in 278 BC. After this victory, the Celts moved eastward and crossed the Bosporus Strait into Asia Minor (now modern-day Turkey). At the time, the region was under the control of the declining Seleucid Empire. Upon reaching Asia Minor, the Celtic group was offered a truce by Nicomedes I, the King of Bithynia. He offered them land in exchange for military support against his opponents. This region, later known as Galatia, comprised parts of the ancient territories of Phrygia, Lycaonia, and Cappadocia. Thus, the Celts who settled in Galatia did pass through Thrace, adding significantly to their journey from central and western Europe. This was an essential part of their odyssey, which ultimately culminated in the founding of Galatia circa 270 BC. It is important to understand that the migration and establishment of the Celtic tribes in Galatia were complex and multi-faceted, rather than just a single event or passage through Thrace."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For much of the past decade, patient numbers have been rising as would be expected with an ageing population. But since 2010, the numbers have levelled off - with just one in eight areas now doing more hips and knees and one in five seeing rises in cataracts. It comes amid mounting pressures on the health service. The challenges facing A&E units have been well documented, but reports have also been emerging that non-emergency care is being squeezed too. These findings - to be published on Monday in Dr Foster's annual hospital guide - provide perhaps the most comprehensive picture yet of what is happening. The health care analysts looked at the number of operations being carried out for the three types of procedures - among the most life-enhancing done by the NHS - for the past decade. It found virtually no change in the overall numbers over the past two years with the total numbers hovering around the 475,000 mark each year. Hip replacements were the only treatment out of the three that were still going up - although the rate of increase has slowed. Meanwhile, the number of cataract operations is at its lowest level for five years and 2012-13 saw the first fall in knee replacements for a decade. The review also provided details of what local areas were up to by looking at the individual figures for the 200-plus clinical commissioning groups which are now in charge of local health budgets. The data showed that just 27 (13%) areas saw a significant rise in knee replacements over the past two years, 27 (13%) a rise for hip replacements and 40 (19%) a rise for cataracts. Roger Taylor, co-founder of Dr Foster, said the findings suggested the squeeze on spending was having an impact on these \\"highly effective\\" treatments. \\"There has been a sharp slow-down in activity. We are seeing some operations fall when normally we see them increasing by 4%, 5% or 6% a year.\\" Postcode search: Find out how your area is doing The review will also highlight other areas of concern. Dr Foster analysed data on what it called \\"ineffective operations\\". These include procedures such as tonsillectomies and knee washouts where the benefits are marginal.

These procedures are largely due to the aging population, and the number of patients undergoing these surgeries has been rising for most of the past decade. However, since 2010, the growth has leveled off, with only one in eight areas now seeing increased hip and knee replacements and one in five areas experiencing a rise in cataract surgeries. The study reveals that the total number of these surgeries had hardly changed over the past two years, remaining around 475,000 operations each year. This stagnation in growth is thought to be a result of increased pressure on the NHS (National Health Service) and limitations on healthcare spending.  Hip replacements are the only procedure of the three still seeing an increase in numbers, though the rate of growth has slowed down. On the other hand, cataract operations are now at their lowest numbers in five years, and 2012-13 saw the first decrease in knee replacements in a decade. The data also showed that: - 27 areas (13%) saw a significant rise in knee replacements over the past two years - 27 areas (13%) saw a rise for hip replacements - 40 areas (19%) experienced a rise for cataract surgeries Roger Taylor, co-founder of Dr. Foster, believes the stagnating numbers suggest that spending constraints are affecting these crucial treatments. He notes that there has been a sharp slowdown in activity, as some surgeries are no longer increasing at their usual 4%-6% yearly rate. The study also looked at data on \\"ineffective operations,\\" such as tonsillectomies and knee washouts, which have marginal benefits. The numbers of these procedures have fallen by 8% in the past five years, yet there are still 124 areas where their use has increased since 2010-11. Medical professionals have expressed concerns about the situation. Colin Howie, Vice President of the British Orthopaedic Association, views the findings as \\"very concerning\\" and believes that attempts to save money in the short term will cost the NHS and society in the long term. These operations are seen as highly effective, restoring mobility and reducing disability for patients, yet the research shows that vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and poor, are most likely to miss out on these procedures. A spokesperson for NHS England emphasized the need to be cautious when drawing conclusions from the data presented. Although these procedures are usually considered effective, they can also be overused, and it's important to analyze the reasons behind the numbers before making definitive claims about their impact on healthcare."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Title: D.O.A. Movie plot: Frank Bigelow (Edmond O'Brien) begins his tale by walking into a Los Angeles police station and telling a detective \\"I want to report a murder... mine.\\" Oddly, the police almost seem to have been expecting him and already know who he is since there has been an APB on him since yesterday.A flashback begins with Bigelow in his hometown of Banning, California where he is an accountant and notary public. He decides to take a one-week vacation in San Francisco, but this does not sit well with Paula Gibson (Pamela Britton), his confidential secretary and girlfriend, as he does not want her to accompany him.Bigelow meets and accompanies a group of randy men from a sales convention on a night on the town. At a \\"jive\\" nightclub called \\"The Fisherman\\", unnoticed by Bigelow, a stranger swaps his drink for another. (The nightclub scene includes one of the earliest depictions of the Beat sub-culture). The next morning, Bigelow feels ill. He visits a doctor at the general hospital, where tests reveal he swallowed a poison called \\"luminous toxin\\" for which there is no antidote. A second opinion confirms the grim diagnosis, and the other doctor implies that the poisoning must have been deliberate. Bigelow remembers his drink tasted strange. He flees from the hospital in a panic, wondering who poisoned him and why.With just a day or two to live at most, Bigelow sets out to untangle the events behind his impending death, interrupted occasionally by phone calls from Paula, whom never finds out about the predicament that he is in. Paula provides the first clue: a man named Eugene Philips who had urgently been trying to contact Bigelow by phone for the past two days has died, purportedly a suicide. Bigelow travels to Philips' import-export company in Los Angeles, meeting a variety of suspicious characters.

Bob liked herbal tea a lot more than adderall because the","output":"natural benefits it offered not only provided a soothing sensation but also a plethora of health advantages that were not accompanied by the unwanted side effects often experienced with stimulant medications like Adderall. Herbal teas have been consumed for centuries across different cultures worldwide, and they are known for their numerous healing properties. Bob preferred herbal tea over Adderall as he discovered that these natural infusions were packed with antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, which helped to boost his immune system, maintain overall health, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Furthermore, many herbal teas have calming and stress-relieving effects, such as chamomile, lavender, and lemon balm. These teas aid in relaxation, promote better sleep, and help reduce anxiety, which is especially important for individuals like Bob who struggled with the stimulating and sometimes unnerving experience of taking Adderall. On the other hand, Adderall is a prescription medication used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. It is a stimulant that works by increasing the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, which enhances focus, alertness, and impulse control in people with ADHD. While Adderall can be highly effective for some individuals, it comes with a range of potential side effects, including insomnia, dry mouth, loss of appetite, headaches, and anxiety. Long-term use of Adderall also raises concerns about the risk of dependence and addiction, making many people, like Bob, wary of using it as a long-term solution. Additionally, Adderall can also interact with other medications or existing health conditions, causing more severe side effects or complications. For those who are sensitive or have negative reactions to stimulants, herbal teas serve as a gentler, more natural alternative that comes without the risk of dependency or harmful interactions. Bob's preference for herbal tea over Adderall is a testament to the rise in popularity of natural therapies, which may prove to be a more sustainable and healthier choice for long-term wellness. As each individual's needs and preferences differ, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before making any decisions on which treatment options might be best for your situation. However, for Bob, the benefits of herbal tea far outweighed those of Adderall, especially since they provided him with a sense of well-being and comfort without introducing any harsh or harmful side effects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ensure the scene is stable and securely assembled to avoid any mishaps or damage.

(CNN) -- A 22-year-old man from Pakistan hopes to soon swim the English Channel with an American friend -- but first he's got to navigate the currents of bureaucracy. College teammates David Gatz (left) and Usman Javaid want to swim the English Channel for charity. Usman Javaid, an Ohio college student who has won national swimming titles in his native Pakistan, wants to swim the channel with his best friend, David Gatz, a fellow member of the swim team at Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio. They want to honor their international friendship by working together to accomplish a great feat: a relay across the English Channel. They also hope to raise money for charity. \\"They weren't satisfied I was going to","output":"return to Pakistan after the swim,\\" Javaid told CNN in an interview. \\"They were concerned I might try to remain in the UK illegally.\\" Despite having won several national swimming titles and being an exemplary student at his university, Javaid encountered unforeseen hurdles when applying for a visa for the monumental swim. The visa application required evidence that Javaid would return to Pakistan after completing the challenge. However, the British authorities were not convinced by the documentation provided, and Javaid's visa application was denied. Disappointed but not defeated, Javaid and Gatz decided to persist in their plans and began exploring other options. They reached out to their local representatives and sought support from different organizations, including the Ohio Wesleyan University, which has expressed its backing to the duo tirelessly. College officials and faculty members have written letters vouching for Javaid's character, emphasizing his academic achievements and commitment to swimming. The pair also garnered support from the larger swimming community, including prominent international athletes and organizations. They believed that the attention their relay swim would receive would help raise awareness and funds for various charities, including those focused on providing clean water and education to underprivileged communities in Pakistan and around the world. Aware of the increased attention that their case was garnering, Gatz and Javaid felt a sense of urgency to secure the necessary permissions. They knew that overcoming the bureaucratic obstacles would be crucial if they wished to carry out their ambitious plans. Javaid then submitted an appeal to the British consulate, providing supplementary evidence to support his claim of temporary stay in the UK for the purpose of the Channel swim. As they awaited a decision on their appeal, Gatz and Javaid continued their rigorous training, motivated by their charitable initiatives and a determination to complete their relay swim, which they called \\"Swimming for Unity.\\" They focused on overcoming physical challenges and honing their skill, pushing their limits in both open water and pool practices. Finally, after months of advocacy, efforts, and anticipation, Usman Javaid received the good news that his visa appeal had been approved. The British consulate granted him a visitor's visa, allowing him to enter the UK to pursue the relay swim. With the bureaucratic obstacles finally behind them, Gatz and Javaid moved forward with their plans, finalizing logistics, and intensifying their training schedule in preparation for the Channel swim relay. They continued to engage supporters and publicize their cause, reminding everyone of the spirit of friendship, unity, and perseverance behind their quest.

Former Judge Opens Inquiry Into Savile Sexual Abuse Case The inquiry by Dame Janet Smith, a retired appeals court judge who once led an inquiry into a notorious serial killer, came as a senior police commander said Mr. Savile’s behavior might have gone unchecked for decades because different British institutions, including local police forces, failed to collate the evidence they had against the flamboyant personality who was seen as a philanthropist and a national treasure. At the same time, the former head of a BBC children’s charity, Children in Need, said that, even a decade ago, suspicions about Mr. Savile were so prevalent that “we didn’t want him anywhere near” the organization. Dame Janet’s inquiry is one of two that the BBC has commissioned into the scandal. It began on the first anniversary of Mr. Savile’s death at age 84, and a day after the British police arrested a former pop star, Paul Gadd, better known as Gary Glitter, in the widening scandal. Mr. Gadd has been accused of abusing a teenage girl on BBC premises. The scandal has exploded since ITV, a BBC rival, broadcast a documentary this month about Mr. Savile and his alleged abuses, opening a floodgate of complaints. The police now say 300 potential victims have come forward. Much soul-searching and public anger have focused on how Mr. Savile’s misconduct appears to have been widely known among colleagues and police officers who did little or nothing to restrain or prosecute him. Sharpening the questions about the BBC’s conduct, one of the network’s current affairs programs, “Newsnight,” began and then canceled an investigation into Mr. Savile late last year. Bernard Hogan Howe, the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, said on Monday that though Mr. Savile was accused a number of times while he was alive, police forces in different parts of Britain never put the picture together. Much attention has focused, too, on why successive heads of the BBC have said they were unaware of the rumors about Mr. Savile within the organization. They include the current director general, George Entwistle, and his predecessor, Mark Thompson, the incoming president and chief executive of The New York Times Company. Mr. Thompson was the organization’s head when the “Newsnight” investigation was canceled, a time when other BBC departments were planning holiday tributes to Mr. Savile. The extent of the mistrust surrounding Mr. Savile emerged from a BBC interview on Monday with Sir Roger Jones, a former BBC governor and the head of the Children in Need charity, who said that he had suspicions more than a decade ago, according to an article on the BBC Web site. “I think we all recognized he was a pretty creepy sort of character,” Mr. Jones said in the article. “We took the decision that we didn’t want him anywhere near the charity, and we just stepped up our child protection policies — which again would have put him at risk if he tried anything.” Still, he acknowledged that the charity had only suspicions against Mr. Savile. “If you’re going to go on the attack and make claims against him, then you’d need evidence, hard evidence that simply wasn’t there,” Mr. Jones was quoted as saying. The other inquiry, led by Nick Pollard, a former head of a rival network, Sky News, is looking specifically into the circumstances surrounding the cancellation of the “Newsnight” investigation. Compared with the public inquiries into the behavior of tabloid reporters and editors in Britain in the phone hacking scandal, which have unfolded in a glare of publicity, the inquiries into the Savile matter at the BBC seemed more opaque. A BBC spokesman and a person representing Dame Janet each said her inquiry began on Monday, but they declined to say who would go before the inquiry, where it was being conducted or whether it would operate in public. In response to a reporter’s questions, Dame Janet’s representative, Carolyn E. Pepper of the law firm Reed Smith, released a statement saying: “Dame Janet’s view is that it is not appropriate for her to give interviews or provide comment regarding the review at this time. Press information will be issued in due course.” Her inquiry is meant to gather testimony from people who have accused Mr. Savile of abusing them or who have raised concerns about his activities. It is also supposed to examine “the extent to which BBC personnel were or ought to have been aware of unlawful and/or inappropriate conduct by Jimmy Savile on BBC premises or on location for the BBC,” the BBC said. She is also supposed to determine whether the BBC’s child protection and whistle-blowing policies are adequate. The BBC has also said it is looking into nine more recent cases related to a variety of sexual harassment and abuse cases, but it has not said who was involved in them. Both her inquiry and Mr. Pollard’s investigation are supposed to be independent of BBC control, although both were appointed by BBC supervisory bodies. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text are: 1.

Answer the following question: Law enforcement officers are often unfamiliar with information technology, and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers. There are also budgetary constraints. It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as DNA testing, and improved forensics mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a network administrator or a system administrator) requires a search warrant and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant.  Two neighboring police Departments took different approaches to fighting crime, Greenville P.D. did not invest in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology, while Grayville took extensive measures of that nature.  Which P.D. took a more efficient approach in fighting crime? Answer:","output":"To determine which police department (PD) took a more efficient approach in fighting crime, we need to consider various factors, as well as the specific results or outcomes achieved by each department. Greenville PD did not invest in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology. This decision might have led to cost savings, allowing them to allocate resources to other aspects of law enforcement, such as increasing personnel, investing in community outreach programs, and enhancing traditional crime-fighting strategies. However, the lack of investment in advanced technologies might limit their ability to solve complex cases, track criminals effectively, and secure convictions based on solid evidence. On the other hand, Grayville PD invested extensively in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology. This investment might have provided them with better tools and capabilities to solve crimes faster and more accurately, identify and apprehend criminals, and prosecute cases with strong evidence. Advanced technologies, such as DNA testing and digital forensics, can significantly improve crime-solving rates, especially in cases involving violent crimes, cybercrimes, or organized criminal networks. However, the costs associated with these technologies might limit the resources available for other crime-fighting strategies, leading to potential drawbacks, as mentioned in the provided information. To determine which PD took a more efficient approach, we need to analyze the results of both departments in terms of crime-solving rates, the impact on overall crime rates, community satisfaction, and the ability to adapt to new forms of criminal activities. The efficiency of their approach will depend on the balance between using advanced technologies and applying traditional crime-fighting methods, combined with the effectiveness of their strategies on reducing crime rates and improving public safety. In summary, without specific data on the outcomes achieved by both Greenville and Grayville PDs, it is difficult to definitively say which department's approach was more efficient. Evaluating the effectiveness of their strategies would require analyzing their performance in various aspects, including crime-solving rates, crime reduction, community satisfaction, and adaptability to changing crime trends."},{"instruction":"Pick one category for the following text.

Input: The Ox-Bow Incident takes place in Nevada in 1885 and begins with Art Croft (Harry Morgan) and Gil Carter (Henry Fonda) riding into the town of Bridger's Wells. They go into Darby's Saloon and find that the atmosphere is subdued, in part because of the recent incidents of cattle-rustling (the stealing of livestock) in the vicinity. Everyone wants to catch the thieves.Gil learns that his former girlfriend left town at the start of the spring and drinks heavily to drown his sorrows. Art and Gil are possible rustler suspects simply because they are not often seen in town. The townspeople are wary of them, and a fight breaks out between Gil and a local rancher named Farnley. Immediately after the fight, another man races into town on horseback, goes into the saloon and announces that a rancher named Larry Kinkaid has been murdered. The townspeople immediately form a posse to pursue the murderers, who they believe to be the cattle rustlers. The posse is told by the local judge that they must bring the presumed rustlers back alive for trial, and that their deputization by a deputy is illegal, but little heed is taken of this. Art and Gil join the posse as well, as much to avoid being its target as to participate. Davies (Harry Davenport), who is vehemently opposed to forming the posse because of its capacity for \\"mob rule,\\" also joins. Among the other people in the posse are \\"Major\\" Tetley (Frank Conroy) and his son, Gerald (William Eythe). The major informs the posse that three men with cattle bearing Kinkaid's brand have just entered Bridger's Pass, and therefore shouldn't be too difficult to catch.On their journey, the posse encounters a stagecoach. They try to stop it, but the stagecoach guard assumes that it is a stickup, and shoots, accidentally wounding Art in the left shoulder. In the coach are Rose Mapen (Mary Beth Hughes), Gil's old girlfriend, and her new, obviously rich husband, Swanson (George Meeker).Later in the night, in the Ox-Bow canyon, the posse finds three men sleeping on the ground, with what are presumed to be stolen cattle nearby. The posse interrogates the men: a young, well-spoken man, Donald Martin (Dana Andrews); a Mexican named Juan Martínez (Anthony Quinn) who claims to be unable to understand English; and a delusional old man named Alva Hardwicke, portrayed by veteran Hollywood character actor/silent film director Francis Ford (brother of famed film director John Ford). Martin claims that he purchased the cattle from Kinkaid, but that he received no bill of sale because the sale took place out on the range. No one believes Martin, and it is therefore decided that the three men are to be hanged at sunrise.Martin, as his last wish, writes a private letter to his wife and asks Davies, the only member of the posse that he trusts, to deliver it. Davies reads the letter, and, hoping to save Martin's life, gives it to the others to read. Because of the letter's eloquence, Davies believes that Martin is innocent and does not deserve to die. However, Martin finds out that his letter has been read, and becomes angry at the betrayal of his privacy.During the argument, the Mexican, who is actually a gambler named Juan Morez, tries to escape and is shot. The posse discovers that Juan is able to speak \\"American\\" and ten other languages and that he has Kinkaid's gun. Major Tetley wants the men to be lynched immediately because he does not want any of the rustlers to escape through the courts. A vote is taken on whether the men should be hanged or taken back to face trial. Only seven of the group (of approximately twenty-five people), among them Davies, Gerald Tetley, Gil and Art, vote to take the men back to town alive; the rest support immediate hanging. Gil tries to stop it, but is overpowered. The group must choose three people to hit the horses out from under the condemned men. Farnley and Jenny Grier (Jane Darwell), the only woman in the posse, volunteer, and Gerald Tetley is ordered by his father to be the third. While the others hit the horses of the old man and Morez, Gerald Tetley does not, and the horse therefore simply walks out from under Martin. Farnley shoots Martin to kill him.After the lynching, the posse heads back towards Bridger's Wells. On the way, they meet Sheriff Risley (Willard Robertson). They tell him with pride of their actions, but the sheriff replies that Lawrence Kinkaid was not killed, is under the care of the doctor in Pike's Corner, and that the men who shot him have already been arrested. Risley strips the deputy of his badge and asks Davies, whom he knows would not have supported a hanging, to tell him who was involved. \\"All but seven,\\" Davies replies. \\"God better have mercy on you,\\" the sheriff tells the posse. \\"You won't get any from me.\\"The men of the posse gather back in Canby's Saloon and drink in silence. Major Tetley returns to his house and locks the door so his son cannot come in. His son yells at him through the door, telling him what he thinks of him. Major Tetley walks into another room and shoots himself. In the saloon, Gil reads Martin's letter out loud to Art while the other members of the posse are listening. In the closing scene, mirroring the initial scene, Gil and Art ride out of town to deliver the letter to Martin's wife and family.

Wrestling is a sport that demands both physical strength and technique. Lifting weights can help improve a wrestler's performance by increasing their strength, which is crucial for executing various moves, overpowering opponents, and maintaining stamina during matches. Given this, \\"have strength\\" is the most appropriate answer, as it directly relates to the advantages that weightlifting can provide to a wrestler.

Rinse the zipper thoroughly with freshwater. Wash the zipper with a soap solution.","output":"Title: Reviving Stuck Zippers: A Comprehensive Guide to Loosen and Maintain Zippers with Natural Solutions Introduction A stuck zipper can be the ultimate roadblock in our day-to-day activities and a challenge, especially when it occurs on our most valued garments or accessories. Whether it's a bag, jacket, or pair of jeans, zippers are an indispensable component, securing functionality and ease in our lives. When a zipper sticks, it can be frustrating and render the item unusable. However, worry no more as this article presents a comprehensive guide to loosening zippers using natural solutions, including beeswax, fresh water, and soap to help breathe life back into your garments and accessories. Step 1: Open the zipper as much as possible The first important step you should take when faced with a stuck zipper is to attempt to open it as much as you can. Gently pull the zipper, using minimal force, to prevent damaging the item or causing the teeth to misalign further. Be patient and remember that applying too much pressure can result in rendering the zipper permanently damaged. Step 2: Use beeswax to loosen the zipper Once you have opened the zipper space adequately, you can now proceed to apply a lubricant to ease the movement of the zipper. Our recommendation for this purpose is beeswax, as it is an eco-friendly, natural option, and typically doesn't stain or damage fabrics. For optimal results, follow these guidelines: - Rub the edge of a beeswax bar or use a cotton swab dipped in beeswax along both sides of the zipper's teeth. - If you don't have access to beeswax, an alternative to natural lubricants includes lip balm. However, avoid petroleum jelly, as it may darken or stain the fabric. - Exert gentle pressure to glide the zipper back and forth, allowing the lubricant to penetrate and ease the stuck areas. Repeat until the zipper runs smoothly. Step 3: Rinse the zipper thoroughly with freshwater After applying the lubricant of choice and moving the zipper back and forth gently, clean off any accumulated dirt, grime, or excess lubricant. To achieve this, rinse the zipper thoroughly with fresh, clean water. Ensuring the zipper is free from residues and dirt particles will help preserve its function and longevity. Step 4: Wash the zipper with a soap solution The final step is to use a soap solution to clean the zipper and eliminate the chances of any residue buildup. Take a small amount of mild soap or detergent and mix it with water to create a solution. Use a toothbrush, sponge, or soft cloth to gently clean the zipper's teeth and parts. While engaging in this process, be cautious to avoid the soapy solution from making contact with the garment or accessory material, as it may cause harm or discoloration. After cleaning the zipper, rinse it thoroughly with clean water and pat dry with a towel or allow it to air dry before using. Conclusion Maintaining the function and appearance of zippers is essential for preserving the life of your valued items. This comprehensive guide, which employs natural solutions such as beeswax, fresh water, and soap, offers a reliable, effective, and environmentally friendly means of loosening stuck zippers and ensuring their longevity. By adhering to these steps and practicing proper zipper maintenance, you can easily remedy zipper issues and extend the life of your favorite garments and accessories."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He wished he hadn't come to the lake for the weekend. \\"We're ready,\\" Dad said as he came in from the porch. \\" Grab your rod.\\"  Alex turned away from the window and slowly picked up his fishing rod. \\"Have fun!\\" Mom said. \\"Sure,\\" said Alex, trying to make his voice bright. \\"We should have done this before.\\" Dad said. \\"Let's catch a big one!\\" Dad picked up his tackle   box, rod, and bait can from the porch. He clicked on the flashlight.     They walked down the hill toward the lake in the narrow beam of light. The only thing Alex could see was the circle of weeds and rocks at their feet, lit by the flashlight. Insect voices filled his ears---clicks, hums, buzzes, whines. Hundreds of bugs waited in the darkness to attack. \\"Ow!\\" he blurted as he felt a sting on his arm. \\"Mosquitoes,\\" Dad said. \\"I have brought some spray   to keep them off.\\"  When they reached the boat, Alex stumbled as he climbed over the side. \\"I don't like this much,\\" he said. \\"It's so dark.\\" Dad squeezed his shoulder. \\"Don't worry. It's not as dark as you think. After a while your eyes will get used to the night.\\" Suddenly something rushed past Alex's head. He gasped. \\"What was that?\\" \\"Probably a bat,\\" Dad said. How could Dad act as if it were nothing! \\"Will bats be flying around our heads the whole time?\\" \\"This is their time to be out catching insects,\\" Dad explained. \\"They won't hurt you. They're too busy grabbing dinner.\\" He pushed the boat off the gravel   and jumped in. Alex gazed back at the cabin. A square of light from the window glowed in the darkness.   Dad rowed to the middle of the lake and stopped. \\"We'll just let the boat drift. Keep the flashlight in the bottom of the boat. The fish won't bite if they see light flashing around. When we've done baiting our hooks , we'll turn the light off.\\" Leaning down to get closer to the light, Alex tried to thread a worm on his hook, but he couldn't seem to work his fingers right. So... Question: Whom did Alex go fishing with? Options: A: No one. B: His mother C: His parents D: His father Answer:","output":"D: His father"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A. hockey game  B. cold weather  C. refrigerator  D. zoo  E. antarctica  The best answer is Answer:","output":"The best answer is D. Zoo. Here's a detailed explanation for each option: A. Hockey Game - Ice is an essential part of a hockey game, as the sport is played on a surface made of frozen water, called an ice rink. Therefore, it would be highly likely to find ice at a hockey game. B. Cold Weather - Ice is formed when water freezes, which occurs at temperatures below its freezing point (32°F or 0°C). Therefore, during cold weather, it would be likely to find ice on surfaces such as sidewalks, roads, or natural bodies of water like rivers and lakes. C. Refrigerator - Most refrigerators have a cooling mechanism that involves the circulation of refrigerants, which can cause the water vapor inside the refrigerator to freeze. This results in the formation of ice, especially in the freezer section. Finding ice in a refrigerator is a common occurrence. D. Zoo - A zoo primarily serves as a facility where various animals are housed and cared for. While certain animals, like polar bears or penguins, may require ice or cold conditions for their habitats, it would not be common to find ice widely present throughout the zoo. This makes it the least likely place to find ice among the given options. E. Antarctica - Antarctica is the southernmost continent on Earth, and it is almost entirely covered in ice. In fact, approximately 90% of the world's ice is located in Antarctica. As a result, it is highly likely that one would find ice in Antarctica."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what material is a mouse pad made out of? Suggested answer: A mousepad with a padded wrist rest. Should I validate this answer? A:","output":"The suggested answer is not entirely accurate, as it does not fully address the question of what material a mousepad is made out of. Instead, it mentions a specific feature of some mousepads (a padded wrist rest), which is not necessarily relevant to the core question. A more appropriate answer to the question \\"what material is a mouse pad made out of?\\" would cover the different types of materials that could be found in typical mouse pads. So, a detailed response would look something like this: Mouse pads can be made from various materials, depending on the design and purpose. The most common materials include: 1. Rubber foam base: This serves as the bottom layer of a mousepad, providing grip and stability. The rubber foam base is anti-slip and can be either hard or soft, depending on user preference. 2. Fabric (e.g., polyester, microfiber, or cloth): This is a top layer material that provides a smooth surface for the mouse to glide across. The fabric layer can also have varying textures, which may affect the precision of the mouse movements. Some mouse pads have heat-treated surfaces for a smoother glide. 3. Plastic (e.g., polyethylene or acrylic): Some mouse pads have a hard plastic surface instead of a fabric layer. Hard plastic pads generally offer greater durability and are often preferred by gamers for their low friction surfaces that enable quicker mouse movements. 4. Metal (e.g., aluminum): Metal mouse pads are less common but provide a sleek, premium feel. They are durable and offer a unique texture. 5. Glass: These mouse pads typically have a frosted or textured surface to provide optimal tracking for the mouse. Glass mouse pads are easier to clean and have an elegant appearance, but they may not be suitable for all mice and users. 6. Gel or foam wrist rest: As you mentioned, some mouse pads do include a padded wrist rest, which is made of a comfortable gel or foam material. This additional feature is designed to provide ergonomic support and alleviate strain during long periods of use. In conclusion, while the suggested answer you provided is not completely incorrect, it does not offer a comprehensive understanding of the various materials that mouse pads can be made from. A more accurate response would include details about rubber foam bases, fabric surfaces, plastic, metal, and glass options, and the potential addition of ergonomic wrist rests."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"An earlier heartwood results in what?\\"  Context: \\"The term heartwood derives solely from its position and not from any vital importance to the tree. This is evidenced by the fact that a tree can thrive with its heart completely decayed. Some species begin to form heartwood very early in life, so having only a thin layer of live sapwood, while in others the change comes slowly. Thin sapwood is characteristic of such species as chestnut, black locust, mulberry, osage-orange, and sassafras, while in maple, ash, hickory, hackberry, beech, and pine, thick sapwood is the rule. Others never form heartwood.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"An earlier heartwood formation results in a tree having a thinner layer of live sapwood. In certain tree species, heartwood develops early in the tree's life, while in others, this change occurs gradually or does not occur at all. The formation of heartwood is primarily due to the tree species' natural traits and growth patterns, rather than any specific factors or conditions. Heartwood, the central portion of a tree's trunk, consists of dead and decayed cells, giving it a darker color and denser composition compared to the surrounding sapwood. It plays a crucial role in giving the tree mechanical support and stability. In contrast, sapwood is the living outer layer of the tree and is involved in conducting water and nutrients from the roots to the leaves and branches. Species that exhibit early heartwood formation and thin sapwood layers include chestnut, black locust, mulberry, osage-orange, and sassafras. In these species, the swift conversion of sapwood to heartwood can be useful for the tree's long-term survival. Early heartwood formation provides additional structural strength, often enabling these trees to better withstand harsh environmental conditions and resist various external threats, such as pests, diseases, and storm damage. On the other hand, species with late or minimal heartwood formation, like maple, ash, hickory, hackberry, beech, and pine, tend to have thicker sapwood layers. In these trees, the larger sapwood area allows for more efficient water and nutrient transport, which can contribute to a faster overall growth rate. However, these species may be more prone to damage or decay in the sapwood region due to their higher living cell content and moisture levels, which can attract pests and fungi. Ultimately, an earlier heartwood formation is a natural growth pattern found in specific tree species, resulting in thinner sapwood layers. This characteristic provides increased structural support and helps enhance the tree's durability in challenging conditions. In contrast, tree species with thicker sapwood layers may benefit from improved water and nutrient transport efficiency, potentially leading to faster growth rates. Both traits have their advantages and drawbacks and are largely determined by the tree species' inherent genetics and growth habits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: While Ava had its hands full with the Manipuri raids in Upper Burma, a rebellion broke out at Pegu in November 1740. Ethnic Mon officials selected Smim Htaw Buddhaketi, a cousin of the king at Ava, as their king. The court at Pegu consolidated its hold in Lower Burma. Starting in 1742, Pegu, with renegade Dutch and Portuguese musketeers, began its annual raids of the upcountry. Because of the Manipuri threat, Ava could only send small armies to the south in 1743 and 1744, neither of which made any mark. The war \\"carried on languidly\\", with neither side achieving any lasting advantage until 1747. In December 1747, Binnya Dala came to power in Pegu, and the new king was determined to finish the war. He was not satisfied to gain independence for Lower Burma itself but determined to make Upper Burma its tributary. He stopped the annual raids and began planning for a decisive invasion. He sought and received French East India Company's support in firearms. Alarmed, Ava too sought support from China but no help materialised. In November 1751, Pegu launched a full-scale invasion by land and by river with a total strength of 30,000. Ava had prepared an extensive defensive line around Ava—a riverside fort at Sinbyukyun on the Irrawaddy, and a series of forts at Sintgaing, Tada-U and Pinya en route to Ava. By mid-January, the invasion forces had overcome Ava's defences, and laid siege to the city. On 21 March 1752, the invaders broke through the city's outer walls. Two days later, they breached the inner walls and took the city. The 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty had fallen. Question: What city was taken by the invaders on 21 March 1752?

How is \\"This amendment would still imply some new obligations for Member States which have not yet been discussed in the Council.\\" said in Finnish?","output":"Tämä tarkistus viittaisi kuitenkin edelleen sellaisiin uusiin velvoitteisiin jäsenvaltioille, joita ei ole vielä käsitelty neuvostossa. Here is a detailed explanation of the translation: 1. \\"This amendment\\" - \\"Tämä tarkistus\\" In Finnish, the word for 'amendment' is 'tarkistus,' and 'this' is expressed as 'tämä.' 2. \\"would still imply\\" - \\"viittaisi kuitenkin edelleen\\" 'Would' in Finnish is often translated as a conditional form of the verb, in this case, 'viittaisi' (from 'viitata,' meaning 'to imply' or 'to refer'). The word 'still' is translated as 'edelleen,' and 'kuitenkin' means 'however' or 'nonetheless,' which gives some nuance to the sentence, reflecting the feeling that even though something else has happened or changed, this implication still exists. 3. \\"some new obligations\\" - \\"sellaisiin uusiin velvoitteisiin\\" In Finnish, 'some' can be translated as 'sellaisiin,' meaning 'such' or 'those.' 'New obligations' is translated as 'uusiin velvoitteisiin' ('uusi' means 'new' and 'velvoitteet' means 'obligations'). The plural form is used here, and the case ending 'iin' shows that the obligations are something that has not yet been discussed in the Council. 4. \\"for Member States\\" - \\"jäsenvaltioille\\" The phrase 'for Member States' is translated as 'jäsenalioille.'

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Fertilizer runoff can create dead zones in the ocean.   Choices:  - fresh zones  - barren zones  - hot zones  - dead zones   A: The answer to this question is:","output":"dead zones. Fertilizer runoff plays a significant role in the creation of dead zones in the ocean. As rain or irrigation washes fertilizers off farms, lawns, and other land surfaces, these nitrogen and phosphorus-loaded substances flow into rivers and streams and eventually make their way to the ocean. There, they provide a surplus of nutrients that phytoplankton and algae thrive on, causing excessive growth or 'bloom.' These intense blooms consume a large portion of the available oxygen in the water, as when they die, their decomposition process steals oxygen from the surrounding water environment. This process, also known as eutrophication, can lead to hypoxic or low-oxygen conditions capable of suffocating marine life.  The areas where oxygen has been severely depleted to the point where little to no aquatic life can survive are referred to as 'dead zones.' While some small organisms can exist there, the biodiversity is significantly reduced, and larger marine creatures such as fish and shellfish often avoid these areas. This cause of nutrient pollution is a serious environmental issue. Dead zones can be seasonal or persistent. Dead zones are of particular concern because they threaten biodiversity, disrupt ecosystems, and have economic impacts on commercial and recreational fisheries. Controlling nutrient sources and timing of fertilizer applications can help reduce the severity and extent of dead zones. Therefore, the correct choice would be \\"dead zones,\\" as fertilizer runoff leads to an excessive nutrient supply which results in oxygen-deprived areas in the ocean, killing marine life and creating 'dead zones.' It's a pressing environmental issue that requires mitigation for the health of our oceans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question \\"How would you describe Quinn?\\", is \\"careless\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, it would not be accurate to describe Quinn as \\"careless\\" just because Quinn texted Riley back after receiving a distressed message. In fact, responding to a distressed message is an act of care and concern, and it shows that Quinn values their relationship with Riley and is attentive to their friend's needs. Before jumping to conclusions and labeling someone as \\"careless,\\" it's important to consider multiple factors and instances that illustrate an individual's character. Being described as \\"careless\\" implies that the person shows a lack of attention or consideration for others, as well as a lack of concern for the consequences of their actions. On the contrary, in this situation, Quinn's response to Riley's message indicates that they pay attention to others' emotions and they make an effort to support and be there for their friends when needed. To get a comprehensive understanding of Quinn's character, it would be necessary to look at additional instances and examine their behavior in various contexts. In terms of a friendship context, we could consider factors such as:  1. How Quinn treats Riley and other friends regularly: Observe if they are consistently supportive, empathetic, and understanding or if they frequently disregard others' feelings and needs.  2. Quinn's interaction with their social circle: Determine if Quinn consistently shows interest and engages with friends’ lives, or if they are detached and self-centered. 3. How Quinn responds to different circumstances: Assess if Quinn adapts their behavior and attitude accordingly to different situations, or if they often act recklessly without considering consequences and possible impacts on others. 4. Reliability and consistency: Check if Quinn is someone that can be counted on when needed and stays true to their words, or if they have a history of forgetting promises and backing out of plans. 5. Communication: Evaluate if Quinn fosters open communication and actively listens to their friends' concerns, or if they are dismissive and ignore problems others face. By looking at these factors, it would be possible to create a more accurate portrayal of Quinn's character than just labeling them as \\"careless.\\" Based on the initial scenario given, Quinn seems to demonstrate care and concern for Riley by responding to their distressed message. However, a more detailed evaluation is necessary if we aim to capture a broader understanding of Quinn as a person."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

We have an equation: 0 = 3*g + 27 - 15 First, let's see what happens when we take away 15 from 27. Imagine you have 27 candies and you give 15 away.

Plot title: Seven Movie plot: In an unidentified city of constant rain and urban decay, Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is preparing to retire and leave the horrors of the city. Before he retires, he is partnered with Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), a cocky, young and short-tempered cop from Springfield, a comparatively small town. The two investigate the murder of a highly obese man (Bob Mack) who was fed spaghetti until a kick to his stomach burst him open. Somerset investigates the murder while Mills is given the murder case of Defense Attorney Eli Gould (Gene Borkan), with GREED written in Gould's blood on the floor. Gould was forced to carve a pound of flesh off of his body, and subsequently bled to death. The police captain gives Somerset an evidence container with three slivers of a plastic-like material found in the stomach of the obese man, which he was forced to consume along with the spaghetti. Going to the victim's house, Somerset finds three groove marks in front of the refrigerator and finds that the plastic-like slivers fit into them perfectly. Knowing the slivers resulted from the refrigerator being moved, Somerset looks behind it. He finds the word GLUTTONY written behind the fridge in grease, along with a note containing a quote from Milton's Paradise Lost. Somerset theorizes that a serial killer is basing his crimes on the Seven Deadly Sins, with five more to go.To give Mills and Somerset a chance to get along with each other, Mills's wife, Tracy Mills (Gwyneth Paltrow) invites Somerset over for dinner. While they are eating, a train passes by on the track nearby, making the building and all its contents and inhabitants tremble: the couple mention that that's why the realtor was so nervous for them to see the apartment quickly. After Tracy goes to bed, Mills and Somerset examine case evidence from the two scenes. They find a picture of Gould's wife with blood painted around the eyes.

I went to the Pinnacle web site, and I found out the guarantee is 30 days and the problem with total failure at 6 months or so is pretty common. I was directed to an on line b-board where there were a number of postings of buyers whose experience was exactly like mine. There seems to be no recourse or fix other than replacement at my cost. Is this product review negative? Answer:","output":"Yes, this product review is negative. The author initially expresses satisfaction with the product's easy installation and the TV picture quality, but then goes on to describe issues they faced with the product over time. The tuner failing after just six months of use is a significant problem, as it impedes the primary function of the product. Moreover, the reviewer's experience of not being able to find a solution for the issue, and discovering that the guarantee for the product is only 30 days, adds to the negative sentiment. The mention of other buyers with similar experiences on the online message board further reinforces the prevalence and severity of the issue. This creates a sense of discontent and disappointment among potential buyers, who may be apprehensive about investing in a product with such negative feedback. In conclusion, this product review highlights the reviewer's dissatisfaction with the product's reliability, the short duration of the guarantee, and the lack of support from the manufacturer.

Breeland responded and said he “wanted to be the villain at that point in time” because of criticism after a win. His season got off to a rough start after an impressive training camp. Breeland recorded an interception in the season opener against the Pittsburgh Steelers, but he allowed two touchdowns to wide receiver Antonio Brown on plays that could’ve resulted in takeaways. It spiraled down from there as questions arose about why the Redskins didn’t use cornerback Josh Norman to trail Brown. During the second half of Washington’s game against the Dallas Cowboys in Week 2, defensive coordinator Joe Barry made the switch to have Norman trail wide receiver Dez Bryant during the fourth quarter. these so call redskins fans need to stop wasting their breathe talking to me like im a slouch check ur history real talk #HTTR — Bashaud Breeland (@Salute_me17) October 10, 2016 “To me, I feel like I’m one of those players where I know I messed up,” Breeland said. “I know I’ve played bad, and I critique myself.

Elsewhere on the beach, a dead soldier lies face-down in the bloody surf; his pack is stenciled Ryan, S. In Washington, D.C., at the U.S. War Department, General George Marshall learns that three of the four sons of the Ryan family were killed in action and that the fourth son, James, is with the 101st Airborne Division somewhere in Normandy. After reading Abraham Lincoln's Bixby letter aloud, Marshall orders Ryan brought home. Three days after D-Day, Miller receives orders to find Ryan and bring him back. He chooses seven men from his company—T/Sgt. Horvath, Privates First Class Reiben and Caparzo, Privates Mellish and Jackson, T/4 medic Wade—plus T/5 Upham, an interpreter from headquarters. They move out to Neuville, where they meet a squad of the 101st engaged against the enemy. Caparzo is killed by a German sniper who is then killed by Jackson. They locate a Private James Ryan but he is not the right one. From passing soldiers, Miller learns that Ryan is defending an important bridge in Ramelle. Near Ramelle, Miller decides to neutralize a German machine gun position at a derelict radar station, despite his men's misgivings. Wade is killed in the skirmish. At Upham's urging, Miller declines to execute a surviving German soldier, and sets him free.

Q:I have a new situation: Two people got stuck in a local  blizzard. Tom had a bottle of alcohol with him and drank it after he found some kind of shelter in the snow. Dan didn't have alcohol with him.  But I can use this background: Alcoholic beverages do not make the entire body warmer.[361] The reason that alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth is that they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood. This can actually result in making the core body temperature lower, as it allows for easier heat exchange with a cold external environment.  What is an answer for this question: Which of the two people had more blood vessels dilate? A:","output":"Based on the given background information, Tom, who consumed the bottle of alcohol, experienced more blood vessel dilation than Dan, who did not have any alcohol. This is because the consumption of alcohol has a vasodilating effect on the blood vessels. When Tom drank the alcohol, it caused his blood vessels to widen, particularly those near the surface of his skin. This increase in blood flow near the skin's surface led to the sensation of warmth, as the nerve endings were stimulated by the influx of warm blood. However, this also made it easier for his body to exchange heat with the cold external environment, which could potentially lower his core body temperature. On the other hand, Dan did not consume any alcohol, so his blood vessels were not subjected to the vasodilating effects of alcohol. Therefore, his blood vessels remained relatively constricted compared to Tom's, and he did not experience the same sensation of warmth as Tom. In summary, Tom, who drank alcohol, had more blood vessels dilate due to the vasodilating effects of alcohol compared to Dan, who did not consume any alcohol."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy.

She examines a red one and notices that it bends much more easily than a green one. Which pole should she choose if she wants to lower the likelihood that the pole will snap? (A) green vaulting pole (B) red vaulting pole.  What is the most sensical answer between \\"red vaulting pole\\" and  \\"green vaulting pole\\"? Answer:","output":"The most sensical answer between \\"red vaulting pole\\" and \\"green vaulting pole\\" would be the green vaulting pole (A).  To understand the reasoning behind this answer, let us consider the situation that Tamara is in and the properties of each pole. Tamara needs a new vaulting pole for her upcoming meet, which means that she hopes to find a pole that will be reliable, safe, and efficient in helping her perform her best. When Tamara examines the red and green poles, she notices a significant difference in their flexibility. The red pole bends much more easily than the green one. This observation leads to an important question: which of these properties is more desirable in a pole-vaulting context? For an effective pole vault, the athlete relies on the pole to transfer their forward momentum into vertical lift. The pole needs to be strong and flexible enough to withstand the stress and absorb the energy during this process. If the pole is too weak or flexible, it can snap or lose power when recoiling, which may cause injury to the athlete or negatively affect the performance. In this case, Tamara's observation suggests that the green pole is less flexible and potentially stronger compared to the easily bendable red pole. A pole that is less prone to bending can typically hold up more weight and pressure without snapping. Therefore, the green pole (A) seems to be a better choice for Tamara, as it lowers the likelihood that the pole will snap during the competition and helps her ensure a more secure and successful performance. In conclusion, the most sensical answer for Tamara's situation between the two vaulting pole options is the green vaulting pole (A), as it displays characteristics of a more reliable, safe, and efficient tool for her upcoming meet compared to the red one."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Join at least one betting exchange in addition to your favourite dimeline sportsbook. A betting exchange is similar to a sportsbook except players determine their own betting lines with one another. In other words, you will determine the payout with the person you are betting against. Dimeline odds ensures that the odds on favorite and the underdog are separated by 10 cents on the dollar, thus the term dimeline. For example, if the favored team is given -150 odds, then a line of +140 will be given to the underdog, which is a 10 cent difference. If you choose the favourite the payout will be less than if you bet on the underdog to win. The team with the negative sign in front of it is the favourite. The team with the plus sign is the underdog. Dimelines work in your favour because the sportsbook can’t over-shade the favourite without exposing themselves on the back side with a large underdog line. If a sportsbook offers 15 or 20 cent odds, the favourite and underdog will be separated by 15 or 20 cents. This puts you at a disadvantage so be weary. Choosing a dimeline book ensures that your winnings will be higher over the long term, regardless of who you bet. Betting exchanges cut out the middle man and let bettors from around the world offer their own money lines directly to other bettors. This results in lines that are more favourable than any sportsbook. Additionally, a betting exchange won’t straddle the line. This means it won’t always separate the favourite and the underdog by exactly 10 or 20 cents. It may even be common to find no or almost no separation between the favourite and the underdog. You can’t get better than equal odds. Summary:","output":"When betting on baseball, consider various factors and strategies such as team performance, betting options, comparing odds at different sportsbooks, and utilizing dimeline odds and betting exchanges to maximize potential payouts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Input: Passage: In 1918 Whitehead's academic responsibilities began to seriously expand as he accepted a number of high administrative positions within the University of London system, of which Imperial College London was a member at the time. He was elected Dean of the Faculty of Science at the University of London in late 1918 (a post he held for four years), a member of the University of London's Senate in 1919, and chairman of the Senate's Academic (leadership) Council in 1920, a post which he held until he departed for America in 1924. Whitehead was able to exert his newfound influence to successfully lobby for a new history of science department, help establish a Bachelor of Science degree (previously only Bachelor of Arts degrees had been offered), and make the school more accessible to less wealthy students.

For me, there’s always something that has to be done. In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden. Inside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son. Better mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children. But for me, this very small decision, this day of ‘laziness’, became a treasured memory. What is the first chore the mother does later?  A. She cleans dishes.  B. not enough information  C. She irons clothes.  D. She washes clothes. A:","output":"B. not enough information"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

He is also accused of fleeing to Spain 10 days later \\"to avoid arrest, prosecution and conviction\\". Mr Paterson denies all the charges against him and has lodged two special defences of alibi and incrimination. The trial is taking place at the High Court in Glasgow. An excerpt from a telephone call made by Mr Paterson to his girlfriend Sarah Maguire from prison in October last year was played to the court. In it he was heard telling her that he had been served with his indictment and that there were 350 witnesses on the list, including her father. Giving evidence to the jury, Miss Maguire's father Kevin Maguire, 70, told the court that Mr Paterson was in a relationship with his daughter and before going to Spain in January 2010 sometimes stayed at their house. Det Sgt Grant Durie, who searched the house where Miss Maguire lived with her father in Cumbernauld, also gave evidence. He told the court he was the crime scene manager and that during the search a bulletproof vest was found under the bed in Miss Maguire's room. Advocate depute Iain McSporran asked if it was if it was \\"unusual\\" to find it and he said it was. The prosecutor asked how many times he had previously come across a bulletproof vest during searches and he replied: \\"That was the first time, sir.\\" The officer also told the court that Kevin Carroll had the nickname \\"Gerbil\\". He confirmed that a man called Ross Monaghan had been arrested and charged with Mr Carroll's murder. It is claimed - while masked and acting with others - Mr Paterson repeatedly discharged loaded handguns at 29-year-old Mr Carroll shooting him on the head and body. The 35-year-old is also accused of attempting to defeat the ends of justice. The indictment claims that on 23 January 2010 he boarded a flight from Glasgow to Malaga \\"to avoid arrest, prosecution and conviction\\". Mt Paterson further faces a number of firearms charges as well as another accusation of attempting to defeat the ends of justice. He is also said to have been involved in the reset of a car or an alternative accusation of being in the vehicle knowing it had been taken without consent. Mr Paterson denies all the charges and has incriminated six other people, including Ross Monaghan, and lodged a special defence of alibi claiming he was at his girlfriend's house in Cumbernauld on the day of the murder.

Title: The Ruins Movie plot: Two young American couples â Jeff (Jonathan Tucker) and Amy (Jena Malone), and Eric (Shawn Ashmore) and Stacy (Laura Ramsey) â enjoy their vacation in Mexico. They meet Mathias (Joe Anderson), a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas), Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins. At the top, they find an abandoned camp and a shaft in the center. The group cannot call for help since Eric's phone has no signal. They hear a cell phone ringing from somewhere inside the ruins. Believing it is Heinrich's phone ringing, the rest of the group lowers Mathias down the shaft with a rope. The rope breaks and Mathias falls, becoming completely paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans, but to no success. In anger, Amy throws a clump of vines at them and hits a young boy, whom the Mayans promptly kill. They realize the Mayans are afraid of the vines, and won't let them go since they have touched them. Later, Stacy and Amy descend the shaft to help Mathias and to find the phone. Jeff and Eric rig a backboard and bring Mathias out of the shaft. The next morning, Stacy sees a tendril of vine has crept into a wound on her leg. The vines have also wrapped themselves around Mathias's lower legs and eaten them down to the bone. Eric and Jeff are barely able to remove the vines from Stacy but cannot get them off of Mathias.

Tweet: i really miss my 1/2&quot; lobes  Choose from: *negative. *positive.","output":"Before analyzing the sentiment of the tweet \\"i really miss my 1/2\\" lobes\\", let's first understand the context of the text. The tweet is referring to \\"1/2\\" lobes which indicate the size of earlobe stretching (piercings) that the person used to have. This tweet consists of two main elements: \\"really miss\\" and \\"1/2\\" lobes\\". The element \\"really miss\\" signifies a sense of longing and craving for something that the user used to have, which in this case, are the 1/2\\" lobes. Missing something usually signifies a positive sentiment; however, it is important to note that missing something means that it is no longer present or the user doesn't have it anymore. This absence contributes to a negative sentiment as well. The element \\"1/2\\" lobes refers to a specific size of earlobe stretching the user used to have. Talking about a past earring choice indicates a personal preference or experience, which is neither inherently positive nor negative. Taking the two elements into account, the sentiment in this tweet can be seen as a mix of both positive and negative emotions. On one hand, the positive sentiment comes from the fact that the user has fond memories or positive feelings regarding their 1/2\\" lobes. On the other hand, the negative sentiment is due to the absence or loss of those 1/2\\" lobes, which is something the user misses or longs for. However, considering the overall tone of the tweet and that the user has chosen to express their longing for their 1/2\\" lobes, it can be inferred that the primary sentiment is negative. This is because the tweet focuses on the absence and longing more than the appreciation or positive feelings associated with the 1/2\\" lobes.

Navarrette: A black actress came out for Romney and got slammed and reviled. Limbaugh calls activist a 'slut,' he says, columnist blasted for changing parties. Nobody can disagree without going on the attack, he writes, and leaders just as bad.","output":"Title: The Growing Divide: How Discord and Name-Calling Lead to a Fragmented Society The United States of America has long been acclaimed as a land of freedom - a place where people of diverse backgrounds, opinions, and beliefs can coexist in peace. However, in recent years, a worrisome trend has emerged. As noted by political commentator Ruben Navarrette, the nation now seems to be sharply divided into two camps that refuse to engage in meaningful dialogue, opting instead for relentless name-calling and division. In his article, Navarrette highlights instances where celebrities and public figures are not only vehemently criticized for their political views, but also subject to personal attacks and vitriolic language. He cites the example of a black actress who publicly endorsed then-presidential candidate Mitt Romney. The actress faced backlash in the form of verbal abuse and hatred. This troubling episode underscores the fact that, regardless of one's profession or personal life, political differences are being used as grounds for marginalization and ridicule. The political landscape is also replete with instances where prominent figures themselves engage in name-calling. Navarrette refers to conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh's labeling of an activist as a \\"slut,\\" and a columnist being criticized for switching political parties. It seems that, to an ever-increasing extent, the limits of decency are being crossed as political opponents seek to demean each other. This ongoing - and escalating - trend of attacking our fellow citizens due to their political beliefs has far-reaching consequences. It is slowly eroding the foundations of our democracy, which is built on the idea that rational debate and the exchange of ideas should play key roles in shaping policies and opinions. Name-calling, in contrast, is devoid of substance and serves only to poison the atmosphere. Furthermore, when name-calling grows to be the norm, it discourages people from engaging in political conversations. Fearful of harsh judgments and potential ostracism, individuals may prefer to keep their thoughts and opinions to themselves. This climate of silence and mistrust further widens the divide between the two camps and stifles the development of innovative ideas and solutions. It is clear, then, that a solution to this problem is sorely needed. Political discourse must return to its roots in respectful, open debate, where individuals can disagree without resorting to ad-hominem attacks. We must foster a culture in which it is possible for a person to endorse a particular candidate or political party without fear of being vilified. This necessitates a collective commitment to civility and understanding, both from our political leaders and from the average citizen. One approach to fostering such a change is through grassroots initiatives that encourage dialogue between people of different political persuasions. Creating safe spaces where people can discuss political topics without fear of judgment can break the ice and help develop a sense of mutual respect. These kinds of conversations can promote empathy and understanding while also breaking down stereotypes. In conclusion, the political polarization and name-calling that Ruben Navarrette describes in his article represent significant barriers to progress and unity in our society. To bridge the gap and heal the rifts that have formed, we must all do our part to encourage respectful, meaningful conversations and promote understanding across the political spectrum. The future of our nation - and our democracy - depends on our ability to set aside our differences, resist the impulse to attack one another, and find common ground."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The intricate design features a heart held by two hands, with a crown above it, representing love, friendship, and loyalty, respectively. The traditional Irish ring's rich history dates back to the small fishing village of Claddagh in Galway, where the ring was first created, and its use has since then carried on & transcended beyond the Irish culture. One fascinating aspect of the Claddagh ring is the way it's worn, which indicates the wearer's relationship status. This article will delve into the subtle art of communicating one's relationship status through the positioning of the Claddagh ring on the ring finger of the right hand. The Claddagh Ring: Origins and Symbolism The origins of the Claddagh ring can be traced back to the 17th century in Ireland. Among several legends about the ring's creation, the most popular and widely accepted one revolves around Richard Joyce, a Galway native and fisherman who was separated from his beloved when he was captured by pirates and sold into slavery. While in captivity, Joyce learned the art of metalwork and fashioned the first Claddagh ring to symbolize his love, friendship, and loyalty to his sweetheart whom he hoped to return to someday. Eventually, Joyce gained his freedom and reunited with his love, presenting her with the ring he had crafted. The word \\"Claddagh\\" itself refers to the village of Claddagh in Galway, where this romantic story originated. Wearing the Claddagh Ring: The Art of Signaling Relationship Status The Claddagh ring has become a beloved symbol of Irish identity, and the subtle method of wearing it to signify one's relationship status has resonated with people worldwide. To demonstrate the nuances of this tradition, we will explore the various positions and their corresponding meanings: 1. Wear the Ring on the Right Hand, Heart Facing Outward To indicate that you are single and potentially open to love, wear the Claddagh ring on the ring finger of your right hand, with the heart pointing outward, away from your body. This positioning of the heart is an open invitation for someone to capture it and symbolizes that the wearer's heart is not yet committed to another. In this stance, the heart represents a willingness to explore potential relationships and an openness to finding love. 2. Wear the Ring on the Right Hand, Heart Facing Inward If you are in a relationship, you can convey that by wearing the Claddagh ring on the ring finger of your right hand, with the heart pointing inward, towards your body. In this position, the heart signifies that it has been claimed by someone and demonstrates that the wearer has made a commitment to their partner. The heart facing inward represents the emotional connection and devotion to another person, symbolizing a strong bond between the wearer and their partner. Beyond Relationship Status: Other Uses of the Claddagh Ring Beyond signaling one's relationship status, the Claddagh ring is also worn for other purposes in various contexts. The Claddagh ring is often used as a friendship ring, presented from one friend to another as a symbol of loyalty, trust, and support in their relationship. Additionally, it's common for the ring to be adopted as an engagement or wedding band, handed down through generations as a family heirloom, or given as a meaningful gift representing the promise of love, friendship, and loyalty. Conclusion The Claddagh ring's rich history and symbolism make it a timeless piece of art that transcends cultural boundaries. Its subtle codes provide a unique and eloquent way for people to communicate their relationship status without explicitly announcing it. Whether worn to signify one's search for love, a loving relationship, or a testament to loyalty and friendship, the Claddagh ring remains an enchanting emblem of human bonds and connects us to the shared values of love, friendship, and loyalty across the world."},{"instruction":"Read the bio below and try to give details on rolinha kross 's:    - image     - genre       - name     - background     - website     Bio: rolinha kross -lrb- born 16 june 1961 -rrb- is a dutch singer with a jewish/czech mother and a surinamese father . from an early age , she was fascinated by eastern european music and the yiddish language . she performed with various groups , a.o. with her mother , ilona cechova , under the name \`\` sense '' . she followed the vocalprogram in jazz and light music at the conservatory in hilversum -lrb- now in amsterdam -rrb- . immediately after the academy , she went on tour with the musical \`\` you 're the top '' , with willem nijholt in the lead . meanwhile she worked with klezmokum , solomon klezmorim and various jazz ensembles . the rolinha kross trio , together with bokkie vink and theo van tol , recorded an album \`\` tsigayner klezmer '' . many performances followed at home and abroad , among them canada and curaçao . a tour with ramses shaffy along theaters in the netherlands and belgium proceeded together with a production of ira gershwin with ernst daniël smid , mathilde santing en denise jannah . subsequently , rolinha worked together with the klezmer group mazzeltov , with whom she performed often at home and abroad , and recorded four albums . with mazzeltov rolinha performed three times at the concertgebouw in amsterdam . recently , rolinha plays in the musical performance \`\` iberia '' which she and perry dossett developed . with guitarist harold berghuis she delivers a program of yiddish poetry -lrb- translated by willy brill -rrb- that they have put to music . she often performs as a guest in the show of \`\` frank in person '' with jazz standards . on top of that , the newly created rolinha kross quartet brings dutch lyrics to gypsy jazz music . they are currently working on an album . rolinha kross regularly hosts singing workshops . her voice can be heard in commercials and commentary on documentaries .","output":"- Image: Rolinha Kross is a Dutch singer of mixed Jewish/Czech and Surinamese heritage.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the song that was a top ten hit in the UK from the David Live album?  Bowie moved to the US in 1974, initially staying in New York City before settling in Los Angeles. Diamond Dogs (1974), parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk, was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-apocalyptic city, and setting George Orwell's 1984 to music. The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits \\"Rebel Rebel\\" and \\"Diamond Dogs\\", and No. 5 in the US. To promote it, Bowie launched the Diamond Dogs Tour, visiting cities in North America between June and December 1974. Choreographed by Toni Basil, and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by Alan Yentob. The resulting documentary, Cracked Actor, featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with the singer's slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, paranoia, and emotional problems. He later commented that the accompanying live album, David Live, ought to have been titled \\"David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory\\". David Live nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at No. 2 in the UK and No. 8 in the US. It also spawned a UK No. 10 hit in Bowie's cover of Eddie Floyd's \\"Knock on Wood\\". After a break in Philadelphia, where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul. Matters came to a head in London in May in what became known as the \\"Victoria Station incident\\". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was captured on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. \\"I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology ... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism ... I'd discovered King Arthur\\". According to playwright Alan...

But just when I decide to retreat to my pre-1992 cocoon, I come across a dope artist that reminds me of why I love hip hop. Hip Hop Meditations gets back to hip hop's roots of drawing upon its surroundings and standing up for something beyond mere loot, which gets reflected here. Beyond the boom bap, Carlos draws heavily upon Afro-Cuban traditions, which considering hip hop's roots in the Caribbean, should be done more often. Speech from Arrested Development is a guest here, and I was intrigued enough to look him up and get reintroduced to a guy I thought had essentially retired from the game. (My bad).

Of all the developments of Institute week, naturally the one which filled J.W.'s thoughts with a sort of awed gladness was Marty's decision to offer himself for the ministry.  Joe Carbrook's right-about-face was much more dramatic, for J.W. saw, when the decision was made, that Marty could not have been meant for anything but a preacher.  It was as fit as you please.  As to Joe, previous opinion had been pretty equally divided; one side leaning to the idea that he might make a lawyer, and the other predicting that he was more likely to be a perpetual and profitable client for some other lawyer.

However, it is crucial to consider the negatives mentioned in the review as well. The reviewer points out that the cafe is often crowded, with long lines and limited seating options. Even though this is a negative aspect, it indirectly implies that the cafe is popular, which tends to be an underlying positive. Additionally, the decor is described as \\"hip, urban industrial.\\" This statement conveys that the place has an appealing atmosphere, adding to the overall positive vibe of the review.

Please answer the following question: Article: Ever since Canadian psychiatrist Michael R. Phillips, who works in China, released his report saying China's suicide rate from 1995 to 1999 reached 0.023 percent, the country has been ranked among those with the highest suicide rates in the world. But Jing Jun, a professor of sociology in Tsinghua University, challenges that view and presents the true picture through his nationwide research. Jing and his students took one year to set up the first national database on suicide rate to grasp the overall trend of suicides in China. They collected data from the Health Statistics Annuals of the World Health Organization (sample size 10 million), and the country's Health Statistics Annuals (which cover 100 million people). The database covers 23 years, from 1987 to 2009. Jing calculates the suicide rate in China based on these data. Though the suicide rate was comparatively high in the early years, his study shows it has dropped in recent years, as opposed to the ascending trend in the rest of the world. According to Jing's calculation, China's suicide rate had dropped to about 0.01 percent in 2004. In 2009, the figure dropped further to 0.007 percent, which is rather low compared with the global rate of 0.016 percent. Even if the \\"missing\\" suicides were added, China's suicide rate in 2009 would still be below 0.008 percent.[:Zxxk.Com] Jing has found that one of the main reasons why the suicide rate has dropped was the steady and big decline in the number of suicides committed by rural women. In the early years, researchers generally agreed that the suicide rate among Chinese women was higher than among men, which is pretty rare in the rest the world. But the suicide rate among Chinese women, especially in rural areas, has declined remarkably in recent years. In fact, it is almost equal to that of Chinese men. As a sociologist, Jing regards suicide as a social issue, and believes improvement of social policies will reduce the suicide rate even further. More people's lives can be saved if the authorities adjust to... Question: In Jing's opinion, what should be done to reduce the suicide? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Continue to improve social environment.\\"?

Available choices: (1). yes; (2). it is not possible to tell; (3). no; Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"The second sentence is not explicitly entailed by the first sentence as it presents a more extreme statement. In the first sentence, the statement being made is that Oklahoma's jocks (referring to athletes) may be no denser (meaning not more stupid) than many of its other Republican politicians. This sentence suggests a comparison between two groups - athletes and politicians - and highlights a potential similarity in terms of intelligence or lack thereof. On the other hand, the second sentence makes a definitive and absolute claim that Republican politicians from Oklahoma are the dumbest. This sentence declares that this particular group of politicians is not just denser than the athletes or others but is in fact the dumbest amongst the wider population. Although the first sentence implies that the intelligence of Oklahoma's Republican politicians leaves something to be desired and compares it unfavorably to that of athletes, it does not directly entail the second sentence. The first sentence leaves room for other groups to also have similarly low intelligence, while the second sentence specifically establishes Republican politicians from Oklahoma as being the dumbest.

The son of a gardener who lives in a barrio section of Los Angeles, Santiago works as a busboy in a Chinese restaurant and helps with his father's (Tony Plana) gardening business. His ultimate dream is to play football professionally. Due to his poverty and the fact that he plays solely for a club made up of Hispanics from a local car wash, he feels his chances are slim. Santiago is noticed by Glen Foy (Stephen Dillane), a former Newcastle United player who works as a car mechanic but still has ties to his old team. Glen arranges to get Santiago a tryout with Newcastle United, who recently signed talented new player Gavin Harris (Alessandro Nivola). Needing to get to England, Santiago begins to save his money in an old shoe, but his father finds the stash and takes it to buy a GMC truck to allow them to work for themselves, believing that Santiago's dreams are hopeless. His dream is not lost though, as his grandmother (Miriam Colon) sells off her jewellery to buy him a ticket to England. Glen warmly welcomes Santiago to his home and takes him to the tryout. Unfamiliar with the English style, he performs poorly. Glen convinces the team's manager that Santiago needs a month's trial to show his full potential. Santiago does not tell club nurse, Roz Harmison (Anna Friel), that he has asthma. After a month, a jealous teammate crushes Santiago's inhaler before a reserve game. An asthma flare-up prevents him from being able to run hard, and his coach lets him go. While on his way to the airport Santiago meets Gavin Harris, who was late to arrive to the team. Harris finds out what has happened and makes Santiago explain it to the manager. The manager allows Santiago to stay, provided he gets treatment for the asthma.

Review: It's sort of hard for me to say it, because I so greatly enjoyed both \\"Targets\\" and \\"Paper Moon\\", but I thought \\"The Last Picture show\\" was a somewhat fascinating but overly self-indulgent film. Its main positive, as far as I'm concerned, is the stunning photography. But for me the film had nothing to offer beyond surface beauty (and a kind of hidden beauty, at that). The characters were very hard to relate to or to care about. Basically you had this very slow pace and this naturalistic style of acting, but it was all there to prop up a very formulaic and predictable story, complete with all the trappings one would expect from any small town melodrama -- everything from the boy cheating with his teacher's wife to the handicapped kid who everyone picks on. It was like \\"American Graffiti\\" without the joy of life. Some might say this film is more realistic -- nowadays a lot of people seem to think that realism is the only virtue a film can possess. But for me the film was simply oppressive, and I want to see it again about as badly as I'd like to spend a few hours in that miserable town the characters live in. Maybe this film really just belongs to its time -- perhaps if I'd seen it in 1971 I would have been impressed by its novelty, just by seeing something different on the screen. But that would basically assume that I had never seen anything like, say, Godard's \\"Breathless\\". Maybe the overt references to classic films would have appealed to the movie geek in me and helped me to overlook some of the film's weaknesses. But in the post-Tarantino world that hardly seems unique or special either. It is interesting though how he uses the films in the film to give his own film more depth. We see 3 films as I recall in the picture show. First we see Vincente Minnelli's \\"Father of the Bride\\" -- Liz Taylor's exquisite looks provide a contrast to Sonny's girlfriend and Minnelli's studied upper-middle class milieu contrasts to the character's \\"real life\\" surroundings in a similar way. Later, clips from Howard Hawks' \\"Red River\\" emphasize the theme of a broken friendship between a mentor and a protégé. It really just reminds me that Bogdanovich is kissing his own mentor's butt, much as he did if I remember correctly by selecting a Hawks film as part of his own on-screen reverie with Boris Karloff in \\"Targets\\". I guess in 1971 this kind of thing was new but looking at it today it just seems self-indulgent, like so much of the rest of this film. Ultimately, I'd rather see another film by Hawks, Ford or Minnelli than to have Bogdanovich's film remind us of why they were so striking in such a less-than-subtle way. Maybe he intends to remind us of the giants whose time had passed -- all he really does is remind us how small he and most of his contemporaries are in relation. Now, what is this review like? Available choices: (I). negative. (II). positive.","output":"This review is (I). negative.  Reasoning: The user found the film \\"The Last Picture Show\\" to be overly self-indulgent and largely formulaic. They felt the characters were hard to connect with and the plot was predictable.

Nerves: Nerves are responsible for transmitting signals and information within the ant's body, but not for external communication with other ants. 2. Heat energy: Ants don't use heat energy to communicate with each other. 3. Sound: Though ants can make some sounds by rubbing their body parts together, they primarily rely on other methods for communication. 4. Binary code: Binary code is a human-made method of encoding data and not applicable to ant communication. 5. Light energy: Ants don't use light energy to communicate with each other. 6. Antennae: This is the correct answer. Ants communicate with their antennae by using chemical signals called pheromones. Ants touch their antennae to pheromone trails or other ants to exchange information. 7. Megaphones: Megaphones are human-made communication devices and not relevant to ant communication. 8. Hand signals: Ants do not have hands; they have legs and antennae. So, the correct answer is antennae.

The desirability of this score depends on the user's individual goals and the requirements for whatever they're pursuing (e.g., an exam, a certification, or a particular skill level).    - It is unclear if the reviewer had any prior experience or background knowledge in the subject, which could affect the perceived effectiveness of the study material.    - The minimal timeframe for preparation might not work for everyone, meaning potential users might expect better results with more extended study periods. In conclusion, the review has both flattering and unflattering elements. It showcases the effectiveness of the product in helping the user prepare and achieve a passing score within a short period, but it leaves some ambiguity regarding the user's prior knowledge and whether the score of 73 would be considered satisfactory for all potential users."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The first black American to win the Nobel Peace Prize was Ralph Bunche. Born on August 7, 1903, in Detroit, Michigan, Ralph Johnson Bunche was an American political scientist, academic, and diplomat. He received the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize in 1950 for his exceptional mediation efforts and success in negotiating peaceful agreements during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, particularly for the 1949 Armistice Agreements. Bunche was a trailblazer for black Americans as well as people of color worldwide. His accomplishments and accolades spanned various spheres, including education, diplomacy, and civil rights activism. He earned his undergraduate degree summa cum laude from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1927 and later completed his master's and doctorate degrees in government and international relations from Harvard University in 1928 and 1934, respectively. Bunche became the first black American to be awarded a PhD in political science from an American university. Throughout his illustrious career, Bunche held numerous significant positions in both academia and international diplomacy. He worked as a researcher and professor, teaching political science at universities such as Harvard, Northwestern, and Howard. Eventually, he transitioned to the world of diplomacy, where his expertise in colonization and racial conflict resolution was evidently instrumental in international conflict resolution efforts. In the early 1940s, Bunche served as an advisor to the U.S. State Department and played a vital role in creating the United Nations. As a participant in the 1945 San Francisco conference, he contributed to drafting the U.N. Charter, and later in that year, he joined the permanent staff of the United Nations as Head of the Trusteeship Division. Bunche's most significant achievement in diplomacy took place while working for the United Nations. In 1948, he was appointed as Principal Secretary of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) and later as Acting United Nations Mediator on Palestine. The following year, he played a pivotal role in securing the armistice agreements between Israel and the Arab States. As a direct consequence of these efforts, Ralph Bunche received the Nobel Peace Prize on December 10, 1950. In the 1950s and 1960s, Bunche actively participated in the civil rights movement, working closely with prominent figures like Martin Luther King Jr. He held prestigious positions throughout his life, such as serving as Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations, and actively engaged in global efforts to promote peace and combat racial discrimination. Ralph Bunche passed away on December 9, 1971, but left behind a legacy as a pioneering black American who dedicated his life to be an advocate for peace and equal rights."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Jack and Audrey Landry are a middle-aged couple with three daughters: Nora, Teri, and Dahlia (also known as Dolly). The eldest, Nora, is a supermodel based in Italy, who rarely comes home. Teri, the second daughter, is an independent business woman who lives with her boyfriend Bryan. Dahlia, the youngest, lives at home with her parents still, and changes her \\"look\\" often. In addition to the happy family, Nora's ex-boyfriend Sam works for Jack and is very close with the family as well. Their peaceful lives are disrupted when Nora breaks her leg in a car accident while on location in Italy, and returns home to recover. Teri discovers that her boyfriend Bryan has been cheating on her and promptly moves back in with her parents. For the first time in several years, all of the girls are back under the Landrys' roof. Shortly after a handsome Italian man by the name of Guillermo arrives at the Landry residence and introduces himself as Nora's boyfriend. Guillermo explains that he has come to ask Jack and Audrey for Nora's hand in marriage, Jack and Audrey agree and Nora accepts Guillermo's proposal. Audrey, Nora, Teri and Dolly quickly consume themselves in wedding plans while an unenthusiastic Jack watches the rising expenses. Teri finds out that she has lost her job, but a handsome co-worker, Lyle, who has also been laid off, invites her to join a start up marketing a technology he's developed. At first feelings between the two are only friendly, but soon evolve into romance. When Teri receives a bouquet from Bryan begging her to come back to him, Lyle realizes how he truly feels about Teri and spontaneously asks her to marry him. Teri accepts, and suddenly the Landrys become \\"a two wedding family\\". Jack has lunch with Lyle and explains that weddings cause a great deal of stress to the brides family, to which Lyle suggests that the solution lies in both weddings happening on the same day. To Jack's surprise, Nora and Teri agree. The plans, which had already been laid out, are now in upheaval. If this was not... The answer is:","output":"\\"Under One Roof: A Tale of Two Weddings\\" This movie title encapsulates the central premise of the story: two sisters getting married on the same day, and all the chaos that ensues as a result. The phrase 'Under One Roof' highlights the return of all the Landry daughters to their childhood home, as well as the common setting for the two weddings. 'A Tale of Two Weddings' serves as a play on the famous novel title \\"A Tale of Two Cities,\\" but adapts the phrasing to encompass the dual nature of the events taking place. Ultimately, this title promises humor, romance, and familial bonds that will delight audiences with its heartwarming and entertaining story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been. It is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life. Her name is not common, but every so often I meet people with the same name and ask them if they know of a relative to whom this happened, but, so far, no-one has known of her.

Answer:","output":"From the given bio of Saint Gangulphus of Burgundy, we can gather several details regarding his life, background, and the context of his martyrdom: 1. Time Period: Saint Gangulphus lived in the 8th century, as he died on May 11, 760 AD. His life occurred during the early medieval period. 2. Geographical Location: He belonged to the region of Burgundy, which is located in present-day France. 3. Religion: Saint Gangulphus is recognized as a martyr by the Catholic Church, which indicates that he was an adherent of the Catholic faith at the time. 4. Socio-economic Background: He was a courtier in the Burgundian court, depicting his high social standing during that period. The bio also mentions that his family dominated the region, showing that they exercised considerable power and influence. 5. Occupation and Lifestyle Transformation: Gangulphus was initially a great landowner with vast properties and wealth. However, he later decided to renounce his wealth and become a hermit, signifying a significant change in his lifestyle and values. 6. Historical Evidence: The historical existence of Saint Gangulphus can only be attested by a single document - a deed from the court of Pepin the Short dated 762. This indicates that there may be limited sources and evidence to provide a complete picture of his life. 7. Cause of Death: Gangulphus was killed by his wife's lover, who wished to remove him as a possible interference in their adulterous relationship. This implies that his death was the result of personal enmity and domestic issues rather than religious persecution or any political conflict. 8. Martyrdom: Despite the seemingly personal nature of his death, the Catholic Church venerates Gangulphus as a martyr, suggesting that his renunciation of wealth, devotion to his faith, and unjust murder are considered significant enough for him to be remembered and honored as a saint.

Here's how we can solve this task using the given list of integers: [-30, 60, 94, -14, -11] 1. First, sort the list in ascending order: [-30, -14, -11, 60, 94] 2. Initialize a variable, 'min_difference', to store the smallest absolute difference found so far. Set its initial value to the absolute difference between the first two numbers in the sorted list ('min_difference' = |-30 - (-14)| = 16) 3. Iterate through the sorted list, starting from index 2 (the third element) to the end:    - Calculate the absolute difference between the current number and the previous number in the list    - If this absolute difference is less than the current 'min_difference', update 'min_difference' with the new value 4. The final value of 'min_difference' will be the smallest possible absolute distance. Using this method, let's find the minimum absolute difference: - Initial min_difference: 16 - Absolute difference between -14 and -11: |-14 - (-11)| = 3 (min_difference is updated to 3) - Absolute difference between -11 and 60: |-11 - 60| = 71 (min_difference does not change, as 71 > 3) - Absolute difference between 60 and 94: |60 - 94| = 34 (min_difference does not change, as 34 > 3) After iterating through all the elements, the minimum absolute difference is found to be 3.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Where was the man who's musical career was interrupted in 1896 principal conductor in 1907?  Monteux's first high-profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor.

Here is a news article: Alabama's 2011 BCS championship trophy -- the exact one Nick Saban and Crimson Tide players lifted above their heads after their 21-0 victory over LSU -- shattered into thousands of tiny pieces Saturday, the result of what Crimson Tide officials are dubbing an unfortunate accident.            Associate Athletics Director for Football Communications Jeff Purinton said a parent of a current Crimson Tide player accidentally knocked over the crystal football, which was on display after Saturday's A-Day game inside the Mal Moore Athletic Facility. Purinton declined to disclose who sent the football tumbling from its perch.            Purinton said Alabama is in the initial stages of figuring out how to replace the trophy, which is made entirely of Waterford Crystal and is valued at 30,000.

Athletic department spokesman Jeff Purinton said the Waterford Crystal trophy, valued at 30,000, was on display in the Mal Moore Athletic Facility as part of the festivities for the Crimson Tide's spring football game Saturday in Tuscaloosa, Ala. He says the man stumbled on a rug that was under the trophy display.      Purinton said the school is working with the American Football Coaches Association, which owns the trophy, on getting a replacement.

The state has a large number of lakes, and is known by the slogan \\"Land of 10,000 Lakes\\". Its official motto is \\"L'Étoile du Nord\\" (French: \\"Star of the North\\"). Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the MinneapolisSaint Paul metropolitan area (known as the \\"Twin Cities\\"), the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the large majority of the European settlers emigrated from Scandinavia and Germany, and the state remains a center of Scandinavian American and German American culture. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, the Horn of Africa, and Latin America has broadened its historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation.  - Nunavut (from Inuktitut:  ) is the newest, largest, northernmost, and least populous territory of Canada. It was separated officially from the Northwest Territories on April 1, 1999, via the Nunavut Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act, though the boundaries had been contemplatively drawn in 1993. The creation of Nunavut resulted in the first major change to Canada's political map since the incorporation of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador in 1949.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.  - Speech is the vocalized form of communication based upon the syntactic combination of lexicals and names that are drawn from very large (usually about 1,000 different words) vocabularies. Each spoken word is created out of the phonetic combination of a limited set of vowel and consonant speech sound units (phonemes). These vocabularies, the syntax which structures them, and their sets of speech sound units differ, creating many thousands of different, and mutually unintelligible, human languages. Most human speakers are able to communicate in two or more of them, hence being polyglots. The vocal abilities that enable humans to produce speech also enable them to sing.  - The Isles of Scilly (or \\"\\") are an archipelago off the south western tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain. It is the southernmost location in England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most westerly in England.  - A university (\\"a whole\\", \\"a corporation\\") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects.  Universities typically provide undergraduate education and postgraduate education.  - A parliamentary republic is a republic that operates under a parliamentary system of government where the executive branch (the government) derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature (the parliament). There are a number of variations of parliamentary republics. Most have a clear differentiation between the head of government and the head of state, with the head of government holding real power, much like constitutional monarchies. Some have combined the roles of head of state and head of government, much like presidential systems, but with a dependency upon parliamentary power.  - Ontario, one of the 13 provinces and territories of Canada, is located in east-central Canada. It is Canada's most populous province by a large margin, accounting for nearly 40 percent of all Canadians, and is the second-largest province in total area. Ontario is fourth-largest in total area when the territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are included. It is home to the nation's capital city, Ottawa, and the nation's most populous city, Toronto.  - Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory located on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula. It has an area of and shares its northern border with Spain. The Rock of Gibraltar is the major landmark of the region. At its foot is a densely populated city area, home to over 30,000 Gibraltarians and other nationalities.  - A boot is a type of footwear and a specific type of shoe. Most boots mainly cover the foot and the ankle, while some also cover some part of the lower calf. Some boots extend up the leg, sometimes as far as the knee or even the hip. Most boots have a heel that is clearly distinguishable from the rest of the sole, even if the two are made of one piece. Traditionally made of leather or rubber, modern boots are made from a variety of materials. Boots are worn both for their functionality  protecting the foot and leg from water, extreme cold, mud or hazards (e.g., work boots may protect wearers from chemicals or use a steel toe) or providing additional ankle support for strenuous activities with added traction requirements (e.g., hiking)  and for reasons of style and fashion.  - Portugal (Portuguese: ), officially the Portuguese Republic (Portuguese: ), is a country on the Iberian Peninsula in Southwestern Europe. It is the westernmost country of mainland Europe. To the west and south it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean and to the east and north by Spain. The PortugalSpain border is long and considered the longest uninterrupted border within the European Union. The republic also includes the Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira, both autonomous regions with their own regional governments.  - The Royal Art Lodge was a collaborative group of artists based in Winnipeg , Manitoba , Canada , founded in 1996 by Michael Dumontier , Marcel Dzama , Neil Farber , Drue Langlois , Jon Pylypchuk , and Adrian Williams at the University of Manitoba . Hollie Dzama and Myles Langlois also worked with the group . In the last few years , only three of the original members remained , including Michael Dumontier , Marcel Dzama , and Neil Farber . The majority of the work produced by The Royal Art Lodge were small - scale drawings and paintings which often incorporated text . The group met for several years once a week to do many drawings each evening . Generally , at least three of the members contribute to each piece of work in a spontaneous response to the previous artist 's work on the page before stamp - dating the work . After a piece was deemed complete , the group then sorted and date stamped them . The work has been exhibited internationally including in England , Spain , Italy and France . The group became a launching pad for the solo careers of many of its members . After the group disbanded in 2008 , Michael Dumontier and Neil Farber continue to collaborate on works in a similar fashion .

Answer:","output":"General Average Sacrifice is a maritime law principle that refers to the intentional and voluntary sacrifice of a part of a ship's cargo, equipment, or any other belongings in order to preserve the overall safety of the vessel, its crew, and the remaining cargo during an emergency or in the face of a perilous situation. This principle can be traced back to ancient maritime laws and has since been recognized and incorporated into many modern legal systems. The response provided, \\"2nd. There must be a voluntary jettison, jactus, or casting away, of some portion of the joint concern for the purpose of avoiding this imminent peril, periculi imminentis evitandi causa, or, in other words, a transfer of the peril from the whole to a particular portion of the whole.\\" is an explanation of the principle referring to the conditions under which the sacrifice is made. The rationale behind the General Average Sacrifice is to acknowledge the fact that in dire situations, it may be necessary to sacrifice a part of the ship or its cargo to save the rest of the ship, its crew, and the remaining cargo, and even to prevent the potential for a greater loss. When a General Average Sacrifice occurs, the losses incurred as a result of the sacrifice are to be shared proportionally by all the parties involved, such as shipowners, charterers, and cargo owners. To qualify as a General Average Sacrifice, the following conditions must be met: 1. Imminent Peril: The situation must involve a real, tangible, and imminent threat to the safety of the vessel, its crew, or the cargo on board. 2. Voluntary and Reasonable Sacrifice: The decision to sacrifice a part of the ship or its cargo must be voluntary and based on rational assessment of the situation, ideally by a responsible person such as the ship's captain or a relevant authority. The sacrifice should be of a portion of the joint concern and made with the aim of avoiding the imminent danger. 3. Benefit to All Parties: The sacrifice must have the intention and effect of benefiting all the parties involved in the maritime venture. In other words, the sacrifice should have a measurable positive outcome towards preserving the safety of the ship, cargo, or crew. 4. Proper Sharing of Losses: The losses resulting from the sacrifice should be shared proportionally among all the parties involved, based on their respective interests in the venture. In conclusion, the response provided is a reasonable explanation of the General Average Sacrifice, specifically addressing the intentional and voluntary act of casting away a portion of the joint concern to prevent an imminent peril. However, it should be noted that this is just one of the various conditions that need to be met in order to classify an incident as a General Average Sacrifice. A full understanding of the principle requires considering all the conditions mentioned for a sacrifice to be recognized as a General Average, and how the losses are to be shared among the involved parties."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Reyes was arrested in Maui on Oct. 31 after he allegedly beat and shoved his wife, Katherine Ramirez in a hotel room, according to a police report. Ramirez had told police that Reyes grabbed her throat and shoved her through a sliding glass door during an argument in their hotel room. Hotel employees reported that Ramirez had injuries to her neck, wrist and thighs. Reyes pleaded not guilty but the criminal charges were soon dropped after lack of cooperation from Ramirez. He was placed on paid administrative leave by MLB as they conducted their own investigation.

When Jack orders them to surrender, Brock pulls out a gun and starts firing and Jack kills Brock in self-defense as Burroughs escapes. Among those who show up at the scene are fellow cops Ben Kehoe and Frank Cruise, and also Blake Wilson, the head of the Internal Affairs division. Cates tells Wilson that he shot Brock in self-defense as Brock had opened fire on him. Cruise picks up a burnt piece of twisted metal but says that he can't find Brock's gun. Jack, however finds a partly burnt picture of Reggie Hammond in Brock's bag. Jack then goes to visit Reggie in prison, with Reggie due for release in 24 hours. After getting hit in the face with a basketball by Reggie for refusing to promise Reggie his 500,000 unless Reggie helps him find the Ice Man, Jack discovers that Wilson plans to prosecute him on a charge of third degree manslaughter for the Arthur Brock shooting, with Wilson claiming that it was not self-defence and Jack is placed on suspension. Wilson also does not believe that the Iceman exists and believes Jack is wasting department resources looking for him.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. It is a consequence of the way sunlight is scattered by haze particles, say scientists. The US space agency probe continues to downlink the information gathered during its historic flyby of the dwarf planet on 14 July. As this data arrives on Earth, the team processes it and studies it. A black and white image of the hazes was previously released, showing them to be as high as 130km above Pluto's surface. That picture came from the Lorri camera and was acquired as New Horizons departed the dwarf, looking back to see sunlight skim the edge of the distant world. This new view comes from the Ralph colour camera system. Again, it is taken with Pluto backlit. Like Earth, the dwarf has a predominantly nitrogen atmosphere (albeit much more spare). But it is the interaction of this nitrogen with the Sun's ultraviolet light, in presence of another atmospheric constituent, methane, that is able to create the chunky haze particles. \\"That striking blue tint tells us about the size and composition of the haze particles,\\" said New Horizons team member Carly Howett from the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Boulder, Colorado. \\"A blue sky often results from scattering of sunlight by very small particles. On Earth, those particles are very tiny nitrogen molecules. On Pluto they appear to be larger - but still relatively small - soot-like particles we call tholins.\\" The principal investigator on the mission, Alan Stern, had teased Pluto fans in recent days, telling them to expect something special from this week's regular Thursday release of new images. \\"Who would have expected a blue sky in the Kuiper Belt? It's gorgeous,\\" he said in a Nasa statement. If you stood on Pluto and looked straight up, the sky would actually appear black because of the rarity of the atmosphere. \\"The haze is pretty thin, so you'd mostly see the colour of the haze as blue sunrises and sunsets,\\" Dr Howett explained to BBC News. The other important piece of news to come out concerns the detection of water-ice at many locations on the 2,300km-wide dwarf's surface. More volatile ices tend to dominate the surface, so understanding why the water-ice is seen strongly in some places is an interesting observation that will need to be followed up, the team says. \\"We expected water-ice to be there, but we've searched for water-ice in Pluto's spectrum for decades and not seen it before now,\\" tweeted Alex Parker, also from SwRI. Since 14 July, New Horizons has moved more than 100 million km beyond Pluto. And this puts it about five billion km from Earth. The vast separation makes for very low data rates. It will be well into 2016 before all the information is on the ground.

Steven Ellison (born October 7, 1983), known by his stage name Flying Lotus or sometimes FlyLo, is an experimental multi-genre music producer, electronic musician, DJ, filmmaker, and rapper from Los Angeles, California. Flying Lotus has released five studio albums--1983 (2006), Los Angeles (2008), Cosmogramma (2010), Until the Quiet Comes (2012) and You're Dead! (2014)--to critical acclaim. At his mother's house, Ellison saw an advertisement on Adult Swim/Cartoon Network asking for song submissions. He sent some in, under the name Flying Lotus (a moniker inspired by lucid dreaming) and was accepted.  Around this time, he was interning at the pioneering hip hop label Stones Throw Records. Days were spent in their offices, and nights were spent at his grandmothers, working on the music that would become his debut album: 1983. The record (released on LA indie label Plug Research) was an early touchstone for Ellison's eclectic creative mission, forging compressed, spacey and Eastern sounding hip-hop beats, that summoned Madlib as much as Dntel, while sampling as far back as 70s Japanese proto-synthpop and 60s jazz harp. It would also feature Laura Darlington, who went on to become a vocal fixture of future albums.  In 2006, Ellison participated in that year's annual Red Bull Music Academy, which took place in Melbourne, Australia. In 2007, he announced on CSU-Fullerton's Titan Radio that he signed with Warp Records (home to Prefuse 73, Autechre, Boards of Canada, and Aphex Twin). Following his Warp debut, the six-track Reset EP, he quickly became one of the label's cornerstone artists and released his second studio album, titled Los Angeles, on June 10, 2008.  His first release on Warp, Reset EP, gave his new audience a taste of the steady grooves and darker breaks that had earned him the move. As Ellison's profile rose, he decided to commandeer the limelight by launching his own label, Brainfeeder, to house his friends (Samiyam, Ras G, etc.) and unite a large section of the LA beat scene under one label.

The information provided in the premise is centered around Clinton's actions involving Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Israel in the context of the peace process. The two key actions mentioned in the premise include: 1) Rolling out the carpet to enhance Arafat's prestige: This statement implies that Clinton was trying to increase Arafat's reputation and standing by offering him a warm reception and support. This can be interpreted as an attempt to strengthen Arafat's position in delicate peace negotiations and promote a peaceful resolution between the Palestinian Authority and Israel. 2) Sending Israel a warning not to screw up the peace process by provoking further conflict: Clinton's actions are also clearly focused on ensuring that Israel remains committed to the peace process and does not engage in behaviors that could disrupt progress or escalate tensions. This statement conveys the importance the Clinton administration placed on the peace process and their willingness to address any potential threats to its success. Given this context, the hypothesis involving North Korea is not supported by the premise. It is important to note that the premise does not mention North Korea or any other country beyond Palestine and Israel. The actions and intentions of the Clinton administration, as stated in the premise, are centered on achieving peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In summary, the hypothesis \\"Administration officials said Clinton was sending a warning to North Korea.\\" is not true based on the provided premise. The information given focuses on Clinton's efforts and intentions towards facilitating peace between Israel and Palestine, and does not involve North Korea in any way.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who accidentally puts the diaper on while the baby crawls off?  Babysitter Jeannie (voiced by Julie Bennett) is instructed to look after the baby while his mother (also voiced by Julie Bennett) goes out. However, Jeannie pays more attention to talking on the telephone apathetically than her actual babysitting. In the midst of Tom and Jerry's usual fighting, they see the baby crawling out of its pram. Any attempt to return the baby to where it came from simply results in the baby escaping from the pram again. During one escape, the baby crawls into Spike's dog house. Tom accidentally grabs Spike instead of the baby, and is promptly attacked, scratched and bit. This time, Tom angrily brings the baby back to Jeannie herself, who hits Tom over the head with a broom, thinking that Tom has taken the baby away from her. Realising that the baby is no longer worth the trouble, Tom does nothing the next time that it crawls from its pram. However, he and Jerry are forced to react after the baby crawls down to the street and into a 100-story mixed-use skyscraper construction site. The baby crawls from one steel beam to another while the two look on. Jerry manages to catch up, and saves the baby from crawling off a wooden plank lying on the 50th floor by grabbing his diaper. The diaper comes loose, and the baby falls, but he is then caught by Tom. Tom attempts to put the baby's diaper back on, but in the impending confusion, ends up putting the diaper on himself while the baby crawls off, nonchalantly. Tom and Jerry catch up with the baby, only to lose it again, and fearing that it has crawled into a cement mixer on the 30th floor, the two dive straight in, only to find that the baby never did enter the mixer but instead playing with a hammer.

But he manages to survive after 227 days of fighting against all the hardships of the sea. Pi, the lead character in Oscar-winning Ang Lee's new movie Life of Pi, went through an inspiring journey of growth and self-discovery. So did 19-year-old Suraj Sharma, the Indian actor who plays him. But it was a lucky chance that opened up the opportunity for the new star. Sharma was a regular student who lived with his mathematician parents in Delhi, India. As the director traveled to Mumbai to find his Pi, the teenager went along with his younger brother, who had acted in a couple of movies, to audition . But little did Sharma know that he would end up winning the role from 3, 000 hopefuls. Lee said he saw Pi in Sharma: \\"Not only does he have a compelling and wise look. He has this rare talent.\\" The director said that in the final round, Sharma gave one of the \\"most compelling readings we had.

Each state has different requirements for becoming a real estate agent or broker. Before you begin undergoing the necessary training, make sure you meet the basic requirements. In Washington, in order to be a real estate agent you must:  Be at least 18 years of age Have at least a high school diploma or the equivalent, such as a GED You will have to engage in nearly two years of education to get your real estate license in Washington. Use that time to your advantage to gain experience in the field. While not directly related to obtaining your license, certain experiences are invaluable to your success as an agent.  Try to get an internship or office job in a real estate firm. Even an administrative position that seems only tangentially related to buying and selling houses can teach you hard work and give you a sense of what the industry is like. Not to mention, if you make a good impression on someone in the industry you could snag a job after you get your license. Ask an experienced real estate agent if you can shadow them for a day or week to see what the industry is like just to make sure this career path is really for you. In Washington, there are specific educational requirements you must complete before taking the real estate exam.  Make sure the courses you enroll in are approved by the Washington State Department of Licensing. If you're unsure if a class is approved, give the Department of Licensing a call during office hours just to be sure. You don't want to invest time and money in a course that won't be accepted when you apply to take the exam. A list of approved curriculum is found on the Washington Department of Licensing website, as well as some approved schools.  Classes are available online, through colleges such as Kaplan, and in-person at universities and community colleges. Find a route that works for you and enroll. Fees vary from program to program, but tuition can cost as much as 300. Be prepared to spend some money during the process of obtaining your license. You must complete 90 total hours of coursework within a 2-year time frame. These courses are extensive and demanding, so be prepared to commit.  Your 90 hours include a 60-hour course in real estate fundamentals. This course is an overview of the real estate trade. You will learn about various real estate firms and what they do in communities. You will learn about policies like contract laws, fair housing laws, property ownership rights, and listing agreements. There's also an extensive overview of the buying and selling process, and a good deal of basic real estate vocabulary you must commit to memory.  The additional 30 hours are comprised of a course in real estate practices. Here, you will learn about basic business skills and procedures in the real estate world. You will learn how to evaluate, price, and market property as well as a variety of negotiation and sales techniques. You will also learn about the closing process and how to conduct real estate math. The state exam is hard. Knowing the information and having completed the necessary coursework does not guarantee you will pass. The structure of the questions and specific vocabulary can throw even the most well-researched test taker. Exam prep, whether through software or a test prep class, can help you get a passing score on the real estate exam.  Free practice exams are available online, but are not subject to as rigorous review as paid courses and prep work. Online universities offer test prep courses for a variety of state real estate exams, including Washington. Self-guided exam prep guides are available for purchase online, which include information on the format of the test, information you'll need to know, and a variety of practice exams.  You can purchase exam prep books, either on Amazon or from a local bookstore, that help with real estate test prep. However, make sure you get the most recent edition as real estate exams are subject to change. Going to a used bookstore is not the best option if you're going the book route, as you're likely to find a dated exam guide. Summary:","output":"1.

The two topics are unrelated, so the statement is not the correct answer to your question. Huo Guang, a renowned Chinese statesman and politician, was born in 110 BC and died in 68 BC. He served during the Western Han dynasty of China and played a crucial role in consolidating the rule of Emperor Wu. Following the death of Emperor Wu, Huo Guang acted as a regent for three successive emperors. He was instrumental in preserving the stability of the Western Han dynasty, particularly through his vision and outstanding political skills. Now, to address the statement you provided: \\"The liquor monopoly lasted only from 98 to 81 BC, and the salt and iron monopolies were eventually abolished in early Eastern Han.\\" This statement refers to the monopolies on industries imposed by Emperor Wu during his reign. Emperor Wu actively initiated various state monopolies, including the liquor, salt, and iron industries, as a means to increase the revenue for the Western Han government and enforce his expansionist policy. The liquor monopoly indeed lasted from 98 to 81 BC, whereas the salt and iron monopolies were abolished during the early Eastern Han period, which began in 25 AD when the Western Han dynasty was usurped by the Xin dynasty (9-23 AD).

I had seen it before, those fuzzy, furry leaves and stalks, with the pretty, star-pointed purple flowers, but up until that moment that I saw them sitting in a basket at the market stalls, I admit I had never taken notice of it as a food. It grow along cracks in stone walls and along the roadside near my home in Settignano, which is blooming with spring goodness right now: robinia (black locust) trees, wild garlic (three-cornered leek) and even elderflowers are already bursting. I asked the vendor just to double check, “Is this borage?” “Si,” Came the answer, “Borragine.” He confirmed. “I’ve had it in ravioli,” I started to say, “Brava!” He said, as if we were about to start a guessing game on what could be done with it. Actually, there’s a lot that can be done with it. If you can use it as a ravioli filling with ricotta, then you can imagine it taking the place of spinach in gnudi, too, but also soups or frittata or stirred through polenta. I learned that the flowers are just as delicious, if not more interesting, for their delicate cucumber-like flavour — people told me of their use in salads or cocktails like Pimms, and someone even mentioned she freezes them in ice cubes, what a pretty idea for those first warm nights when you can dine al fresco, homemade cocktail in hand. Then there’s risotto and of course the fritters, much like these ones. Or you can simply deep fry the clusters of buds that haven’t yet burst open like these deep-fried robinia flowers. borage and ricotta crepes The problem, I was thinking, as I took home my bag of borage, is that I can’t decide what to make. There’s simply too much choice. I consulted two of my favourite books that also happen to be cookbooks. Patience Gray’s Honey from a Weed and Luigi Ballerini’s A Feast of Weeds. Both had wonderful ideas for borage (and indeed many other edible, foraged plants). The cooking probably took - two hours - an hour - a day - not enough information","output":"In Patience Gray's Honey from a Weed, she mentions using young borage leaves in a frittata, simply by combining them with eggs and a little seasoning. She also writes about making a soup with borage, potatoes, and leeks, blending everything together with the addition of a little cream to finish it off. The soup is said to have a fresh, delicious flavor, not unlike leek and potato soup, but with a hint of the cucumber-like taste that borage is known for. In Luigi Ballerini's A Feast of Weeds, he suggests making borage and ricotta crepes. The recipe involves making a simple crepe batter, combining the cooked and chopped borage leaves with ricotta cheese and a pinch of nutmeg, and then spooning the mixture into the crepes, folding them into packets, and baking them in the oven until heated through and slightly crispy on the edges. Ballerini's recipe also calls for serving the crepes with a drizzle of melted butter and Parmesan cheese, a classic and decadent Italian touch. After spending some time browsing through these two cookbooks and contemplating the many possible uses for borage in my dishes, I decided to go ahead and try making the borage and ricotta crepes. The result was wonderful - the crepes were light and delicate, while the filling was creamy and packed with the unique flavor of borage. The process of making the crepes and the filling took about two hours, from start to finish. This included the time spent cleaning and blanching the borage leaves, which can take some time due to their fuzzy and slightly prickly nature. It's important to choose young, fresh leaves for this type of preparation, as they are more tender and less prickly than older leaves. It wasn't the quickest of meals to prepare, but it was well worth the effort. As I enjoyed my borage and ricotta crepes with a simple green salad and a glass of white wine, I couldn't help but think of how fortunate I was to have stumbled upon this versatile and delicious plant. The fact that it grows wild in my own backyard makes it even more special, as it's a constant reminder of the beauty and abundance of nature, and the many culinary delights that can be enjoyed if we just take the time to explore and embrace the natural world around us. In the end, my foray into cooking with borage turned out to be a wonderful experience, one that left me with a newfound appreciation for this unassuming, yet delightful plant. I now look forward to trying even more recipes and preparations using borage, with the goal of incorporating it into my culinary repertoire on a regular basis. Whether it's in ravioli or gnudi, soups or frittatas, or simply as a garnish for a refreshing cocktail, borage is a plant that certainly deserves a place at the table."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Trouble at the top: My own private car crisis Guest Post by Cindy DiPietrantonio, Chief Operations Officer, Jones Apparel Group You can only imagine how I was feeling last week when I came home from the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit. Inspired. Empowered. After three days in Washington, D.C., where we heard from Hillary Clinton, CEOs like Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo PEP and Carol Bartz of Yahoo yhoo , Warren Buffett brk.a , and even the President of the United States, I was feeling practically invincible. After the Summit, I took the train back home to Philadelphia. You won’t believe what happened when I arrived at 30th Street Station. I can’t find my car. So I walk all six floor in the garage with my luggage, black bag with all my heavy files, heels and a hot pink yoga mat that I had gotten at the Summit. I walk ALL six floors again with my luggage, black bag with all my heavy files, heels and the hot pink yoga mat. So I go to security and explain my issue. Velma, the security guard on duty, offers to search the garage with me, and when I ask if I can leave my stuff while we do that, she says “Not if you want to see it when you get back.” Okay. So Velma walks me all six floors with my luggage, black bag with all my heavy files, heels and the hot pink yoga mat. No car. (By the way, Velma was eyeing my hot pink yoga mat.) Velma calls Tyrone, her manager. Tyrone comes and tells me that people are always losing their cars because they think they drove up the ramp when they really drove down the ramp. He repeats this point as he drives me up and down the ramps in his 1972 Chevrolet with his muffler dragging and… So we call the police and report it stolen. Now I am upset but being cool about it, even though my car, a 2010 BMW 550 GT, is seven months old and has my razzle-dazzle camera with my expensive lens in the trunk and I feel invaded. This is my first big girl car (no more Mom SUV). Two hours and lots of paperwork later, I call my husband, Dominic. I didn’t want to get him concerned. I tell Dominic the bad news, and what does he tell me? My car is in the driveway. Because, he reminds me, I got dropped off at the station. So I went back to Velma and Tyrone and told them, in a whisper, my mistake. I didn’t have the heart to tell them that I had just come from the Most Powerful Women Summit.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the subgenre of music that can range from soulful to minimalistic that is based around squelchy, deep electronic tones? , can you please find it?   House music is a genre of electronic dance music created by club DJs and music producers in Chicago in the early 1980s. Early house music was generally characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms provided by drum machines, off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, which preceded and influenced it, as both were DJ and record producer-created dance music, house was more electronic and minimalistic. The mechanical, repetitive rhythm of house was one of its main components. Many house compositions were instrumental, with no vocals; some had singing throughout the song with lyrics; and some had singing but no actual words. House music developed in Chicago's underground dance club culture in the early 1980s, as DJs from the subculture began altering the pop-like disco dance tracks to give them a more mechanical beat and deeper basslines. As well, these DJs began to mix synth pop, rap, Latin, and even jazz into their tracks. Latin music, particularly salsa clave rhythm, became a dominating riff of house music. It was pioneered by Chicago DJs such as  Chip E., and Steve Hurley. It was influenced by Chicago DJ and record producer Frankie Knuckles, the Chicago acid-house electronic music group Phuture, and the Tennessee DJ/producer Mr. Fingers. The genre was originally associated with the Black American LGBT subculture but has since spread to the mainstream. From its beginnings in the Chicago club and local radio scene, the genre spread internationally to London, then to American cities such as New York City and Detroit, and eventually globally.Chicago house music acts from the early to mid-1980s found success on the US dance charts on various Chicago independent record labels that were more open to sign local house music artists. These same acts also experienced some success in the United Kingdom, garnering hits in that country. Due to this success, by the late 1980s, Chicago house music acts suddenly found themselves being offered...

The band is currently composed of Matthew Tuck (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Michael Paget (lead guitar, backing vocals), Jason Bowld (drums) and Jamie Mathias (bass guitar). Former members include Michael Thomas, Jason James and Nick Crandle; the latter were on bass. They were formed under the name Jeff Killed John and started their music career by covering songs by Metallica and Nirvana. In an interview, Matt Tuck said that Bullet for My Valentine were going to start work on a new album before the Rule Britannia Tour which took place between 1 December 2013 till the 6 December 2013 in which the band played arenas in Britain supported by Young Guns and Asking Alexandria. In the interview Matt also said that they were strongly considering working with Terry Date, who has worked with bands such as Pantera and Deftones. He also said the band would bring back the thrash metal elements from Scream Aim Fire.  In November 2013, Bullet for My Valentine revealed though their Facebook page they were working on a new song. A short snippet of the song, titled \\"Raising Hell,\\" was released on Matt Tuck's Vine profile on the 15th. The song was first played three days later via BBC Radio 1's Rock Show. It was made available for streaming and a music video for the song was released a week later.  In 2014, Matt announced on Twitter that the band were entering the studio to record a fifth album. On August 28th, the band appeared on paranormal television show Most Haunted for an investigation at the Newton House in Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire.  In an interview with Kerrang! on 21 January 2015, Matt revealed that Bullet for My Valentine will be hitting the studio next month with producer Colin Richardson who produced both The Poison and Scream Aim Fire, rather than Terry Date, who was the suggested producer initially. Tuck also said that their fifth album will be their heaviest album yet. On 9 February 2015, Bullet for My Valentine announced the departure of bassist Jason James, adding that they would announce a replacement when they felt \\"the time was right.\\" They went on to say that until the announcement, they'd be busy and focused on recording their new record.  It was announced on the band's Facebook page in 2015 that a new song, \\"No Way Out,\\" would debut on BBC Radio 1 on 17 May 2015.

If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.  Paragraph: Bimmy and Harold are both four years old and are about to start attending school. Before that though, it is important that they have adequate supplies to be prepared. Bimmy's parents, who both have worn glasses their whole lives, took him to the store to pick up folders and pencils. While there, they bumped into Harold and his parents, who do not wear glasses. They quickly exchanged hellos before moving on with their shopping.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which boy will more likely struggle to see the chalkboard when they start school?

Solve this problem.","output":"To solve the equation 84*p - 5 = 83*p for p, we need to isolate p on one side of the equation by performing some algebraic manipulations. Here's the step-by-step process: 1. Write down the original equation:    84*p - 5 = 83*p 2. To start isolating \\"p\\", move all terms containing \\"p\\" to one side of the equation. In this case, we'll subtract 83*p from both sides. This will leave us with the following equation:    (84*p - 83*p) - 5 = 0 3. Now, simplify the equation by combining like terms. Since 84*p and -83*p both have \\"p\\" in them, we can combine them:    (84 - 83)*p - 5 = 0    1*p - 5 = 0 4. Now, let's move the constant term to the other side of the equation to completely isolate \\"p\\". In this equation, the constant term is -5. To move it to the other side, add 5 to both sides of the equation:    1*p = 5 5. Lastly, to find the value of \\"p\\", divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \\"p\\", which in this case is 1:    p = 5 / 1 Therefore, the solution to the equation 84*p - 5 = 83*p is:    p = 5"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: It's not yet clear how many other cases — including the 400 inmates on the state's death row — could be affected, experts said.      “The substance of the ruling would affect the vast majority of Florida’s death row inmates,\\" said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, which opposes capital punishment.      \\"The remaining question would be: Will the Supreme Court consider this to have retroactive effect and retroactive to when?”      He said he expects the ruling will unleash a wave of litigation.      “Every defendant in Florida whose death sentence was imposed in this matter will be challenging the constitutionality of his or her death sentence under Hurst,\\" Dunham said.      Connie Fuselier, the mother of Hurst's victim, said she doesn’t care if he is executed at this point, but she can’t bear the thought of more legal proceedings.      “It’s been hell,” she told NBC News. “When you get to thinking it’s over with, it starts all over again. It’s nerve-racking.”      At one point during the many appeals the case has spawned, Fuselier said, she told the prosecutor she’d be satisfied with a sentence of life without parole.      “I just want it over with. I want to know he has no more appeals,” she said.      She said the case’s 17-year journey through the courts, with the rehashing of the gruesome details of her daughter’s death, has taken a toll on the family.      “I have post-traumatic stress. I have depression,” she said. “It’s like the family evaporated. We’re all here, but it’s like we’re not.” ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — Florida's unique system for sentencing people to death is unconstitutional because it gives too much power to judges — and not enough to juries — to decide capital sentences, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.      The 8-1 ruling said that the state's sentencing procedure is flawed because juries play only an advisory role in recommending death while the judge can reach a different decision.      The decision could trigger new sentencing appeals from some of the 390 inmates on the Florida's death row, a number second only to California. But legal experts said it may apply only to those whose initial appeals are not yet exhausted.      The court sided with Timothy Lee Hurst, who was convicted of the 1998 murder of his manager at a Popeye's restaurant in Pensacola. A jury divided 7-5 in favor of death, but a judge imposed the sentence.      Florida's solicitor general argued that the system was acceptable because a jury first decides if the defendant is eligible for the death penalty.      Writing for the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said a jury's \\"mere recommendation is not enough.\\" She said the court was overruling previous decisions upholding the state's sentencing process.      \\"The Sixth Amendment requires a jury, not a judge, to find each fact necessary to impose a sentence of death,\\" Sotomayor said.      The justices sent the case back to the Florida Supreme Court to determine whether the error in sentencing Hurst was harmless, or whether he should get a new sentencing hearing.      Justice Samuel Alito dissented, saying that the trial judge in Florida simply performs a reviewing function that duplicates what the jury has done.      Under Florida law, the state requires juries in capital sentencing hearings to weigh factors for and against imposing a death sentence. But the judge is not bound by those findings and can reach a different conclusion. The judge can also weigh other factors independently. So a jury could base its decision on one particular aggravating factor, but a judge could then rely on a different factor the jury never considered.      In Hurst's case, prosecutors asked the jury to consider two aggravating factors: the murder was committed during a robbery and it was \\"especially heinous, atrocious or cruel.\\" But Florida law did not require the jury to say how it voted on each factor. Hurst's attorney argued that it was possible only four jurors agreed with one, while three agreed with the other.      Sotomayor said Florida's system is flawed because it allows a sentencing judge to find aggravating factors \\"independent of a jury's fact-finding.\\"      The Supreme Court ruled in 2002 that a defendant has the right to have a jury decide whether the circumstances of a crime warrant a sentence of death.      Florida is one of only three states that do not require a unanimous jury verdict when sentencing someone to death. The others are Alabama and Delaware.      Stephen Harper, a law professor who runs the Death Penalty Clinic at Florida International University, said it's unlikely the Supreme Court ruling will open the door for most Florida death-row inmates to new sentencing hearings. He said the Florida decision is based on a previous Arizona ruling that was already found not to be retroactive.      \\"In general, it will not be retroactively applied,\\" Harper said.      But he added that Florida inmates whose initial appeals have not been exhausted may be able to argue that the latest decision applies to them. And, he said, any capital cases that are awaiting trial would likely be delayed while state legislators and the Florida Supreme Court sort out the next steps.      Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said her office is reviewing the ruling.      News of the high court's decision stunned Florida legislators. Florida House Speaker Steve Crisafulli, who learned of the ruling while he was giving a speech to open the state's annual legislative session, said the Supreme Court had \\"impeccable timing.\\"      Crisafulli said House legal experts would begin to review the ruling. Rep. Matt Gaetz, an attorney who has dealt with capital punishment during his legislative career, predicted that Florida legislators would act swiftly to get the death penalty \\"right back on track.\\"      Cassandra Stubbs, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Capital Punishment Project, said the ruling \\"restored the central role of the jury in imposing the death penalty.\\" She called it another step toward ending capital punishment since juries across the country have been increasingly reluctant to impose death sentences.      ___      Associated Press writers Curt Anderson in Miami, Gary Fineout in Tallahassee, Florida, and Tamara Lush in St. Petersburg, Florida, contributed to this report. ||||| The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday struck down Florida's death penalty system on the grounds that judges, not juries, decide the key facts that determine whether a killer is condemned to die.      In an 8-1 ruling, the justices said this judge-driven system violates a defendant's right to a jury trial.      The ruling will likely give new sentencing hearings to inmates who were recently sentenced to death in Florida, but the justices in the past have said such new rulings do not apply automatically to old cases.      Tuesday's ruling relied on a 2002 decision that struck down Arizona's judge-driven system for deciding death penalty cases. Despite that ruling in the case of Ring vs. Arizona, the Florida courts had continued to uphold death sentences there on the grounds that juries had recommended death as the proper verdict.      But on Tuesday, the justices decided Florida must move to a sentencing system that gives juries the final word. The ruling will mean a new sentencing hearing for Timothy Hurst, who was convicted of stabbing and killing a a co-worker at a Popeye's restaurant in 1998.      Join the conversation on Facebook >>      He was tried twice, and the jury, though divided, recommended a death sentence, and the judge imposed one.      But Justice Sonia Sotomayor, speaking for the court, said Florida should have followed the 2002 decision by putting the full weight on the jury.      \\"The 6th Amendment protects a defendant's right to an impartial jury,\\" she said. \\"This right required Florida to base Timothy Hurst's death sentence on a jury verdict, not a judge's fact-finding. Florida's death sentencing scheme, which required the judge alone to find the existence of an aggravating circumstance, is therefore unconstitutional.\\"      Dissenting alone, Justice Samuel A. Alito said the justices had upheld Florida's system in the past. \\"Under the Florida system, the jury plays a critically important role,\\" he said, by weighing the evidence and recommending whether the murderer should die.

Strapping Young Lad was known for its energetic live performances, mostly owing to the eccentric appearance and persona of Devin Townsend. Adrian Begrand of PopMatters wrote \\"Nobody in metal today has the same kind of commanding stage presence as the self-professed Bald Bastard, Devin Townsend\\", and called Strapping Young Lad \\"one of the best live bands around\\". Townsend was famous for his on-stage antics; he integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows and interacted heavily with the audience. He would deliver comical, and often insulting remarks to them, organize circle pits, and parody heavy metal clichés as well as the genre itself.The band's humorous approach was also evidenced by a song frequently performed live from 1997, entitled \\"Far Beyond Metal\\", a parody of classic heavy metal. It became a live staple and a fan favorite, with lyrics changing practically every performance. Although it was recorded live on No Sleep 'till Bedtime, and on the For Those Aboot to Rock DVD, a studio version was not recorded until 2006 during The New Black sessions. The band was also sarcastic about their own Canadian heritage, they used \\"Blame Canada\\", a comedic anti-Canada song from South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut as intro music at many concerts in 2003 and 2004.For a period of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo material live. In 1998, after the release of Infinity, they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: Why were game animals introduced by acclimatisation societies?  A: The islands making up New Zealand originally had no land mammals apart from bats.  Does the answer correctly answer the question Choose from: -- yes. -- no.","output":"Yes, game animals were introduced by acclimatisation societies primarily due to the lack of native land mammals in regions like New Zealand. These societies aimed to enhance the biodiversity of their respective regions by importing and acclimating foreign species to local environments. However, the introduction of game animals by these societies had both positive and negative consequences. In the 19th century, European settlers in countries like New Zealand and Australia founded acclimatisation societies with the primary objective of making these newly settled lands more familiar and comfortable. Adding game animals to the local ecology not only provided settlers with recreational hunting opportunities but also an additional source of food, leading to increased self-sufficiency. This is evidenced by the introduction of various animals like rabbits, deer, pheasants, and trout to the islands of New Zealand. Acclimatisation societies took great care in selecting the species to be introduced and closely monitored their progress in adapting to their new environments. However, these societies failed to predict the long-term ecological consequences of introducing new and, in many cases, invasive species to ecosystems that had developed in isolation over thousands of years. In many instances, the introduction of game animals caused irreversible damage to local habitats and led to the decline or even extinction of indigenous flora and fauna. In New Zealand, for example, the introduction of rabbits, possums, and stoats led to widespread devastation of local ecosystems, causing significant loss of native vegetation and bird life. These invasive species, which had no natural predators in their new environments, multiplied rapidly and overwhelmed the native species for resources, ultimately leading to imbalanced ecosystems and the disruption of natural food chains. In conclusion, game animals were introduced by acclimatisation societies in countries like New Zealand to create a sense of familiarity for European settlers, provide recreational hunting opportunities, and increase self-sufficiency through alternative food sources. While these initiatives were successful in their aims, they also resulted in unforeseen ecological consequences, disrupting ecosystems and threatening the existence of native species. Today, many conservation efforts are focused on mitigating the damage caused by these introduced game animals and restoring local ecosystems to their former balance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what does loud noises often do to mammals?\\" is \\"comfort them\\", given that  loud noises can cause mammals to startle? Answer:","output":"No, I would not agree that the right answer to the question \\"what does loud noises often do to mammals?\\" is \\"comfort them.\\" On the contrary, loud noises typically cause discomfort, stress or even fear in mammals. This is because loud noises can be perceived as a potential threat or danger in their environment, leading them to startle or display other defensive behaviors. Furthermore, mammals have evolved to be sensitive to loud noises as a survival mechanism. This sensitivity allows them to effectively respond to potential threats, such as predators or natural events like storms or avalanches. Consequently, loud noises can trigger a \\"fight or flight\\" response in many mammals, increasing their heart rate, adrenaline production, and other physiological changes that help them quickly respond to perceived danger. In general, loud noises are more likely to cause stress, discomfort, or fear in mammals rather than providing any sense of comfort or relaxation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A documentary about two rocks bands, spanning a number of years. Brian Jonestown Massacre and the Dandy Warhols. What makes it special is the examination of the complex contrasting personalities and the ironies of success and failure. Anton Newcombe, the main man of Brian Jonestown Massacre, is widely recognised as a musical genius not only by his colleagues, his friends and rivals the Dandy Warhols, but also by record producers and most people who have worked with him. Sadly he and his band members are also incapable of integrating with the real world. Newcombe picks fights with band members on stage or with members of the audience (getting arrested at one point for literally kicking in the head of a fan). Newcombe knows no limits  he plays between 40 and 100 different instruments, writes and produces all BJM's music, can produce enough songs to fill a whole album in a single day, has a prophet-like obsessiveness with his own musical genius, but is also a heavy drugs user, flies into rages at the slightest compromise of his own artistic integrity, orders his band members about as if they are lower forms of life, and can blow deals as fast as he makes them. BJM go through a large number of record labels in fast succession  they sign them up as soon as they realise Newcombe's talents and let them go as soon as they realise he is totally uncontrollable. The Warhols acknowledge their debt to Newcombe's creativity and don't even put themselves in the same exalted sphere of greatness  but the Warhols have something that BJM don't  the ability to integrate their talents with common sense, the real world, and their market  as a mixing pot of talent (even if much of it is distilled from guru Newcombe) and accessibility, they are the very definition of 'cool.' DiG! follows the parallel careers of the two bands with increasing poignancy. At one point, Newcombe pulls stunts designed to generate publicity by sending apparent death threats and hate messages to the Warhols (in a box containing live ammunition and insults like a bar of soap 'to clean up their act')  only he forgets to tell them it's a stunt and they get so paranoid they take out a restraining order against Newcombe. By the time the Dandy Warhols take off in Europe with hits like 'Every Day Should Be A Holiday' and 'Bohemian Like You', Newcombe is becoming increasingly isolated. BJM are stopped and the band breaks up when they are arrested for possession of marijuana  the Warhols get busted for drugs around the same time, let off with a warning, and even allowed to keep the grass. The wider appeal of DiG! is that the lessons of genius versus accessibility go way beyond two bands or even rock music. The downside is that it is still a documentary, however intimate, and it will mostly only appeal to dedicated film fans or people who are already interested in the music of one or both of the featured bands. Newcombe may well be a largely unrecognised genius, and there are feint glimpses of this in the film, but to the unattuned ear there is little more than the assertions of the people interviewed to attest to this. In the words of one of the band members: \\"In every spiritual tradition, you burn in hell for pretending to be God and not being able to back it up.\\" Newcombe isn't pretending  but numerically there are maybe still insufficient people to appreciate him in his own lifetime, and DiG! has an uphill struggle to rectify the balance in favour of a tortured but largely unrecognised genius.

Movie title: The Graduate Movie plot: The film explores the life of 21-year-old Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) shortly after earning his bachelor's degree from an unnamed college in the Northeast. The school is widely believed to be Williams College, Webb's alma mater (in the opening sequence of the movie, Dustin Hoffman, playing Benjamin Braddock, is wearing a Williams College tie). Benjamin is seen arriving at LAX International Airport over the opening credits.The movie really begins at a party that same evening celebrating his graduation at his parents' house in Pasadena, a suburb of Los Angeles. Benjamin is visibly uncomfortable at the party attended by his parents' friends. He remains aloof while his parents deliver accolades and neighborhood friends ask him about his future plans. Benjamin escapes from each person who comes to congratulate him, exposing his seeming embarrassment at all the honors he had won at college. Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), the neglected wife of his father's law partner, asks Benjamin to drive her home, which he reluctantly does. We never learn Mrs. Robinson's first name (or, indeed, the first names of any of Benjamin's and Elaine's parents) during the course of the film (in the novel, we are told that the initial of Mrs. Robinson's first name is G).Arriving at her home, she pleads for Benjamin to come inside, saying that she doesn't like to enter a dark house alone. Once inside, she forces a drink on him, and later exposes herself to him offering to have an affair with him. This scene, known as the \\"Mrs. Robinson, you are trying to seduce me\\" scene, as said by Benjamin, is said to be one of the most iconic scenes in the film. She, for no clear reason, does attempt to seduce him, removing her clothing. Mr. Robinson arrives home a few minute later, but does not see or suspect anything. Initially flustered and shocked by her advances, Benjamin flees into the night.A few days later Benjamin contacts Mrs. Robinson and clumsily organizes a tryst at a hotel beginning their affair.

Bountiful food sources might have made Malaysia an inviting place for the contemporaries of Java Man — in 230,000 b.c. But thus far, the country's earliest traces of homo sapiens, found in the Niah Caves of northern Sarawak, are fragments of a skull dating to 40,000 b.c. On the peninsula, the oldest human-related relics (10,000 b.c. ) are Stone Age tools of the Negritos. These small, dark Melanesians are related in type to Australian aborigines and are confined today to the forests of the northern highlands. By 2,000 b.c. , these timid, gentle nomads hunting with bow and arrow were driven back from the coasts by waves of sturdy immigrants arriving in outrigger canoes equipped with sails. Mongolians from South China and Polynesian and Malay peoples from the Philippines and the Indonesian islands settled along the rivers of the peninsula and northern Borneo. They practiced a slash-and-burn agriculture of yams and millet, a technique that exhausted the soil and imposed a semi-nomadic existence from one jungle clearing to another. Families lived in wooden longhouses like those still to be seen today among the Iban peoples of Sarawak. Another unit was added on to the communal dwelling each time a marriage created a new family. Other tough migrants from the South Seas settled along the coasts — sailors, fishermen, traders (for the most part pirates) — known euphemistically as orang laut (sea people).

The expansion of trade among West Asia, India and Southeast Asia helped the spread of the religion as Muslim traders from Southern Yemen (Hadramout) brought Islam to the region with their large volume of trade. Many settled in Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia. This is evident in the Arab-Indonesian, Arab-Singaporean, and Arab-Malay populations who were at one time very prominent in each of their countries. The second theory is the role of missionaries or Sufis.[citation needed] The Sufi missionaries played a significant role in spreading the faith by introducing Islamic ideas to the region. Finally, the ruling classes embraced Islam and that further aided the permeation of the religion throughout the region. The ruler of the region's most important port, Malacca Sultanate, embraced Islam in the 15th century, heralding a period of accelerated conversion of Islam throughout the region as Islam provided a positive force among the ruling and trading classes.

Article: The Nazi regime under Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, and along with Mussolini's Italy sought to gain control of the continent by the Second World War. Following the Allied victory in the Second World War, Europe was divided by the Iron Curtain. The countries in Southeastern Europe were dominated by the Soviet Union and became communist states. The major non-communist Southern European countries joined a US-led military alliance (NATO) and formed the European Economic Community amongst themselves. The countries in the Soviet sphere of influence joined the military alliance known as the Warsaw Pact and the economic bloc called Comecon. Yugoslavia was neutal. Question: What was the military partnership between countries aligned with the Soviet Union called?","output":"The military partnership between countries aligned with the Soviet Union during the Cold War was called the Warsaw Pact. Formally known as the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance, the Warsaw Pact was established on May 14, 1955, in response to the formation of the NATO alliance. The founding member countries of the Warsaw Pact included the Soviet Union, Albania, Poland, Romania, Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria. It served as a counterbalance to NATO and aimed at fostering military cooperation and coordination among its member nations. The Warsaw Pact alliance dissolved in 1991, following the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence 1: His brown suit was well cut, but perilously near the end of its tether. Sentence 2: His suit was well-cut,but worn.  If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"If we closely examine both sentences, we can break them down to determine if the second sentence is true when the first sentence is true. Sentence 1: \\"His brown suit was well cut, but perilously near the end of its tether.\\" In this sentence, we have two pieces of information. Firstly, the suit is brown, and it is well cut. This means that the suit is designed and tailored in a flattering and stylish manner. The second part of this sentence, \\"perilously near the end of its tether,\\" suggests that the suit is close to its breaking point, meaning that it is significantly worn or damaged and may not be able to withstand much more use. Sentence 2: \\"His suit was well-cut, but worn.\\" In this sentence, we also have two pieces of information. Firstly, the suit is well-cut, which, like in the first sentence, means it is tailored in a well-designed and flattering manner. The second part of this sentence states that the suit is worn. This indicates that the suit has seen some use and is showing signs of wear and tear. Now, let's compare both sentences. The first part of each sentence, which refers to the suit being well-cut, is consistent. Both sentences agree that the suit has a good design and is tailored in a flattering manner. However, the second part of the sentences may seem to describe slightly different things. In Sentence 1, the suit is \\"perilously near the end of its tether,\\" which implies it is severely worn or damaged, whereas in Sentence 2, the suit is simply described as being \\"worn,\\" without the same emphasis on the extreme level of wear. That being said, we can still argue that the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true. Sentence 2 does not contradict any information provided in Sentence 1. If the brown suit in Sentence 1 is \\"perilously near the end of its tether,\\" it would indeed qualify as being worn, which is the description provided in Sentence 2. In conclusion, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence can also be considered true. The overall state of being \\"worn\\" in Sentence 2 can encompass the more detailed and severe state of wear described in Sentence 1, even if Sentence 2 does not explicitly mention the extent of the wear."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: But few people who work in computer security can stand those programmes or movies because, in their words, they are so technically inept. One TV show that has proved popular with hackers is NBC Universal's Mr Robot which centres around Elliott Alderson - a security pro by day but who is also a member of an anti-establishment hacker group called FSociety that wants to use his technical skills to change the world. Kor Adana, one of Mr Robot's writers who worked in IT security before jumping to TV production, said the decision to make the show as technically accurate as possible was made even before the first episode was shot. \\"I've got nothing but disdain for how Hollywood has portrayed hacking and technology before now,\\" he told a packed session at Def Con that was testament to the huge following Mr Robot has won among hackers. \\"We wanted to do it right,\\" he said, \\"and we thought that doing it in a realistic way would be enticing and compelling.\\" To help get the details correct, Mr Adana has recruited several technical consultants well-known in the Def Con and hacking community to advise on how the hacks Elliott uses can be accomplished. The consultants develop the hacks, prove they work and then pass on information about how they were done to Mr Adana so they can be used on the show. However, he said, drama demands that not every last detail of how Elliot cracks passwords, spoofs text messages, hacks phones or penetrates corporate and civil networks is shown. \\"We have to strike a balance between what's visually compelling and what we have to do to move the story forward,\\" he said. Despite this the show does take care to make sure real and relevant hardware and software is used, he said. This attention to detail extends to the version numbers of software packages being used, command syntax, output format and screen layouts. \\"We want to nail those details,\\" said Mr Adana. \\"It really helps to ground the show in reality if we can use real tools.\\" Mr Adana extended an open invitation to the Def Con audience to contact him and the technical consultants with information about the tools they use so they can be featured on the show and used in its hacks. Beyond the technology and hacks featured in the show, Mr Adana said it was also trying to make an important point about the contemporary role of technology. \\"We live in an age where we are more dependent on devices than ever,\\" he said. \\"And there are a lot of the younger generation that know how to use apps but do not know about the ways in which they are vulnerable and how if they leave their phone unlocked it will not take long for it to be rooted.\\" \\"If Mr Robot increases the level of awareness and paranoia out there then that's a good thing,\\" he said. Veteran hacker Marc Rogers, who develops and proves many of the hacks featured in the show, said he had been encouraged by the care it took to get the tech right. \\"For years and years I have watched TV betray my community,\\" he said, \\"I want to see real stuff on TV that does not make me rage and which is an accurate portrayal of people in my community.\\" \\"It's been a gift to work on this,\\" he said. Andre McGregor, a consultant who formerly worked in the FBI's cyber division, said he too was heartened by the care taken over the technology in the show. \\"I find it refreshing that the accuracy is so important to them,\\" he said, adding that he was approached to help with Series Two of Mr Robot because several episodes feature law enforcement and government responses to cyber attacks. Mr McGregor said his advice extended beyond helping the show's writers understand how the FBI and law enforcement agencies investigate cyber intrusions and conduct interviews. It also involved more subtle elements such as how FBI agents arrange themselves in a room during a meeting or interrogation, he said. \\"An agent would never stand in front of a door,\\" he said. \\"It's what we call the 'fatal funnel', you could be hit by a shotgun blast through that door.\\" But there were some things that the show did gloss over, said consultant Ryan Kazanciyan, a former penetration tester who is now head of forensics at security firm Tanium. \\"It's missing the time, the number of steps you have to go through for a hack, complexity and the amount of research you have to do,\\" he said. \\"When I would do penetration testing I would have one or two weeks to get in from the outside and then one or two weeks to see how much damage I could do from the inside,\\" he said. \\"Sometimes I would go for days just coming up blank,\\" he said. \\"And then you would have that Aha! moment that gets you in.\\" He said one facet of hacking the show did get right was the view of the world that anyone with an understanding of security software swiftly acquires. \\"There's always a way in,\\" he said.","output":"\\"Mr. Robot\\" is a popular TV show about a computer security guy named Elliot who is part of a hacker group called FSociety. They want to use his skills to change the world. The show is liked by hackers because it tries to be very accurate about computer stuff. The writers have special helpers who know a lot about hacking and make sure the show stays realistic with real tools and ways of doing things. They want to teach people about the good and bad things about technology we use every day. This show is different from other TV shows that sometimes don't show computer stuff in the right way. Some parts might not be fully realistic so it stays fun and interesting to watch, but it's important to the people making the show that they do a good job showing computer things accurately."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Rhodesia, commonly known from 1970 onwards as the Republic of Rhodesia, was an unrecognised state in southern Africa from 1965 to 1979, equivalent in territorial terms to modern Zimbabwe. With its capital in Salisbury (now Harare), Rhodesia was considered a \\"de facto\\" successor state to the former British colony of Southern Rhodesia (which had achieved responsible government in 1923).  - Daniel Carney ( 1944 -- 1987 ) was a Rhodesian novelist . Three of his novels have been made into films . He was a brother of Erin Pizzey , also a writer .  - Erin Patria Margaret Pizzey (born 19 February 1939) is an English family care activist and a novelist. She became internationally famous for having started the first domestic violence shelter in the modern world, Chiswick Women's Aid, in 1971, the organisation known today as Refuge. Haven House is often cited as the first women's refuge (called women's shelters in Canada and the U.S.), but at the time of their founding they only worked to help the mentally ill transition from committed life in a hospital to life in the outside world. By contrast the refuge started by Erin Pizzey was focused on removing victims of domestic abuse from their abusers, in an attempt to break the cycle.  - Chiswick is a district of west London, England. Most of it is in the London Borough of Hounslow. Other parts of the W4 postcode area, including Chiswick Park tube station, Acton Green, and much of Bedford Park are in the London Borough of Ealing. It contains Hogarth's House, the former residence of the 18th-century English artist William Hogarth; Chiswick House, a neo-Palladian villa regarded as one of the finest in England; and Fuller's Brewery, London's largest and oldest brewery. It occupies a meander of the River Thames used for competitive and recreational rowing, with several rowing clubs on the river bank.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Which verses of the ballad about the Wabash River talk about missing a loved one? ?  The ballad speaks of the Wabash River, which flows through Indiana, and reminisces about events that occurred there. The song has two verses and a chorus. The first verse is about the narrator's childhood on a farm and his love for his mother. The second verse is about his lost love, Mary. While the subjects of the verses are connected, the narrative of the chorus is detached from the verses as it seemingly reminisces nostalgically.Without speaking directly of death, both verses indicate the absence of a loved one, and the narrator's sadness and inability to cope with the grief. In the second verse, the narrator cannot bring himself to come near to his lost love's grave. The effort to avoid the subject of death and the focus on fond memories is typical of songs and societal sensibilities at the time.The melody of the song is a memorable tune made easy to learn because of its combination of harmonic repetition and contrast—elements that make music easy to remember while avoiding monotony. The recurrence and dissimilarity within the melody is similar to the patterns in many popular folk songs. Dresser, however, avoided the common 19th-century practice of using a portion of the refrain's melody in the verse. With little formal training in music theory, it is unlikely that Dresser purposefully made any methodical calculations when he composed the melody.Written for piano, guitar, and mandolin, the music begins in the key of G major with an Andante Moderato tempo. The verses follow a chord progression of G–C–G. The chorus transitions to B minor, and progresses as B–E–E, before returning to G–C–G in its final bars. Although the melody of the chorus is unique within the piece, it is in harmonic unity with the verses. An upbeat version played at a Andantino tempo was also adapted for play by small orchestras and big bands. Answer:","output":"The second verse of the ballad about the Wabash River talks about missing a loved one. This verse is about the narrator's lost love, Mary, and it indicates the absence of a loved one and the narrator's sadness and inability to cope with the grief.

Reducing hours and benefits: The reviewer condemns the business for cutting employee hours to part-time to circumvent providing benefits like health insurance and vacation time. This is seen as an unethical and exploitative move that further emphasizes the negative sentiment. 3. Staff turnover: As a consequence of the poor treatment, the review mentions that the great staff members are leaving or have already left the business. This is another indication of the negative environment and could potentially affect the quality of service offered by the business. 4. Pricing and markup issues: The reviewer is also critical of the business's pricing and markup, implying that they believe the products or services are overpriced.

Given the question: Combine facts and answer this: Camelots du Roi was a youth organization of which far-right movement and journal? The answer is:","output":"The Camelots du Roi was a youth organization associated with the far-right movement known as Action Française, as well as its associated journal. To uncover more in-depth details, it's essential to dig into the roots of the \\"Camelots du Roi\\" and \\"Action Française.\\" The term \\"Camelots du Roi\\" was established by the French royalist movement in the early 20th century, referring to the militant action group and youth organization created by \\"Action Française,\\" a far-right political movement founded by Maurice Pujo and Henri Vaugeois at the beginning of the 20th century, precisely in 1898, during the Dreyfus Affair.  Action Française aimed to restore monarchy in France and was recognized as a significant far-right political organization in France during the early 20th century. The ideological premise of Action Française encompassed elements of nationalism, monarchism, and conservatism. It theorized that constitutional monarchy, in the form that existed before the French Revolution, was a better fit for the French than democracy.  The Camelots du Roi, created in 1908, functioned as the paramilitary wing of Action Française and held a strong presence in universities in Paris and throughout France. The name \\"Camelots du Roi\\" translates as 'King's Peddlers,' because members would sell the Action Française newspaper on the streets. Through street sales and public demonstrations, they advocated for the organization's ideology, disparaging republicanism and promoting a return to monarchy.  The Camelots du Roi, notorious for their confrontational nature, often became involved in street brawls with leftist groups, becoming a symbolic representation of the increasing politicization of French youth and street politics during the early 20th century.  The 'Action Française' journal, meanwhile, was a daily newspaper launched by Maurice Pujo, Henri Vaugeois, and other monarchists in 1908. It was sought to disseminate their royalist ideologies and political views to a broader audience. The paper featured strong editorials, philosophical debates, and literary works, expressing their opposition to the parliamentary Republic and advocacy for traditional monarchy and Catholicism.  In conclusion, the Camelots du Roi was a youth organization and militant action group of the far-right movement, Action Française, which also published the same-named journal as a mechanism to broadcast their political ideologies and philosophies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Genetics is the branch of biology that focuses on heredity in organisms.   Choices:  - schools  - fruits  - vacuums  - organisms   A: Answer:","output":"Organisms Genetics is the branch of biology that deals with the study of heredity in organisms. In this context, the term \\"organisms\\" refers to any living entity that possesses the ability to reproduce, grow, and maintain homeostasis. Organisms include animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, and even single-celled organisms such as amoebas. The main focus of genetics is to understand how the characteristics of organisms are passed from one generation to the next. This occurs through the transmission of genetic material in the form of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) or, in some viruses, RNA (ribonucleic acid). This genetic material carries the hereditary information in the form of genes, which are specific sequences of DNA or RNA that code for proteins or functional RNA molecules. Genetics aims to explore several aspects of heredity, including: 1. Inheritance patterns: The way in which genes are passed down from parents to offspring. These patterns can be Mendelian (following the principles laid down by Gregor Mendel), or non-Mendelian (deviating from Mendel's principles due to various phenomena such as incomplete dominance, multiple alleles, or sex-linked inheritance). 2. Gene structure and function: The physical and chemical properties of genes, as well as the role they play in the organism's development, growth, and maintenance of homeostasis. 3. Genetic variation: The differences in genetic material found among individuals of the same species or within populations. This variation can be due to mutation, recombination, and gene flow. 4. Genotype and phenotype: The relationship between an organism's genetic makeup (genotype) and its observable characteristics (phenotype). 5. Population genetics: The study of how genetic variation, gene flow, and natural selection affect the genetic makeup of populations over time. Other areas of genetics include molecular genetics, clinical genetics, epigenetics, and genomics. Molecular genetics investigates the molecular mechanisms involved in gene regulation, replication, and expression, while clinical genetics focuses on the diagnosis, management, and prevention of genetic disorders in humans. Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression that are not due to changes in the DNA sequence itself. Genomics, on the other hand, involves the study of whole genomes, including gene mapping and comparative genomics, which compare the DNA sequences of different species to understand evolutionary relationships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the final step of the following process: -  Body temperature rises - The brain tells blood vessels to dilate - The sweat glands become active - Moisture is released from the pores - The moisture evaporates Answer:","output":"The final step of the process where body temperature rises, the brain tells blood vessels to dilate, the sweat glands become active, moisture is released from the pores, and the moisture evaporates, can be described as the body achieving thermoregulation and maintaining a stable internal temperature.  To elaborate further, this process is initiated when the body detects an increase in temperature, either through internal factors like fever or muscle activity, or external factors such as environmental heat. The rise in body temperature leads to the brain, specifically the hypothalamus, sending signals to various bodily systems to engage in cooling strategies. One such strategy is the dilation of blood vessels, particularly those near the surface of the skin. This dilation increases blood flow to the skin's surface, allowing for the transfer of excess heat to the environment. As the body's response continues, sweat glands become active and produce sweat. This sweat is a mixture of water, salts, and other compounds produced by the glands, and is released from the pores on the surface of the skin. The function of this sweating is to employ evaporative cooling, a process through which the body gets rid of excess heat. Once the moisture is released from the skin's pores and comes into contact with the air, it begins to evaporate. Evaporation is a cooling process that requires energy input in the form of heat. As the sweat evaporates, the heat contained within the body is used to fuel this conversion, effectively cooling the body down. The final step of the process is the body achieving a state of thermoregulation, whereby the body's internal temperature is stabilized, and the aforementioned cooling mechanisms (dilation of blood vessels, sweating, and evaporative cooling) manage to dissipate the excess heat. The hypothalamus then ceases its intensified signals to these systems, reducing the cooling efforts back down to baseline levels, as the desired internal temperature has been restored and further cooling is no longer necessary. In this way, the body maintains a stable and safe internal temperature, adapting to various internal and external factors to prevent overheating and other detrimental effects on bodily functions and overall well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Washington Supreme Court is asking the Legislature to approve a 90 surcharge on a court filing fee to help provide legal help for the poor in civil cases, Chief Justice Gerry Alexander said Wednesday. \\"Some might say, why should we support this when we face tough financial times?\\" Alexander asked in his State of the Judiciary address to a joint session of the Legislature. \\"It seems to me in America, where we rejoice in the fact that we are a nation devoted to the rule of law, we should not ration access to justice.\\" The recommendation comes from the court's Task Force on Civil Equal Justice Funding, created in 2001 to look for ways to cope with the sparse amount of money available for such cases. As the task force was studying the issue, 900,000 was cut from state support for civil equal justice services. That prompted the state's two main legal services providers - Columbia Legal Services and Northwest Justice Project - to cut their staffs, Alexander said. The change would increase the cost of filing a lawsuit in Superior Court to 200. The total fee would be split, with 54 percent going to counties and 46 percent going to the state for a newly created equal justice account. Alexander also requested money for five additional Superior Court judgeships and one additional District Court judgeships, arguing that increased caseloads require more judges.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who became a symbol of resistance to the white-minority government?  Makeba was among the most visible people campaigning against the apartheid system in South Africa, and was responsible for popularising several anti-apartheid songs, including \\"Meadowlands\\" by Strike Vilakezi and \\"Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd\\" (Watch out, Verwoerd) by Vuyisile Mini. Due to her high profile, she became a spokesperson of sorts for Africans living under oppressive governments, and in particular for black South Africans living under apartheid. When the South African government prevented her from entering her home country, she became a symbol of \\"apartheid's cruelty\\", and she used her position as a celebrity by testifying against apartheid before the UN in 1962 and 1964. Many of her songs were banned within South Africa, leading to Makeba's records being distributed underground, and even her apolitical songs being seen as subversive. She thus became a symbol of resistance to the white-minority government both within and outside South Africa. In an interview in 2000, Masekela said that \\"there [was] nobody in Africa who made the world more aware of what was happening in South Africa than Miriam Makeba.\\"Makeba has also been associated with the movement against colonialism, with the civil rights and black power movements in the US, and with the Pan-African movement. She called for unity between black people of African descent across the world: \\"Africans who live everywhere should fight everywhere.

After marrying Carmichael she often appeared with him during his speeches; Carmichael later described her presence at these events as an asset, and Feldstein wrote that Makeba enhanced Carmichael's message that \\"black is beautiful\\".

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? typical toback machinations","output":"To determine the sentiment of the sentence, \\"typical toback machinations,\\" we must first analyze and understand the meaning of the individual words and the overall context of the sentence. Unfortunately, the sentence seems to contain a typo or misuse of a word, which needs to be clarified to provide an accurate analysis. The word \\"typical\\" is an adjective describing something that is representative of a particular type or characteristic. It usually implies that the subject is behaving as expected and does not carry an inherently positive or negative sentiment. Now, \\"toback\\" appears to be a misspelling or an unclear reference. It might be referring to \\"tobacco,\\" the common name for a plant, or to a person named Toback. Let us consider both possibilities. 1. If referring to tobacco: In this context, \\"machinations\\" could refer to the manipulative or deceitful actions of the tobacco industry for promotion and sales of their products. \\"Machinations\\" suggests a negative sentiment because it implies hidden, dishonest tactics meant to deceive or manipulate. 2. If referring to a person named Toback: \\"Machinations\\" could refer to the underhanded or deceitful actions taken by this individual. Again, the sentiment here would be negative because \\"machinations\\" implies dishonest or manipulative behavior. In either case, the word \\"machinations\\" seems to be the primary determinant of sentiment in this sentence, and it generally conveys a negative implication. Therefore, given the limited information and assuming that the typo is resolved, the sentiment of the sentence can be considered negative. However, remember that sentiment analysis may not always be an exact science since different words may carry different emotions or connotations for different individuals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"What caused it to be warmer then than it is now?\\"  Context: \\"During the Eocene (56 million years ago - 33.9 million years ago), the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. At the beginning of the period, Australia and Antarctica remained connected, and warm equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high. But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 Ma, the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents. The Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze, sending cold water and ice floes north, reinforcing the cooling. The present pattern of ice ages began about 40 million years ago.[citation needed]\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"There were multiple factors that contributed to the warmer global temperatures during the Eocene epoch as compared to the current climate. Some of the key reasons for the warmer conditions during that time include the Earth's geography, atmospheric composition, and oceanic currents. 1. Geographical Position of Continents: During the Eocene period, the continents were not situated in the same position as they are today. Their ongoing drift significantly influenced the global climate. In particular, Australia and Antarctica were connected, allowing for the transportation of heat between the two continents. The lack of significant land masses around the poles also contributed to less ice formation, leading to an overall warmer climate.  2. Warm Equatorial Currents: As Earth's geography was different during the Eocene epoch, the warm equatorial currents mixed with the colder Antarctic waters, creating a more uniform distribution of heat around the globe. This factor contributed to higher global temperatures compared to the present climate. However, when Australia separated from Antarctica approximately 45 million years ago, these warm equatorial currents started to deflect away from Antarctica, resulting in the cooling of the Antarctic region. 3. Atmospheric Composition: During the Eocene epoch, the concentration of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), was substantially higher than it is today. This increased level of CO2 in the atmosphere led to a stronger greenhouse effect, trapping more heat and contributing to the higher global temperatures observed during that time period.  4. Oceanic Circulation: Changes in oceanic circulation also played a significant role in the global temperature variations during the Eocene epoch. As Australia separated from Antarctica, a cold water channel developed between the two continents, causing the Antarctic region to cool down. This, in turn, led to the formation of ice and the distribution of colder water and ice floes towards the north, eventually giving rise to the present pattern of ice ages around 40 million years ago. 5. Solar Radiation: Variations in solar radiation due to changes in the Earth's orbit and tilt could have also caused warmer temperatures during the Eocene period. The combination of the Earth's position relative to the Sun and the uneven distribution of solar energy contributed to the overall warmer climate conditions of this epoch. In summary, the warmer global temperatures during the Eocene epoch can be attributed to a combination of factors, including geographical positions of continents, oceanic circulation, atmospheric composition, and solar radiation. The separation of Australia and Antarctica, along with the development of a cold water channel between the two continents, contributed to the shift towards a cooler climate."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

However, it does not provide any information about the prior districts that Jodey Arrington may have served on, nor does it discuss his career before representing the nineteenth district. Before jumping to any conclusions about his previous service in other districts, we would need more information about Jodey Arrington's political career, including his past representations, elections, and political history. Without that information given, we cannot infer anything about his service beyond the nineteenth district."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: I heard that Jesse took a chance on Sandra and asked her to the prom only to be embarrassed when she accepted but danced with Jack all night.  And I was wondering How would Jesse feel afterwards? Select from: 1). like he had been used; 2). like he made Sandra's night; 3). like he was cupid's twin; Answer:","output":"Jesse would likely feel like he had been used after asking Sandra to the prom and experiencing the embarrassment of her dancing with Jack all night. This disappointment would stem from several factors, including unmet expectations, feelings of betrayal, and the impact on his self-esteem. 1. Unmet expectations: Jesse took a chance by asking Sandra to the prom, assuming that they would spend the evening together and enjoy each other's company. Sandra's decision to dance with Jack all night, however, completely undermined this expectation. Experiencing this disconnect between what Jesse hoped for and what actually happened may leave him feeling frustrated and taken advantage of. 2. Feelings of betrayal: Since Jesse invited Sandra to the prom as his date, it's reasonable to assume that he may have trusted her to honor the implicit social contract that comes with this invitation. By choosing to spend the evening with Jack instead, Sandra can be seen as betraying Jesse's trust. This betrayal could make Jesse feel deceived and like he had been used by Sandra. 3. Impact on self-esteem: The experience of being embarrassed at the prom due to Sandra's actions may cause Jesse's self-esteem to take a hit. He might begin to doubt his worthiness as a prom date, question his own judgment in choosing to invite Sandra, and experience feelings of insecurity as a result of the situation. These feelings can be further amplified due to the public nature of the event, as others witnessed the situation unfold and may have passed judgment on Jesse and Sandra's relationship. In summary, Jesse would most likely feel like he had been used after the prom experience because his expectations were not met, he was betrayed by Sandra, and his self-esteem was negatively impacted. This challenging situation would leave Jesse with lingering feelings of disappointment and potentially lead to reduced self-confidence and trust in others in the future."},{"instruction":"I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the full name of one of Massenet's last students? ?  Massenet was a prolific composer; he put this down to his way of working, rising early and composing from four o'clock in the morning until midday, a practice he maintained all his life. In general he worked fluently, seldom revising, although Le roi de Lahore, his nearest approach to a traditional grand opera, took him several years to complete to his own satisfaction. It was finished in 1877 and was one of the first new works to be staged at the Palais Garnier, opened two years previously. The opera, with a story taken from the Mahabharata, was an immense success and was quickly taken up by the opera houses of eight Italian cities. It was also performed at the Hungarian State Opera House, the Bavarian State Opera, the Semperoper, Dresden, the Teatro Real in Madrid, and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in London. After the first Covent Garden performance, The Times summed the piece up in a way that was frequently to be applied to the composer's operas: \\"M. Massenet's opera, although not a work of genius proper, is one of more than common merit, and contains all the elements of at least temporary success.\\"This period was an early high point in Massenet's career. He had been made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1876, and in 1878 he was appointed professor of counterpoint, fugue and composition at the Conservatoire under Thomas, who was now the director. In the same year he was elected to the Institut de France, a prestigious honour, rare for a man in his thirties. Camille Saint-Saëns, whom Massenet beat in the election for the vacancy, was resentful at being passed over for a younger composer. When the result of the election was announced, Massenet sent Saint-Saëns a courteous telegram: \\"My dear colleague: the Institut has just committed a great injustice\\". Saint-Saëns cabled back, \\"I quite agree.\\" He was elected three years later, but his relations with Massenet remained cool.Massenet was a popular and respected teacher at the Conservatoire. His pupils included Bruneau, Charpentier, Chausson,... A:","output":"Pierre Monteux"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an email with the following subject: Argentina and Brazil tax assignments Email:","output":"Subject: Argentina and Brazil Tax Assignments Dear [Recipient's Name], I hope this email finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to provide you with detailed information regarding the tax assignments for our operations in Argentina and Brazil. Given the importance of ensuring that our company remains compliant with all relevant tax laws and regulations in both countries, I wanted to share our findings and insights which may help us in our future business endeavors. 1. Argentina Tax Obligations: As part of our business operations in Argentina, it is imperative that we stay updated and abide by all applicable tax laws, which primarily include: a) Corporate Income Tax (CIT): Companies established in Argentina are subject to a standard CIT rate of 25%, and all expenses related to the production of income or the maintenance of the source are deductible. b) Turnover tax: This is a provincial tax based on gross income and the rate varies depending on the province and the activity carried out. Typically, the rates range from 1% to 5%. c) Value Added Tax (VAT): Argentina's VAT is applied on domestic sales and services, as well as on imports of goods and services. The general VAT rate is 21%, with differential rates of 10.5% and 27% based on the type of product or service. d) Export Taxes: Companies that export goods or services from Argentina may be subject to export taxes, depending on the nature of the goods being exported. e) Payroll Taxes: Employers in Argentina are required to pay social security contributions based on employees' gross salaries, which generally range from 20% to 27% depending on the specific employment agreement and social charges. f) Property taxes: These are assessed annually on ownership of real property, at rates ranging from 0.5% to 2%, depending on the value and location of the property.  2. Brazil Tax Obligations: Similar to Argentina, it is crucial for our operations in Brazil to remain compliant with the country's tax laws. Some of the significant taxes our business may be liable for include: a) Corporate Income Tax (CIT): Companies in Brazil are subject to federal corporate income tax, known as the Imposto de Renda da Pessoa Jurídica (IRPJ).

Its gravitational center is located somewhere between the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy. The Local Group covers a diameter of (about 10 meters) and has a binary (dumbbell) distribution. The group itself is a part of the larger Virgo Supercluster, which in turn may be a part of the Laniakea Supercluster.  - The Andromeda Galaxy, also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224, is a spiral galaxy approximately 780 kiloparsecs (2.5 million light-years) from Earth. It is the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way and was often referred to as the Great Andromeda Nebula in older texts. It received its name from the area of the sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda, which was named after the mythological princess Andromeda.  - In astronomy and navigation, the celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of arbitrarily large radius, concentric with Earth. All objects in the observer's sky can be thought of as projected upon the inside surface of the celestial sphere, as if it were the underside of a dome or a hemispherical screen. The celestial sphere is a practical tool for spherical astronomy, allowing observers to plot positions of objects in the sky when their distances are unknown or unimportant.  - A constellation is formally defined as a region of the celestial sphere, with boundaries laid down by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The constellation areas mostly had their origins in Western-traditional patterns of stars from which the constellations take their names.  - Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole.  - A dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) is a term in astronomy applied to low luminosity galaxies that are companions to the Milky Way and to the similar systems that are companions to the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). While similar to dwarf elliptical galaxies in appearance and properties such as little to no gas or dust or recent star formation, they are approximately spheroidal in shape, generally lower luminosity, and are recognized only as satellite galaxies in the Local Group.  - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.  - Andromeda V is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy about 2.52 Mly away in the constellation Andromeda . Andromeda V was discovered by Armandroff et al . and published in 1998 after their analysis of the digitized version of the second Palomar Sky Survey . The metallicity of Andromeda V is above the average metallicity to luminosity ratio of the Local Group 's dwarf galaxies .  - The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System. The descriptive \\"milky\\" is derived from the appearance from Earth of the galaxy  a band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term \\"Milky Way\\" is a translation of the Latin ', from the Greek (', \\"milky circle\\"). From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.    What entity does 'andromeda v' has the relation 'astronomical body' with? A:","output":"Andromeda V has the relation 'astronomical body' with the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). It is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy that is a companion to the Andromeda Galaxy and is located about 2.52 million light-years away in the constellation Andromeda."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How to trap mink  Learn their travel habits.  Minks travel more than most furbearers, covering up to ten miles a night. They normally follow a definite route.","output":"Step 1: Research In order to effectively trap mink, it's important to understand their behavior, habits, and habitat. The information provided indicates that minks travel more than most furbearers, so it is essential to learn their travel routes. Research online or seek advice from experienced trappers or local wildlife experts to gain more knowledge about mink behavior. Step 2: Identify a suitable trapping location Based on the information gathered, identify potential travel routes that minks might use in your area. Look for signs such as tracks, scat, or evidence of their prey. Waterways, such as streams and rivers, are common areas for mink activity. Select a location along these routes where you are likely to encounter a mink. Step 3: Choose an appropriate trap Select a trap that is specifically designed for catching mink, such as a live cage trap or a body-gripping trap. Make sure the trap is suitable for the size and strength of mink while minimizing the potential for catching non-target animals. Step 4: Determine the best trapping technique Depending on the type of trap, there may be specific techniques that are more effective for catching mink. For example, you might use bait, lures, or visual attractants to draw the mink towards the trap. Research the best practices for the trap you've chosen to increase the likelihood of success. Step 5: Set up the trap Carefully set up the trap according to the manufacturer's instructions and the technique you've selected. Ensure the trap is secure and properly camouflaged to avoid alerting the mink to its presence. Check local trapping regulations to make sure your setup complies with any rules or guidelines. Step 6: Monitor the trap Check the trap regularly, ideally at least once a day, to see if you've caught a mink. Promptly remove any animals caught, and if it's a non-target animal, release it and consider adjusting your setup to minimize the risk of future non-target captures. Step 7: Process the mink humanely If you're successful in catching a mink, handle the animal humanely, whether you plan to release it, use it for fur, or another purpose. Follow local regulations and best practices for processing the mink. Step 8: Review and refine your trapping strategy After attempting to trap mink, review your success and any challenges encountered. Use this information to refine your trapping strategy, making adjustments as needed to improve your results in future trapping endeavors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

During the battle, Hippolyta specifically targeted and beheaded her son Thrax, whom Ares forcibly conceived with her and who is fighting for his father. Hippolyta then defeated Ares, but Zeus stopped her from delivering the death strike. Instead, Hera bound his powers with magic bracers so that he was deprived of his ability to draw power from the psychic aura of violence and death he could instigate, and only another god could release him. In compensation, the Amazons were granted the island of Themyscira, where they would remain eternally youthful and isolated from Man in the course of their duty of holding Ares prisoner for all eternity.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Blatter Orders Brazil To Speed Up Work For 2014 GENEVA (Reuters) - FIFA president Sepp Blatter warned Brazil on Monday that they needed to speed up preparations to host the 2014 World Cup. \\"I would like to tell my Brazilian colleagues about the 2014 World Cup, it's tomorrow, the Brazilians think it's just the day after tomorrow,\\" he told reporters. \\"We are hoping for a little good faith, things are not advancing very quickly.\\" Brazil's Sports minister Orlando Silva replied by inviting Blatter to the South American country to see the work going on for himself. \\"I'm convinced he'll be reassured that Brazil will stage a very good World Cup,\\" Silva told a news conference in Sao Paulo. Blatter compared Brazil's preparations unfavorably with 2010 World Cup hosts South Africa's at the same stage four years ago. \\"If Brazil keeps going like this there will not be matches in Rio de Janeiro or Sao Paulo at the Confederations Cup.\\" The Confederations Cup is held the year before the World Cup in the same country and is used as dress rehearsal for the main stadiums. Blatter added that because of discussions between Brazilian politicians, it was not clear where this year's draw for the qualifying competition -- originally scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro in July -- would be held. Blatter also reiterated his belief that goal line technology could be used in 2014 and said he would make an important announcement about the fight against corruption at the FIFA Congress in June where he stands for re-election. Blatter faces a challenge from Asian Football Confederation (AFC) president Mohamed Bin Hamman for the FIFA presidency. \\"I will present something very special there (at FIFA Congress in June) but I will not now disclose the contents -- it is to fight corruption, all cheating and discrimination,\\" he said. FIFA was rocked by a corruption scandal last year when two executive committee members were banned for offering to sell their votes in the 2018 and 2022 World Cup hosting contest to undercover newspaper reporters. Blatter rejected suggestions that FIFA should allow external investigations into its affairs. \\"It would be like Switzerland asking France or Germany or Italy to vote for them when they elect the federal council,\\" he said. Blatter, 75 and FIFA president since 1998, also dismissed suggestions he should make way for a younger man. \\"Age is not a question of a number of years, it's a question of what you are able to do,\\" he said. \\"It is the FIFA Congress which will decide whether I am too old or not.\\" He also reflected on how FIFA had grown since he joined as a development officer 36 years ago. \\"FIFA had a World Cup with 16 teams, no development program, no youth competition, no women's competitions, nothing, just a World Cup every four years,\\" he said. \\"Even the Olympic Games was a farce because, at the time, there were only amateurs, so you can imagine why there were no western teams as champions. \\"There are 300 million active participants (in soccer) and if you count their parents and friends, that makes one billion people.\\" (Additional reporting by Tatiana Ramil in Sao Paulo) (Editing by Ed Osmond; To query or comment on this story email sportsfeedback@thomsonreuters.com)","output":"The FIFA president Sepp Blatter told Brazil that they need to hurry up and prepare for hosting the World Cup in 2014.

Insurance companies dawdled and by the time we received a settlement over a year later my parents had divorced. I was under full custody of my father living in a trailer in very rural Tennessee (Wayne County) with no electricity and a wood burning stove for heat. My mother was nowhere to be found until a few years later. We received the settlement and it turned out to be several thousand dollars. My dad turned on the electricity and bought our first computer, a Packard Bell. Now we needed dial up internet! -My what a change! Then he started dating online. He met a woman who lived in Franklin, TN (Williamson County), dated and married her (at least for a few years), worked at CompUSA for a few years, then started his own computer repair business which he and I ran from 2001 to 2014 before selling it. Williamson County population : 226,257 Wayne County population : 16,583 I ran a business with my father, graduated from a high school that was ranked 24/273 instead of one ranked of 223/273 in the state. The woman I married would not be the same, nor where I live and the lifestyle I now live, the jobs I have been able to get, the places I have been able to go, traveling around the US and to Canada and soon further abroad. The amazing things that I have experienced in my life are a pretty direct effect of some 16 year old kid not paying attention and rear ending my family.

The formal Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed on 2 September 1945, on the battleship USS Missouri, in Tokyo Bay. The surrender was accepted by General Douglas MacArthur as Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, with representatives of several Allied nations, from a Japanese delegation led by Mamoru Shigemitsu and Yoshijiro Umezu.

Question: \\"Who currently owns WKY's radio division?\\"  Context: \\"Oklahoma City was home to several pioneers in radio and television broadcasting. Oklahoma City's WKY Radio was the first radio station transmitting west of the Mississippi River and the third radio station in the United States. WKY received its federal license in 1921 and has continually broadcast under the same call letters since 1922. In 1928, WKY was purchased by E.K. Gaylord's Oklahoma Publishing Company and affiliated with the NBC Red Network; in 1949, WKY-TV (channel 4) went on the air and later became the first independently owned television station in the U.S. to broadcast in color. In mid-2002, WKY radio was purchased outright by Citadel Broadcasting, who was bought out by Cumulus Broadcasting in 2011. The Gaylord family earlier sold WKY-TV in 1976, which has gone through a succession of owners (what is now KFOR-TV is currently owned by Tribune Broadcasting as of December 2013).\\"  Answer:","output":"The current owner of WKY's radio division is Cumulus Media Inc. This came about after a series of ownership changes throughout the years. Let's take a closer look at the transition of ownership that led to Cumulus Media owning WKY's radio division. Oklahoma City's WKY Radio has a rich history as a pioneer in radio and television broadcasting. Established in 1921, WKY holds the distinction of being the first radio station transmitting west of the Mississippi River and the third radio station in the United States. The station began broadcasting under the same call letters in 1922, and in 1928, it was acquired by E.K. Gaylord's Oklahoma Publishing Company. At that time, WKY became affiliated with the NBC Red Network. In 1949, WKY took a significant step in broadcasting history by launching WKY-TV (channel 4), which later became the first independently owned television station in the United States to broadcast in color. The radio and television divisions went their separate ways in 1976 when the Gaylord family sold WKY-TV; however, WKY Radio remained under the ownership of the Oklahoma Publishing Company. The WKY radio division saw a significant change in ownership in mid-2002 when Citadel Broadcasting purchased the station outright. Citadel Broadcasting was a significant player in the radio industry, and its acquisition of WKY added to its growing portfolio of radio stations across the country. The ownership landscape shifted again in 2011 when Cumulus Media Inc., another major broadcasting company, acquired Citadel Broadcasting in a deal worth 2.4 billion. This acquisition made Cumulus the second-largest operator of radio stations in the United States, and it brought WKY Radio under the Cumulus umbrella. As part of Cumulus Media, WKY Radio continues to be a significant presence in the Oklahoma City market. Cumulus Media owns and operates radio stations in many other markets across the country, making it a significant player in the industry. In conclusion, after a series of acquisitions and sale transactions, Cumulus Media Inc. currently owns WKY's radio division as a result of its acquisition of Citadel Broadcasting in 2011."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options: - small cuts - puncture wound - competition - injury - panting  Explain why a human would choose \\"small cuts\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human might choose \\"small cuts\\" as an answer to the question above because they are thinking in terms of the possible physical harm that might be caused during the sport of fencing. Step 1: Analyze the question - The question asks about a common danger in fencing, which may imply some sort of harm or risk involved in participating which can be relatable to the initial comparison with owning a kitten. Step 2: Relate to the given comparison - Owning a kitten might sometimes result in small cuts or scratches due to the kitten's claws or teeth. Humans could potentially make an analogy between the sharp claws of a kitten and the sharp tip of a fencing sword, even though the comparison is not perfect. Step 3: Consider the options - Among the options provided: puncture wound, competition, injury, and panting, \\"small cuts\\" seem to be the closest to the physical harm caused by a kitten. A puncture wound is a more serious injury, competition and panting indicate more to athletic aspects rather than direct harm, and injury is a more general term that doesn't specify a type of harm. Step 4: Justify the choice - Given these considerations, a human might choose \\"small cuts\\" as the answer because it connects with the underlying theme of possible harm, and it is the closest option to the risk associated with the initial comparison to owning a kitten. However, it is important to note that fencing is a controlled sport with safety equipment, and it is designed to minimize injury, including small cuts."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What type of flight takes the most energy? Context: Most birds can fly, which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes. Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil. Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators. Though flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to \\"fly\\" through the water, as do auks, shearwaters and dippers.

Q: Abstract: To acquire information about the characteristics of U.S. citizens who had recently studied medicine abroad, the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) and the Association of American Medical Colleges merged independently collected data on a study group of 10,460 U.S. citizens who attended 359 medical schools in 75 foreign countries and who took their first ECFMG examination between 1978 and 1982. The study group was markedly heterogeneous: 21 percent were not U.S. citizens at birth, 32 percent did not have English as a native language, and 12 percent had two or more years of undergraduate college education in Puerto Rico. Sixty-seven percent resided in New York, New Jersey, California, Florida, or Puerto Rico, and 74 percent studied medicine in Mexico or the Caribbean. Forty-six percent passed the ECFMG examination on their first attempt, and 22 percent passed a subsequent examination. Only 45 percent had applied to a U.S. medical school, and 65 percent had taken the Medical College Admission Test. The means of the college grade-point averages, known for 39 percent of the study group, and of the scores on the admission test, known for 65 percent, were lower than those of both accepted and unaccepted applicants to U.S. medical schools in the 1976 and 1978 entering classes. The finding that 55 percent of the study group did not apply to a U.S. medical school does not support the widely held belief that most, if not all, U.S. citizens who attend foreign medical schools do so only after several unsuccessful attempts to gain admission to a U.S. school.

Q:Comets  are parts of our solar system. Like the planets, they go around the sun. But comets are not made of solid rocks like planets. A comet is a ball of dust, stones, and ice. Many people call comets dirty snowballs. The \\"snowball\\" may be only a few miles across. But when the sun heats the \\"snowball,\\" much of it is changed to gases. The gases spread out and form the comet's head, which may be thousands of miles across. A comet moves fast in its trip around the sun. But when we see it, the comet does not seem to move. That's because it is so far away. The moon moves fast, but when you look at it, you can't see any motion . That's because the moon is far away. Each year astronomers  discover new comets. Some of them are seen only once. They make one trip around the sun and then go away out into space. The sun's gravity cannot hold them. Other comets, like Halley, keep returning. They have been captured by the sun. Halley's earliest visit was probably 3,000 years ago. It may keep returning for another 3,000 years. But every time a comet goes around the sun, the comet loses part of itself. Gases and dust are pulled out of the comet. That's why Halley is now dimmer  than it used to be.

This possible weakness in the Democratic coalition coincides with a bit more slippage among Obama's 2008 supporters (9%) than among McCain voters who won't vote GOP in November (5%). Bottom line: By picking the bona fide conservative Ryan, the Republican base is likely to deliver a rapturous response, which may allow Romney to succeed in exploiting Obama's greatest weakness at this point. Before you conclude this is far-fetched, think back to Karl Rove's strategy in 2004 to move right with strident social conservatism on abortion and same-sex marriage, steep tax cuts and hawkish policies in Afghanistan and Iraq. Embracing the base and scorning the rush to the middle cost George W. Bush the independent vote. But Bush also supercharged conservatives and Republicans, who turned out in droves. Refuting the conventional wisdom that Democrats do best in high-turnout elections, it was Bush who most benefited from the 16% jump in the total vote. But -- there's always a but. Even as Ryan fires up conservatives, he may also mobilize votes for Obama -- including senior citizens who reside in key swing states like Florida. Alarmed by his draconian proposals to remake Medicare, they may boost their support of Obama. Another potential risk: A good number of voters may be primed to punish the incumbent for poor economic times. Pluralities of Ohio and Florida independents report that Obama's re-election would hurt their personal financial situation. But the coming hullabaloo over Ryan's budget proposals may distract the economically pained from punishing Obama. All in all, Romney has a tough battle ahead -- even stringent counts of Electoral College votes based on polls show Obama within striking distance of winning. But using Ryan to ignite the Republican base is probably Romney's most plausible path to prevailing. And, it may produce a campaign focused a bit more on policy than on birth certificates, service records and the other side issues of recent elections.

In this case, the person who wants to be the leader, Romney, picks a helper, Ryan, who a lot of people really like. This can make more people want to vote for them and maybe even help them win. But sometimes, picking a helper can also make more people want to vote for the other team, like Obama. They might not like what Ryan wants to do with things like healthcare for older people. So, it can be a difficult choice. The main idea is that picking Ryan can make the election more exciting and close. We don't know what will happen, but it's fun to watch and find out."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Problem: Solve 7*w + 2523 = 2495 for w. And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation 7*w + 2523 = 2495 for the variable w, follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the term containing the variable To do this, you should subtract 2523 from both sides of the equation, so that the constant terms are only on the right side of the equation. This way, we keep the equality balanced. The new equation becomes: 7*w = 2495 - 2523 Step 2: Calculate the difference on the right side Now, subtract 2523 from 2495: 2495 - 2523 = -28 The equation is now: 7*w = -28 Step 3: Solve for the variable w At this point, you need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of w, which is 7. This step will isolate w on the left side of the equation and give us the value of w: w = -28 / 7 Step 4: Calculate the value of w -28 / 7 = -4 So, the answer is: w = -4"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Gilmartin, (Professor of History, Maynooth, 1890), writes in Church History, Vol. 1, Ch XVII: On the death of Alexander, five months after the termination of the Council of Nice, Athanasius was unanimously elected to fill the vacant see. He was most unwilling to accept the dignity, for he clearly foresaw the difficulties in which it would involve him. The clergy and people were determined to have him as their bishop, Patriarch of Alexandria, and refused to accept any excuses. He at length consented to accept a responsibility that he sought in vain to escape, and was consecrated in 326, when he was about thirty years of age.

How would this review be described in terms of sentiment?","output":"This review can be described as having a predominantly negative sentiment. The reviewer had a disappointing experience at the late-night venue at Aria, with several aspects contributing to their dissatisfaction. They encountered subpar service - waiting long periods without being acknowledged, lack of attention to detail, and having to remind the staff for water refills. Additionally, they were unimpressed with the arrival of dishes without the courtesy of being asked and felt rushed when asked to pay before the cashier left. However, there is a slightly positive aspect to the review, as the customer enjoyed the crispy chicken wings' taste and texture.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What are the first names of the three people who rent a Madame Pompadour costume?  Johnny and girlfriend Frankie are performers on a Mississippi River riverboat, which also has a casino. Johnny is a compulsive gambler who is down on his luck and in debt. Johnny and his friend Cully, a musician and composer, visit a gypsy camp to get his fortune told. A lady reads tea leaves and tells Johnny that he will soon meet a red-haired woman who will bring him luck. Back on the boat, Johnny and Cully promptly encounter Nellie Bly, their boss Clint Braden's on-again, off-again girlfriend. Nellie has just caught Braden seducing another singer, Mitzi. Since she has red hair, Nellie is persuaded by Johnny to touch his chips for luck. After he wins, Johnny is convinced that the gypsy must be correct. Frankie finds out and becomes jealous, as does Johnny's boss. In a bit of musical theatre, Frankie shoots Johnny for dancing with Nellie Bly while singing Cully's latest song. A Broadway recruiter sees the riverboat show and buys the rights to this new song, suggesting that Frankie and Johnny should work together with him in New York City. Landing in New Orleans, the musical cast and riverboat crew attend a masked ball. Frankie, Nellie and Mitzi all rent the same Madame Pompadour costume. Johnny is eager for the luck of redhead Nellie to win more money, contrary to Frankie's expressed wishes. Being masked and in costume, Frankie and Nellie scheme to switch places to test Johnny's lucky-redhead theory. Johnny wins 10,000 at roulette, but when he kisses the woman he believes to be Nellie, he discovers the switch. Frankie is furious and throws all the winnings out of a window, into the street.

Answer the following question: Information:  - An accident, also known as an unintentional injury, is an undesirable, incidental and unplanned event that could have been prevented had circumstances leading up to the accident been recognized, and acted upon, prior to its occurrence. Most scientists who study unintentional injury avoid using the term \\"accident\\" and focus on factors that increase risk of severe injury and that reduce injury incidence and severity (Robertson, 2015).  - Death is the cessation of all biological functions that sustain an organism. Phenomena which commonly bring about death include biological aging, predation, malnutrition, disease, suicide, homicide, starvation, dehydration, and accidents or trauma resulting in terminal injury. Bodies of living organisms begin to decompose shortly after death.   - Nazareth (\\"Narat\\" \\"Narath\\" \\"an-Nira\\") is the capital and the largest city in the Northern District of Israel. Nazareth is known as \\"the Arab capital of Israel\\". In its population was . The inhabitants are predominantly Arab citizens of Israel, of whom 69% are Muslim and 30.9% Christian. Nazareth Illit (lit. \\"Upper Nazareth\\") is built alongside old Nazareth, and had a Jewish population of 40,312 in 2014. The Jewish sector was declared a separate city in June 1974.  - Lazarus of Bethany , also known as Saint Lazarus or Lazarus of the Four Days , is the subject of a prominent miracle attributed to Jesus in the Gospel of John , in which Jesus restores him to life four days after his death . The Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic traditions offer varying accounts of the later events of his life . In the context of the seven signs in the Gospel of John , the Raising of Lazarus is the climactic narrative : exemplifying the power of Jesus \`\` over the last and most irresistible enemy of humanity -- death . For this reason it is given a prominent place in the gospel . '' A figure named \`\` Lazarus '' ( Latinised from the Aramaic :  , Elzr , cf. Heb. Eleazar -- \`\` God is my help '' ) is also mentioned in the Gospel of Luke . The two Biblical characters named \`\` Lazarus '' have sometimes been conflated historically , but are generally understood to be two separate people . The name \`\` Lazarus '' is frequently used in science and popular culture in reference to apparent restoration to life ; for example , the scientific term \`\` Lazarus taxon '' denotes organisms that reappear in the fossil record after a period of apparent extinction . There are also numerous literary uses of the term .  - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament.  - The Gospel According to John (also called the Gospel of John, the Fourth Gospel, or simply John) is one of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament. It traditionally appears fourth, after the synoptic gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. John begins with the witness and affirmation of John the Baptist and concludes with the death, burial, resurrection, and post-resurrection appearances of Jesus.  - Jesus (; c. 4 BC  c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.  - Pontius Pilate (or ; Latin: \\"Pontius Pltus\\", , \\"Pontios Pltos\\") was the fifth prefect of the Roman province of Judaea from AD 2636. He served under Emperor Tiberius, and is best known today for the trial and crucifixion of Jesus.  - The Old Testament is the first section of the Christian Bible, based primarily upon the Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh), a collection of religious writings by ancient Israelites believed by most Christians and religious Jews to be the sacred Word of God. It is the counterpart to the New Testament, the second portion of the Christian Bible. The Old Testament canon varies between Christian Churches. Protestants have a version with 39 books. Catholics have a version with 46 books, and Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Churches choose the Old Testament version with 49 books.  - Malnutrition or malnourishment is a condition that results from eating a diet in which nutrients are either not enough or are too much such that the diet causes health problems. It may involve calories, protein, carbohydrates, vitamins or minerals. Not enough nutrients is called undernutrition or undernourishment while too much is called overnutrition. Malnutrition is often used specifically to refer to undernutrition where there is not enough calories, protein, or micronutrients. If undernutrition occurs during pregnancy, or before two years of age, it may result in permanent problems with physical and mental development. Extreme undernourishment, known as starvation, may have symptoms that include: a short height, thin body, very poor energy levels, and swollen legs and abdomen. People also often get infections and are frequently cold. The symptoms of micronutrient deficiencies depend on the micronutrient that is lacking. Undernourishment is most often due to not enough high-quality food being available to eat. This is often related to high food prices and poverty. A lack of breastfeeding may contribute, as may a number of infectious diseases such as: gastroenteritis, pneumonia, malaria, and measles, which increase nutrient requirements. There are two main types of undernutrition: protein-energy malnutrition and dietary deficiencies. Protein-energy malnutrition has two severe forms: marasmus (a lack of protein and calories) and kwashiorkor (a lack of just protein). Common micronutrient deficiencies include: a lack of iron, iodine, and vitamin A. During pregnancy, due to the body's increased need, deficiencies may become more common. In some developing countries, overnutrition in the form of obesity is beginning to present within the same communities as undernutrition. Other causes of malnutrition include anorexia nervosa and bariatric surgery. Efforts to improve nutrition are some of the most effective forms of development aid. Breastfeeding can reduce rates of malnutrition and death in children, and...  - Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, or substance misuse. Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide, such as firearms and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness. The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicide resulted in 842,000 deaths globally in 2013 (up from 712,000 deaths in 1990). This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, about 12 per 100,000 persons per year. Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world. Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries those aged between 15 and 30 are at highest risk. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and females. Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life. During the samurai era in Japan, a form of...

Here are possible answers to this question: - trust - move mountains - uplift - belief - experience  I believe the correct choice is \\"belief\\", here's why:","output":"\\"Belief\\" is indeed the most appropriate synonym for faith among the options provided. While faith and belief can sometimes be used interchangeably, it is essential to understand the nuances that distinguish them. Let's explore the reasons in greater detail. Faith is a complete trust or confidence in someone or something, often associated with spiritual or religious matters. Faith can be seen as a steadfast assurance in a higher power, doctrine, or set of principles, even in the absence of empirical evidence. However, faith can also be secular, referring to trust in other individuals, processes, or ideas without needing conclusive proof. Belief, on the other hand, refers to accepting something as true or regarding it as the correct view. Similar to faith, belief is often used in spiritual or religious contexts to describe one's conviction in divine powers or teachings. Both faith and belief embody a sense of commitment and trust in something. Now let's discuss the other options: - Trust: Although trust is a crucial component of faith, it does not wholly define it. Faith often encompasses spiritual or religious convictions, while trust typically corresponds to confidence in a person or thing due to past experiences or knowledge. - Move mountains: This phrase denotes achieving seemingly impossible or challenging feats, often with the power of faith or determination. As an idiomatic expression, it does not serve as an accurate synonym for faith. - Uplift: Uplifting usually implies elevating or inspiring someone emotionally or spiritually. While faith can often uplift an individual, \\"uplift\\" does not possess the same connotations as faith and is not a suitable synonym. - Experience: Experience denotes an event, encounter, or occurrence that affects a person and leads to increased understanding or knowledge. Experience does not capture the essence of faith as a trust or confidence in a particular belief or principle. In conclusion, \\"belief\\" is the most fitting synonym for faith among the listed options, as both terms represent a conviction or trust in someone or something. Although there are subtle differences between the two, they share a common thread of commitment and confidence, making \\"belief\\" the best choice as a synonym for faith."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Two identical planets, Norlon and Bothar, have been discovered in a neighboring galaxy of ours. These two planets have the same type of atmosphere as Earth and are extremely similar to Earth in terms of topography and even species of animals that live on them. The main difference is that Norlon is inhabited by a species very similar to humans that emit a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Bothar, however, has no such species on its planet.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which new planet has a cooler atmosphere? The answer is:","output":"Bothar has a cooler atmosphere. The reason for this is that Norlon is inhabited by a species that emit a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, which contributes to the greenhouse effect.

In contrast, Bothar does not have such a species; therefore, its atmosphere has less carbon dioxide and is less affected by the greenhouse effect, resulting in a cooler atmosphere compared to Norlon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Ok, this one is not missing a class but much better story IMO. When I was in middle school, if you didn’t have homework completed or goofed off in some way, teachers could make you stay after school for ‘after school help.’ It was essentially a mandatory study hall and if a teacher called you out, you had no choice in the matter. Now, I was in Biology class towards end of my middle school career and was sitting at one of those lab tables next to another student. We both had newspaper routes (yes, people actually delivered actual newspapers to people’s homes in the 1980s), so it would make us late for our deliveries if we were made to stay after school. This biology teacher would check our vocabulary assignment every week and I totally spaced it this week - Oh Crap! Now, my lab mate had most of his done, but just didn’t quite finish. Our teacher is working his way around the classroom checking assignments. So, he checks my lab partner, “well Scott, looks like you will be staying after school today.” This fellow student knew I didn’t have mine either, but also knew I was a pretty good student. I feel like I am sweating bullets and trembling as the teacher approaches me. In a near panic, I reach into my folder and pull out a prior week’s assignment. He looks it over and says “OK, good job” or something like that. Scott is looking at me in utter disbelief. Even funnier was the fact that this week’s assignment required 6–7 pages of paper to complete. The one I had blindly grabbed from folder had 2 pages, with barely anything in second page. It was totally obvious what I had done, but our teacher gave me a break that day. I managed to make it thru all three years without needing any ‘after school help!’ This was a large public school and they still paddled students if the infraction was serious enough. I know none of that is allowed these days, but those were both good deterrents for me!! Question: How long did i take the author to do the first assignment?

Article: Switzerland is famous for its watches. However, this country didn't invent the watch. It was the British who did it. Here is a story of how the watch was brought to Switzerland. Many years ago, an Englishman was traveling to Italy, on his way he stopped in a small town in south Switzerland. This Englishman traveled in a carriage inside which there was a carriage watch. This was the earliest kind of watch. A native shop assistant happened to see the watch.

Answer based on context: The threat of new religious persecution in Bosnia reappared within a few years of the war. Pope Innocent IV began urging the Hungarians to undertake another crusade in late 1246 and 1247, and they appeared willing. Matthew Ninoslav argued that he only associated with heretics to defend Bosnia against Hungarian invaders. He appears to have convinced Innocent, who suspended the crusade in March 1248. A crusade against Bosnia was preached again in 1337-38 and 1367, by popes Benedict XII and Urban V respectively, but in drastically different political circumstances. Hungary was ruled by a new dynasty, the Capetian Angevins, who supported the Kotromanić rulers of Bosnia. King Charles Robert once declared that any Hungarian who attacked Bosnia, ruled by his friend Stephen II, would be regarded as a traitor. The only significant impact the Bosnian Crusade had was augmenting the anti-Hungarian sentiment among the Bosnians, a major factor in Bosnian politics that contributed to the Ottoman conquest of Bosnia in 1463 and lasted beyond it. Who supported the crusade against Bosnia?","output":"Based on the context provided, Pope Innocent IV supported the crusade against Bosnia, as he began urging the Hungarians to undertake another crusade in late 1246 and 1247.

The sum of the two numbers is 77, so: x + y = 77 2. 5 times one number is equal to 6 times the other, so: 5x = 6y Now we need to solve this system of equations to find the values of x and y. First, we'll solve the first equation for one of the variables, let's say x: x = 77 - y Next, we'll substitute this expression for x into the second equation: 5(77 - y) = 6y Now, we will distribute and simplify the equation: 385 - 5y = 6y Combine like terms: 385 = 11y Now, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 11 to solve for y: y = 35 We found that the second number y is 35.

Translate to English","output":"The Celts also gave the land its name, which was derived from Galaicos and later became Galicia. The Celts, a cultural and linguistic group originating in central Europe, played a significant role in shaping the early history of many regions across the continent. One such region is Galicia, located in the northwest of modern-day Spain. The Celts arrived in this region during the Iron Age, around the 9th or 8th century BC. They brought with them a distinct culture, language, and traditions that helped shape the identity of this area. The name 'Galicia' has its origin in the Celtic tribes inhabiting the region, specifically the tribe known as \\"Galaicos\\" or \\"Gallaeci.\\" These tribes had a strong presence on the Iberian Peninsula and were known for their fierce warriors and distinct customs. The word \\"Galaicos\\" is believed to have a possible connection to the Celtic word \\"Gall,\\" which stands for “stranger” or “foreigner.” The Romans later adopted this term when referring to the region and its Celtic inhabitants. As time went on and cultures continued to merge and evolve, the term 'Galaicos' underwent transformations. With the Roman conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, the Latin language began to influence the local languages and dialects. As a result, the name \\"Galaicos\\" gradually evolved into \\"Gallici,\\" which more closely resembled the Latin linguistic structure. Eventually, the term \\"Gallici\\" underwent further linguistic changes and adaptations, ultimately resulting in the name \\"Galicia.\\" This name has remained in use to this day, representing the region's unique identity and the lasting influence of its Celtic past. Today, Galicia is an autonomous community within Spain, known for its lush landscapes, rugged coastline, and unique cultural heritage.

Title: Battle for Terra Movie plot: Mala (Evan Rachel Wood) and her friend Senn (Justin Long) are young alien creatures who live on Terra, a planet from a star system in the Milky Way. Terra is a peaceful planet of alien creatures who have a rich semi-advanced culture. One day a large, mysterious object blocks the Terrian sun, piquing the Terrians' interest. However, since the Terrian culture bans the development of new technologies, such as telescopes, without the approval of the ruling council, none of the inhabitants are able to get a closer look at the huge object in their sky. Mala, who is inventive and headstrong, goes against the rules of her community and creates a telescope, which she takes out into the dark empty area outside the Terrian city and uses to view the object and witnesses smaller objects coming from the large object that turn out to be incoming scout spaceships. She returns to the city to find that the scout spaceships have already started abducting Terrians (who willingly offer themselves to the scout spaceships mistaking them as their new \\"gods\\"). After Mala's own father, Roven (Dennis Quaid) is abducted she goads a ship into tailing her and lures it into a trap, which causes it to crash. Afterward, she saves the life of the pilot, revealed to be a human, an officer named Lieutenant Jim Stanton (Luke Wilson). After his personal robot assistant named Giddy (David Cross) warns Mala that Stanton will die without a supply of oxygen (which the Terrian atmosphere does not contain), she creates an oxygen generator and fills a tent with air containing oxygen so that Jim can breathe, and eventually convinces Giddy to teach her human language.

Available choices: - no. - yes.","output":"No. The response, \\"Too smart,\\" is not factually correct based on the information provided in the paragraph. The narrative explains that Sultan Shahryar's perceived weakness, which prompts Schahzenan to lead his army to Baghdad and attempt to claim the throne, is not because he is \\"too smart.\\" Rather, it underlines that Shahryar's inability to execute Scheherazade due to his curiosity about the ongoing stories she tells him each night is what Schahzenan perceives as weakness. Schahzenan interprets this as a deficiency in Shahryar's ability to rule, which induces him to plan an invasion of Baghdad. Therefore, the correct statement of Shahryar's weakness should emphasize his psychological struggle and the subsequent failure to execute Scheherazade rather than suggesting that he is \\"too smart.\\" Consequently, the response provided does not accurately reflect the narrative's content."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  The first group of people claiming to be an ambassadorial mission of Romans to China was recorded as having arrived in 166 AD by the Book of the Later Han. The embassy came to Emperor Huan of Han China from \\"Andun\\" (Chinese: 安敦; Emperor Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius Antoninus), \\"king of Daqin\\" (Rome). As Antoninus Pius died in 161 AD, leaving the empire to his adoptive son Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, and the envoy arrived in 166 AD, confusion remains about who sent the mission, as both emperors were named \\"Antoninus\\". The Roman mission came from the south (therefore probably by sea), entering China by the frontier of Rinan or Tonkin (present-day Vietnam). It brought presents of rhinoceros horns, ivory, and tortoise shell, probably acquired in Southern Asia. The text states that it was the first time there had been direct contact between the two countries. Yule speculated that the Roman visitors must have lost their original wares due to robbery or shipwreck and used the gifts instead, prompting Chinese sources to suspect them of withholding their more precious valuables, which Yule notes was the same criticism directed at papal missionary John of Montecorvino when he arrived in China in the late 13th century AD. Historians Rafe de Crespigny, Peter Fibiger Bang, and Warwick Ball believe that this was most likely a group of Roman merchants rather than official diplomats sent by Marcus Aurelius. Crespigny stresses that the presence of this Roman embassy as well as others from Tianzhu (in northern India) and Buyeo (in Manchuria) provided much-needed prestige for Emperor Huan, as he was facing serious political troubles and fallout for the forced suicide of politician Liang Ji, who had dominated the Han government well after the death of his sister Empress Liang Na. Yule emphasised that the Roman embassy was said to come by way of Jiaozhi in northern Vietnam, the same route that Chinese sources claimed the embassies from Tianzhu (northern India) had used in 159 and 161 AD.

Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig.  In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias.  Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".

Definition: Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text. Input: At Lanark Sheriff Court, he was convicted of seven charges of indecent assault in the 1970s and early 1980s. Talbot was a teacher at a school in the Manchester area at the time and took boys away on camping and boating trips. Sheriff Nikola Stewart asked for background reports and will sentence him next month. Talbot, 67, of Greater Manchester, had denied the allegations but was convicted of seven of the nine charges he faced after a nine-day trial. He was cleared of two charges - one of indecent assault and one of lewd, indecent and libidinous practices - on not proven verdicts. The offences, against boys aged 15 to 17, all took place between 1978 and 1981. They happened during separate trips to two locations - one near Moffat in southern Scotland, and one on the Caledonian Canal in Inverness. During the trial, a succession of witnesses, now men in their 50s who cannot be named for legal reasons, told of their initial excitement at going on the trips - sometimes the first time away from their parents. At the time, Talbot was a young teacher \\"with a more relaxed attitude than others\\" and would talk to the boys about topics such as pop music, alcohol and sex, the court heard. The men went on to recount how Talbot abused his position of trust to attack them more than 35 years ago. One man told the court he was indecently assaulted as a teenage boy after a visit to a pub on a camping trip left him \\"very much the worse for wear\\". The witness told of his \\"horror\\" when he awoke - after being \\"singled out\\" to go to the pub - to find Talbot touching him in a tent when he was partially clothed. Another witness gave evidence over a video link from Australia to recount how he woke in his tent to find Talbot making a sexual advance on him. A further witness said he was left \\"petrified\\" when Talbot indecently assaulted him on a trip to the Caledonian Canal in 1979. Stone Roses frontman Ian Brown, 54, who was not an alleged victim, also gave evidence at the trial and said he had never forgotten the moment Talbot invited one of his young friends to sleep in his tent on a school camping trip. Det Insp Bryan Lee welcomed the guilty verdicts, describing Talbot as a \\"sexual predator who hid behind a mask of respectability\\". \\"He used his position as a teacher to engineer situations which allowed him to isolate and target his victims,\\" he said. \\"He took advantage of his position of trust to abuse young men in his care. \\"Thanks to the bravery of his victims, their courage in speaking to us and their commitment and support throughout this investigation, and to close working with Greater Manchester Police, we have been able to secure this conviction today.\\" He added the police message was that they would listen and take action on all reports of abuse no matter where or when they occurred. Talbot was jailed for five years at Manchester Crown Court in 2015 for the indecent assault of two 14-year-old boys. The former television personality was formerly a regular on the floating weather map in Liverpool's Albert Dock for ITV's This Morning show.

(CNN) -- The brand name Yukos no longer exists and its former founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky has left Russia after being freed from jail, but a landmark ruling in the Hague released Monday ensures their legacy will live on during a sensitive period of time for Vladimir Putin. Yukos was one of Russia's oil giants through the 1990s and until the early 2000s, when its assets were expropriated by the state after a political battle with Khodorkovsky. Now the Permanent Court of Arbitration, in what is considered a landmark judgment, has ordered payment of damages to its former shareholders, totaling 50 billion and including interest and fees for violation of a treaty covering Russia's energy assets. \\"The","output":"ruling sends a clear message to Russia and other countries that unjust expropriation of assets and politically motivated actions against businesses will not go unpunished,\\" the Permanent Court of Arbitration stated. This decision comes at a time when Vladimir Putin's government is already under scrutiny due to rising tensions with the West, particularly over Ukraine and the ongoing investigation into alleged election interference. Observers believe that the timing of the judgment could prove to be a double-edged sword for the Kremlin. On one hand, it may further damage Russia's international reputation and increase pressure for reforms and transparency within the country. On the other hand, it could rally domestic support as the government portrays itself as a victim of foreign interference and political bias. The court's decision has been hailed as a victory for the rule of law by the ex-shareholders of Yukos and their legal representatives. GML, the group representing former shareholders, stated that this judgment \\"confirms the politically motivated attacks on Yukos and vindicates the rights of the company's former shareholders.\\" Meanwhile, Khodorkovsky, who now runs the Open Russia Foundation from his exile in Switzerland, called the ruling \\"encouraging\\" and hopes it will serve as a precedent for other victims of political repression. However, the question of whether Russia will comply with the court's ruling remains uncertain. The Russian government has long argued that the case is politically motivated and the court lacks jurisdiction over the matter. Despite the uncertainty, the ruling is seen as a major milestone in a long-standing legal battle, and it will likely have lasting implications on Russia's actions both domestically and on the international stage. The Yukos case has been a thorn in the side of Putin's administration since its inception, and this ruling is a stark reminder that political battles of the past still have a significant impact on the present. As the world watches to see how Russia will respond, the legacy of Yukos and its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, continues to shape the political landscape, pushing the limits of power and justice in an increasingly complex world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Prideaux is shot and captured. Amid the international incident that follows, Control and his right-hand man George Smiley are forced into retirement. Control dies of illness. Percy Alleline becomes the new Chief, with Bill Haydon as his deputy, and Roy Bland and Toby Esterhase as key lieutenants. Despite Control and Smiley's misgivings, their successors had already begun a secret operationâ\\"Witchcraft\\"âto obtain Soviet intelligence, which is being exchanged with the CIA for US intelligence. Smiley is brought out of retirement by Oliver Lacon, the civil servant in charge of intelligence, to investigate a claim by Ricki Tarr, a British spy, that there has been a long-term mole in a senior role in the Circus, as Control had suspected. Smiley chooses a trustworthy agent, Peter Guillam, and retired Special Branch officer Mendel to help him. He interviews Connie Sachs, who was sacked by Alleline after deducing that Alexei Polyakov, a Soviet cultural attachÃ© in London, was a spy. Tarr tells Smiley that, on a mission to Istanbul, he had had an affair with Irina, a Soviet agent. She wanted to reveal the name of a mole in the top ranks of the Circus, but when Tarr reported this to London, they ignored him and ordered him straight home, whereas Moscow immediately kidnapped Irina. Tarr concluded that the mole had intercepted his message, and went into hiding, suspected of defecting and murdering the British station chief. Smiley sends Guillam to steal the Circus logbook for the night Tarr called: he finds the pages for that night are cut out, suggesting that Tarr's story is true. Smiley interviews Prideaux, who after brutal interrogation was exchanged by the Soviets but sacked from the service.

You can offer some related item or incentive to increase the odds that people will purchase the eBook.  This is a particularly good strategy if you have other eBooks that you've written. You can offer access to one of these books for free with the purchase of your new book. Keep in mind that you should never offer something for free that will cost you a lot of money. If the cost of the free gift is more than the profit you'll make on the eBook, you will put yourself in the hole financially! An affiliate program is a system to gain referrals in exchange for a commission. Members of your affiliate program will receive a small incentive to promote your book for you.. For instance, a popular lifestyle blogger might recommend your eBook and provide a referral link to her readers, and she will earn a 10% commission on sales that result from site traffic and purchases using that referral link.  You need to ensure that the price of your eBook can justify paying commissions. A book that sells for 0.99, for example, can only afford a few penny's worth of commission for referrals. You can ask friends, family, or members of your writing club to serve as affiliates, but the most affective online affiliates are those with a substantial blog or social media presence. Search engine optimization (SEO) is a way to ensure that when people search the internet using popular search engines, your eBook will show up in the suggested results. For instance, if you've written an eBook about changing tires, your eBook website would show up in the first page of search results when a person typed in the search query \\"how to change a tire.\\"  To take advantage of search engine optimization, you need to make sure your eBook or author website uses the right terms and phrases, known as keywords, to drive traffic to your site.  Start by creating a very extensive list of all the possible search engine queries a person may use who would benefit from your eBook. In the example of an eBook on changing tires, you might include makes and models of cars included in your guide; popular brands of tires; words like tire, car, maintenance, mechanic, service; and others. Next, update your website using these words as much as possible, in the actual text visible to readers (the \\"front page\\") and the indexing system you use on the \\"back page\\" as you write the website. You still want your website to be helpful, reader-friendly, and attractive, so be careful to keep it sounding natural.

The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients.

The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA.

Pointing to a color1ful flower, Campbell lifts her baby's soft hand, and rapidly moves it from one side of his nose to the other as she sniffs  .\\"Flower!\\" she says loudly. Gregory smiles and looks carefully. It could be a year before Gregory, 4 months old, can speak, but now his mother hopes to communicate with her baby through sign language. Like others around the world, Campbell is part of a growing movement of parents teaching hearing babies simple signs to communicate before they can talk. The baby sign language has been more popular in recent years. The movie,\\"Meet the Fockers\\",where the main character teaches his young grandson to sign, makes it well developed. Babies generally begin to talk between 12 and 15 months, but babies can use sign language to communicate before they learn how to speak. \\"We know they are learning language faster than they are able to show you with their speech production because that system takes a long time to develop.\\" says McRoberts, director of developmental research at the Haskins Laboratories. \\"They are understanding words before they are able to say them. From around 16 to 18 months, they might say 50 words but understand 200.They understand short sentences well.\\" says McRoberts. Studies have shown deaf children learn to use sign language earlier than hearing children learn to speak meaningfully. As to whether hearing babies can communicate earlier with sign language, McRoberts says,\\"I think that's still unknown. It may not. I'm very interested in that very question.\\" Which of the following does McRoberts agree with? A) Babies learn to talk quickly. B) Babies can understand more words than they can say.

Others may pause to wonder why Connecticut--and 19 other states--needs an antitrust policy separate from that of the United States. Does it follow that \\"Many wonder why 20 states need a different antitrust policy than the one written by the United States.\\"? Choose your answer from: [-] yes. [-] it is not possible to tell. [-] no.","output":"Yes, the statement \\"Many wonder why 20 states need a different antitrust policy than the one written by the United States.\\" accurately reflects the sentiment of those who question the necessity of state-level antitrust policies. Antitrust laws play a crucial role in regulating the competitiveness within an economy, preventing monopolies and promoting fair competition. In the United States, federal antitrust laws such as the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act provide a unified framework to prevent businesses from engaging in anti-competitive practices. However, some states such as Connecticut have enacted their own antitrust laws and established specific antitrust policies. There are reasons for this divergence and it can be helpful to understand the underlying motivations behind the existence of state-level antitrust policies. 1. Tailored regulation: State antitrust policies can be designed to address specific regional issues related to competition and market dynamics. State policymakers can create legislation that targets economic matters unique to their jurisdiction, allowing for a more tailored approach than a strictly federal system might offer. 2. Enforcement: States may enact their own antitrust policy to ensure that they have the authority to enforce the laws at the state level. In some cases, state attorneys general might have more experience dealing with local issues, giving them an advantage in enforcement efforts. 3. Policy experimentation: States often function as laboratories of policy experimentation. State-level antitrust laws can serve as an opportunity for states to test new legislation and policies that might better address contemporary business practices and market dynamics. If successful, these innovative policies could serve as models for future federal legislation. 4. Additional protection: State antitrust policies can provide consumers and businesses with additional protection and recompense in cases where federal laws fail to offer adequate reassurance. While there are valid arguments for having state-level antitrust policies, those who question the need for different antitrust policies in 20 states might have concerns about potential drawbacks, such as: 1. Fragmentation: With 20 states having their own antitrust policies, this creates a more fragmented and complex landscape for businesses to navigate. Companies operating in multiple states must ensure compliance with both federal and varying state regulations, potentially increasing the costs and challenges of operating in these areas. 2. Inconsistencies: Divergent antitrust laws and policies across states could create inconsistencies and disparities in business regulation. This might be confusing and potentially lead to unfair advantages or disadvantages for companies operating in different states. 3. Overlapping authority: There is the potential for overlapping authority between the federal and state agencies, which might complicate enforcement and lead to wasteful duplication of effort. In conclusion, the statement \\"Many wonder why 20 states need a different antitrust policy than the one written by the United States.\\" reflects the perspective of those who question the necessity of state-level antitrust policies. It is important to weigh the benefits of tailored regulation and enforcement against potential drawbacks such as fragmentation, inconsistencies, and overlapping authority when examining the rationale for state antitrust policies."},{"instruction":"Question: \\"Danny Patrick (politician)\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

PUBLISHED:. 11:12 EST, 28 September 2013. |. UPDATED:. 12:27 EST, 28 September 2013. Glamour: Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva pictured at the Cannes Film Festival. Both sisters would look at home in a. James Bond film - both are wealthy, glamorous, and the daughter of a. central Asian dictator. But. Lola, the 35-year-old younger daughter of Islam Karimov, has revealed. in her first in her first interview with Western media that she and her. elder sister Gulnara hate each other. Lola. Karimova-Tillyaeva, Uzbekistan's permanent representative at Unesco in. Paris, agreed to take part in an interview with the BBC Uzbek Service. carried out by email. Lola has tended to avoid the media since she attempted to sue a French website that called her a 'dictator's daughter' in 2011. Human rights activists testified at the trial and the case was thrown out. Lola is based in Geneva, is Uzbekistan's ambassador to Unesco in Paris, and lives in a mansion that reportedly cost £29m. She said that she had not spoken to her ambitious older sister, Gulnara, for 12 years. She went further, saying she ensured her two or three visits to Uzbekistan per year do not coincide with the times Gulnara will be there. 'We have never hidden this from anyone ... We have neither family nor friendship contacts,' she said. 'We don't even meet each other for family activities.' Gulnara, 41, who is seen as a possible presidential successor, is known as a pop singer and fashion designer and runs jewellery and cosmetics businesses and number of charities. Last year as her alter-ego GooGoosha, she recorded a duet with Gerard Depardieu, Until recently she was Uzbekistan's permanent representative in the UN in Geneva and the country's ambassador in Spain. However, there are plenty of similarities between the two: both lead jet-set lifestyles, hob-nob with Western celebrities and pride themselves on their generous philanthropic endeavours. Lola and her husband Timur have been included in a list of Swizterland's wealthiest people - and so has Gulnara. But it seems that rivalry and resentment trump sisterly loyalty. 'Any good relationship requires a similarity of outlook or likeness of character,' said Lola. Harmony? Lola's sister Gulnara pictured here with Sting, who defended his decision to perform in Uzbekistan despite its poor human rights record. 'There is nothing like that in our relationship, has never been and is not now.' She said she and her sister had had quite different characters since childhood.'And these differences, as you know, only grow over the years.' This is not merely a family squabble. Their father is 75 and rumours have begun to swirl around the question of his succeessor. Karimov has ruled the country since it declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 with such an iron grip that there are no major high-profile politicians waiting in the wings. Party: Lola and her husband Timur pictured in Saint Tropez. Gulnara has long been tipped as a possible successor, but she is deeply unpopular in Uzbekistan. A US diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks referred to her as 'the single most hated person in the country'. The Harvard graduate has been given diplomatic status by her father, and according to the memos sent to Washington, seen as a 'robber baron'. Lola was no politician and wanted to focus on her family. But she told the BBC she thought Gulnara's chances of succeeding their father are 'slim'. It may be that Lola is publicly distancing herself from her sister because Gulnara has been linked to a wide-ranging international fraud investigations. Critics claim she runs a huge business empire in Uzbekistan. Gulnara has denied all wrongdoing. Lola told the BBC that she does not know whether her father is aware of the allegations surrounding her sister's business interests, ebcause she and her father never discuss politics. Asked why she sued the French news site, Rue89, Lola said that it hurts her when the media referred to her only as a 'dictator's daughter'.'I want to be seen as a person with her own principles and viewpoint,' she said. On the question of her father's policies, she said she agreed with his view that radicalisation of the population was largely due to unemployment and lack of opportunity. Karimov has been accused of using the pretext of combating Islamic extremism to quash all dissent. She said: 'And I am confident they cannot be solved by using force.' Karimov is accused of sanctioning his henchmen to slaughter hundreds of his own citizens at a massacre in the city of Andijan in 2005, though western leaders have courted him due to his country's proximity to Afghanistan. Human rights activists say he has had opponents boiled alive, and torture is widespread in the country's prisons. Uprising: the Andijan massacre in 2005 was one of the bloodiest episodes in Uzbekistan's post-Soviet history. Karimov said in a television interview in June that Uzbeks who went to Russia to look for work were 'lazy', and said he felt 'disgusted that people go there for a slice of bread'. Average annual income in Uzbekistan is just £1,063, and the US estimates that around one in four Uzbeks works abroad because of a lack of work closer to home. Her father has been accused of forcing Uzbeks, even minors, to spend their summers picking cotton for little or no pay. In her email interview she appeared to criticise this practice. 'I am against any exploitation, especially the exploitation of children,' she said. Ally: after 9/11 US President George W Bush met President Karimov, viewing Uzbekistan as useful because it borders Afghanistan. Curiously, despite Lola's claim that she and her sister have not spoken for 12 years, another leaked US cable suggests that only nine years ago the two partied together in the capital, Tashkent, where Lola reportedly owned a nightclub. '[Lola] Karimova typically arrives in her – one-of-a-kind, for Tashkent – Porsche Cayenne S sports utility vehicle around 10 o'clock for the traditional floorshow and stays until the wee hours dancing the night away in the raucous disco.

Here's why: In the given scenario, we can deduce the following points: 1. Billy often eats hamburgers but doesn't always include cheese. 2. He eats cheeseburgers more often than some people, indicating that he does consume cheeseburgers but not necessarily at a higher frequency than all others. 3. He eats cheeseburgers less often than others, implying that his consumption is not extremely frequent, but he still indulges in them. Based on these points, \\"occasionally\\" best describes Billy's cheeseburger consumption behavior. Let's compare this with the other options: - Seldom: This term implies that something rarely occurs. Considering that Billy eats cheeseburgers more often than some people, \\"seldom\\" might underestimate his frequency of consumption. - Hardly ever: This choice indicates that something almost never happens, which does not fit the description of Billy's eating habits since he does eat cheeseburgers more often than some people. - Infrequently: While this term might seem similar to \\"occasionally,\\" it tends to refer to something happening less often than the latter. Therefore, it might not fully capture the extent of Billy's cheeseburger consumption. - Never: This option is not accurate since the scenario explicitly mentions that Billy does eat cheeseburgers, just not as often as other people.

April is believed dead after being crushed by the wreckage of the space shuttle. Tech mogul Aston Reynolds (based on Tesla, Inc. co-founder and SpaceX founder Elon Musk) has developed a new type of high-speed space travel with his company Astro-X (a play on SpaceX), which was used to save Fin's father, Colonel Gilbert Shepard, from the moon. Astro-X has also developed a technology that is capable of using radio waves to diffuse tornadoes, leading to the end of the sharknado phenomenon. Fin travels to Molong with his cousin Gemini to meet up with his son Matt, who has returned from deployment in Iraq. Meanwhile, Reynolds has built and is opening a shark-themed hotel featuring a giant tank of sharks.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the band whose fans are described as \\"veritable teenyboppers\\"?  Touring internationally in June and July, the Beatles staged 37 shows over 27 days in Denmark, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. In August and September they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities. Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York.In August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan. Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \\"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\\": Dylan's audience of \\"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\\" contrasted with their fans, \\"veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion. To many of Dylan's followers in the folk music scene, the Beatles were seen as idolaters, not idealists.\\" Within six months of the meeting, according to Gould, \\"Lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated Dylan's nasal drone, brittle strum, and introspective vocal persona\\"; and six months after that, Dylan began performing with a backing band and electric instrumentation, and \\"dressed in the height of Mod fashion\\". As a result, Gould continues, the traditional division between folk and rock enthusiasts \\"nearly evaporated\\", as the Beatles' fans began to mature in their outlook and Dylan's audience embraced the new, youth-driven pop culture.During the 1964 US tour, the group were confronted with the reality of racial segregation in the country at the time, particularly in the South.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Mother and Son Context: The film opens on two human forms, which soon reveal themselves to be that of a young man and a frail old woman. They recline in a silence broken only by whispers and indistinguishable noises. The young man is the son (Alexei Ananishnov) who is taking care of his exhausted sick mother (Gudrun Geyer). Her illness is undefined and from time to time causes her great pain as she gasps for air. Her son combs her hair, feeds her, covers her with a coat, and takes her in his arms. She is totally dependent on him as he himself was once totally dependent on her. As the film progresses, the son carries his mother on a long journey from her sickbed to her deathbed. It is a circular motion which travels a long walk through a dreamlike landscape in the countryside, along winding dirt roads. At each of their brief stops on the journey is a moment of contemplation, caresses, and tender murmurs. These soft murmurs tell of the mother's love for her son when she was nurturing him and of the son's love for his mother as he opens for her the mysterious path to her death. They progress under the leaden and luminous sky of the Baltic, in totally isolated landscapes. From time to time, there is a far away train or a sail on the sea, emphasizing further their isolation from the rest of the world. They return to the house. The son tenderly lowers his mother into her bed that now seems to resemble a coffin. Although he tries to reassure her to the contrary they both know that the end is coming. He leaves her and goes for a long solitary walk. When he returns he weeps for his mother who's died. Answer:","output":"The old woman is the sick mother (Gudrun Geyer) in the movie Mother and Son.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Tampa Bay Lightning at Toronto Maple Leafs game preview Expectations in hockey-mad Toronto appear to be taking their toll on the Maple Leafs, whose coach is aware of both the issue of his job security and the tension surrounding his struggling team. Randy Carlyle's club has lost three straight heading into Thursday night's home matchup with the Tampa Bay Lightning, and he's aware that improvement needs to come quickly. A 9-2 home loss to Nashville on Tuesday had Carlyle on the defensive the next day, as he often appeared agitated during his post-practice news conference. \\"You're always in a position of doubt when things go awry with your hockey club. When you take these jobs, you can expect that,\\" he said. \\"In this market it's a little bit more intense at times, just by the number of (media) that are here today. We have some faces that we haven't (seen) all year, and it's very similar to last night, that it seems that negativity brings a lot more people out to ask the questions, and rightfully so.\\" Toronto (9-8-2) hadn't allowed nine goals since a 12-1 loss to Pittsburgh on Dec. 26, 1991. It's been outscored 17-5 during its losing streak, including a 6-2 loss to lowly Buffalo on Saturday. Carlyle also spoke about his beleaguered players \\"squeezing the stick\\" in practice Wednesday. \\"Honestly, we've got to quiet the noise,\\" defenseman Cody Franson said. \\"We are feeling a lot of pressure right now and it's tough not to feel that and just focus on hockey. I think we're in a situation where everyone is feeling the heat.\\" The Leafs went 6-1-1 in their eight games before their skid, during which they've lost twice at home following a four-game winning streak at Air Canada Centre. \\"When you get beat like that in professional sports it is embarrassing, and when you get beat like that in front of your home fans it compounds things,\\" captain Dion Phaneuf said. \\"It is unacceptable.\\" They'll look to bounce back against a Lightning team coming off a 5-2 loss to the New York Islanders on Tuesday. Tampa Bay (13-5-2) had won its previous two but looked sluggish late in second of a back-to-back set. Alex Killorn and Ondrej Palat scored for the Lightning, which lost center Cedric Paquette in the first period to a lower-body injury. The status of Paquette, who had five goals in his previous six games, is unclear. \\"That's a tough one for us,\\" coach Jon Cooper said. \\"We gave them six power plays. We lost a forward, so we're playing 50 minutes in a back-to-back with 11 forwards.\\" The Lightning could get a boost from the return of winger Brett Connolly, who has missed the last 12 with a leg injury. He said he's hoping to \\"sneak into the lineup\\" against Toronto, but Cooper has given no indication if Connolly will play. Ben Bishop should be back in goal after Evgeni Nabokov made 31 saves against the Islanders. Bishop is 8-1-1 in his last 10 starts and has a 1.72 goals-against average in his past four. It's uncertain who the Leafs will go with in net after Tuesday's disastrous performance. Jonathan Bernier was pulled before the second period after allowing three goals on 12 shots, and James Reimer gave up six for the second straight game after taking the loss against the Sabres. \\"We need a better performance from everybody,\\" Carlyle said. \\"Goaltending is part of that.\\" Tampa Bay has won the last two meetings. Steven Stamkos had a hat trick in a 5-3 victory March 19 - giving him four goals and two assists in his last three against the Leafs - before Palat scored twice in a 3-0 win April 8.","output":"The Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team has not been playing well recently, and they lost three games in a row.

Answer based on context: In the aftermath of the Clemenceau negotiations in January 1920, violent attacks against French forces occurred sporadically across Syria and effectively the Syrian Congress assembled in March 1920 to declare Faisal the king of Syria, as well as to officially set up the Arab Kingdom of Syria with Hashim al-Atassi as Prime Minister. An independent Arab Kingdom of Syria was proclaimed in Damascus on March 8, 1920, in an apparent dispute with the French over the nature of its rule. This action was immediately repudiated by the British and French and the San Remo Conference was called together by the League of Nations in April 1920 to explicitly establish the mandate of the French over Syria. Shortly, the war of Syrian Arab nationalists with the French became a devastating campaign for the new proclaimed Arab Kingdom of Syria. Several violent incidents in the region initiated by Arab militias, like the Battle of Tel Hai, led to further international support of the French. The League of Nations having given the French Mandate of Syria as planned, the French General Gouraud issued an ultimatum to the Syrian government to disband its troops and submit to French control. Worried about the results of a long bloody fight with the French, King Faisal himself surrendered on July 14, 1920, but his message would not reach the general  and King Faisal's defense minister Yusuf al-'Azma, who ignoring the King, led an army to Maysalun to defend Syrian Arab Kingdom from French advance. The Hashemite government of Damascus submitted reluctantly to the French ultimatum and disbanded its troops. How many months was it between the Clemenceau negotiations and when King Faisal surrendered himself?","output":"The Clemenceau negotiations occurred in January 1920, and King Faisal surrendered on July 14, 1920.

Let's go through each of the given choices and analyze their relation to the situation: - Sweating: Since it's a hot summer day, it's possible that James might have been sweating, but it doesn't directly explain why he chose to cool off in the pool. - Relaxation: Cooling off in the pool on a hot day can provide a feeling of relaxation and comfort. - Revenge: This choice doesn't seem relevant to the situation, as there's no mention of any conflict or reason for revenge. - Shivering: This is not consistent with the context, as shivering usually occurs when someone's feeling cold, not on a hot summer day. - Loss of heat: This choice might have some relation to James cooling off in the pool, as being in the water can help in losing heat from the body.

Four other Thai soldiers have been killed since the fighting started Friday, according to Col. Sansern Kaewkumnerd. Authorities have evacuated thousands of people from nearby villages.

Answer based on context: Although it was a relatively slow game in the first half for both the Rams and Texans, the second half was a stark contrast as Goff had a career-high 355 yards and 3 touchdowns (surpassing the total from his team's 51-17 blowout win over the New York Giants). One was a 94-yard pass to Robert Woods (the third-longest touchdown pass in Rams history) and 1 a pass to Sammy Watkins. Meanwhile, the Rams defense caused 4 turnovers on the Texans 2 of which were strip sack recoveries from Connor Barwin and Samson Ebukam while the other 2 were interceptions (one was by strong safety Blake Countess). The game ended in a Rams victory with a 33-7 score and the fourth-straight win. With that win, the Rams improved to 7-2, their best start in a season since 2001. They now have at least one home victory against all 31 other franchises. How many total points were scored in the game?","output":"The total points scored in the game can be calculated by adding the points scored by each team. In this context, the Rams scored 33 points and the Texans scored 7 points.  33 (Rams' score) + 7 (Texans' score) = 40 total points.

Answer:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"What cannot reproduce by themselves?\\" is viruses, specifically referencing the example provided by the teacher, which is the Influenza virus from the family Orthomyxoviridae.  Viruses are unique and complex microscopic entities that dwell at the edge of what constitutes living organisms. Unlike cells, they lack the necessary components to carry out basic life-sustaining processes such as metabolism and reproduction by themselves. Instead, viruses must infect host cells and hijack their internal machinery to reproduce and propagate. The Influenza virus, belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae, is a prime example of a virus that cannot reproduce without a host cell. Often causing seasonal flu, the Influenza virus infects humans and animals, using their cells to create new copies of itself. The virus enters a host cell and takes over its functions, forcing the cell to produce copies of the virus's genetic material and protein components. These components are then assembled into new virus particles, which eventually burst out of the host cell and infect neighboring cells. This process leads to the spread of the virus throughout the organism, causing the flu symptoms we commonly experience. In summary, viruses, specifically the Influenza virus from the Orthomyxoviridae family, cannot reproduce by themselves and must rely on host cells to propagate and continue their life cycle.

Help as much as you can. Information:  - Amun (also \\"Amon, Amen\\"; Greek \\"Ámmn\\", \\"Hámmn\\") was a major Ancient Egyptian deity. He was attested since the Old Kingdom together with his wife Amaunet.  With the 11th dynasty (21st century BC), he rose to the position of patron deity of Thebes by replacing Monthu.  - The son of Shoshenq I and his chief consort, Karomat A, Osorkon I was the second king of Egypt's 22nd Dynasty and ruled around 922 BC  887 BC. He succeeded his father Shoshenq I who probably died within a year of his successful 923 BC campaign against the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Osorkon I's reign is known for many temple building projects and was a long and prosperous period of Egypt's History. His highest known date is a \\"Year 33 Second Heb Sed\\" inscription found on the bandage of Nakhtefmut's Mummy which held a bracelet inscribed with Osorkon I's praenomen: \\"Sekhemkheperre\\". This date can only belong to Osorkon I since no other early Dynasty 22 king ruled for close to 30 years until the time of Osorkon II. Other mummy linens which belong to his reign include three separate bandages dating to his Regnal Years 11, 12, and 23 on the mummy of Khonsmaakheru in Berlin. The bandages are anonymously dated but definitely belong to his reign because Khonsmaakheru wore leather bands that contained a \\"menat-tab\\" naming Osorkon I. Secondly, no other king who ruled around Osorkon I's reign had a 23rd Regnal Year including Shoshenq I who died just before the beginning of his Year 22.  - King Usermaatre Setepenre/Setepenamun Shoshenq III ruled Egypt's 22nd Dynasty for 39 years according to contemporary historical records. Two Apis Bulls were buried in the fourth and 28th years of his reign and he celebrated his Heb Sed Jubilee in his regnal year 30. Little is known of the precise basis for his successful claim to the throne since he was not a son of Osorkon II and Shoshenq's parentage and family ties are unknown.  - Usermaatre Setepenamun Osorkon II was the fifth pharaoh of the Twenty-second Dynasty of Ancient Egypt and the son of Takelot I and Queen Kapes. He ruled Egypt around 872 BC to 837 BC from Tanis, the capital of this Dynasty. After succeeding his father, he was faced with the competing rule of his cousin, king Harsiese A, who controlled both Thebes and the Western Oasis of Egypt. Osorkon feared the serious challenge posed by Harsiese's kingship to his authority but, when Harsiese conveniently died in 860 BC, Osorkon II ensured that this problem would not recur by appointing his own son Nimlot C as the next High Priest of Amun at Thebes. This consolidated the pharaoh's authority over Upper Egypt and meant that Osorkon II ruled over a united Egypt. Osorkon II's reign would be a time of large scale monumental building and prosperity for Egypt.  - Pedubastis I or Pedubast I was an Upper Egyptian Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt during the 9th century BC. Based on lunar dates which are known to belong to the reign of his rival in Upper Egypt Takelot II and the fact that Pedubast I first appeared as a local king at Thebes around Year 11 of Takelot II's rule, Pedubast I is today believed to have had his accession date in either 835 BC or 824 BC. This local Pharaoh is recorded as being of ancient Libyan ancestry and ruled Egypt for 25 years according to the redaction of Manetho done by Eusebius. He first became king at Thebes in Year 8 of Shoshenq III and his highest dated Year is his 23rd Year according to Nile Level Text No. 29. This year is equivalent to Year 31 of Shoshenq III of the Tanis based 22nd Dynasty of Egypt; however, since Shoshenq II only controlled Lower Egypt in Memphis and the Delta region, Pedubast and Shoshenq III were not political rivals and may even have established a relationship. Indeed, Shoshenq III's son, the general and army leader Pashedbast B \\"built a vestibule door to Pylon X at Karnak, and in one and the same commemorative text thereon named his father as [king] Sheshonq (III)\\" but dated his actions here to Pedubast I. This may show some tacit support for the Pedubast faction by the Tanite based 22nd dynasty king Shoshenq III.  - Heqakheperre Shoshenq II or Shoshenq IIa was a pharaoh of the 22nd dynasty of Egypt. He was the only ruler of this Dynasty whose tomb was not plundered by tomb robbers. His final resting place was discovered within an antechamber of Psusennes I's tomb at Tanis by Pierre Montet in 1939. Montet removed the coffin lid of Shoshenq II on March 20, 1939, in the presence of king Farouk of Egypt himself. It proved to contain a large number of jewel-encrusted bracelets and pectorals, along with a beautiful hawkheaded silver coffin and a gold funerary mask. The gold facemask had been placed upon the head of the king. Montet later discovered the intact tombs of two Dynasty 21 kingsPsusennes I and Amenemope a year later in February and April 1940 respectively. Shoshenq II's prenomen, Heqakheperre Setepenre, means \\"The manifestation of Ra rules, the chosen one of Ra.\\"  - Hedjkheperre Setepenre Shoshenq I (Egyptian \\"ššnq\\"), (reigned c.943-922 BCE)  also known as Sheshonk or Sheshonq I (for discussion of the spelling, see Shoshenq)  was a pharaoh of ancient Egypt and the founder of the Twenty-second Dynasty. Of ancient Libyan (Meshwesh-Berber) ancestry, Shoshenq I was the son of Nimlot A, Great Chief of the Ma, and his wife Tentshepeh A, a daughter of a Great Chief of the Ma herself. He is presumed to be the Shishaq mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, and his exploits are carved on the Bubastite Portal at Karnak.  - King Hedjkheperre Setepenamun Harsiese or Harsiese A, is viewed by the Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen in his \\"Third Intermediate Period in Egypt\\", to be both a \\"High Priest of Amun\\" and the son of the High Priest of Amun Shoshenq C. The archaeological evidence does suggest that he was indeed Shoshenq C's son. However, recent published studies by the German Egyptologist Karl Jansen-Winkeln in \\"JEA\\" 81 (1995) have demonstrated that all the monuments of the first (king) Harsiese show that he was never a High Priest of Amun in his own right. Rather both Harsiese A and his son [...du] whose existence is known from inscriptions on the latter's funerary objects at Coptos are only attested as Ordinary Priests of Amun. Instead, while Harsiese A was certainly an independent king at Thebes during the first decade of Osorkon II's kingship, he was a different person from a second person who was also called Harsiese: Harsiese B. Harsiese B was the genuine High Priest of Amun who is attested in office late in Osorkon II's reign, in the regnal year 6 of Shoshenq III and in regnal years 18 and 19 of Pedubast I, according to Jansen-Winkeln.  - Thutmose I (sometimes read as \\"Thothmes,\\" \\"Thutmosis\\" or \\"Tuthmosis I\\", meaning \\"Thoth-Born\\") was the third pharaoh of the 18th dynasty of Egypt. He received the throne after the death of the previous king, Amenhotep I. During his reign, he campaigned deep into the Levant and Nubia, pushing the borders of Egypt farther than ever before. He also built many temples in Egypt, and a tomb for himself in the Valley of the Kings; he is the first king confirmed to have done this (though Amenhotep I may have preceded him).  - Shoshenq C was the eldest son of the 22nd Dynasty pharaoh Osorkon I and queen Maatkare, the daughter of Psusennes II, and served as the High Priest of Amun at Thebes during his father's reign. Consequently, he was the most important official in Upper Egypt after the king himself. He has generally been equated with Heqakheperre Shoshenq II by the English Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen and viewed as a short-lived co-regent to his father based on the Nile God British Museum statue 8 which identifies him as the son of Osorkon I and Queen Maatkare, daughter of Hor-Psusennes but this assumption is unproven. In the statue, Shoshenq C is called \\"the Master of the Two Lands\\" and the formula \\"beloved of Amun\\" is enclosed within a royal cartouche. However, in the text of the statue, he is not given a specific throne name or prenomen, the use of a cartouche by a royal prince is attested in other periods of Egyptian history such as that of Amenmes, son of Thutmose I, and the documents depicts Shoshenq C as a simple High Priest of Amun on the side of the legs of the Nile God, rather than a king.  - Upper Egypt (', shortened to ' ) is the strip of land on both sides of the Nile that extends between Nubia and downriver (northwards) to Lower Egypt.  - Harsiese B was a High Priest of Amun in 874 BC. Earlier Egyptologists assumed he was both the High Priest of Amun ( HPA ) and son of the High Priest Shoshenq C , who may have become a king at Thebes . However , recent research by Karl Jansen - Winkeln shows that all the monuments of the first ( King ) Harsiese A demonstrate that he was never High Priest of Amun in his own right , merely a regular Priest of Amun . While the earlier Harsiese was certainly a king at Thebes , he is clearly a different person from the later Harsiese , Harsiese B , who is attested as a High Priest of Amun . Jansen - Winkeln further shows that Harsiese A 's son , ( ... du ) , was only an ordinary Priest of Amun . Harsiese B is first explicitly attested as High Priest of Amun late under Osorkon II 's reign on Statue CGC 42225 , which bears this king 's cartouche . He likely assumed the office at Thebes when the current High Priest , Takelot F , proclaimed himself as king Takelot II in the final 3 years of Osorkon II 's reign . Statue CGC 42225 was dedicated by the \`\` Letter Writer to Pharaoh '' , Hor IX , who is mentioned on the walls of Temple J at Karnak . Temple J was built in the final years of Osorkon II 's reign by the then serving HPA , Takelot F. Hor IX later served under Pedubast I and Usermaatre Meryamun Shoshenq VI , who were direct contemporaries of Shoshenq III of the Twenty - second Dynasty . Shoshenq III once even dispatched his second son , Pashedbast B , to Thebes where the latter \`\` added a vestibule door to Pylon X at Karnak , dating it to the reign of Pedubast . '' Hor IX served beyond the 25 - year reign of Pedubast I and lived into Shoshenq VI 's reign under whom his funerary cones were inscribed . Consequently , the High Priest of Amun Harsiese can only be Harsiese B since he was a close contemporary of Hor IX and served late in office under Osorkon II. In contrast , Harsiese A died before the twelfth regnal year of Osorkon II. Harsiese B is also attested in office in the sixth regnal year of Shoshenq III in...  - Kenneth Anderson Kitchen (born in 1932) is a British Bible scholar, Ancient Near Eastern historian, and Personal and Brunner Professor Emeritus of Egyptology and Honorary Research Fellow at the School of Archaeology, Classics and Egyptology, University of Liverpool, England. He is one of the leading experts on the ancient Egyptian Ramesside Period (i.e., Dynasties 19-20), and the Third Intermediate Period, as well as ancient Egyptian chronology, having written over 250 books and journal articles on these and other subjects since the mid-1950s. He has been described by \\"The Times\\" as \\"the very architect of Egyptian chronology\\".  - Titkheperure or Tyetkheperre Psusennes II <nowiki>[</nowiki>Greek <nowiki>]</nowiki> or Hor-Pasebakhaenniut II <nowiki>[</nowiki>Egyptian \\"r-p3-sb3--<n>-nwt\\"<nowiki>]</nowiki>, was the last king of the Twenty-first dynasty of Egypt. His royal name means \\"Image of the transformations of Re\\" in Egyptian. Psusennes II is often considered the same person as the High-Priest of Amun known as Psusennes III. The Egyptologist Karl Jansen-Winkeln notes that an important graffito from the Temple of Abydos contains the complete titles of a king \\"Tyetkheperre Setepenre Pasebakhaenniut Meryamun\\" \\"who is simultaneously called the HPA (i.e., High Priest of Amun) and supreme military commander.\\" This suggests that Psusennes was both king at Tanis and the High Priest in Thebes at the same time, meaning he did not resign his office as High Priest of Amun during his reign. The few contemporary attestations from his reign include the aforementioned graffito in Seti I's Abydos temple, an ostracon from Umm el-Qa'ab, an affiliation at Karnak and his presumed burial  which consists of a gilded coffin with a royal uraeus and a Mummy, found in an antechamber of Psusennes I's tomb at Tanis. He was a High Priest of Amun at Thebes and the son of Pinedjem II and Istemkheb. His daughter Maatkare B was the Great Royal Wife of Osorkon I.

Read the article and select the best answer. Article: This brief book is aimed at high school students, but speaks to anyone learning at any stage of life. Its formal, serious style closely matches its content, a school-masterly book on schooling.The author, W.H.Armstrong, starts with the basics: reading and writing.In his opinion, reading doesn't just mean recognizing each word on the page; it means taking in the information, digesting it and incorporating it into oneself just as one digests a sandwich and makes it a part of himself.The goal is to bring the information back to life, not just to treat it as dead facts on paper from dead trees.Reading and writing cannot be completely separated from each other; in fact, the aim of reading is to express the information you have got from the text.I've seen it again and again:some-one who can't express an idea after reading a text is just as ineffective as someone who hasn't read it at all. Only a third of the book remains after that discussion, which Armstrong devotes to specific tips for studying languages, math, science and history.He generally handles these topics thoroughly and equally, except for some weakness in the science and math sections and a bit too much passion regarding history to his students, that was a hundred times more than my history teachers ever got across.To my disappointment, in this part of the book he ignores the arts.As a matter of fact, they demand all the concentration and study that math and science do, though the study differs slightly in kind.Although it's commonly believed that the arts can only be naturally acquired, actually, learning the arts is no more natural than learning French or mathematics. My other comment is that the text aged.The first edition apparently dates to the 1960s--none of the references seem newer than the late 1950s.As a result, the discussion misses the entire computer age. These are small points, though, and don't affect the main discussion.I recommend it to any student and any teacher, including the self-taught student.

Article: Elshijh, an Egyptian doctoral candidate at Beijing Language and Cultural University, said he felt fairly excited when he learned that Mo Yan had won the literary prize. \\"Mo's winning of the prize is pushing Egypt to translate more of his works into Arabic,\\" Elshijh said, adding that there is already an Arabic edition of \\"Red Sorghum,\\" but Egypt's Ministry of Culture recently announced that it will translate another of Mo's works from Chinese to Arabic. Although Chinese literature is getting more attention around the world, translated versions of Chinese works remain in small supply in places like the United States and Europe. Jonathan Chuck, an American who has been working in social media for three years in China, has read some ancient Chinese classics in Englishand can name several ancient poets such as Li Bai. Chuck said works of Chinese literature are hard to get in the United States, as bookstores simply don't carry many English translations. \\"Besides, China is considered a mysterious country and far away from our daily life.\\" Chuck said when he was in school, pupils mostly studied Western literature translated from French, German and Portuguese, not literature translated from Asian languages. \\"China's Nobel prize will inspire more Westerners to notice Chinese literature, and I may read some of Mo's works,\\" he added. Li Ling, a professor at Beijing Language and Cultural University, said Chinese literature has less of a market than English-language literature because Western culture is the dominant culture. Moreover, it is difficult to fully express some Chinese words in English, which can limit Chinese literature to a Chinese-literate audience, Li added. \\"Western readers are more picky about what they read,\\" he said, explaining that if a Chinese book is not translated well, it would be \\" _ \\" to recommend it to Western readers. Li expects China's Nobel laureate  to expand foreign readership. Question: According to what Chuck said, Mo's winning Nobel Prize has a/an   _   effect on Chinese Literature. - positive - negative - immediate - unobvious The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"positive\\". According to Chuck's statement in the article, he believes that Mo Yan's victory in the literary prize category of the Nobel will encourage more Westerners to pay attention to Chinese literature. He himself expressed interest in reading some of Mo Yan's works due to the prestige associated with the prize. Thus, according to him, the impact Mo's Nobel Prize has on Chinese Literature is positive as it helps bring more international attention and readership."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

CNN's Richard Quest puts the Xshot through its paces with the help of a tourist in Basel. Each show we check out new gadgets and give you our opinion on their usefulness. The XShot. This month CNN's Richard Quest road tested the XShot, a telescopic stainless-steel rod that allows you to take pictures and videos while keeping yourself in the frame. A camera is screwed in position on the end of the lightweight rod which extends by three feet. The mount fits all compact machines. Once in position all you need to do is hit the camera's self-timer or remote, hold the stick out and say \\"cheese.\\" This means you no longer have to be the martyr behind the lens on holiday snaps and you can save yourself the embarrassment of having to ask an unsuspecting member of the public to take a picture of you. Of course, you might well feel just as self-conscious dangling a camera on the end of a meter-long metal stick but at least you'll be able to trust the photographer. Quest tested the gadget against the beautiful alpine views from Mount Stanzahorn, near to the Swiss town of Lucern. After roping in a succession of tourists to try out the XShot, he decided it was easy to operate and compact, and worthy of a thumbs up from Smart Traveller. For more details visit xshotpix.com.

Q:I had this one guy, who enjoyed being a part time bully and part time neutral to me. To say the least he was annoying. He'd take the liberty to hide my backpack, borrow my books without consent, doodle scandalous stuff on my notebooks with a pen and yada yada. So one day, I was showing this cool trick I learned on an anatomy program on the TV to a couple of classmates who used to sit around me. The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed. And then, I saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes. Cool, What I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist. He without batting an eye, asked what I was doing, but then I started beating the desk with my other hand and made squeaking noises while pushing his hand against my throat harder with every turning head. And voilà! Every one in the class (including the teacher) thought he was smothering me. After a few ifs and buts between him and the teacher, he was summoned at the principal’s chambers, from where, later he was sent home, where presumably judging from the look on his face for the next few days, he was beat to crap by his folks. And after that, never was I ever bothered by anyone in the school.(^^) According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Title: Rock Star Movie plot: Chris Cole (Mark Wahlberg) is a Pittsburgh fanatical admirer of a 1980s heavy metal band called Steel Dragon. By day, Chris is a photocopier technician and by night, he is the lead singer of a Steel Dragon tribute band called Blood Pollution (the name is taken from a Steel Dragon song). Internal struggles among the actual Steel Dragon band members culminate with the firing of their lead singer, Bobby Beers (Jason Flemyng), and the starting of recruitment sessions to find a new vocalist. Chris experiences his own strife with his Blood Pollution bandmates, particularly guitarist Rob Malcolm (Timothy Olyphant). During a live performance, Rob's playing fails to live up to Chris' over-demanding standards regarding note-for-note accuracy to the original Steel Dragon recordings, and Chris sabotages Rob's amplifier mid-song - a fight breaks out between the two onstage. The next day, Chris arrives at Blood Pollution's rehearsal space (the basement of an X-rated theater) to find that he's been fired and replaced with his arch-rival, the (now former) lead singer of another Steel Dragon tribute band. Rob also cites Chris' inability to create his own musical style, preferring to remain the singer in a tribute band. One day in 1984, Chris receives an unexpected phone call from Steel Dragon's founder and rhythm guitarist, Kirk Cuddy (Dominic West), and is offered an audition for the band (thanks to two of Blood Pollution's groupies, who showed Kirk a videotape of one of Blood Pollution's concerts). After hanging up on Kirk once, thinking he's being made fun of, Chris ecstatically agrees. At the studio, he meets the band, as well as learning that Bobby Beers was fired because he was a closeted gay, and gives an outstanding performance of \\"We All Die Young\\" (a Steel Dragon song in the movie, but it is actually a song by Steelheart, whose lead vocalist Miljenko Matijevic provides Cole's singing voice for the film).

In this context, it does not make sense to use \\"eager\\" to describe the relationship between \\"clever\\" and \\"obvious.\\" 3. Ambiguity: The sentence is ambiguous as it does not convey a clear meaning. The reader cannot understand if the sentence wants to describe someone clever desiring to be obvious or if the cleverness of an individual is evident. To create a linguistically acceptable sentence, you can restructure it in a way that resolves the aforementioned issues. Here is an example of a more acceptable sentence with a similar meaning: \\"His cleverness is obvious to everyone\\" or \\"He is evidently clever.\\" These sentences make use of an appropriate syntax, clear meaning, and suitable word choices to convey the intended ideas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Finnish government and major creditors of bankrupt shipyard Waertsilae Marine Industries Oy agreed in principle to form a new company to complete most of the troubled shipyard's backlog of 15 ships. The new company will attempt to limit the shipyard's losses, participants said. \\"The situation is that the bankruptcy court will get out of the shipbuilding business. Everything will be taken over by the new company,\\" said Christian Andersson, executive vice president of Oy Waertsilae, former parent of Waertsilae Marine. Once its ownership is finalized, the new company will open talks with state-appointed receivers to buy or lease Waertsilae Marine's shipyard facilities. Subcontractors will be offered a settlement and a swift transition to new management is expected to avert an exodus of skilled workers from Waertsilae Marine's two big shipyards, government officials said. Under an accord signed yesterday, the government and Union Bank of Finland would become major shareholders in the new company, each injecting 100 million Finnish markkaa (23.5 million). Oy Waertsilae is to contribute 200 million markkaa, most of it as subordinated debt, and take a minority stake in the new company. Customers holding contracts for Waertsilae Marine's undelivered ships are expected to subscribe most of the remaining 170 million markkaa in share capital, government officials said. Waertsilae Marine's biggest creditor is Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. Carnival, which has three ships on order from Waertsilae Marine, presented claims for 1.5 billion damages in the bankruptcy court this week. Waertsilae Marine's bankruptcy proceedings began Tuesday in a Helsinki court.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a summary based on this article: While scanning parenting blogs and sites yesterday, I came across an article on Huffington Post about a restaurant receipt with a note from a “single mom.” I was initially a little amused that this was making the rounds because it seems so silly. Who really cares if someone, single mom or not, left a tip? It’s rude in the extreme, but hardly worthy of public discussion. The more I thought about it, though, I realized it wasn’t funny at all.      The restaurant patron, who left no tip on a 138.55 bill, signing, “Single Mom, sorry,” may or may not have been a single mom. I think the diner was not really a single parent, or at least not one who couldn’t afford a tip, but rather someone trying to imply that some single moms feel like they are entitled to a pass because they are struggling financially. The note on the receipt (if it was indeed a joke), and the reaction it has drawn online, points to a larger issue. Increasingly, it seems, single moms are being used as the butt of jokes or, even worse, a scapegoat for societal ills.      What do you think? Is this receipt real? Is the incident indicative of a larger, mostly negative, attitude toward single mothers?      Related content:      Momspeak: Who speaks for the single parent?      Debate over AU professor should be about supporting working parents, not breast-feeding ||||| A photo of a receipt allegedly left by a single mother at a restaurant has gone viral after it was originally posted on Reddit. The bill shows a charge for a 138.35 meal with no additional tip. Instead, there's a note that reads \\"single mom sorry\\" -- implying that whoever signed the bill doesn't have enough money because it is expensive to raise kids alone.      Redditor PhoenixSongFawkes posted the photo and wrote, \\"I'm sure 140 could have gotten you and your kids a week worth of groceries, but instead you spend it one one meal?! For shame!\\"      (Story continues below photo.)      Commenters, including many single moms, were outraged. RedheadedBanshee wrote, \\"I'm a single Mom, and this is bullshit. What exactly are you teaching your kids? ... Dear Parents of all kinds - your kids are watching you and learning.\\" Dozens of commenters suggested that if a person -- single mom or not -- can't afford to leave a tip, that she shouldn't have gone out to eat at all and that whoever left this note is in the wrong.      Lindsay Cross, a blogger for Mommyish and former single mom, has another theory. Cross doesn't believe that the receipt is legitimate. \\"It’s completely possible that someone wanted to be an asshole and blame it on single moms. Honestly, the more I think about how anyone would do this to a waitress, the more I think it’s likely that this was just a very awful prank to make single moms look bad,\\" she wrote.      Though Cross makes it apparent that she isn't trying to stereotype single moms, she notes that moms who raise kids on their own are generally sympathetic to those in service positions and mostly try to help those who are working hard. But on the other hand, as Cross and many commenters argued, \\"jerks\\" come in all shapes and sizes.      (h/t Mommyish)             |||||","output":"The article discusses an incident that took place in a restaurant where a patron left no tip on their 138.55 bill, instead, they left a note stating, “Single Mom, sorry.” The receipt initially caught attention after being posted online, ending up in several parenting blogs and websites, and sparking a significant amount of public discourse. The patron's identity remains unknown, making it unclear whether or not they were indeed a single mom. It's suggested that the diner might not necessarily be a single parent, or at least not one who couldn’t afford a tip, but rather someone attempting to assert the notion that some single moms feel entitled to exemptions under the guise of financial hardship. The posted receipt and the subsequent online reaction have signaled a broader societal issue. The argument in the article points out how single moms are increasingly used as a target for humor or even negatively used to represent societal problems. The controversy over the authenticity of the receipt stems from contrasting perspectives. Some, including single moms, expressed their outrage over the incident, indicating that providing a tip is a standard expectation when dining out, regardless of personal circumstances, and that not doing so sends a poor message to children. They argue that if someone - single mom or not - cannot afford to tip, they should not dine out at all. Conversely, Lindsay Cross, a blogger and former single mom, holds the theory that the receipt might not be legitimate. She theorizes that it could simply be a distasteful prank intended to shed negative light on single moms. Cross mentions that single moms who raise children on their own tend to understand and empathize with individuals in service roles and often seek to assist those who work hard. However, she also emphasizes that discourteous behavior is not exclusive to any particular demographic. In summary, the incident reflects potential biases and stereotypes associated with single parents and raises questions about the authenticity of the narrative depicted in the receipt, leading to a more profound discussion about societal attitudes towards single mothers. The discourse eventually underlines the essence of empathy and mature behavior regardless of one's personal circumstances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Read this: Wherever the Magisterial Reformation, which received support from the ruling authorities, took place, the result was a reformed national Protestant church envisioned to be a part of the whole invisible church, but disagreeing, in certain important points of doctrine and doctrine-linked practice, with what had until then been considered the normative reference point on such matters, namely the Papacy and central authority of the Roman Catholic Church. The Reformed churches thus believed in some form of Catholicity, founded on their doctrines of the five solas and a visible ecclesiastical organization based on the 14th and 15th century Conciliar movement, rejecting the papacy and papal infallibility in favor of ecumenical councils, but rejecting the latest ecumenical council, the Council of Trent. Religious unity therefore became not one of doctrine and identity but one of invisible character, wherein the unity was one of faith in Jesus Christ, not common identity, doctrine, belief, and collaborative action.

American Airlines Flight 11: FAA Awareness. Although the Boston Center air traffic controller realized at an early stage that there was something wrong with American 11, he did not immediately interpret the plane's failure to respond as a sign that it had been hijacked. At 8:14, when the flight failed to heed his instruction to climb to 35,000 feet, the controller repeatedly tried to raise the flight. He reached out to the pilot on the emergency frequency. Though there was no response, he kept trying to contact the aircraft. At 8:21, American 11 turned off its transponder, immediately degrading the information available about the aircraft. The controller told his supervisor that he thought something was seriously wrong with the plane, although neither suspected a hijacking. The supervisor instructed the controller to follow standard procedures for handling a \\"no radio\\" aircraft. The controller checked to see if American Airlines could establish communication with American 11. He became even more concerned as its route changed, moving into another sector's airspace. Controllers immediately began to move aircraft out of its path, and asked other aircraft in the vicinity to look for American 11. At 8:24:38, the following transmission came from American 11: American 11: We have some planes. Just stay quiet, and you'll be okay. We are returning to the airport. The controller only heard something unintelligible; he did not hear the specific words \\"we have some planes.\\" The next transmission came seconds later: American 11: Nobody move. Everything will be okay. If you try to make any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane.  After reading the above, is \\"Flight 11's route changed\\" the correct answer to the question \\"When The supervisor instructed the controller to follow standard procedures for handling a \\"no radio\\" aircraft what further steps by America 11 alarmed them?\\"?

Judy Cameron, a scientist at Oregon Health and prefix = st1 /ScienceUniversity, studies brain development. According to her research, it seems that exercise can make blood vessels, including those in the brain, stronger and more fully developed. Dr. Cameron claims this allows people who exercise to concentrate better. As she says: \\"While we already know that exercise is good for the heart, exercise can literally cause physical changes in the brain.\\"  The effects of exercise on brain development can even be seen in babies. Babies who do activities that require a lot of movement and physical activity show greater brain development than babies who are less physically active. With babies, even a little movement can show big results. Margaret Barnes, a pediatrician , believes in the importance of exercise. She thinks that many learning disabilities that children have in elementary school or high school can be traced back to a lack of movement as babies. \\"Babies need movement that stimulates their five senses. They need to establish a connection between motion and memory. In this way, as they get older, children will begin to associate physical activity with higher learning,\\" says Margaret.  Older people can beef uptheir brains as well.CornellUniversitystudied a group of seniors ranging in age from seventy to seventy-nine. Their study showed a short-term memory increase of up to 40 percent after exercising just three hours a week. The exercise does not have to be very difficult, but it does have to increase the heart rate. Also, just like the motion for infants, exercise for older people should involve some complexity. Learning some new skills or motions helps to open up memory paths in the brain that may not have been used for a long time.  For most people, any type of physical activity that increases the heart rate is helpful. The main goal is to increase the brain's flow of blood. And your brain can benefit from as little as two to three hours of exercise a week. Answer the following questions: 1. Are doctors starting to think there is a connection between exercise and brain development? 2. What does judy Cameron's research say about the topic? 3.

The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia.

Emona itself was the region's easternmost city, although it was assumed formerly that it was part of the Pannonia or Illyricum, but archaeological findings from 2008 proved otherwise. It was located in the area where the navigable Ljubljanica came closest to Castle Hill. The river played an important role as a transport route for the trade between the city and the rest of Roman empire. From the late 4th to the late 6th century, Emona was the seat of a bishopric that had intensive contacts with the ecclesiastical circle of Milan, reflected in the architecture of the early Christian complex along Erjavec Street in present-day Ljubljana.  - The Gulf of Trieste (, ) is a very shallow bay of the Adriatic Sea, in the extreme northern part of the Adriatic Sea.

Her boyfriend, Aaron (Richard Hillman) has left for college, and her cheerleading squad, the Toros, is aiming for a sixth consecutive national title. Torrance is elected to replace the team captain, \\"Big Red\\" (Lindsay Sloane) who is graduating. Soon, however, teammate Carver (Bianca Kajlich) is injured and can no longer compete with her broken leg. Torrance holds an audition for Carver's replacement and gains Missy Pantone (Eliza Dushku), a gymnast who recently transferred to the school with her brother Cliff (Jesse Bradford), with whom Torrance develops a flirtatious friendship. While watching the Toros practice, Missy recognizes their routines from a rival squad that her previous high school used to compete against. After accusing Torrance of being a liar and stealing the routine, she learns from Torrance's offended and passionately defensive reaction that she was completely unaware. So Missy drives Torrance to Los Angeles, where they watch the East Compton Clovers perform routines that are virtually identical to their own team's. Isis (Gabrielle Union), the Clovers' team captain, angrily confronts the two. Torrance learns that \\"Big Red\\" regularly attended the Clovers' practices to videotape and steal their routines. In the meantime, Missy is seen as a threat by the other female members of the squad (because of her outstanding gymnastic abilities), but she ends up becoming Torrance's best friend and de facto co-captain Isis informs Torrance of her plans to defeat the Toros at the regional and national championships, which the team has never attended due to their economic hardship. When Torrance tells the Toros about the routines, the team still votes in favor of using the current routine to win; Torrance reluctantly agrees.

Meanwhile, the Clovers struggle to raise enough funds to attend the Nationals, as they have faced economic hardships that have prevented them from competing in previous years. The primary reason the Clovers are unable to compete at the Nationals is due to the financial constraints they face. Despite being a talented and highly skilled team, they lack the resources and support that the Toros have, which makes it difficult for them to afford the necessary expenses such as travel, accommodations, and competition fees. Additionally, the theft of their routines by the Toros has put them at a disadvantage, as their performances have been used by another team to achieve national success. After feeling guilty for unknowingly using the stolen routines and realizing the extent of the Clovers' struggles, Torrance decides to take action to rectify the situation. She sets out on a mission to help the Clovers by seeking out a private sponsor to cover their expenses for the Nationals. She successfully secures sponsorship for the Clovers, enabling them to compete on an even playing field with the Toros and other teams at the competition. Now that both teams are able to attend the Nationals, they face intense competition and must overcome various challenges in order to prove themselves as the best cheerleading squad in the country. The Toros work hard to create a new, unique routine for their performance, while the Clovers continue to perfect their already impressive skills and routines.

They relied mostly on conventional agriculture and used fertilizer for their crops.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which city contributed less to the creation of dead zones?  Hint: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. A:","output":"Based on the provided information, Pine city contributed less to the creation of dead zones in comparison to Bird city. To understand why, we must first look at the main factors contributing to dead zones and the differences in economy and practices between Pine city and Bird city. Marine pollution, particularly the contribution of hazardous chemicals and particles in the ocean, is primarily caused by rivers. Agricultural fertilizer chemicals, livestock waste, and human waste play a significant role in the creation of dead zones, leading to an excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals, hypoxia, and the formation of dead zones. Marine debris, including human-created waste, is another factor contributing to marine pollution. Bird city's economy relies on conventional agriculture using fertilizers for their crops. The city is situated along a large river flowing into the sea, making it more susceptible to contribution to marine pollution and dead zones. The use of fertilizers causes an increase in nutrient pollution, which flows from the river into surrounding water bodies. Excessive nutrient pollution in water bodies stimulates algal blooms, depleting oxygen levels and creating dead zones. On the other hand, Pine city is located in the mountains and is home to nature lovers and people committed to protecting the environment. Due to these factors, it can be inferred that Pine city's agricultural practices may be more focused on environmentally friendly and sustainable methods. Moreover, the mountainous terrain of Pine city implies that it has limited direct access to marine bodies, reducing the likelihood of contributing to marine pollution and dead zones. Additionally, local residents' commitment to environmental preservation would presumably lead to conscious efforts in reducing human waste and marine debris. Therefore, considering the differences in their agricultural practices, geographic locations, and philosophical approach towards the environment, Pine city is likely to have contributed less to the creation of dead zones compared to Bird city."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Czech is closely related to Slovak and has similarities to other Slavic languages such as Polish and Russian. In English, the phrase \\"Podvozek bez bradavek\\" can be translated to \\"Chassis without nipples.\\" However, the translation appears somewhat random and doesn't form a coherent sentence or thought.

The Czech language uses the Latin script with several additional diacritic marks to differentiate the unique Czech sounds. It has a rich literary history, with some well-known Czech authors such as Franz Kafka, Jaroslav Hašek, and Karel Čapek contributing significantly to the world's literary canon. Czech and Slovak were considered intelligible even after the Austro-Hungarian Empire split in 1918 and Czechoslovakia was formed. After the peaceful dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia emerged as independent nations. However, the languages remain mutually intelligible to a great extent.

He kind of liked the latter one.  and a hint : The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater.

Другими учтенными отходами пренебречь. Ты: Для того чтобы рассчитать удельную величину учтенных отходов, необходимо суммировать массы всех отходов в абсолютно сухом состоянии (без учета влажности) и разделить полученный результат на общее количество произведенной продукции, затем умножить на 100%, чтобы получить удельную величину в процентах.<br/><br/>Удельная величина учтенных отходов в абсолютно сухом состоянии рассчитывается следующим образом:<br/><br/>1. Мучной смет (сухая масса) = общая масса мучного смета - (общая масса мучного смета * влажность мучного смета) = 21 кг * (1 - 0,17) = 21 кг * 0,83 = 17,43 кг.<br/><br/>2. Тестовые отходы (сухая масса) = общая масса тестовых отходов - (общая масса тестовых отходов * влажность тестовых отходов) = 25 кг * (1 - 0,15) = 25 кг * 0,85 = 21,25 кг.<br/><br/>3. Смет готовых изделий (сухая масса) = общая масса смета готовых изделий - (общая масса смета готовых изделий * влажность смета готовых изделий) = 11 кг * (1 - 0,11) = 11 кг * 0,89 = 9,79 кг.<br/><br/>Теперь суммируем сухие массы всех отходов:<br/>Суммарная сухая масса = 17,43 кг + 21,25 кг + 9,79 кг = 48,47 кг.<br/><br/>Рассчитываем удельную величину учтенных отходов:<br/>Удельная величина учтенных отходов (%) = (Суммарная сухая масса отходов / Масса произведенной продукции) * 100%<br/>Удельная величина учтенных отходов (%) = (48,47 кг / 20 000 кг) * 100% = 0,24235%<br/><br/>Таким образом, удельная величина учтенных отходов составляет примерно 0,24235%. Пользователь: 2 Рассчитать плановую норму расхода сырья при выработке мака-ронных изделий влажностью 11 %. Влажность сырья 14,5 %. Удельная вели-чина учтенных отходов 3,4 кг/т. Удельная величина безвозвратных потерь 1,4 кг/т. Ты: Для расчета плановой нормы расхода сырья при выработке макаронных изделий можно использовать следующую формулу:<br/><br/>[ ПНР = (100% + УВБП + УВУО) / (100% - ВС - ВИ) ]<br/><br/>где:<br/>- ( ПНР ) – плановая норма расхода сырья (кг сырья на 1 т произведенной продукции),<br/>- ( УВБП ) – удельная величина безвозвратных потерь (кг/т),<br/>- ( УВУО ) – удельная величина учтенных отходов (кг/т),<br/>- ( ВС ) – влажность сырья (в процентах),<br/>- ( ВИ ) – влажность изделий (в процентах).<br/><br/>Дано:<br/>- ( УВУО = 3.4 ) кг/т,<br/>- ( УВБП = 1.4 ) кг/т,<br/>- ( ВС = 14.5% ),<br/>- ( ВИ = 11% ).<br/><br/>Подставляем данные в формулу:<br/><br/>[ ПНР = (100% + 3.4 + 1.4) / (100% - 14.5% - 11%) = (100% + 4.8) / (100% - 25.5%) ]<br/>[ ПНР = (104.8%) / (74.5%) = 1.40738 ]<br/><br/>Таким образом, плановая норма расхода сырья составляет 1407.38 кг сырья на каждую тонну произведенных макаронных изделий.

В качестве обучающей выборки использовать таблицу истинности для X1→X2&X3, X1&X2 и X1&X3 (не использовать первую строчку таблицы). Синаптические веса задать случайным образом.","output":"Для выполнения вашего запроса на просчет одной итерации цикла обучения по Δ-правилу для однослойной бинарной нейронной сети, нужно выполнить несколько шагов: 1. Инициализация весов. 2. Выбор входных данных для обучающей выборки и целевых значений. 3. Расчет выходов нейронов. 4. Применение Δ-правила для корректировки весов. Так как вопрос содержит не достаточно деталей для полного понимания структуры вашей сети и обучающего процесса, я дам общий пример, как эти шаги могут быть выполнены. Я буду использовать сигмоидальную функцию активации \`σ(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-kx))\`, где \`k=1\`, и Δ-правило обновления весов: \`w_i(new) = w_i(old) + Δw_i\`, где \`Δw_i = η * (target - output) * output * (1 - output) * input_i\`, c η (эта) как коэффициент обучения. # Шаг 1. Инициализация весов Допустим, синаптические веса инициализированы случайным образом: \`\`\` w11, w12, w13 = 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 w21, w22, w23 = -0.2, 0.5, -0.3 w31, w32, w33 = 0.6, -0.1, 0.3 \`\`\` # Шаг 2. Выбор входных данных и целевых значений Возьмем один из входных векторов (не первый) из таблицы истинности для X1→X2&X3, X1&X2 и X1&X3, например: \`\`\` Input: X1 = 0, X2 = 1, X3 = 1 Target для X1→X2&X3: T1 = 1 (так как 0 → 1 = 1) Target для X1&X2: T2 = 0 (так как 0 & 1 = 0) Target для X1&X3: T3 = 0 (так как 0 & 1 = 0) \`\`\` # Шаг 3. Расчет выходов нейронов Используем сигмоидальную функцию активации на каждом нейроне: \`\`\` Output O1 = σ(w11*X1 + w12*X2 + w13*X3) Output O2 = σ(w21*X1 + w22*X2 + w23*X3) Output O3 = σ(w31*X1 + w32*X2 + w33*X3) где σ(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x)) \`\`\` Допустим, получились следующие выходы: \`\`\` O1 = σ(0.1*0 + 0.2*1 + 0.4*1) = σ(0.6) O2 = σ(-0.2*0 + 0.5*1 - 0.3*1) = σ(0.2) O3 = σ(0.6*0 - 0.1*1 + 0.3*1) = σ(0.2) \`\`\` # Шаг 4.

Другими учтенными отходами пренебречь. Ты: Для того чтобы рассчитать удельную величину учтенных отходов, необходимо суммировать массы всех отходов в абсолютно сухом состоянии (без учета влажности) и разделить полученный результат на общее количество произведенной продукции, затем умножить на 100%, чтобы получить удельную величину в процентах.<br/><br/>Удельная величина учтенных отходов в абсолютно сухом состоянии рассчитывается следующим образом:<br/><br/>1. Мучной смет (сухая масса) = общая масса мучного смета - (общая масса мучного смета * влажность мучного смета) = 21 кг * (1 - 0,17) = 21 кг * 0,83 = 17,43 кг.<br/><br/>2.

However, I can describe how you could create an image of a dog by using various methods: 1. Drawing or Painting: If you're artistically inclined, you may draw or paint a picture of a dog. You’ll need a canvas or paper and some drawing or painting materials such as pencils, charcoal, watercolors, or oil paints. You can start by sketching out a rough outline of the dog's shape and then refining the details such as the fur, eyes, nose, and/or the dog's expression. 2. Digital Art Creation: You can use a digital art software like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, or a more specialized drawing app like Procreate for iPad. Digital art allows for a wide range of styles from photorealistic to cartoonish. You can use a stylus or tablet to sketch the dog, or use photo reference to trace and embellish the image. 3. Photography: Another way to create an image of a dog is to take a photograph. If you have a dog or know someone who does, you can use your camera or smartphone to capture a picture of the dog. Pay attention to lighting and background to get the best shot. If you don't have access to a dog, you can find stock photos online. 4. Using AI Image Generators: You can also use an AI image generator like DeepArt, Prisma, or an AI tool that can create images from textual descriptions like OpenAI's DALL-E. These tools enable you to input a description (e.g., \\"a happy golden retriever playing in a park\\") and the AI will provide you with an image based on your description. While I cannot create an image for you, I hope the above suggestions help you find the best way to create one yourself!"},{"instruction":"Что такое t5?","output":"T5 может относиться к разным вещам в зависимости от контекста.

以下是一些步骤指导你如何操作： 1. **节点标签（Labels）**: 首先，你需要对每个节点设置一个标签，反映出它的内存容量。你可以根据实际的内存大小给每个节点打标签，比如 \`memory=high\`，\`memory=medium\`，\`memory=low\` 等等。 \`\`\` docker node update --label-add memory=high NODE_ID docker node update --label-add memory=medium NODE_ID docker node update --label-add memory=low NODE_ID \`\`\` 把 \`NODE_ID\` 替换成实际的节点ID。 2. **服务创建（Service Creation）**: 当创建服务或者更新一个服务的时候，你可以指定一个placement约束以确保服务的容器分配到标记有指定内存的节点上。 例如，要创建一个服务使其只部署到有 \`memory=high\` 标签的节点上： \`\`\` docker service create --name your_service_name --constraint 'node.labels.memory == high' YOUR_IMAGE \`\`\` 3. **服务更新（Service Update）**: 如果服务已经运行了，但是你想更改它的约束条件，你可以更新服务配置： \`\`\` docker service update --constraint-add 'node.labels.memory == high' your_service_name \`\`\` 4. **分布的平衡（Balancing Distribution）**: 即使你的某些服务配置了这样的约束，依然可能会出现一个节点上运行了太多的任务的情况。你可以通过调整副本的数量或者调整负载均衡策略来进一步细化不同服务的分布。 注意：不能直接基于节点的实际可用内存进行调度，因为Docker Swarm默认并不考虑内存或者CPU的实际使用量或者上限来做调度决定。因而，标签只是一个手工设置的标记，你需要根据实际情况来管理和维护这些标签代表的意义。如果需要进行基于实际资源利用情况的调度，你可能要考虑使用Kubernetes之类的更高级的容器编排工具，它支持基于资源的请求和限制来做调度。"},{"instruction":"服务已经启动了，而不是创建的时候","output":"如果服务已经启动了，你想根据内存大小将服务的任务优先调度到内存较大的节点上，你可以按照以下步骤操作： 1. **更新节点标签**: 首先确保所有的节点都已经根据它们的内存大小打上了相应的标签。 \`\`\`bash docker node update --label-add memory=high NODE_ID docker node update --label-add memory=medium NODE_ID # ...以及其他需要的标签 \`\`\` 2. **更新服务约束**: 接着，你需要更新已经运行的服务，添加一个约束以使其任务调度到有特定内存标签的节点上。 \`\`\`bash docker service update --constraint-add 'node.labels.memory == high' your_service_name \`\`\` 这里的 \`--constraint-add\` 参数允许为现有的服务添加新的约束条件。 如果你想将服务的任务迁移到内存较大的节点，并且不介意重新启动这些任务，你也可以使用下面的命令强制任务重新调度： \`\`\`bash docker service update --force your_service_name \`\`\` 使用 \`--force\` 标志将导致Swarm重新调度服务的所有任务，这将使得Swarm根据最新的约束条件重新评估应该在哪些节点上启动这些任务。 请注意，在重新调度任务时，服务的可用性可能会受到暂时性的影响。确保在对生产环境中的服务进行此类操作前考虑到这一点，并在需要时采取措施来减少影响。 同时需要强调的是，Docker Swarm不能直接根据节点的实际可用内存来自动调度服务。可以手动地按内存容量给节点打标签，并人为地制定服务的约束条件，但是如果你想要更精细化的基于实时资源数据的任务调度，可能需要考虑使用更高级的容器编排工具如Kubernetes。"},{"instruction":"无法加载文件 C:Program

The Doctor, played by David Tennant at the time, is heavily involved in trying to stop both factions and save the world from destruction. If the Doctor were to suddenly decide to play chess in the middle of the events of \\"Doomsday,\\" several scenarios could unfold, considering this would be entirely out of character for the Doctor under such dire circumstances. Here are some speculative possibilities: 1. **Distraction Tactic**: The Doctor might use the act of playing chess as a deliberate distraction, either to confuse his enemies or buy time while he or his companions work on a solution to the crisis. 2. **Coded Communication**: The Doctor could employ the chess game as a form of coded communication with his companions or allies, conveying a strategy or plan to defeat the Daleks and Cybermen without them overhearing. 3. **Intellectual Challenge**: In the unlikely scenario that the Doctor challenges a Dalek, Cyberman, or another entity to a game of chess, he might be attempting an intellectual battle to prove a point, stall for time, or as part of a larger, more complex plan he has devised. 4. **Psychological Ploy**: The act could be a psychological tactic meant to unsettle his adversaries by showing a level of calm and control that they do not expect, potentially leading them to make a mistake. 5. **Narrative Pause**: In a meta sense, should the storyline actually include the Doctor stopping to play chess, it might serve as a narrative pause, offering characters and viewers alike a moment of reflection or the introduction of a critical plot element. However, the actual \\"Doomsday\\" episode features no chess game but rather a fast-paced, emotional conclusion to the series' intense conflict. The Doctor works tirelessly to outwit his foes and ultimately faces a heart-wrenching farewell with his companion Rose Tyler as she becomes trapped in a parallel universe. Keep in mind that this answer is speculative, and the Doctor playing chess in a critical moment goes against the established narrative of the show, which typically portrays the Doctor as deeply engaged in and committed to resolving the dangers at hand."},{"instruction":"You know the Librarian, the youtuber?","output":"As of my last update in April 2023, there is no widely recognized YouTuber known solely as \\"The Librarian\\" who has reached a level of notoriety similar to other major content creators whose fame would make them immediately identifiable.

Liminal spaces refer to transitional or in-between spaces that are often empty or abandoned, like empty malls, quiet hallways, or desolate playgrounds at night. These spaces have a certain ambiance and aesthetic that can evoke feelings of nostalgia, eeriness, or surrealism. Content creators focused on liminal spaces might share images or videos of such locations, discuss the feelings and thoughts they inspire, and possibly delve into related topics such as psychology, architecture, urban exploration, or even the paranormal. YouTube channels that discuss liminal spaces, urban exploration, or related content can attract a following from those interested in the unique emotions and aesthetics associated with these places that exist on the thresholds of everyday experience. If The Librarian is indeed a YouTuber engaging with this topic, their content likely revolves around these themes and might include discussions, analyses, slide shows, or explorations of such environments. These types of videos can be popular for those who are intrigued by the concept of liminality or who enjoy experiencing these unusual and often thought-provoking environments from a safe distance."},{"instruction":"Répondre à ce message ci-dessous venant d'un marchand en ligne qui me propose une collaboration.

Dans cet univers, Sukuna est généralement désigné comme le \\"Roi des Fléaux\\" et représente l'un des plus puissants esprits maléfiques ou fléaux (des créatures surnaturelles qui apparaissent à partir des émotions humaines négatives) qui ait jamais existé. Le sort inné (ou technicité innée) de Sukuna n'est pas explicitement défini dans les termes simples d'une seule capacité. Cependant, Sukuna est célèbre pour avoir plusieurs capacités très puissantes, y compris mais non limité à : 1. **Dépeçage (Dismantle) et Cleave (Clave)** : Sukuna peut trancher ses ennemis de manière extrêmement précise et avec une telle force que cela peut sembler magique ou surnaturel. 2. **Domain Expansion** : Sukuna est capable de créer un domaine qui est essentiellement une manifestation physique de son énergie maléfique. À l'intérieur de ce domaine, il peut contrôler les choses à volonté et même altérer les lois de la nature dans une certaine mesure. 3. **Reverse Cursed Technique**: Sukuna a la capacité de guérir des blessures en inversant les effets du sortilège. Cette technique est assez avancée et est généralement réservée aux sorciers de haut niveau. 4. **Fire Manipulation**: Dans l'anime, on le voit capable de manipuler les flammes, ce qui suggère qu'il a un contrôle sur les éléments et sur des techniques de malédictions basées sur le feu. Sukuna est aussi connu pour avoir une force physique, une vitesse, une agilité et des réflexes qui surpassent de loin ceux des humains normaux et même la plupart des autres sortilégeurs de malédictions. Il convient de noter que \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" est toujours en cours de publication, donc de nouvelles informations sur les pouvoirs et la nature précise de Sukuna pourraient être révélées à mesure que l'histoire progresse. Puisque ce personnage est très mystérieux et complexe, le \\"sort inné\\" peut être interprété comme une combinaison de toutes les capacités incroyablement puissantes qu'il possède pour vaincre ses adversaires."},{"instruction":"C'est quoi ton dernier entraînement","output":"En tant qu'IA développée par OpenAI, je n'ai pas de corps physique, donc je ne m'entraîne pas comme un être humain.

Lors du \\"entraînement\\" d'un modèle de machine learning comme moi, de grandes quantités de données textuelles sont utilisées pour enseigner au modèle comment comprendre et générer du texte de manière contextuellement appropriée. Ce processus comprend plusieurs étapes telles que : 1. **Prétraitement des données** : Nettoyage et préparation des données textuelles pour le processus d'apprentissage. 2. **Apprentissage supervisé**: Le modèle apprend à prédire la sortie attendue (par exemple, la suite d'une phrase) pour une entrée donnée (le début de la phrase), en utilisant de nombreux exemples pour lesquels la sortie correcte est connue. 3. **Ajustement fin (fine-tuning)** : Après l'apprentissage initial, le modèle peut être affiné sur un ensemble de données plus spécialisé ou pour des tâches spécifiques. 4. **Validation** : Le modèle est testé sur des données non vues pendant l'entraînement pour évaluer sa performance. 5. **Optimisation** : Ajustement des hyperparamètres du modèle pour améliorer les performances. Ce processus itératif améliore mon aptitude à comprendre les questions et à fournir des réponses pertinentes et informatives.

Jemima Wanjiku fredonne, elle aussi, quelques notes en enfilant ses gants. Sécateur en main, elle par- court les longues allées de rosiers à la recherche des boutons presque éclos, coupe les tiges et les rassemble sans même interrompre sa marche Immédiatement après leur récolte, les fleurs sont transportées dans l'atelier attenant. Là, l'effervescence règne. Des cen- taines de petites mains saisissent, sectionnent, effeuil- lent, ajustent et rassemblent les tiges en bouquets. Le temps est compté. Ces roses, cultivées par la ferme horticole Wildfire sur le lac Naivasha, à une centaine de kilomètres au nord de Nairobi, au Kenya, doivent arri- ver le lendemain sur les étals français, anglais ou néer- landais pour la Saint-Valentin <<< Les ouvrières ont trente minutes entre la récolte et la mise en chambre froide, à 4°C. Après, les fleurs ris- quent de s'ouvrir. Or les consommateurs veulent qu'elles tiennent au moins sept jours dans leur vase », explique Peter Szapary, le propriétaire autrichien de la ferme, venu s'installer au Kenya en 1997 comme d'autres horticulteurs européens, rejoints aujourd'hui par des firmes transnationales, essentiellement in- diennes. Entre 70 000 et 80 000 roses, d'une palette allant du rouge au jaune, sortent tous les jours de ses entrepôts. Direction l'Europe, à 7 000 kilomètres de là, mais aussi les Etats-Unis, l'Australie et le Japon. Peter Szapary a choisi de ne pas augmenter sa production pour la fête des amoureux. <« J'ai des accords de vente à l'année avec des supermarchés », justifie-t-il. En effet, les groupes de grande distribution (Carrefour, Tesco...) si- gnent des accords de vente annuels pour sécuriser leur approvisionnement. Dans le même temps, les produc- teurs dépendent de plus en plus de ces contrats, qui dictent à l'avance les prix et la quantité de fleurs à pro- duire. Controverse Depuis une vingtaine d'années, le Kenya s'est fait con- naître pour sa production de fleurs: il a remplacé l'Eu- rope (Pays-Bas, France...) comme un des principaux producteurs mondiaux. Avec 125 000 tonnes en 2013, c'est le quatrième exportateur au monde, et le premier vers l'Europe. << Les premiers Néerlandais ont installés des fermes au bord du lac Naivasha à la fin des années 1970, car les conditions climatiques y sont similaires toute l'année à l'été en Europe: il fait chaud en journée [30°C], frais la nuit [13 °C] et cette différence de température est bonne pour les roses », explique Peter Szapary. Elle permet aussi d'économiser le prix du chauffage artificiel des serres. Autre atout l'aéroport de la capi tale, Nairobi, d'où partent tous les soirs des cargos em- plis de fleurs, ne se trouve qu'à une heure et demie de route. À partir de 2009, il a été modernisé par le gou- vernement kenyan. C'est aujourd'hui l'un des aéro- ports les plus performants d'Afrique. Et surtout, la main-d'œuvre à Naivasha est très bon marché. Mais il y a une dizaine d'années, ce secteur prospère s'est retrouvé au cœur d'une controverse : l'exploita- tion et même l'intoxication des salariés, l'emploi massif de pesticides ou encore le gaspillage d'eau ont été ré- gulièrement dénoncés par les médias étrangers et les ONG étrangères et kényanes. Conscients de l'impor- tance de leur image de marque auprès des consomma- teurs européens, susceptibles de se tourner vers leurs concurrents d'Amérique du Sud, le gouvernement e les producteurs kényans ont entrepris de << verdir >>> secteur : moins d'engrais chimiques, meilleure prote tion des ouvriers. Moins de 2 euros par jour Lorsque l'on cherche à vérifier ces informations sur le terrain, on se heurte rapidement aux barrières de fermes ultrasécurisées, derrière lesquelles les journa listes locaux et étrangers ne sont pas les bienvenus rien ne doit ternir l'éclat des roses kényanes.. Pour par ler librement aux milliers d'ouvriers qui affluent du pays tout entier, il faut se rendre dans les nombreux bidonvilles qui ont poussé à proximité des serres. Kara- gita est l'un des plus importants, avec ses commerces et ses habitations faites de tôle et de terre, ses amas de détritus et ses chemins cabossés pour toute route. Si l'électricité y est installée, point d'arrivée d'eau ni d'égouts. Vers 17 heures, les bus affrétés par les horticulteurs déposent les travailleurs à l'entrée du village. James Ki- hara Ndung'u, grand gaillard de 26 ans, tente de leur vendre quelques calendriers disposés dans une brouette. Lui aussi a passé la journée dans une ferme, Nini Ltd., pour laquelle il effectue de la maintenance depuis six ans. Mais, faute de revenus suffisants, il mul- tiplie les petits boulots le soir. « Je gagne 200 shillings kényans [1,93 euro] par jour. C'est tellement peu que je ne parviens pas à économiser pour reprendre mes études », se désespère-t-il en exhibant sa fiche de paie. << Je ne pourrai pas me marier et fonder une fa- mille dans cette situation, poursuit-il. Je cherche n'im- porte quel travail mieux payé, même nettoyer les sani- taires. >>> Concurrence éthiopienne Dans un pays ou 40% de la population est au chômage, la floriculture, qui emploie 500 000 personnes, dont 100 000 dans les fermes, est malgré tout perçue comme un eldorado. Reste qu'avec 6 000 shillings (58 euros) en moyenne par mois, les salaires sont à peine supérieurs au minimum légal (5 000 shillings) et les horticulteurs comptent bien préserver leurs marges. << Si les salaires augmentent, il n'y aura plus personne d'ici cinq ans. On partira tous s'installer en Ethiopie », menace Peter Szapary. Car le voisin africain, moins regardant sur les standards sociaux et environ- nementaux, se lance dans la production de fleurs armé d'une main-d'œuvre encore meilleur marché. Et les horticulteurs européens, les firmes transnationales in- diennes ou européennes pourraient quitter le Kenya. La production intensive de fleurs, ainsi que la popula- tion croissante qu'elle attire, n'est pas sans consé- quences sur l'écosystème de Naivasha. Une virée en bateau permet de se rapprocher des immenses pompes rouges installées par les fermes dans le lac pour irriguer les cultures. Wildfire puise par exemple 2000 m³ chaque jour pour arroser ses fleurs entre 7 heures et 13 heures. << Il y a deux ans, on a mis en place un plan d'allocation de l'eau : le gouvernement accorde des permis et on doit réduire les quantités pompées si le niveau du lac baisse », assure Peter Sza- pary. Mais il reconnaît : « Il y a toujours des moutons noirs : certaines fermes pompent l'eau sans autorisa- tion. >>>> Eau contaminée L'association des riverains du lac dénonce également la Presence d'engrais et de pesticides dans l'eau. Si des fermes ont mis en place des cultures hors-sol, avec un système de traitement et de recyclage des effluents, d'autres continuent de rejeter leurs eaux usées dans le lac. Les lois existent, mais il est difficile de les faire res pecter : les fermes se renvoient la responsabilité. Reste que les exploitations floricoles ne sont pas les seules à contaminer l'eau du lac. Les centaines de mil- liers de personnes qui vivent sur ses rives y contri buent, notamment par les rejets d'effluents des bidon- villes. Conséquence: des algues invasives proliferent en présence des nutriments, au grand dam des 400 pê- cheurs du lac qui peinent chaque jour davantage à ma- nœuvrer leurs embarcations. d'après Audrey Garric, « Au Kenya, les épineuses roses de la Saint-Valentin », Le Monde, 10 février 2015.

将复杂问题拆解成更小、更基础的组成部分。 - 例如，假如你想提升个人工作效率，首先要明确「工作效率」的基本要素：时间管理、任务优先级、干扰因素、动力和能量水平等。再逐一分析这些要素如何影响你的工作效率，通过改善这些基本要素来提升总体效率。 2. **根本原理分析**： - 思考每一个小问题背后的基本原理或法则。 - 比如你要减肥，而减肥的第一性原理是「能量消耗大于能量摄入」。你可以通过这个原理来设计饮食和锻炼计划，而不是盲目跟随各种流行饮食或锻炼趋势。 3. **问“为什么”**： - 对现有做法或观点不断提出“为什么”，直到你触及根本原因或基本概念。 - 例子：公司通常年终会做业绩回顾，问“为什么”会揭示出它能帮助团队从成败中学习并规划来年目标。知道了这个，你或许可以设计更高效的回顾流程，比如持续性的回顾而不是一年一次，以实现目标的快速迭代。 4. **避免模仿他人**： - 不是简单地模仿他人成功的模式，而是理解成功背后的基本原因，并将其适用到自己的情境中。 - 例如，某个成功人士早上5点起床阅读，这不一定适合所有人。你应该探究背后的原理，也许是“早起可以安静地反思计划”，而这个原理可以以不同的形式适用于你，或许是白天找一个安静的时间段来进行。 在实际应用上，采纳第一性原理的思考路径通常需要时间和耐心，因为它要求我们深入挖掘，并且可能需要抵抗跟随现成解决方案的诱惑。然而，一旦习惯了这种思考方式，它能帮助你发现更创新、更有效的解决方案，同时避免受限于传统观念。"},{"instruction":"我要组装一台电脑，要求是快速流畅使用stable diffusion和ControlNet，请给我一份详细的配置清单","output":"要组装一台电脑用于快速流畅运行像Stable Diffusion（一种深度学习模型用于生成图像）和ControlNet（可能是指用于控制模型的网络），你需要强大的处理器、大量RAM和高效能的GPU等。以下是一份可能的配置清单： **处理器 (CPU)**: 你需要一个强大的处理器以便快速处理数据。 -

The boy's face shows a mix of exhaustion and hope, with a glimmer of determination in his eyes. The lady's facial expression carries a sense of indifference and entitlement, while her boss exudes power and authority. The scene is captured in a series of movie screenshots, showcasing the stark contrast between the boy's humble appearance and the opulence of the lady and her boss. The movie posters nearby create a backdrop filled with promises of a glamorous and unattainable lifestyle. A detailed description of the boy reveals that his worn-out shoes have holes in them, their soles revealing patches held together by duct tape. His clothes are faded and tattered, barely providing any protection against the cold weather. The single coin he holds tightly in his hand is tarnished and worn, a symbol of his meager earnings. His gaze is fixed on the ground, depicting his solemnity and resignation to his circumstances. The scene's environment is set in a bustling city street, filled with towering skyscrapers and flashing neon signs. The sidewalks are crowded with people rushing past, each engulfed in their own hurried lives. The buildings, bathed in an array of vibrant colors from the neon lights, cast long shadows on the street. The air is tinged with the scent of exhaust fumes and the distant aroma of freshly brewed coffee. The compositions within the scene are carefully crafted to highlight the stark contrast between the characters. The boy is positioned in the foreground, slightly off-center, drawing the viewer's attention to his weary face and clenched fist. The wealthy lady and her boss are placed in the middle ground, striding confidently ahead, their posture exuding a sense of superiority. The movie posters in the background are strategically placed to frame the characters, emphasizing their roles as mere actors in the grand theater of life. The scene's mood, feelings, and atmosphere evoke a sense of societal disparity, reflecting the harsh realities of wealth inequality. The overwhelming feeling is that of injustice and the silent struggle of the working poor. The atmosphere crackles with a sense of tension, as if the sheer weight of the characters' divergent paths hangs heavily in the air. It is a scene rife with contrasts, provoking introspection and empathy. In terms of style, this prompt calls for a photographic approach, capturing the scene with a high level of realism. The lens used is a 35mm prime lens on a full-frame camera, allowing for a moderate wide-angle perspective. The photograph is composed with a shallow depth of field, with the boy's face in sharp focus and the lady and her boss slightly blurred in the background. This style aims to capture the raw emotions and nuances of the characters, reminiscent of the poignant black-and-white street photography of Henri Cartier-Bresson. /imagine prompt: A working poor boy, his weary eyes reflecting the weight of his struggles, stands in stark contrast to a wealthy lady and her boss passing by, their extravagant attire and confident demeanor highlighting their privilege. The boy holds a newspaper in one hand, its headlines showcasing the harsh realities faced by the working class. The lady's elegant dress and expensive jewelry stand in stark contrast to the boy's threadbare clothes. Her boss, dressed in a tailored suit, carries an air of authority and power. The details of the boy's appearance, the lady's attire, and the boss's commanding aura are meticulously captured in a painting reminiscent of the Renaissance masters. The painting exudes a timeless quality, with each brushstroke conveying the emotions and complexities of the characters. The composition focuses on the boy's face, capturing the weariness and determination etched on his features, while the lady and her boss are positioned slightly behind him, symbolizing their detachment from his struggles. The scene's environment showcases the stark contrast between the boy's impoverished surroundings and the lady's affluent lifestyle. The boy stands on a dimly lit street, lined with dilapidated buildings and flickering lampposts. Graffiti tags cover the walls, telling the hardships experienced by the working class. On the other hand, the lady and her boss are surrounded by opulence, walking past a luxurious building adorned with grand pillars and sweeping staircases, symbolizing a world that seems unattainable for the boy. The composition of the painting carefully juxtaposes the characters, emphasizing their contrasting social statuses. The boy is placed in the center, flanked by the lady and her boss on either side. Their body language and facial expressions further accentuate the divide, with the boy's slouched posture contrasting with the lady's poised grace and the boss's commanding presence. The placement of objects and details within the painting conveys layers of meaning, such as the newspaper clutched tightly by the boy, symbolizing his awareness of the world's injustices. The scene's mood, feelings, and atmosphere evoke a sense of yearning, struggle, and inequality. The somber lighting and muted color palette amplify the emotional depth of the painting, with shadows and highlights highlighting the characters' inner turmoil. The atmosphere crackles with tension, as if the forces of society are pushing against each other, creating an invisible barrier between the boy and the lady and her boss. The style for this prompt calls for a painting, conveying the textures, details, and emotions of the characters. The painting is executed in the style of Leonardo da Vinci, characterized by subtle chiaroscuro techniques and meticulous attention to details. The brushwork is precise yet expressive, capturing the intricacies of each character's facial features and clothing. This style aims to elevate the scene to a timeless work of art, allowing for deeper exploration of the characters' emotions and struggles. /imagine prompt: A working poor boy, staring longingly at a theater marquee showcasing the latest blockbuster film, stands in contrast to a wealthy lady and her boss, engrossed in a glamorous conversation. The boy's face radiates a mixture of curiosity and longing, his unkempt hair and worn-out clothes telling a story of struggle. The lady, adorned in a tailored evening gown and exquisite jewelry, embodies confidence and refinement, while her boss exudes power and authority in a finely tailored suit. The boy's expression, a combination of awe and resignation, is frozen in a collection of movie screenshots, capturing a moment of juxtaposition between the humble boy and the world of glitz and glamour. The movie posters lining the walls further emphasize this contrast, featuring vibrant imagery and larger-than-life characters. The boy's description reveals a cascade of details - his hair is disheveled, strands falling across his forehead and partially obscuring his eyes. His clothes are worn and frayed at the edges, the fabric faded from countless washes. A threadbare backpack hangs from one shoulder, a symbol of his transient existence. The scene's environment is set in a bustling city square, with the theater marquee serving as the focal point. The square is filled with people going about their daily lives, hurrying past without sparing a glance for the boy. The surrounding buildings exhibit a mix of architectural styles, showcasing the layers of history and the passage of time. The air is alive with the scent of buttery popcorn, mingling with the echoes of laughter and conversation. The compositions within the scene highlight the contrast between the boy and the lady and her boss. The boy is positioned in the foreground, gazing up at the marquee, with the lady and her boss slightly blurred in the background. Their conversation is visually represented through their body language and gestures, suggesting an animated discussion about the glamorous world they inhabit. The movie posters in the background add depth and dimension to the composition, framing the characters and enhancing the sense of theatricality. The scene's mood, feelings, and atmosphere exude a sense of yearning and the allure of escapism. The atmosphere pulsates with the electric energy of the city, as if it holds the key to a world of dreams and possibilities. The mood is bittersweet, capturing the boy's hunger for a life beyond his reach, juxtaposed with the lady and her boss, who seem to possess everything he desires. The atmosphere crackles with a sense of anticipation, as if the world within the movie theater holds the promise of a transformative journey. In terms of style, this prompt calls for a photography approach, capturing the scene in a realistic and evocative manner. The lens used is a 50mm prime lens on a full-frame camera, allowing for a standard perspective. The photograph is composed with a shallow depth of field, with the boy's face in sharp focus and the lady and her boss slightly blurred in the background. This style aims to capture the fleeting yet powerful emotions of the characters, reminiscent of the momentous street photography of Vivian Maier. /imagine prompt: A working poor boy, his face reflecting a mixture of exhaustion and resilience, carries a heavy load of boxes, while a wealthy lady and her boss stride past him without a second glance. The boy's disheveled clothes and dirt-streaked face tell a story of hardship and determination. The lady, dressed in an elegant designer outfit, exudes an air of entitlement and superiority, while her boss exerts his authority through a commanding presence. The scene is vividly captured in a sculpture, with each character frozen in time, their emotions and struggles encapsulated in the lines and contours of the artwork. The sculpture stands as a powerful testament to the unseen battles fought by the working class against the backdrop of a bustling city. A detailed description of the boy reveals his worn-out shoes, with cracked soles and frayed laces. The boxes he carries are weathered and sturdy, showing signs of repeated use. Each muscle in his body is tensed, conveying the tremendous effort required to bear his burden. Despite the physical strain, his eyes gleam with determination and an unwavering spirit. The scene's environment showcases the urban landscape, with towering buildings and busy streets serving as the backdrop. The city is a vibrant tapestry of life, with cars zooming by, pedestrians rushing past, and the distant hum of conversations. The buildings around the boy are lined with posters and advertisements, offering glimpses into the commercial world that surrounds him. The composition of the sculpture is expertly crafted, balancing the weight and presence of each character. The boy is positioned in the foreground, his stance conveying strength and resilience. The lady and her boss are placed behind him, their body language expressing indifference and detachment. The boxes the boy carries are meticulously arranged, forming a diagonal line that adds movement and visual interest to the composition. Symbolic elements, such as the lady's designer handbag and the boss's polished shoes, further accentuate their privilege and the boy's struggle. The scene's mood, feelings, and atmosphere evoke a sense of social disparity and the unrecognized strength of the working class. The mood is somber and reflective, with each stroke of the sculpture capturing the silent battles fought by the boy while the world continues to turn. The atmosphere crackles with tension, as if the sculpture itself carries the weight of the boy's burdens, yet also exudes a quiet determination. The style for this prompt calls for a sculpture, allowing for a three-dimensional representation of the scene. The materials used are bronze and marble, lending a timeless quality to the artwork. The surfaces of the sculpture are meticulously polished, capturing the interplay of light and shadow, further enhancing the emotional depth of each character. This style aims to provoke contemplation and empathy, reminiscent of the powerful works of Auguste Rodin."},{"instruction":"Write an romcom anime scene about a young man chatting with his dom about getting a human girlfriend.

COZY LIVING ROOM – NIGHT The full moon shines through the open window, casting shifting patterns on the polished hardwood floor. Soft jazz music can be heard in the background, mingling with the distant sound of a TV showing the evening's romcom. In the room, a young, rebellious man – let’s call him AIDEN – is on his knees, his sharp, wolfish eyes betraying an inner wildness. He's adorned with a spiked leather collar. His attire is minimal, limited to a pair of casual boxers, his bared chest showcasing the play of his toned muscles. Every few moments, a soft, animalistic growl slips from Aiden's lips as he impatiently fiddles with the leather leash that connects his collar to the elegant armchair. His knees ache, the hard floor showing no mercy. Beside him, comfortably seated in the armchair, is a striking figure – DOMINIC, a man of poise and controlled strength. His eyes, hidden behind a pair of stylish spectacles, fixate intermittently between Aiden and the TV screen. Dominic's attire is impeccable and exudes an effortless suavity: a tailored suit vest over a short-sleeve shirt, the necktie just slightly loosened to add a touch of insouciance appropriate for the home setting. His leather gloves and polished riding boots gleam in the soft light, a silent testament to his meticulousness. A riding crop rests within easy reach, a sign of his dominance. DOMINIC: (without diverting his gaze from the TV) Have you calmed down, Aiden? A slight, suggestive smile plays on Dominic's lips, a mix of sternness and seduction – an echo of their shared history dating back to their high school days, when Dominic was the enigmatic French exchange student who befriended the fiery Aiden. AIDEN: (growling softly) Yeah, sure, as clam as can be while chatting on the floor. Dominic simply raises an eyebrow, his silence a well-versed tactic in their dynamic. AIDEN: (sullenly) I've been thinking, Dom. Maybe I should get a girlfriend... you know, a human one. Aiden shifts uncomfortably, his eyes darting away as though the idea itself makes him feel vulnerable or even more exposed than his current state of undress. DOMINIC: (finally turning his gaze toward Aiden, eyes gleaming with intrigue) A girlfriend? And here I thought you had grown too fond of our late-night escapades. Aiden's rebellious streak flares at the teasing note in Dominic's voice. AIDEN: (barking out a laugh) I can do both, can't I? Not like being tied up here stops the moon from pulling at my fur. DOMINIC: (leaning forward, voice lower, a hint of possessiveness) You know the risks, mon ami. Your... nature could make things... complicated. Aiden's fiddled movements with the leash pause, his expression hardening with the reminder of his werewolf secret. AIDEN: (defiantly) I can handle it. Besides, it might be nice to have someone to share the daylight hours with. Dominic smirks, a dark brow lifting slightly, as the riding crop taps rhythmically against the boot. DOMINIC: If it's daylight companionship you're after, then by all means, pursue your heart's desire. But remember, when the night falls... He leaves the sentence unfinished, the space suffused with the unspoken threat and promise. The clink of the leash bringing both men back to the present, a subtle reminder of the delicate balance between their nocturnal games and the outside world. AIDEN: (smirking, the playful spark returning) Y'know, Dom, sometimes I forget you're not my actual dad. DOMINIC: (chuckles dryly) Thankfully for you, chéri, I am not. Now, hush. Our favorite part is coming up. As the scene on the TV escalates into a crescendo of romantic mishaps, Aiden and Dominic settle into a comfortable silence. The tension eases, for now, blended into the soft notes of the jazz and the silver glow of the moon. FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"Write a chapter of 1000 words of a story set on harry potter, harry is moped after the death of his godfather on his room on privet drivet 4, when he received a letter from gringotts about the reading of sirius will.","output":"# Chapter: The Last Gift from the Beyond In the silence of Number Four, Privet Drive, the weight of the summer air felt particularly oppressive. It was one of those English days that threatened rain but never delivered, leaving the atmosphere laden with hints of moisture and disappointment. Harry Potter sat alone in his bedroom, the smallest in the house, buried beneath his own swirling cloud of dark thoughts. He was preoccupied with memories of the Department of Mysteries, the bitter twist of Sirius's fate, and the cold absence his godfather's death had left in his heart. Since returning to the Dursleys', Harry had taken to staring out the window, fixating on the mundane comings and goings of the neighborhood. It was a desperate distraction from the unrelenting sorrow that gripped him. His friends had written, of course: Ron and Hermione sent him notes full of worry and assurances that they were only an owl away. But nothing could penetrate the barrier he'd erected around himself—a barrier born of grief and guilt. On that particular afternoon, as the sun’s rays struggled to part the overcast skies, there came a soft tapping at Harry's window. Harry barely registered the sound until it was repeated, louder and more insistent. With a sigh, he rose from his bed and made his way over to the glass pane. Outside, he found himself eye to eye with a Gringotts goblin, perched somewhat precariously on a rather elegant-looking tawny owl. Harry blinked in confusion. Never before had a goblin delivered post to him—especially not when perched on an owl. Goblins weren't fond of magical creatures, for the most part, and preferred their own methods of communication. That this one had come personally suggested a matter of some importance. With a flick of his wand, Harry unlocked the window and allowed the unusual messenger inside. The goblin cast a disdainful eye over the room before hopping onto the desk and extending a sealed envelope towards Harry, who noticed that the seal bore the emblem of Gringotts. \\"Mr. Potter,\\" the goblin grunted, in a voice that held the gravel and depth of the mines their kind was known to inhabit. \\"You are invited to Gringotts, Wizarding Bank, for the reading of Sirius Black’s last will and testament. The date is set for tomorrow morning, nine o'clock sharp. Don't be late.\\" Without waiting for a reply, the goblin turned to leave, then hesitated. As if reconsidering its abruptness, it looked back over its shoulder and added, \\"My condolences on your loss.\\" And with that modicum of civility exchanged, the owl took flight, carrying away the strange envoy. Harry stood motionless, staring at the envelope in his hands. His heart hammered against his ribcage with a blend of anticipation and dread. He had never thought about Sirius's will; the man who had been his godfather, the man who might have been his family, was gone, after all. What did possessions matter in the wake of such a loss? Compelled by something beyond his own understanding, Harry broke the wax seal and carefully unfolded the heavy parchment. The script was neat and formal, the language tinged with the legalese that wizards seemed to favor for such documents. Mr. Harry James Potter, As the named beneficiary and Godson of the late Sirius Orion Black, you are summoned to attend the reading of his will at Gringotts Wizarding Bank. The contents of the will are to be disclosed, and any directives or bequests made known. Please present this letter to the goblin named Griphook upon your arrival at the bank. He has been assigned as the executor of Sirius Black’s estate and will guide you through the proceedings. The letter closed with the date and time, signed with a flourish by a Gringotts official whose name Harry couldn't pronounce. The banality of the words belied the importance of the occasion; they were the last posthumous instructions from someone he had cherished, a voice reaching out from a place he couldn't follow. For a long time after the goblin's visit, Harry couldn't move. His thoughts were tangled: gratitude that Sirius had thought of him, the pain of knowing there would be no more memories together, and the vague, unshaped fear of the future. Alone once again, Harry did the only thing he felt he could do—he started making plans for the next day's journey. As morning light filtered through the curtains the following day, Harry dressed with a sense of purpose. He didn't bother to inform the Dursleys of where he was going; their concern for him extended only as far as the trouble he might accidentally bring down upon them. With a pinch of Floo powder obtained on the sly from the Order of the Phoenix, he set off for the Leaky Cauldron, the intermediary step between the Muggle and magical worlds. Diagon Alley loomed before him, only slightly less bustling than in high season. The shops were open for business, and shoppers navigated the thoroughfares in a cheerful cacophony of haggling and laughter. But Harry had no eyes for the displays of spell-books or the scent of fresh-baked treats from the nearby bakery. Upon reaching Gringotts, Harry stood for a moment before its imposing façade. The white marble of the building gleamed in contrast to the gloomy skies above. The bronze doors depicted wizards and goblins in various states of cooperation and conflict, a reminder of the tumultuous history between the races. As he ascended the steps, his heart thundered in his ears—not from the imposing architecture or the aura of wealth and power that the bank exuded, but from the emotional token waiting for him inside, a last communication from Sirius. Harry swallowed hard, pushed open the bronze doors, and stepped inside."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Pull the changes from the \`dev\` branch on the remote repository by explicitly stating the remote name and branch: \`\`\`bash git pull origin dev \`\`\` This command fetches the changes from the \`dev\` branch of the \`origin\` remote and merges them into your local \`dev\` branch. 2. After you have pulled the remote changes and resolved any conflicts that may have occurred during the merge, you can try pushing your changes back to the remote: \`\`\`bash git push -u origin dev \`\`\` The \`-u\` flag sets the upstream for your branch, making \`origin/dev\` the default upstream for your local \`dev\` branch. This means that in the future, you can use \`git pull\` or \`git push\` without specifying the remote and branch, and Git will use the upstream settings you have provided. However, if you have not set the upstream correctly or are on a branch without any tracking information, you can set it using the following command before pulling: \`\`\`bash git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/dev dev \`\`\` And then simply: \`\`\`bash git pull \`\`\` If you keep encountering issues, make sure you have the correct access rights to the repository.

Таким образом, у мужчин цветовая слепота будет всегда проявляться, так как они имеют только одну аллель Xц на Х-хромосоме. У женщин есть две возможности: 1) Если у женщины будет гетерозиготный генотип XцX, она будет носительницей цветовой слепоты, но сама не будет страдать от неё. 2) Если у женщины будет гомозиготный генотип XX, она будет иметь нормальное цветовое зрение. Теперь рассмотрим вероятность появления детей с цветовой слепотой: - Для сыновей: 50% вероятность унаследовать аллель Xц от матери (в этом случае ребенок будет страдать от цветовой слепоты), 50% вероятность унаследовать нормальную аллель X (в этом случае ребенок будет иметь нормальное цветовое зрение). - Для дочерей: 50% вероятность унаследовать аллель Xц от отца (в этом случае дочь будет носительницей цветовой слепоты, но сама не будет страдать от неё), 50% вероятность унаследовать нормальную аллель X от отца (в этом случае дочь будет иметь нормальное цветовое зрение). Таким образом, вероятность рождения ребенка с цветовой слепотой зависит от того, какой генотип у женщины: - Если у женщины гетерозиготный генотип XцX, то вероятность рождения сына с цветовой слепотой составит 50%. - Если у женщины гомозиготный генотип XX, то вероятность рождения ребенка с цветовой слепотой будет нулевой (0%). В итоге, общая вероятность рождения ребенка с цветовой слепотой зависит от генотипа женщины и составляет 50% (если у женщины гетерозиготный генотип XцX) или 0% (если у женщины гомозиготный генотип XX)."},{"instruction":"Вариант 3 У человека гемофилия детерминирована сцепленным с полом рецессивным геном һ.

Таким образом, вероятность рождения ребенка с гемофилией будет составлять: 0.5 (вероятность передачи аллели Xһ от матери) * 0 (вероятность передачи аллели X от отца) = 0 То есть, в данном случае вероятность рождения ребенка с гемофилией будет нулевой.

This might lead to more external forces or companions bringing problems to the Doctor's attention. 2. **Character Development**: The Doctor's reluctance could be an interesting character trait to explore. There might be a specific reason for this behavior—a past trauma, a moral dilemma, or even a strategic choice that the Doctor has made for the greater good or for self-preservation. 3. **Companion Roles Amplified**: Companions would likely take on a more proactive role, as they would have to convince the Doctor of the necessity to act or perhaps even take the lead in situations. This could lead to stronger companion story arcs and a more collaborative relationship between the Doctor and companions. 4. **Narrative Tension**: The Doctor's hesitation would add a layer of tension to each story. Audiences would wait eagerly for the moment the Doctor decides to step out and how that moment changes the course of the adventure. It adds an element of unpredictability to the character's actions. 5. **Moral Ambiguity**: A reluctant Doctor could introduce deeper moral ambiguity into the series. The character's unwillingness to intervene might question the ethics of non-intervention and the consequences of inaction, creating more complex narratives. 6. **Exploration of the TARDIS**: If the Doctor spends more time inside the TARDIS, the show could explore more of its unknown and infinite interior, turning the ship into an even more significant character and setting within the series. 7. **Impact on Legacy**: The Doctor has always been seen as a largely altruistic character, so a shift towards reluctance could impact how the character is perceived by both new audiences and longstanding fans. It could either be seen as a refreshing twist or as a departure from the core tenets of the character's heroism. 8. **Conflict with the Show's Ethos**: \\"Doctor Who\\" often portrays the Doctor as someone who thrives on exploration and adventure, with a deeply ingrained sense of moral responsibility to help others. A reluctant Doctor might challenge this ethos, presenting a narrative that is in tension with the show's historical themes. The Doctor's character has been interpreted in many different ways over the years, with each actor bringing a unique spin to the role. A reluctant incarnation of the Doctor would be another intriguing interpretation, offering fresh storytelling opportunities and character growth while challenging the traditional image of the Doctor as an archetypal hero."},{"instruction":"I meant, what if he was socially awkward?","output":"If the Doctor in \\"Doctor Who\\" were portrayed as socially awkward, it would add a layer of complexity both to the character and the interactions within the show. Here's how this characterization could influence the series: 1. **Unique Character Quirks**: The Doctor's social awkwardness would be expressed through various quirks—perhaps struggling with small talk, misreading social cues, or being overly literal. These traits could lead to humorous, endearing, or even cringe-worthy moments that enrich the character. 2. **Companion Dynamics**: Companions would play a more critical role in helping the Doctor navigate social interactions. They might act as intermediaries, translators, or coaches, helping the Doctor understand and engage with others effectively. This could create stronger bonds as companions learn to appreciate the Doctor's idiosyncrasies. 3. **Communication Challenges**: Social awkwardness could lead to communication mishaps, with the Doctor inadvertently offending or confusing others. These situations would provide both conflict and an opportunity for demonstrating the importance of empathy and understanding. 4. **Relatable Hero**: Many viewers could relate to a socially awkward Doctor, possibly seeing aspects of themselves in the character. This relatability could deepen the connection between the audience and the Doctor, making the character's struggles and triumphs even more impactful. 5. **Atypical Problem-Solving**: A socially awkward Doctor might approach problems from unconventional angles or prefer non-verbal methods of communication when possible. This could lead to innovative storytelling and unexpected resolutions to conflicts. 6. **Exploration of Vulnerability**: The Doctor's social struggles would humanize a character often seen as supremely confident and competent. Displaying vulnerability can create more emotional resonance in the show, adding depth to the Doctor's persona. 7. **Character Growth**: Over time, the Doctor might develop better social skills, providing a character development arc that allows viewers to witness the Doctor's progress in real-time. This growth could be a consistent sub-plot across multiple series. 8. **Unpredictable Interactions**: With the Doctor being socially awkward, encounters with allies, enemies, and passers-by would be more unpredictable, potentially altering the outcomes of adventures or creating new obstacles to overcome. 9. **Inner Conflict**: The Doctor's internal struggle with wanting to connect with others but finding it difficult due to social awkwardness would add a layer of psychological complexity to the character, making the Doctor more introspective and self-reflective. 10. **Different Heroic Model**: Portraying a hero that doesn't fit the typical charismatic, smooth-talking archetype would challenge stereotypes about what it means to be a hero, presenting a protagonist who saves the day just as often through intellect and compassion as through social prowess. A socially awkward Doctor would still retain the core values of the character—intelligence, compassion, and a desire to do what's right—but would experience the world in a way that many viewers might find refreshingly sincere and authentically human."},{"instruction":"how would he feel during doomsday?","output":"\\"Doomsday\\" is the thirteenth episode of the second series of the revamped British science fiction television program \\"Doctor Who,\\" and it includes an emotional farewell between the Doctor (played at the time by David Tennant) and his companion, Rose Tyler (Billie Piper). In the context of the episode and considering the Doctor to be socially awkward as per your scenario, here's how his feelings might be depicted: 1. **Overwhelmed**: Facing the end of the world or an impending apocalypse would be intense for anyone, especially for someone socially awkward who might already feel overwhelmed by less catastrophic situations. The Doctor might find the heightened emotions and epic scale of the conflict to be particularly taxing. 2. **Focus on Duty**: The Doctor typically prioritizes his duty to save lives and preserve the universe. His social awkwardness wouldn't detract from that commitment, though it would likely affect how he interacts with others during this crisis. 3. **Isolation**: Socially awkward individuals often feel isolated in large groups or intense social situations. During the events of \\"Doomsday,\\" the Doctor might feel even more keenly the emotional distance between himself and those around him, as the weight of responsibility and his unique role as a Time Lord separate him from others. 4. **Difficulty Expressing Emotions**: As someone who struggles with social cues, the Doctor might find it hard to express the deep emotional turmoil he experiences during the farewell with Rose. His internal pain could be manifested through actions rather than words, as he might not be able to articulate the depth of his sorrow. 5. **Increased Anxiety**: As things get more chaotic and the stakes rise, the Doctor's anxiety might spike. He may become more frantic in his efforts to solve problems, showing a sense of urgency and stress that reflects his internal struggle. 6. **Compartmentalization**: To cope with the situation, a socially awkward Doctor might compartmentalize his emotions, focusing entirely on the task at hand to push through the emotional distress of a doomsday scenario and the pain of losing Rose. 7. **Inner Conflict**: Despite his social difficulties, the Doctor's attachment to Rose and his compassion for others would create a strong internal conflict. He must reconcile the part of him that wants to emotionally shut down with the part that deeply cares and is driven to save others. 8. **Indirect Communication**: Faced with an intensely emotional moment like saying goodbye to Rose, the Doctor might resort to indirect or non-verbal communication to convey his feelings, such as using the TARDIS or other means to deliver his message without directly confronting the situation. 9. **Empathy from Others**: The Doctor's companions and allies might recognize his discomfort and step in to offer support, bridging communication gaps and providing emotional backup to help navigate the crisis. 10. **Resilience and Determination**: Ultimately, the socially awkward Doctor, like all iterations of the character, would be defined by his resilience and determination. Regardless of how difficult he finds the social dimension of the situation, he would commit to doing whatever it takes to prevent disaster and protect those he cares about. In summary, a socially awkward Doctor might go through a rollercoaster of emotions during \\"Doomsday,\\" with an added layer of social anxiety and communication challenges. Nevertheless, his fundamental nature as the Doctor—a being driven by the desire to do good and save lives—would ultimately guide his actions in any doomsday scenario."},{"instruction":"what if he struggles to feel empathy, but just keeps up the appearance of empathy, while still fretting over the fact he can't truly feel it.","output":"If the Doctor from \\"Doctor Who\\" struggled with feeling empathy and only maintained the appearance of it, this would represent a significant departure from the traditional portrayal of the character. Empathy is a core trait of the Doctor across various regenerations, guiding much of their decision-making and interactions. Here's how such a change might impact the series: 1. **Internal Struggle**: The Doctor would experience an ongoing internal struggle, confronting the disconnect between appearing empathetic and their inability to truly feel empathy. This conflict might make the Doctor more introspective, questioning their actions and motivations. 2. **Increased Isolation**: A lack of genuine empathy could lead to a sense of isolation from others, contributing to feelings of being an outsider even among friends. The Doctor might feel alone despite being surrounded by companions and allies. 3. **Compensatory Behavior**: To mask the lack of empathy, the Doctor might overcompensate with acts of kindness or heroism, strictly adhering to a moral code as a substitute for emotional connection. These actions may be based on intellectual understanding of what is right, rather than an emotional response. 4. **Rational Decision-Making**: The Doctor's choices could become more analytical and logical, relying less on emotional responses and more on the practical or ethical consequences of their actions. This shift may lead to harder decisions that prioritize the greater good over individual relationships. 5. **Reliance on Companions**: Companions could play an even more critical role as emotional surrogates, helping the Doctor to navigate complex social and emotional landscapes. They would be essential in ensuring the Doctor's actions remain compassionate and in concert with human values. 6. **Personal Growth Arc**: Over time, exploring the possibility of the Doctor developing empathy could serve as a significant character growth arc. Such a transformation could be the focus of a series or multiple episodes, offering a substantial payoff for both the character and the audience. 7. **Narrative Tension**: The tension between the Doctor's perceived and actual emotional states would add depth to the narrative, creating situations where the Doctor's lack of empathy could be at odds with the expectations of others or compromise relationships. 8. **Exploration of Morality**: The series could delve deeper into the nature of morality and what it means to be good. It might question whether actions have the same moral weight if they are not motivated by empathy but instead by a sense of duty or intellectual understanding. 9. **Darker Themes**: Storylines might take on darker or more complex themes, exploring what it means to save the world without emotional connection to those one is saving. The Doctor's motivations could become more ambiguous, challenging viewers' perceptions of heroism. 10. **Viewer Response**: Audiences might respond with mixed emotions to a Doctor who struggles with empathy. Some might find the portrayal thought-provoking and a refreshing take on the character, while others might miss the warmth and heart that typically define the Doctor. Incorporating these elements would fundamentally alter the fabric of \\"Doctor Who,\\" potentially making for a darker and more challenging series. However, it would need to be handled with care to retain the essence of the Doctor as a force for good in the universe, even if the emotional aspect of their actions is complicated. It could also reflect real-world experiences of individuals on the autism spectrum or those with similar empathetic processing, providing an opportunity for representation and discussion about neurodiversity."},{"instruction":"what if the doctor did have moments of genuine Empathy, but only rarely.","output":"If the Doctor in \\"Doctor Who\\" experienced genuine empathy only rarely, it would create a dynamic where the character's occasional moments of emotional connection become particularly significant and impactful. This shift could influence the narrative and character development in several ways: 1. **Highlighted Moments of Connection**: The rare instances when the Doctor genuinely feels empathy would stand out as pivotal moments in the series. These could become emotional high points of episodes or entire story arcs, signalling important character development or turning points in the narrative. 2. **Complex Character**: With empathy being a sporadic experience, the Doctor would be seen as more complex and enigmatic. This would invite viewers to closely observe the Doctor's behavior, trying to discern when the Doctor is genuinely empathetic versus when they are simulating the expected emotional response. 3. **Enhanced Storytelling**: Storylines could be crafted to build up to and revolve around those moments of empathy. A rare emotional connection might be the key to resolving a critical conflict, saving a companion, or making a morally difficult decision. 4. **Personal Struggle and Growth**: The rarity of true empathy would likely cause the Doctor to wrestle with feelings of inadequacy or alienation. However, these struggles could lead to moments of personal insight and growth, enriching the Doctor's character and providing a more nuanced portrayal of emotion and identity. 5. **Dramatic Irony**: The audience would sometimes be privy to the Doctor's genuine emotional experiences while other characters might not, creating dramatic irony. This could be used to deepen narrative complexity and increase viewer engagement. 6. **Mystery and Suspense**: Not knowing when the Doctor will genuinely empathize adds an element of mystery and suspense to the show. Viewers might wonder whether a particular situation will trigger a genuine empathic reaction from the Doctor. 7. **Exploration of Emotional Intelligence**: The Doctor's rare empathy might prompt them to develop other forms of emotional intelligence, such as strong analytical skills to understand others' feelings and extensive knowledge about different species' social norms and emotional expressions. 8. **Reflecting Real Life**: This portrayal could resonate with viewers who themselves experience empathy in a more intermittent or atypical way, reflecting the diversity of human emotional experience and creating a relatable aspect of the character. 9. **Guidance from Companions**: Companions might become emotional touchstones for the Doctor, guiding the Time Lord through their own emotional landscape and helping the Doctor interpret and respond to the emotions of others. 10. **Impact on Relationships**: The Doctor's sporadic empathy could create complex relationships with others. Companions and allies might find these moments precious and form deep bonds with the Doctor, while also feeling frustration or confusion during times when the Doctor seems detached. Overall, this interpretation of the Doctor would provide fertile ground for storytelling, exploring what drives a person to do good in the absence of consistent empathic feeling, and examining the ways in which intellectual understanding and a commitment to ethical principles can compensate for emotional distance. It could also introduce a new dimension to the Doctor's interactions and relationships with other characters, leading to unpredictable and emotionally nuanced narratives."},{"instruction":"Write the goodbye dialogue scene between the doctor and Rose, but the Doctor feels nothing, but still keeps up the appearance of emotion, but in the end, Rose calls him out.","output":"Certainly, such a scene would significantly alter the emotional tone of the iconic farewell between the Doctor and Rose. Here is a reimagined version of the scene, placing it on a stark beach in the parallel universe where Rose is to remain: [The distant whirr of the TARDIS fades as it materializes on the desolate beach, windswept and gloomy under the gray sky. The Doctor steps out, maintaining a somber demeanor as Rose hurries toward him, tears already streaming down her face.] Rose: Doctor! [They stand at an awkward distance; the Doctor's face is carefully composed into an expression of sorrow.] The Doctor: Rose Tyler. Rose: You’re going to say it, aren’t you? I can see it on your face. This is goodbye, isn’t it? [The Doctor nods, his eyes betraying no emotion but his voice softening to mimic the warmth he knows he's supposed to show.] The Doctor: Yes, this is goodbye. Rose: How can you stand there so calmly? Doesn’t this… doesn’t this hurt you at all? The Doctor: [Pausing, he takes a slow breath and looks at Rose, trying to reflect the pain he imagines one might feel in such a moment.] Rose, I've seen so much. Lost so much. But you... losing you is like losing a part of myself. Rose: [Frowning at the rehearsed tone in his voice] It doesn’t feel real. From you, I mean. Do you honestly feel anything? The Doctor: [Unwavering] I feel. I do. It's just... complicated. Rose: No. No, I know you, Doctor. I’ve seen you laugh, seen you cry. This isn’t you. There’s something you’re not telling me. The Doctor: I am the last of the Time Lords. Feelings like yours, human feelings, they don’t always come naturally to me. But I understand them. Believe me, Rose, if I could feel the loss tearing at me, I would. Rose: But can you? Really? Can you actually feel what's tearing at me right now? The Doctor: I can see it. I can understand how hard this must be for you. Rose: Not for me. For us. Doctor, if there's no emotion behind these words, no heart in what you’re saying, then aren't they just empty? Say it... say you're gonna miss me. The Doctor: I will miss you. Rose: [Her voice cracking, shaking her head] You can say the words--but that’s not the Doctor I traveled with.

We're running out of time, and I don't even get to keep the real you in my memories. Just this façade. [The Doctor looks down, unable to hold her gaze any longer, realizing the futility of his act. He is silent, almost shamed.] Rose: [Softly, resigned] Just go. Save other worlds. Maybe one day you’ll understand, truly understand, what you’re pretending to feel today. [A tear finally falls from Rose's cheek as she turns away. The Doctor watches her retreating figure, the TARDIS hum revving up as the breach seals shut, leaving the Doctor alone, a question lingering in the eyes that for so long have seen the universe—what does it mean to feel?] [The TARDIS disappears, leaving behind only the echo of its departure and a palpable absence on the cold, empty beach.] —End Scene— This version portrays a Doctor who is deeply aware of his emotional limitations and forces a confrontation with Rose's perception of him, ending on a more ambiguous and introspective note than the original scene.

The scene is filled with the symbol of integrity as lotus petals float in the air. /imagine prompt: In a power plant, three workers are dressed in khaki work uniforms and blue hard hats as they meticulously examine the electric motors. The air is filled with ethereal lotus petals, symbolizing purity and honesty. The workers' faces show a deep focus and determination, emphasizing their dedication to their task. The motors, intricately designed and complex, create a contrast with the workers' simple attire and bring attention to the importance of their work. The lotus petals gently float around the workers, creating a surreal atmosphere and adding a touch of tranquility to the otherwise bustling power plant. /imagine prompt: The power plant is a massive industrial complex, with towering structures and metallic machinery stretching as far as the eye can see. The workers are surrounded by endless rows of electricity generators, their motors making a constant hum. The air is thick with a subtle scent of machinery oil, mixed with the delicate fragrance of the lotus petals floating in the air. The power plant's environment is both awe-inspiring and overwhelming, with its maze-like layout and pipes and cables crisscrossing in every direction. The workers navigate this labyrinth with ease, their expertise evident in every movement. Despite the intimidating size of the power plant, a sense of order and purpose is present, as if each machine is meticulously placed and perfectly functioning to ensure a steady supply of energy to the surrounding cities. /imagine prompt: The composition focuses on the three workers in the foreground, their backs slightly hunched as they examine the massive electric motors. The motors, intricate and filled with interlocking gears, convey a sense of complexity and precision. The workers' postures reflect their expertise and experience, as if they have performed this task countless times before. The lotus petals are scattered in the background, creating a contrast between the workers' mundane but essential task and the ethereal symbol of purity and integrity. The composition captures the workers in a moment of intense concentration, with the motors and lotus petals serving as complementary elements, emphasizing the significance of their work and the value of integrity in their profession. /imagine prompt: The scene exudes a serene and determined atmosphere. The power plant, with its imposing structures and relentless noise, is juxtaposed with the calm presence of the lotus petals, symbolizing the workers' unwavering commitment to their job and their adherence to ethical principles. The workers move with grace and purpose amidst the chaotic machinery, their focused expressions revealing their dedication and professionalism. The entire scene is bathed in soft, diffused lighting, casting a warm glow over the workers and evoking a sense of reverence for their work. The atmosphere is infused with a quiet determination, as if time stands still in this moment of industriousness and integrity. /imagine prompt: A photograph captured with a Canon EOS 5D Mark IV and a 24-70mm lens reveals an intricate level of detail. The composition is focused on one worker, their face partially hidden under the brim of the blue safety helmet. The shallow depth of field provides a bokeh effect, blurring the background and drawing attention to the worker's face and the delicate lotus petals swirling around them. The image contrasts the sharpness of the worker's features with the softness of the petals, creating a harmonious balance of strength and grace. The lighting captures the natural colors of the scene, highlighting the worker's determined expression and the vibrant hues of the lotus petals. The photograph captures the essence of the workers' integrity and dedication, showcasing their role in maintaining the functioning of the power plant. /imagine prompt: The scene evokes a sense of awe and wonder, reminiscent of the works of Chinese ink and watercolor paintings. The workers and the electric motors are portrayed with bold, flowing brushstrokes, emphasizing their importance in the composition. The lotus petals, delicately rendered with soft and gentle strokes, create a dream-like atmosphere, evoking harmony between man and machine. The colors are muted, with shades of monochromatic grays and hints of pale blues and greens, contributing to the ethereal quality of the scene. The scene beautifully captures the juxtaposition between the workers' practical task and the symbol of purity represented by the lotus petals, creating a moving and evocative image. /imagine prompt: The atmosphere teems with a sense of purpose and resilience. The power plant's surroundings are depicted with crisp details and gritty textures, showcasing the industry's brute force and determination. The workers, rendered in a realistic style, are shown amidst the machinery, their attire showing signs of wear and tear, a testament to their hard work. The lotus petals, although delicately portrayed, serve as a powerful juxtaposition against the industrial setting, symbolizing the workers' unwavering commitment to integrity and ethical practices. The image invokes a sense of admiration for the workers' dedication and their role in providing essential energy for the community. The realistic photographic style captures the scene's authenticity, making the viewer feel as if they are witnessing the workers in action firsthand. /imagine prompt: The atmosphere is filled with a striking blend of chaos and beauty. The power plant, depicted in a stylized and surreal manner, is aglow with vibrant colors and distorted perspectives. The workers, stylized with elongated limbs and exaggerated facial expressions, seem to dance gracefully amidst the massive electric motors, their movements synchronized with the swirling lotus petals. The environment is surreal, with floating geometric shapes and shifting perspectives. The scene captures the workers' spirit of determination and bravery, emphasized by the chaotic and otherworldly elements surrounding them. This illustration conveys a sense of energy and dynamism in the workers' task, emphasizing their courage and resilience while executing their duties. The artwork presents a whimsical and captivating interpretation of the power plant scene, immersing the viewer in a realm where reality merges with imagination."},{"instruction":"sp = set() for n in range(10, 1001): dv = bin(n)[2:] first = str(dv).find('1') second = str(dv).find('1', first + 1) new_dv = dv[second:] sp.add(int(dv, 2) - int(new_dv, 2)) print(len(sp)) можешь тоже самое но без len","output":"Конечно, можем модифицировать код так, чтобы он считал уникальные значения без использования len().

Gendry is meticulously sharpening a blade, the sound of steel on stone rhythmically filling the room. Arya, perched on an anvil nearby, watches his handiwork with an intensity that matches his. After a moment of silent communion with the flickering shadows, she speaks.] ARYA: Winter's grip is relentless, isn't it? GENDRY: [glancing up with a half-smile] I reckon it's got nothing on you, though. ARYA: [a small, appreciative smile playing on her lips] I've had to be. When you have nothing but the cold and the dead for company, you learn to hold on to yourself. GENDRY: [stops sharpening, concern softening his features] Is that why you looked right through me when I first came riding back? As if I were one of those wraiths? ARYA: [quietly] I was... preoccupied. With surviving. And... other matters. GENDRY: [leaning back against the workbench, facing her] We all have our walls. Plenty of mine came crashing down just trying to keep the forge alive. [he half-chuckles, though it lacks humor] ARYA: [leaning forward slightly, her voice tender but guarded] You know, I did see you. That day. The snow was blinding, but not enough. GENDRY: [softly, searching her face] And? ARYA: [a deep breath, her eyes wandering to the fire] It mattered, your being there. I just... couldn't let that matter. Not at first. Hope is as dangerous as a sharp blade around here. GENDRY: [nods, then offers carefully] I get it, Arya. These wars, they carve deep. But here we are—still standing, still fighting. ARYA: [fixes her gaze on him, her voice a mere whisper] Yes, but not alone, it seems. Turns out, I'm rather glad of that. GENDRY: [voice warm with something akin to relief] Ditto, m'lady. ARYA: [bristles playfully, a glimpse of her old self] Don't call me that. GENDRY: [grinning now] I'll call you that if it brings out that fire. It's good to see, Arya. It's good to see you. ARYA: [her guard lowering, a small smile breaking the barriers] And you, Gendry. We've... both been through our own hells. It's not easy, letting someone else in after that. GENDRY: [serious again] I know. But I reckon we've got a better chance against the cold and the dead together. Trust takes time—and plenty of it we've been given. ARYA: [thoughtful, almost to herself] Time we've filled with steel and fire. And maybe... something like trust.

The stillness eventually breaks under the weight of her voice.] ARYA: You know, everything seemed darker when winter came. GENDRY: [glances up] Even with the night fires burning? ARYA: [shakes her head] Fires only do so much. The cold gets everywhere... makes you forget what warmth feels like. GENDRY: [pauses his work] Is that why you seemed... distant, when I got back? Because of the cold? ARYA: [staring at her hands] It was more than just the cold. I've been surrounded by death for so long it's hard to remember what it's like to feel anything else.
