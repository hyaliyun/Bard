Many workers are turning to freelance work for more flexibility. However, freelance work often lacks job security and benefits. There is a growing debate about the ethics and consequences of the gig economy.","output":"The rise of the gig economy has been a hot topic in recent years. With the ease of access to technology and the internet, many workers are now turning to freelance work for the flexibility it provides. Freelance work allows individuals to work on their own schedules, choose their own clients, and take on projects that interest them. However, with this newfound flexibility comes a lack of job security and benefits that traditionally come with full-time employment. The gig economy has been beneficial in many ways, as it has provided many people with income and allowed them to pursue their passions. For example, many writers, designers, and programmers are now able to work from home and have more control over their work. However, this newfound flexibility also comes with risks. Freelancers often do not have a guaranteed income, and their work depends entirely on the availability of projects. This can be stressful and create a sense of instability. Another concern is the lack of benefits that come with freelance work. Freelancers are responsible for their own healthcare, retirement, and other benefits that traditional employees might take for granted. This can be expensive and can lead to a lack of protection for workers. Additionally, gig workers are not protected by labor laws that are in place to protect employees from issues such as wage theft and discrimination. As the gig economy continues to grow, there is a growing debate about its ethics and consequences. Some argue that the gig economy is beneficial because it provides opportunities for people who might not have been able to access them otherwise. They also argue that the gig economy is beneficial for the economy as it can lead to lower consumer prices and a more efficient allocation of resources. However, others argue that the gig economy is problematic because it exploits workers and allows companies to bypass labor laws. They argue that companies in the gig economy should be held responsible for providing benefits and protections to their workers, regardless of whether they are classified as employees or independent contractors. Overall, the gig economy has had both positive and negative effects. While it provides flexibility and opportunities for many workers, it also poses risks and undermines labor protections. As policymakers, companies, and workers continue to navigate this new terrain, it will be essential to consider the consequences of the gig economy on workers, the economy, and society as a whole."},{"instruction":"Generate a tweet that has the following sentiment: positive","output":"\\"Today is off to a great start!

The company was found responsible for improperly disposing of hazardous waste, posing a significant risk to the environment and public health. The fine was imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which has been increasingly focused on cracking down on companies that violate environmental regulations. The EPA's investigation found that the company had been knowingly disposing of hazardous waste in a manner that violated federal and state regulations. The company's actions posed a significant threat to the environment and public health. Hazardous waste can contaminate soil, groundwater, and surface water, leading to long-term environmental damage and health complications for nearby communities. The EPA's penalty sends a strong message to companies that violate environmental regulations. It demonstrates that there are significant consequences for ignoring environmental laws and regulations, and that companies must take their environmental responsibilities seriously. In addition to the 2 million fine, the company is now required to implement a comprehensive plan for managing its hazardous waste. This plan includes steps to prevent future violations, such as training employees on proper hazardous waste disposal and conducting regular audits of waste management practices. The company's response to the EPA's penalty will be closely watched by other businesses operating in similar industries. If the company takes its environmental obligations seriously and works to prevent future violations, it could set a positive example for others to follow. In conclusion, the 2 million fine imposed on the company for environmental violations related to waste disposal is a significant penalty that should serve as a warning to other businesses. The EPA's investigation and enforcement actions demonstrate the importance of following environmental regulations and the serious consequences of failing to do so. We must all take environmental responsibility seriously and work together to protect our planet and our communities."},{"instruction":"Should college athletes be paid for their participation in sports?","output":"As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or biases.

By Sarah Griffiths for MailOnline PUBLISHED: 04:38 EST, 7 October 2015 | UPDATED: 05:57 EST, 7 October 2015 The Department of Justice has provided more details on the two cyberespionage hackers who allegedly stole American business secrets for the Chinese Government. Su Bin, 50, is allegedly one of the hackers who exploited a weakness in Boeing's computer systems, to obtain information about US programmes such as the C17 military transport and the F22 and F35 fighter jets. Jeremiah Grossman, Chief of Security Strategy for SentinelOne, said: 'China has had a long history of stealing government and corporate secrets, and in particular an insatiable appetite for obtaining US military technology. OPTIONS: The US has become increasingly vocal in its criticism of China over the years, particularly when it comes to their allegedlyhacking activities. The US has been arming itself against cyberattacks in recent years, investing in better cybersecurity measures in government agencies and other public sector roles. With the US election coming up, it seems increasingly likely that both sides will use the threat of cyberterrorism to try and secure an advantage. It is clear that cyberespionage has become one of the key battlegrounds in the ongoing political tension between China and the United States. It is still unclear how much damage Su Bin and his fellow hackers have done to America's technological superiority, or how good their relationship with the Chinese Government really is. While the US has long been regarded as one of the leaders in computer security and cybercrime prevention, experts are warning that our vulnerabilities are becoming more and more apparent to hackers. The case has illustrated the lengths that the Chinese Government is willing to go to in order to obtain sensitive information, but could prompt the US to toughen its stance against China. The incident highlights the growing importance of computer and cybercrime in the international world order, with more and more countries investing heavily in their own cybersecurity. This latest case has raised concerns that the US could be losing ground in the global IT arms race. Despite the fact that Su Bin is currently awaiting extradition to the US, his lawyers are fighting to have the charges dropped, claiming his alleged crimes are an exaggeration.","output":"It is still unclear how much damage Su Bin and his fellow hackers have done to America's technological superiority, or how good their relationship with the Chinese Government really is."},{"instruction":"Concepts: technology, innovation, future Write a sentence that includes all these words.","output":"The advancements in technology and innovation will shape the future."},{"instruction":"Trivia Question: What famous Renaissance artist painted The Last Supper?","output":"Leonardo da Vinci."},{"instruction":"Read the following paragraph and answer the question below.

It is considered one of the most significant events in modern history, having far-reaching consequences for the global economy and politics. There were many factors that contributed to the Great Depression, including: 1. Stock Market Crash: The stock market crash of 1929 is often seen as the main cause of the Great Depression. The crash occurred on October 24, 1929, when the stock market lost 11 percent of its value in a single day. The market continued to plummet, leading to massive losses for investors and banks. 2. Bank Failures: As the stock market crashed, many investors withdrew their money from banks, causing banks to fail. By 1933, nearly 9,000 banks had failed, leading to the loss of millions of dollars in deposits. 3. Overproduction: In the years leading up to the Great Depression, there was a massive increase in industrial production, leading to oversupply and falling prices. This resulted in a chain reaction of bankruptcies throughout the economy. 4. Protectionism: Some economists argue that policies promoting trade protectionism worsened the Great Depression by causing a reduction in international trade. Countries began implementing tariffs and other trade barriers to protect their domestic industries. 5. Agricultural Crisis: Another contributing factor to the Great Depression was an agricultural crisis that affected many regions, particularly in the United States. Crop yields were high, leading to overproduction and falling prices. This led to massive farm failures and the migration of rural workers to urban areas. 6. Government Policies: Finally, economists also point to government policies that exacerbated the Great Depression. Many governments followed restrictive monetary policies that reduced the money supply, causing deflation and economic contraction. Overall, the Great Depression was caused by a combination of factors, including overproduction, trade restrictions, and restrictive government policies. The event led to massive economic and social upheaval, shaping the political and economic landscape for decades to come."},{"instruction":"f you don't water your plants, they will die.

With an increasing awareness of the impact of fashion on the environment, consumers are seeking out clothes that are made from sustainable materials, produced in ethical and fair labor conditions, and reduce waste. Many brands are now incorporating eco-friendly materials such as organic cotton, recycled polyester, and even fabrics made from bamboo and hemp. These fabrics not only have a lower environmental impact but also feel soft and comfortable on the skin. In addition to using sustainable materials, some brands are also adopting circular design principles - creating clothes that are designed to be easily disassembled and recycled at the end of their life cycle. Another trend that's gaining popularity is slow fashion, which focuses on creating timeless pieces that can be worn for years rather than fast fashion's philosophy of producing cheap and trendy clothes that only last a season. This approach involves investing in high-quality pieces made from durable and sustainable materials that will stand the test of time. Additionally, gender-neutral clothing is becoming more prevalent in fashion. As societal norms around gender continue to shift, many brands are now producing clothing lines that are purposely designed to be unisex. This trend is not only promoting inclusivity and diversity but also challenging the traditional binary gender roles that have been perpetuated by fashion for many years. Overall, the latest trend in fashion is not just about looking good but also doing good for the environment and society. Consumers are increasingly prioritizing sustainability, ethical production, and fair labor conditions when they make clothing purchases.

The Falcon Heavy's maiden flight, which took place in February 2018, saw it carry a cherry red Tesla Roadster as its payload.

A mannequin named \\"Starman\\" was placed in the driver's seat, dressed in a SpaceX spacesuit for added effect. The success of the Falcon Heavy launch has far-reaching implications for the future of space exploration.

The report notes that the cost of building large-scale solar and wind farms has fallen below the cost of electricity from new coal and gas-fired power plants in 2020. The increasing affordability of renewable energy is due to a combination of factors, including technological advances and economies of scale. As more governments and companies turn to renewable energy to meet their energy needs, the cost of producing and installing clean energy technologies has continued to decrease. This shift toward renewable energy is not only more affordable in the short term but is also expected to benefit economies in the long term. Renewable energy technologies offer more stable pricing and are not subject to the same volatile price fluctuations as fossil fuels. Additionally, investing in renewable energy can create job opportunities and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The report’s findings highlight the need for continued investment in renewable energy technologies. As economies around the world move toward cleaner energy sources, it is essential that countries and companies invest in infrastructure and policies that support sustainable growth.

This might come as a surprise to some people who associate deserts with barren, sandy landscapes in hot climates. However, a desert is defined as a region that receives very little precipitation, and Antarctica fits that description perfectly. The Antarctic Desert covers an area of about 14 million square kilometers, which is nearly twice the size of the Sahara Desert. It is also the coldest and windiest desert, with temperatures that can drop as low as -128.6°F (-89.2°C) and winds that can exceed 200 miles per hour (320 kilometers per hour). Despite these harsh conditions, there is still life in the Antarctic Desert. Many species of plants and animals have adapted to the extreme environment, such as lichens, mosses, and penguins. However, humans cannot survive here without specialized gear and supplies, so the Antarctic remains one of the most remote and untouched regions of the world. In conclusion, the largest desert in the world is not the Sahara or the Mojave, but rather the Antarctic. Its huge size and extreme conditions make it a unique and fascinating landscape that continues to challenge scientists and explorers."},{"instruction":"Are these sentences synonymous?

Users can enter their address and the tool uses data like roof angle, local weather patterns, and nearby tree cover to estimate annual sunlight. Additionally, the tool shows data about the average hourly and daily sunlight received by the house, and it provides a cost estimation for installing solar panels on the roof for the users. This feature has the potential to not only give homeowners an understanding of their rooftop’s solar energy output but also inspire them to take action towards renewable energy solutions.

This innovation will allow people to easily identify what potential savings solar energy could bring to their household while helping reduce carbon footprint from increasing adoption of solar energy. Project Sunroof is part of Google’s wider push towards environmental sustainability solutions. The company has promised to run on 100% renewable energy by the end of 2020, and solutions like Project Sunroof can help make renewable energy more accessible to individuals and further reduce carbon emissions.

A new report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation found that the amount of plastic in the oceans is set to triple by 2050 if current trends continue. The report calls for a rethink of our use of plastic, including the development of new packaging materials and more efficient recycling systems. What can we do as individuals and as a society to reduce the problem of plastic waste?","output":"Article: Plastic has become one of the biggest environmental problems of our time. With millions of tons of plastic entering our oceans every year, it is endangering our marine life and the health of our planet. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation recently released a report that warns that if current trends continue, the amount of plastic in the oceans will triple by the year 2050. The report calls for a major overhaul of the way we use plastic. We need to sort out alternative packaging solutions, and implement more advanced and efficient recycling systems. It warns that we need to act now or else the situation could get worse. However, it's not just the responsibility of governments and big corporations. As individuals, we need to take action as well. Here are some simple steps that we can take to reduce our plastic waste: 1. Say no to single-use plastics: Things like straws, plastic bags, and plastic water bottles are some of the most commonly-used plastic items that end up in the ocean. Refusing to use them or investing in reusable alternatives, like a metal water bottle, shopping bags or glass straws can make a big difference. 2. Recycle correctly and responsibly: By sorting your waste and recycling, you can help reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in the ocean. 3. Pick up trash: Participate in beach clean-ups, litter picking and recycling drives. Even if you're not directly responsible for the trash, picking it up and disposing it of properly helps reduce the amount of plastic that could end up in the ocean. 4. Support eco-friendly businesses: Look for companies that are adopting sustainable packaging solutions, and support them by buying their products. 5. Advocate for change: Spread awareness about the plastic crisis with your family, friends, and colleagues. Encourage them to reduce their plastic waste and make better choices. It's time that we all take responsibility and take action to reduce our plastic waste. By collectively making changes in the way we consume and waste products, we can make a significant difference to our environment and ourselves.

However, it has also been associated with negative effects on mental health. Studies have linked social media use to increased rates of anxiety, depression, and other mood disorders. One of the primary reasons for this is the constant exposure to negative content, including bullying and judgment. Social media sites are often platforms for people to voice their opinions and criticisms, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy, anxiety, and stress. Moreover, social media can lead to feelings of FOMO, the fear of missing out. Users often see friends and peers living lavish lifestyles or achieving success, which can create feelings of resentment and failure. Additionally, social media often promotes unhealthy comparisons. People are more likely to compare themselves to others on social media, leading to feelings of inadequacy and negatively impacting their self-esteem. Another issue is the constant pressure to curate a perfect life online. Many users feel compelled to project a false image of happiness and success, which can lead to feelings of insecurity and low self-worth. Overall, the impact of social media on mental health is complex and multifaceted. While social media can provide benefits like increased social connection and communication, it can also lead to negative effects on psychological well-being. It is important for individuals to be mindful of their social media use and take steps to protect their mental health."},{"instruction":"The company's profits were at an alltime high because of the successful marketing campaign.

The major sources of greenhouse gases include the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, deforestation, industrial activities, and agricultural practices. Another factor contributing to climate change is the depletion of the ozone layer. The ozone layer is a protective layer in the Earth’s atmosphere that absorbs harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. However, the release of chemicals like Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) has resulted in the depletion of the ozone layer, leading to an increase in UV radiation that further causes climate change. Effects of Climate Change: The effects of climate change are evident in different parts of the world. The rising global temperature results in melting glaciers, which causes sea levels to rise. The increase in sea levels has led to flooding in coastal areas, causing significant property damage and loss of life. Additionally, climate change leads to extreme weather conditions such as intense heatwaves, droughts, hurricanes, and typhoons. These catastrophic events can cause severe economic and social impacts. Climate change also affects wildlife habitats and crop production, leading to food insecurity. As temperatures continue to increase, some animal species are now migrating to cooler areas. This movement is leading to a decrease in biodiversity and a decline in the availability of natural resources. Conclusion: Climate change is an issue that requires immediate attention from all nations worldwide. The primary cause of climate change is the release of greenhouse gases, depletion of the ozone layer, and deforestation. The effects of climate change include rising sea levels, extreme weather conditions, food insecurity, and loss of biodiversity. We must take urgent measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and conserve our natural resources to prevent devastating impacts on the planet."},{"instruction":"f the premise is The cake tastes sweet, is the hypothesis The cake has chocolate frosting entailed by it?

Maintaining the luster and sheen can be achieved by following simple and easy care instructions. The first step in caring for your leather shoes is to wipe them down with a damp cloth to remove any dust and dirt that may have accumulated on the surface. It is vital to avoid using soap or harsh chemicals that may damage the leather. Once the surface is clean and dry, apply a leather conditioner to nourish and protect the material. It is advisable to use a soft cloth to apply the conditioner and avoid over-saturating the leather. Ensure that you choose the right conditioner that matches the color of your shoes for the best results.

Brushing ensures that the leather looks polished and well taken care of. In conclusion, regular maintenance and proper care for leather shoes are crucial for keeping them looking new and fresh.

According to a new study, scientists have developed a technique that could be used to recycle plastic waste into strong and waterproof concrete. Researchers from the UK's University of Bath and Goa Engineering College in India teamed up to create the new type of concrete, which they say could be used to build flood defenses and other structures in water. The technique involves putting waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic into a solvent that turns it into 'exceptional' plastic flakes. These flakes are then combined with cement to create a more sustainable type of concrete. The use of green cement made from waste plastic actually slightly improves some of the engineering properties of the concrete, explained Professor John Latham, Director of the University of Bath's BRE Centre for Innovative Construction Materials. OPTIONS: Building flood defenses from recycled plastic has never been done before. Scientists at the University of Bath have discovered a new way to create stronger concrete. The use of this new concrete will help reduce the current plastic waste problem. There is no limit to the structures that can be built using this method. The PET plastic is the key ingredient in making this new type of concrete. Recycling plastic is not a new concept, but this new technique is a gamechanger. Cement production is notoriously harmful to the environment, but this new technique is more sustainable. The researchers are currently working on ways to improve the process and make it more efficient. The new waterproof concrete is predicted to last longer than traditional concrete.

Bart is particularly thrilled and can't wait to see it. Act 1: Bart convinces his family to let him watch the Radioactive Man movie despite its PG-13 rating. To his delight, Bart finds the film exhilarating and full of thrilling action scenes. He immediately becomes a devoted fan, much to Lisa's disappointment. Meanwhile, Lisa accompanies Marge on a trip to the Springfield Nature Preserve, where she stumbles upon a hidden entrance. Curious, she ventures inside, only to discover a parallel world filled with anthropomorphic animals living in harmony. Excited, she explores the realm, observing unique animal societies, including moles working as miners and a gang of unconventional friends—a duck, a crow, and a flamingo. Act 2: Back in Springfield, Bart's enthusiasm for the movie soon turns sour when he accidentally stumbles upon a heated online debate discussing the movie's flaws and its negative reception. Overwhelmed by the intense criticism, Bart begins to doubt his own taste and feels guilty for enjoying something that is so heavily criticized. Lisa, on the other hand, continues to explore the charming animal world, gaining valuable insights into their unique dynamics. She befriends the duck, crow, and flamingo trio, who offer her their perspectives on friendship and acceptance. Inspired by their wisdom, Lisa realizes that not all criticisms should dictate her own opinions. Act 3: Desperate to fit in and conform, Bart decides to hide his love for the Radioactive Man movie from his friends and family. He starts behaving negatively towards anything associated with the film, distancing himself from something he genuinely enjoyed. However, his secret agony affects his mood and relationships, causing concern among his loved ones. Meanwhile, Lisa decides to introduce the animal world to her family, hoping they can learn valuable lessons from their peaceful coexistence. The Simpsons are mesmerized by the heartwarming and harmonious animal society and see the stark contrast with their own town's chaotic nature. Act 4: During a family discussion, Lisa shares her newfound wisdom with Bart. Recognizing his internal struggle, she urges him to embrace his own taste without being swayed by public opinion. Bart realizes that his guilt stems from caring too much about what others think, and he begins to regain his confidence in his own judgment. In the final act, Bart publicly defends the Radioactive Man movie, giving an impassioned speech in its favor. To his surprise, many of his classmates resonate with his words and confess their own hidden love for the film. Bart feels relieved that he's not alone in appreciating something often criticized. Lisa, along with her new animal friends, continues her efforts to bring a touch of the harmonious animal world to Springfield. The episode ends with Simpson family members thoughtfully considering the lessons they've learned about acceptance, self-expression, and not being swayed by external judgments. Outro: As the credits roll, we catch glimpses of Springfield slowly adopting a more tolerant and accepting nature, thanks to Lisa's inspiration and Bart's courage to embrace his own opinions."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Natsuki: (to herself) “Just stay calm, Natsuki…Sakura’s going to be due soon.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and warm water. Mix well until it forms a smooth dough. Knead the dough for 5-10 minutes until it becomes elastic. Cover the dough with a damp towel and let it rest for 30 minutes. 2. In the meantime, prepare the dumpling filling. In a separate bowl, combine the minced pork or chicken, chopped cabbage, green onions, minced garlic, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, grated ginger, salt, and pepper. Mix everything until well combined. 3. After the dough has rested, divide it into small pieces and roll each piece into a thin circle about 3-4 inches in diameter. 4. Place about 1 tablespoon of the filling mixture into the center of each dumpling wrapper. Fold the wrapper in half and press the edges together to seal the filling inside. You can crimp the edges in a decorative pattern if desired. 5. Repeat the process until all the filling and wrappers are used. 6. Heat a large steamer or a steamer basket over boiling water. Place the dumplings in the steamer, making sure they are not touching each other. Steam the dumplings for about 12-15 minutes, or until the filling is cooked through and the wrappers become slightly translucent. 7. While the dumplings are steaming, prepare the dipping sauce. In a small bowl, mix together soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil. 8. Once the dumplings are cooked, serve them hot with the dipping sauce. You can garnish the sauce with chopped green onions if desired. Enjoy your homemade Shifu's dumplings inspired by Kung Fu Panda!"},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Natsuki: (to herself) “Just stay calm, Natsuki…Sakura’s going to be due in 4 weeks.

Here's a general approach to auto-animate or create sprite sheets for your AI-generated assets: 1. **Adobe Character Animator**: Adobe Character Animator can be used to animate characters automatically by using a webcam and microphone to apply live motion capture to your characters. It's more suitable for puppet-style animation. 2. **Spine**: If the AI-generated assets are skeletal-based (like characters or creatures), you can use Spine by Esoteric Software. Spine allows you to rig your characters and interpolate between keyframes automatically. It can also export sprite sheets. 3. **DragonBones**: DragonBones is a free alternative to Spine, where you can rig and animate characters. It also allows for sprite sheet export. 4. **Unity or Godot Engine**: If you're designing a game, you may already be using a game engine like Unity or Godot. Both have built-in tools to create animations from individual frames and can generate sprite sheets from these animations. You can use their respective animation tools to set up keyframes and interpolate between frames. 5. **Scripting in Image Editing Software**: Programs like Photoshop or GIMP can be scripted to automate the process of creating sprite sheets. For example, a Photoshop script could place each individual frame in a grid pattern on a new canvas, essentially creating a sprite sheet. 6. **TexturePacker**: TexturePacker is a tool for creating sprite sheets. You would first create the individual frames, and then TexturePacker can automatically combine them into an optimized sprite sheet. 7. **Automated Rigging and Animation Tools**: Some tools use AI or procedural generation to automatically rig and animate characters. An example is Mixamo by Adobe, which automates the rigging process and provides a library of animations that can be applied to characters. When your assets have been animated, you can capture each animation frame to compile into a sprite sheet using any sprite sheet generator or by manually arranging them in an image editor. Automation will depend on the complexity of animations and the kinds of assets you’re dealing with. Standard run cycles, idle animations, and simple actions are more conducive to automation, while complex or unique animations might still require a manual touch. Remember that the automated processes usually give better results when there's a well-established structure or pattern for computer interpretation. If the AI-generated assets are inconsistent or vary widely in form and structure, you may have more work to do in cleaning up or standardizing the assets before they can be effectively animated using automated tools."},{"instruction":"what adobe version is best for 2d games","output":"When working on 2D games, the most relevant Adobe software products would typically be Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. These programs are used for creating and editing images and vector graphics, respectively. The best version of Adobe software for your project often depends on the specific features you require, your budget, and personal preference. Here's a bit more about each: 1. **Adobe Photoshop**: - Photoshop is great for creating detailed textures, background images, sprite sheets, and UI elements. - It supports frame-by-frame animation and can create animated GIFs or sprite sheets. - You might prefer the latest Creative Cloud (CC) version for ongoing updates and cloud-based features. 2. **Adobe Illustrator**: - Illustrator is ideal for designing vector-based assets that can be scaled without losing quality. - It’s excellent for creating clean, scalable art for characters, items, and GUI components. - Like Photoshop, the CC version ensures the most recent features and improvements. 3. **Adobe Animate** (formerly Flash Professional): - Animate is designed for vector graphics and animation. - It's useful for creating interactive animations and can export in various formats suitable for games. - This could be part of your workflow if you're targeting platforms that support the animations you create with this tool. For game development, there isn't a single \\"best\\" version across all Adobe software as the choice heavily depends on the specific requirements of your project. However, the latest versions from the Adobe Creative Cloud usually provide the most extensive set of features, along with regular updates and cloud services. If budget is a concern, or you don't need the latest features, you might consider using an older version, but keep in mind that Adobe no longer sells perpetual licenses to their software. Instead, they operate on a subscription-based model. Alternatively, if you do not wish to subscribe to Adobe's software, there are other tools available that are widely used in the game development industry, like: - **Affinity Designer and Photo**: One-time purchase options that are comparable to Illustrator and Photoshop, respectively. - **GIMP**: A free and open-source alternative to Photoshop. - **Inkscape**: A free and open-source vector graphics editor, similar to Illustrator. Regardless of the software version you choose, ensure that it's compatible with your operating system and hardware, and that it has the features required for your specific game development process."},{"instruction":"help me create the easiest way for me to get assets and create assets into the game","output":"Creating and integrating assets into a game can be a streamlined process if you use the right tools and follow an organized workflow. I'll outline a simplified step-by-step guide to help you get assets and create them for your game: 1. **Conceptualize Game Design**: - Before creating or acquiring assets, have a clear idea of your game's theme, style, and requirements. - Create a list of all the assets you'll need (characters, backgrounds, UI elements, sound effects, music, etc.). 2. **Asset Creation**: For creating assets yourself, here are some routes you can follow: - **2D Art**: Use software like Adobe Photoshop, Affinity Photo, or GIMP for creating 2D art. - **Vector Graphics**: For scalable graphics like UI elements or stylized characters, use Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape. - **Pixel Art**: If your game has a retro aesthetic, consider using dedicated pixel art software like Aseprite or Pyxel Edit. - **Animation**: Animate your assets using software like Adobe Animate, Spine, or DragonBones. - **Sound Effects**: Create or edit sounds using tools like Audacity, or use free libraries like freesound.org. - **Music**: Compose music with digital audio workstations (DAWs) like FL Studio, Ableton Live, or use royalty-free music from sources like incompetech.com. 3. **Acquiring Pre-made Assets**: - Leverage assets from marketplaces like Unity Asset Store, Unreal Engine Marketplace, Itch.io, or Envato Market. - Use subscription-based libraries like Envato Elements for a wide range of game assets. - Search for free assets on websites like OpenGameArt or Kenney.nl, but always check the licensing. 4. **Organizing Assets**: - Keep your assets organized in folders by type (e.g., sprites, sounds, music, scripts). - Use clear naming conventions for easy identification. 5. **Asset Integration**: Whatever game engine you're using, follow these general steps: - **Import Assets**: Import the assets into your game project's asset folder. Most engines have a simple drag-and-drop functionality for this. - **Create Game Objects**: Use your game engine's editor to create game objects and attach your 2D sprites or animations to them. - **Implement Interactivity**: Implement the functionality of your game objects with scripts or the game engine's visual scripting tools. - **Sound Integration**: Add sound effects and music to the relevant game objects or triggers within your game. 6. **Testing**: - Regularly test the game to see how the assets look and behave in the live environment. - Make adjustments to the assets or their implementation as needed. 7. **Optimization**: - Optimize your assets for the best performance, which may involve reducing file sizes or resolutions, using sprite sheets, and compressing audio files. 8. **Iteration**: - Through testing and feedback, continue to iterate on your assets to improve the quality and fit within the game. By following this process, you can create or obtain assets and integrate them into your game effectively. Remember to save your work often, keep backups, and version control, especially if working with a team. This ensures a smooth development cycle with minimal loss of data and productivity. If you choose a popular game engine like Unity or Godot, you'll find plenty of tutorials and documentation to help guide you through these steps in more detail."},{"instruction":"I want it to have a inky feel to it but still feel great with movement, it's gonna have the e ink style","output":"Creating a game with an \\"inky\\" or \\"e-ink\\" style is a unique and visually striking choice that can set your game apart. To achieve this aesthetic and still ensure fluid movement, you'll need to focus on both the visual design of your assets and the smoothness of your animations. Here's how you can approach it: 1. **Visual Style**: - Use a limited color palette that matches e-ink displays, typically black, white, and shades of grey. - Design assets with high contrast to mimic the sharpness of e-ink screens. - Incorporate ink-like textures and stroke effects in your art to give it an authentic, hand-drawn appearance. 2. **Asset Creation**: - Create your art assets using vector graphics software like Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape to maintain sharp lines that are reminiscent of ink drawings. - For added texture and organic feel, use bitmap programs like Adobe Photoshop to hand-draw textures or to apply ink-like brush effects to vector assets. - Consider using a graphics tablet to draw your assets, as it can give you more natural and fluid ink strokes. 3. **Animations**: - Use a high frame rate where possible to ensure movements feel smooth. E-ink itself has a slower refresh rate, but since you're emulating the style rather than using actual e-ink hardware, you can animate as smoothly as you like. - Employ easing functions and tweening in your animations to make movements more natural. - Simplify animations to focus on the most critical movements. Overcomplicated animations can detract from the inky aesthetic due to too much visual noise. 4. **Integration**: - Import the assets into your game engine and test the animations. Pay attention to the feel of the movement — it should be fluid, despite the stark, inky contrasts. - If your engine supports shaders, consider adding a shader that simulates the look of ink on paper, or that adds an effect like ink spreading into paper when a new object appears. - Apply post-processing effects to enhance the e-ink feel, if necessary, such as adding a paper texture overlay. 5. **User Interface (UI)**: - Design the UI with the same ink and paper concept. Use inky calligraphy or handwriting-inspired fonts for text elements. - Keep UI elements simple and high contrast to remain legible and faithful to the e-ink style. 6. **Polish and Refine**: - Frequently playtest to make sure that the inky aesthetic is consistent throughout the game and that the movement feels right. - Get feedback from others to see if the art style and movement meet your vision and are also appealing to players. 7. **Performance**: - Although aesthetic is key, don't forget about the performance. Ensure assets are optimized for the platforms you are targeting. - Test the game on different devices (if applicable) to make sure the experience remains consistent. 8. **Consistency**: - Always maintain the inky style aesthetic across all assets and animations for consistency. This will help to keep the player immersed in your game's unique world. For sound design, you might want to consider minimalist sounds that are evocative of the style you're going for—perhaps paper rustles, pen strokes, and other subtle, thematic audio clips that complement the visual e-ink vibe of the game. By carefully crafting your visual and animation assets to fit this inky and e-ink style, you can create a cohesive and engaging experience that resonates with the theme and mechanics of your game."},{"instruction":"you got any example on how I can prompt a diffuser for best result of game assets, both tilemap and characters","output":"When prompting a diffusion model (like DALL-E or similar AI image generators) for game assets, clarity is key.

La plupart des aéroports régionaux en RDC sont mal équipés et présentent des pistes en mauvais état, des installations de sûreté et de sécurité dépassées, ainsi que des terminaux vétustes. Certaines pistes sont très courtes et ne permettent pas l'atterrissage d'avions de grande taille. De plus, l'absence de modernisation et de mise à niveau des équipements de navigation aérienne rend la gestion du trafic aérien régional difficile. Il y a souvent des retards importants dans les départs et les arrivées en raison du manque de capacités opérationnelles des aéroports. Le manque d'investissements dans les infrastructures aéroportuaires en RDC a également un impact sur le développement économique du pays. Les compagnies aériennes hésitent souvent à desservir les aéroports régionaux en raison des contraintes opérationnelles et de sécurité. Le gouvernement congolais a toutefois pris conscience de ces problématiques et a engagé des travaux de modernisation dans certains aéroports clés, tels que Kinshasa-N'Djili et Lubumbashi. Des projets de construction et de rénovation sont en cours, notamment pour développer les capacités et améliorer l'efficacité des aéroports régionaux.

Les aéroports congolais souffrent de plusieurs problèmes, tels que des pistes en mauvais état, des bâtiments vétustes, des équipements de sûreté obsolètes et une circulation aérienne inefficace. Ces problèmes entraînent des retards fréquents, des annulations de vols et des problèmes de sécurité potentiels, ce qui décourage potentiellement les voyageurs congolais. En raison de ces problèmes, la demande de la population congolaise pour les voyages aériens est souvent limitée. Les Congolais ont généralement peu confiance dans la sécurité et la fiabilité des vols nationaux, ce qui les pousse à privilégier d'autres modes de transport pour leurs déplacements. Pour remédier à cette situation, il est essentiel d'investir massivement dans la modernisation et la rénovation des infrastructures aéroportuaires en RDC. Cela inclut la réhabilitation des pistes, la construction de nouveaux terminaux, l'installation d'équipements de sûreté et de navigation aérienne modernes et la formation adéquate du personnel. Le gouvernement congolais devrait également favoriser l'attrait des compagnies aériennes internationales pour desservir les aéroports congolais en améliorant les conditions opérationnelles et en renforçant la réglementation du secteur. Cela permettrait d'accroître la concurrence et d'améliorer les services aériens offerts aux voyageurs congolais. De plus, une attention particulière doit être accordée à la transparence et à la lutte contre la corruption dans le secteur aéroportuaire. Des mécanismes efficaces de supervision et de gestion des aéroports doivent être mis en place afin de garantir l'utilisation appropriée des ressources financières et de prévenir les fraudes. En résumé, pour remédier à l'état actuel de l'infrastructure aéroportuaire en RDC et répondre à la demande de la population congolaise, il est crucial d'investir massivement dans la modernisation des aéroports, d'améliorer la qualité des services offerts et de renforcer la réglementation du secteur.

Le pays compte plusieurs compagnies aériennes opérant tant au niveau national qu'international, mais elles rencontrent différents défis. Certaines compagnies aériennes congolaises sont bien établies et offrent des services de qualité. Cependant, elles sont souvent confrontées à des difficultés liées à l'âge et à l'état de leur flotte, ainsi qu'à des problèmes de maintenance et de conformité aux normes de sécurité internationales. Certains avions en service sont anciens et leur maintenance régulière peut être un défi. De plus, les compagnies aériennes en RDC ont parfois eu des problèmes liés à la fiabilité des horaires de vols, des retards fréquents et des annulations non prévues. Ces problèmes sont souvent attribuables aux infrastructures aéroportuaires déficientes, à la congestion du trafic aérien et à des problèmes logistiques. La congestion aérienne est également un défi majeur en RDC, surtout dans les aéroports les plus fréquentés comme Kinshasa-N'Djili. L'absence d'infrastructures et d'équipements adéquats pour gérer efficacement le trafic aérien peut entraîner des retards et des défaillances opérationnelles pour les compagnies aériennes. En termes de sécurité, le gouvernement congolais a mis en place des mesures pour renforcer les contrôles et les normes de sécurité aérienne, mais des efforts supplémentaires sont nécessaires pour assurer une conformité totale aux normes internationales. Pour améliorer l'état des compagnies aériennes en RDC, des investissements dans la modernisation des flottes, la formation du personnel, la mise à niveau des systèmes de maintenance et d'exploitation, ainsi que l'amélioration des infrastructures aéroportuaires sont nécessaires.

Elle met l'accent sur les interactions entre les différentes parties d'un système et sur les flux d'informations et de commande qui circulent entre elles. Cette méthode se base sur la représentation graphique du système, en utilisant des diagrammes de blocs pour montrer les différentes fonctions du système et leur interconnexion. Chaque bloc représente une fonction, et les flèches entre les blocs représentent les flux d'informations ou de commande. La méthode structuro-fonctionnelle est souvent utilisée dans le domaine de l'ingénierie des systèmes, notamment pour analyser et concevoir des systèmes complexes tels que les systèmes d'information, les systèmes industriels ou les systèmes embarqués. L'avantage de cette méthode est qu'elle permet de modéliser et de comprendre facilement les interactions entre les différentes parties d'un système, ce qui facilite son analyse et sa conception. De plus, elle fournit une vue d'ensemble du système, ce qui permet de mieux comprendre son fonctionnement global. La méthode structuro-fonctionnelle peut être utilisée avec des références pour décrire les liens entre différentes parties d'un système. Les références peuvent être utilisées pour représenter les entrées et les sorties d'une fonction, les relations de dépendance entre les différentes fonctions, ou les contraintes que doivent satisfaire certaines parties du système.

Do (Cutoff frequency): Do is the cutoff frequency of the filter, also known as the -3dB frequency. It determines the point at which the filter begins attenuating the input signal. In a low-pass filter, frequencies below Do are allowed to pass through, while frequencies above Do are attenuated. In a high-pass filter, frequencies above Do are allowed to pass through, while frequencies below Do are attenuated. 2. n (Order of the filter): n represents the order or degree of the Butterworth filter, which determines the slope of the filter's attenuation curve. The order determines how quickly the filter attenuates the frequencies beyond the cutoff frequency. A higher order provides a steeper roll-off (attenuation) curve. The order can be any positive integer. Together, Do and n define the characteristics of the Butterworth filter, including its frequency response, sharpness of attenuation, and passband/stopband behavior."},{"instruction":"when do and n increase/decrease, what will the image alter","output":"When adjusting the cutoff frequency (Do) and the order (n) of a Butterworth low-pass or high-pass filter, the following changes can be expected: 1. Cutoff Frequency (Do): - Increase in Do: When increasing the cutoff frequency, the filter allows higher frequencies to pass through the filter. This results in a broader passband and potentially more frequencies being retained. - Decrease in Do: When decreasing the cutoff frequency, the filter attenuates higher frequencies more strongly. This leads to a narrower passband and fewer high-frequency components being retained. 2. Order (n): - Increase in the order: With a higher order, the filter provides a steeper roll-off (attenuation) curve. This means that frequencies beyond the cutoff frequency are attenuated more quickly. - Decrease in the order: Lowering the order results in a less steep roll-off curve. The attenuation of frequencies beyond the cutoff frequency is not as strong. In summary, increasing the cutoff frequency (Do) allows more frequencies to pass through, while decreasing it attenuates higher frequencies. Increasing the order (n) provides a sharper attenuation curve, while decreasing it results in a gentler curve."},{"instruction":"introduce separately by high filter and low filter","output":"Sure! Let's discuss the effects of increasing or decreasing Do and n separately for a high-pass filter and a low-pass filter. High-pass Filter: - Increasing Do: When the cutoff frequency (Do) of a high-pass filter is increased, it allows higher frequencies to pass through the filter. This means that more high-frequency components in the input signal will be retained, while lower frequencies will be attenuated. - Decreasing Do: Lowering the cutoff frequency of a high-pass filter results in a narrower passband for higher frequencies. This means that fewer high-frequency components in the input signal will be retained, and more frequencies will be attenuated. - Increasing n: When the order (n) of a high-pass filter is increased, the roll-off (attenuation) curve becomes steeper. This means that frequencies below the cutoff frequency are attenuated more rapidly, providing stronger rejection of low-frequency components. - Decreasing n: Decreasing the order of a high-pass filter results in a less steep roll-off curve. This leads to a gentler attenuation of frequencies below the cutoff frequency, allowing more lower-frequency components to pass through. Low-pass Filter: - Increasing Do: In a low-pass filter, increasing the cutoff frequency allows more high-frequency components to be attenuated. This means that higher-frequency signals will be progressively filtered out, resulting in a narrower passband for lower frequencies. - Decreasing Do: Lowering the cutoff frequency of a low-pass filter broadens the passband for lower frequencies, allowing more low-frequency components to be retained. - Increasing n: When the order of a low-pass filter is increased, the roll-off curve becomes steeper. This means that higher frequencies beyond the cutoff frequency are attenuated more rapidly, resulting in a sharper transition from passband to stopband. - Decreasing n: Decreasing the order of a low-pass filter results in a gentler roll-off curve. This leads to a smoother transition from the passband to the stopband, allowing some higher frequencies to be retained even after the cutoff frequency. Remember, the specific effects of increasing or decreasing Do and n will depend on the specific values chosen and the overall design of the filter."},{"instruction":"how about Gaussian Filter","output":"A Gaussian filter is a type of low-pass filter that applies Gaussian smoothing to an image or signal. It is widely used in various image processing and signal processing applications to reduce noise and blur. The operation of a Gaussian filter is based on convolving the input with a Gaussian kernel. In the case of a Gaussian filter, there are two main parameters that can be adjusted: 1. Sigma (σ): Sigma controls the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution. In the context of a Gaussian filter, it determines the amount of smoothing or blurring applied to the input. Increasing sigma results in a wider Gaussian distribution and thus more smoothing. Conversely, decreasing sigma leads to a narrower distribution and less smoothing. 2. Kernel Size: The kernel size determines the size of the Gaussian filter window or matrix. It specifies the extent over which the convolution operation is performed. Larger kernel sizes capture a wider range of neighboring pixels during filtering, resulting in more extensive spatial smoothing. Smaller kernel sizes, on the other hand, limit the spatial extent of the filter and provide less smoothing. It is worth noting that increasing the sigma value and kernel size increase the computational complexity of the Gaussian filter, as more pixels need to be considered during convolution. However, they also provide more substantial smoothing effects and better noise reduction. Therefore, the choice of sigma and kernel size should balance the desired level of smoothing with computational efficiency. Overall, adjusting the sigma and kernel size parameters of a Gaussian filter allows for controlling the amount of smoothing and blurring applied to an image or signal, with larger values resulting in more smoothing."},{"instruction":"when do increase/decrease, what will the image alter","output":"When adjusting the parameters of a Gaussian filter, the following changes can be expected: 1. Sigma (σ): - Increasing Sigma: Increasing the value of sigma widens the Gaussian distribution and increases the amount of smoothing or blurring applied to the image. This results in a more blurry or smoothed-out image. It reduces high-frequency details and decreases image sharpness. - Decreasing Sigma: Decreasing the value of sigma narrows the Gaussian distribution and decreases the amount of smoothing or blurring applied. This leads to a sharper image with more preserved high-frequency details. However, it may also allow more noise or artifacts to remain in the image. 2. Kernel Size: - Increasing Kernel Size: Increasing the kernel size of a Gaussian filter captures a larger neighborhood around each pixel during filtering. This results in more extensive spatial smoothing and blurring. The resulting image will have smoother transitions between regions and reduced high-frequency details. - Decreasing Kernel Size: Decreasing the kernel size of a Gaussian filter limits the neighborhood considered during filtering. As a result, the spatial extent of the smoothing is reduced, and the overall smoothing effect is less pronounced. The resulting image will retain more of its original details and high-frequency components. In summary, increasing the sigma value or kernel size of a Gaussian filter increases the amount of smoothing and blurring applied to the image, resulting in a smoother and less detailed appearance. Decreasing these parameters has the opposite effect, preserving more details and sharper transitions between image regions. However, smaller kernel sizes may also allow more noise or artifacts to be retained. It is essential to find the right balance between smoothing and preserving important image details when adjusting these parameters."},{"instruction":"introduce separately by high filter and low filter","output":"Sure! Let's discuss the effects of increasing or decreasing the parameters of a Gaussian filter separately for high-pass and low-pass filtering: High-pass Filtering with a Gaussian Filter: - Increasing Sigma: When the sigma value is increased in a Gaussian high-pass filter, it widens the Gaussian distribution and increases the amount of high-frequency noise and details that are preserved. This allows more high-frequency components to pass through the filter, resulting in a sharper output image with enhanced edges and fine details. - Decreasing Sigma: Decreasing the sigma value narrows the Gaussian distribution and reduces the preservation of high-frequency details. This leads to more attenuation of high-frequency components, resulting in a smoother output image with reduced noise and fine details. - Increasing Kernel Size: Increasing the kernel size in a Gaussian high-pass filter expands the neighborhood of pixels considered during filtering. This results in enhanced edge detection and preservation of larger-scale high-frequency information in the image. - Decreasing Kernel Size: Decreasing the kernel size limits the neighborhood considered during filtering, leading to more localized edge detection. This can result in a sharpened output image with pronounced high-frequency details. Low-pass Filtering with a Gaussian Filter: - Increasing Sigma: In a Gaussian low-pass filter, increasing the sigma value widens the Gaussian distribution and increases the amount of smoothing applied to the image. This leads to a stronger attenuation of high-frequency components, effectively reducing noise and fine details in the output image. - Decreasing Sigma: Decreasing the sigma value narrows the Gaussian distribution and decreases the amount of smoothing applied. This preserves more high-frequency details, resulting in a sharper output image with more pronounced fine details and noise. - Increasing Kernel Size: Increasing the kernel size in a Gaussian low-pass filter extends the spatial extent over which smoothing is applied. This results in more extensive smoothing and blurring of the image, reducing high-frequency details and noise. - Decreasing Kernel Size: Decreasing the kernel size limits the spatial extent of smoothing, resulting in a less pronounced smoothing effect. This preserves more high-frequency details at the cost of reduced noise reduction. In summary, adjusting the parameters of a Gaussian filter in a high-pass setting can enhance high-frequency details and edges when increasing sigma or kernel size, while decreasing them can reduce noise and emphasize larger-scale high-frequency information. In a low-pass setting, increasing sigma or kernel size enhances smoothing and noise reduction, while decreasing them preserves more high-frequency details."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Natsuki: (to herself) “Just stay calm, Natsuki…Sakura’s going to be due in 4 weeks.

Along this journey, I have been fortunate to train under the watchful eye of Bradley Hill, a renowned coach in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) circuit. Under his tutelage, I have sharpened my skills, honed my technique, and pushed my limits. Through relentless training and arduous practice sessions, I proudly achieved the esteemed blue belt ranking. This recognition symbolizes the growth and progress I have made in this captivating sport. In addition to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, I immerse myself in the invigorating practice of the Wim Hof Method, particularly embracing its core principle of cold exposure. Even during the harshest winter months, I willingly subject myself to the biting cold, developing mental resilience and boosting my physical endurance. Art has always been my sanctuary, and I have passionately pursued various artistic endeavors for over seven years. This creative outlet allows me to express myself, channel my emotions, and explore new realms of imagination. The combination of the discipline required in martial arts and the freedom of artistic expression has made me remarkably resourceful in managing life's challenges. Furthermore, the dedication I have cultivated extends to the weightlifting realm. Weightlifting enables me to further enhance my physical strength and endurance, enabling me to conquer the demanding aspects of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. This commitment to lifting weights has nurtured my resourcefulness, as I constantly seek innovative ways to improve my performance.

Migdalia Camacho y le exprese que dicha información me recordó lo aprendido acerca de las situaciones que ocurren en nuestro país, acerca de la Colonialidad, como se ejerce la opresión por parte del Estado, a través del patriarcado y el capitalismo. Luego después del almuerzo, se asignaron a todas las personas para asistir a diferentes talleres concurrentes de los cuales tuve la oportunidad de asistir al de Poesía Para Estar Vivas de Elisaura Vázquez Ayala, confieso que al principio no me llamo la atención, pero una vez que entre en la Sala B, me enamore al escuchar que cuando nos solicitaron escribir en un papel las cinco cosas que mas nos gusta de estar vivos, y lo utilizamos para crear un poema, que dicho sea de paso nunca había escrito un poema. Me percate que son las mismas cosas que no sacamos el tiempo para hacer y no están en nuestra lista de prioridades, ni siquiera en la agenda, lo que nos hizo reflexionar en dedicarnos tiempo. Mas adelante, el recurso nos declamo varios poemas del libro de Antologías, llamado; “Poesía para estar vivas, por las niñas de Borinquen”, basado en historias reales de mujeres víctimas de violencia doméstica, de abuso psicológico y sexual, tanto a mujeres adultas como a niñas que se aplica como fin terapéutico de sanación lo cual me impacto tanto que descubrí que me encanta la poesía, tanto así que compré los tres libros. También al finalizar dicho taller le solicite su información para llevar su mensaje a la escuela donde laboro. Por otro lado, debo mencionar que tuve la oportunidad de conocer a la Dra. Isabel Feliciano Giboyeaux. En resumen, este panel y taller fueron experiencias muy valiosas para mí. Aprendí sobre la importancia de abordar la salud mental desde diferentes perspectivas y reflexionar sobre las estructuras de poder que contribuyen a la opresión en nuestro país. Además, descubrí el poder sanador de la poesía y cómo puede ayudarnos a expresar y sanar nuestras experiencias. Estoy agradecido por esta oportunidad y emocionado de llevar este conocimiento a otros.

En otro asunto, a las 8:46am, llego una participante que la Enlace atendió y esta suscribiente estuvo de oyente, la cual era una femina de 62 anos, ama de casa, residente de Gurabo, la cual tiene dos hijos el mayor que no revelo su edad que sta en Puerto Rico actualmente y su hija menor fruto de su matrimonio la cual tiene una hija de 5 anos y residen en Japón actualmente, según alego hace 9 anos descubrió unos mensajes de texto en el celular de su aun esposo que provenian de otra mujer y a raíz de eso el la rechazaba por tal razón, no tenían relaciones sexuales e incluso se divorcio recienmente por solicitud de su ex esposo por ruptura irreparable, y tenia pensado demandarlo para reclamarle bienes al ex esposo pero se recibió asesoramiento de un abogado que le oriento y le recomendó esperar las gestiones pendientes con relación a la división de la casa que esta a nombre de ambos, y tiene 90 dias para que su ex esposo le haga entrega por la cantidad de 53,000 que representa la mitad del valor de dicha casa, y nos expresó que todavía sigue viviendo en la casa que comparte con su ex esposo y tiene miedo por su seguridad dado a que se ha incrementado un ambiente hostil hacia su persona y trata de estar lo menos posible en el hogar, incluso a veces se encierra en su cuarto a aparte donde duerme hace 9 anos y alego surfrir de violencia psicológica durante todo su matrimonio pero cuando su hija se fue para Japón y su ex suegra falleció, aumentaron los episodios de maltrato psicológico hacia ella y la Enlace le oriento acerca de la Ley 54 pero la participante se negó y expreso que no quería hacerle dano a su ex esposo que confiaba mas en la justicia divina, lo que le provoca preocupación es que una vez culmine el plazo el día 14 de diciembre de 2023, no tiene donde vivir, a lo que la Enlace, le oriento que durante dicho proceso la ley la cobija mientras la casa se encuentre a nombre de ambos, en todo caso su ex esposo tendría que pedir desahucio pero debido a la escasez de hogares que existe actualmente le da oportunidad de mas tiempo para realizar gestiones de búsqueda de un lugar seguro para vivir. Partiendo de esa premisa y la información provista por la participante, la Enlace, le oriento acerca de solicitar en Vivienda pero surge de la entrevista que la participante tiene otra casa a su nombre la cual se vendio por 40,000, pero con la cláusula de alquiler con opción a compra y en ese entonces recibió 20,000 y la otra mitad el inquilino la paga por una mensualidad de 350 y todavía para completar dicho acuerdo faltan de 3 a 4 años. Por lo que, la casa todavía esta a su nombre y paga CRIM todavía razón por la cual no es elegible en Vivienda. añadió que sus ingresos además de la renta son 1,055 de seguro social y entiende que no cualifica para PAN. La enlace le oriento para verificar en Sección 8 para alquiler de casa o apartamento, y le proveyó listado de alternativas en Caguas y Gurabo, incluyendo egidas según solicito la participante para realizar las llamadas correspondientes y añadió que lleva un tiempo diligenciando con la ayuda de sus hijos y amistades, para conseguir un lugar donde vivir pero que la mayoría son personas que dividen una casa en pequeños estudios que no tienen ventilación y hay otros lugares que son para personas que casi no salen mucho y son mucho mayores que ella y se siente útil y funcional lo cual le produciría depresión esos sitios. Por mi parte cuando pude interactuar con la participante le pregunté más o menos cuanto puede pagar de alquiler de renta y esta me respondió de 350 a 400 y también me ofrecí a conseguir el número de Jardines de las Catalinas en Caguas, para validar los requisitos de elegibilidad que tengo entendido que es para personas de edad avanzada y que reciban seguro social.Luego la Enlace recapitulo toda la información y acerca de la importancia de tener la evidencia de búsqueda de un lugar donde vivir y mantenerse en contacto de surgir alguna opción y por ultimo tan pronto tengamos la información de los apartamentos de Caguas se lo comunicaremos via telefónica, nos despedimos y quedo muy agradecida por la orientación. Cabe señalar, que una vez sali del Centro de Practica logre conseguir el numero de Jardines de las Catalinas es el 787-653-6749, e incluso intente hablar con el personal de Administración personalmente, pero las gestiones fueron infructuosas, dado a que había un letrero que decía se atiende publico hasta las 2:00pm, de todos modos se le estará dando seguimiento. Por otro lado, estuve de oyente cuando la intercesora legal se comunico con mi Enlace para informarle lo ocurrido en el caso de la participante que solicito la orden de protección el pasado 27 de octubre de 2023, (la cual mencionamos al inicio), y resulto que la misma llego al tribunal acompañada por su pareja y expreso que solicito la orden de protección porque quería que se fuera del hogar, pero no quería hacerle dano porque a pesar de todo era bueno, y que no tenia interés en seguir con el caso, pero al parecer el demandado se comporto de una forma agresiva hacia la jueza y expreso que la participante reta al machismo, por lo que la jueza decidió extender la orden de protección. En otro caso, que le realizamos la entrevista inicial el 31 de octubre de 2023, a una participante, la Enlace se comunico con ella para darle seguimiento y esta suscribiente estuvo de oyente, que pase por la oficina según recomendó la intercesora legal, para que responda a la demanda de divorcio específicamente el inciso 6 y 7 que expresan acerca de su interés en obtener los muebles como el alega que todavía los paga tendría que darle dinero para quedarse con ellos y lo mismo con la guagua en o antes del 13 de noviembre de 2023. Donde acordaron que luego del trabajo el pasado 10 de noviembre de 2023, en la tarde, haría lo posible por llegar a la oficina. En la tarde, la Enlace recibió la llamada de la participante que tenia cita en el tribunal relacionado a la orden de protreccion, que mencionamos al principio,en la cual estuvos de oyente donde le expreso que recibió la llamada del personal del Municipio de Gurabo, para el puesto de ama de llaves,pero no tenia buena recepción en su teléfono e intento devolverle la llamada pero no fue psobile hablar con el personal del municipio, a lo que la Enlace le indico que le daría seguimiento y le proveyó el numero telefónico y la ubicación de la Casa de la Juventud de Gurabo, donde coordinan las entrevistas, y por ultimo, también la participante indico que solicito en la compañía de celulares SafeLink Wireless y próximamente tendrá entrevista de empleo. A las 2:45pm llego la participante relacionada con la respuesta de la demanda de divorcio y redacto el documento requerido para hacer entrega del mismo el próximo lunes, 13 de noviembre de 2023, dado a que este día no tiene transportación para hacer entrega del mismo en el tribunal. Para finalizar, el día esta suscribiente comenzó la lectura de la Ley 121, de la Carta de Derechos y la Política Publica del Gobierno a favor de los Adultos Mayores, expedida el 1 de agosto de 2019, donde se hizo resumen de la exposición de motivos, donde dice y cito: “Los adultos mayores requieren atención y protección del Estado, sus múltiples necesidades. El compromiso de esta Administración con esta población quedo plasmada en el Plan de Puerto Rico, programa de gobierno avalado en las pasadas elecciones de noviembre de 2016”. Luego el 2 de enero de 2017 se asumió las riendas de Puerto Rico, presentando la prioridad al mejoramiento de esta población y se presento legislación para crear programas dirigidos a identificar oficinas donde se le ofrezcan servicios a esta población, mas tarde se creo la Ley 58 del 2018, que incluía unos programas que atendieran las necesidades de los adultos mayores, como transportacioin, cuidado personal, rehabilitación, consejería, programas de nutrición, apoyo psicosocial, manejo de condiciones medicas, incentivos económicos entre otros. Para finalizar, se enfatiza en el desarrollo de actividades y acciones que contribuyen a mantener la capacidad máxima de la independencia física, mental y social dentro del ámbito familiar, económico, y social lo que es esencial para lograr su bienestar y participación en la comunidad.","output":"Esta información refleja situaciones reales en las que la Enlace y la suscribiente están asistiendo a participantes en diferentes casos. La primera reflexión es sobre la participante que parece haber perdido interés en mantener la orden de protección contra su pareja. Esto puede ser preocupante ya que indica un posible riesgo para su seguridad. Es importante que la Enlace siga brindando apoyo y orientación, recordándole la importancia de su bienestar y seguridad. En el segundo caso, la participante está pasando por un proceso de divorcio y también enfrenta dificultades para encontrar un lugar seguro donde vivir una vez culmine el plazo de entrega de la mitad del valor de la casa. La Enlace está buscando alternativas y ofreciendo información para ayudar a la participante a encontrar una solución adecuada. En cuanto a la participante de mayor edad, se destaca la importancia de la Ley 121 que busca atender y proteger los derechos de los adultos mayores en Puerto Rico. Se resalta la necesidad de brindar servicios y apoyo a esta población para garantizar su bienestar y participación en la comunidad.

The sun casts a golden glow on the beach, illuminating the scene. The boys, lost in the intensity of the game, seem unaware of her presence. She notices their energy and passion on display. They dive for the ball, leaping into the air with graceful agility. Some of them cheer and shout encouragement, adding to the excitement of the game. The sound of laughter and playful banter mingles with the crashing waves in the background. As she continues observing, she notices the camaraderie among the boys. They high-five each other after a good play and offer kind words of support. The sheer joy they exude from their shared love for the sport is contagious. The girl feels a sudden desire to join in the fun. She takes off her sandals, runs towards them, and asks if she can join the game. The boys, momentarily surprised as she caught them off guard, pause and exchange glances. They scrutinize her with curious eyes, wondering if she will be able to keep up with their skill level. The girl smiles confidently, assuring them that she's up for the challenge. Intrigued by her enthusiasm, the boys agree, welcoming her to their game. She introduces herself to the boys, and they reciprocate with their names. They quickly begin a new round of volleyball, this time with the addition of the girl. The ball soars through the air, as they exchange powerful spikes and precise ball control. Though she initially struggles to match their expertise, the boys are patient and offer helpful tips to improve her technique. Gradually, the girl becomes more comfortable, her skills evolving with each passing minute. She surprises herself by returning powerful serves and contributing to their intense rallies. As the game progresses, the bond between the girl and the boys strengthens. They laugh together, tease each other, and share friendly banter. It no longer matters whether they are boys or girls; they are simply friends enjoying a game on the beach. Hours pass by, filled with laughter, competition, and camaraderie. The girl realizes that this impromptu game of beach volleyball has become a beautiful moment of connection and shared joy. For a brief period, the worries of the world fade away, replaced by the simplicity of friendship and the sheer pleasure of playing together. As the sun begins to set, casting vibrant hues across the sky, the girl and the boys reluctantly call an end to their game. They exchange gratitude for the incredible time they shared and promise to meet again on the beach soon. The girl walks away from the beach, her heart filled with the memory of an unforgettable day. She realizes that sometimes, the most unexpected moments bring the most delight, and friendships can be formed in the simplest of circumstances."},{"instruction":"but as she is walking home, someone attacks her, but one of the boys sees and tries to defend her","output":"As the girl walks along the path on her way home, enjoying the warm breeze and reminiscing about the beach volleyball game, her serene thoughts are abruptly shattered. A figure emerges from the shadows, rushing towards her with hostility in their eyes. Startled, the girl's heart races as fear engulfs her. She instinctively tries to defend herself, but the attacker is relentless. Panic sets in, and she fears for her safety. However, fate intervenes in the form of one of the boys from the beach volleyball game. He had been following her discreetly, unaware of the impending danger. Sensing the impending threat, he rushes forward, determined to protect her from harm. With a burst of adrenaline, the boy launches himself at the assailant, diverting their attention away from the girl. The attacker, momentarily stunned by the sudden intervention, engages in a brief scuffle with the boy. The girl, realizing she has a chance to escape, darts towards the nearest populated area, shouting for help. Passersby are alerted to the commotion and quickly come to her aid, ensuring her safety and summoning the authorities. Meanwhile, the boy bravely continues to fend off the attacker, utilizing the skills he honed during the volleyball game. Despite being outnumbered and facing a formidable adversary, he remains resilient, fighting with determination. Eventually, the combined efforts of bystanders and local security forces overpower the assailant. With the threat neutralized, the boy stands tall, his clothes disheveled and his face covered in cuts and bruises. Despite the pain, a defiant look of triumph shines in his eyes. Grateful and profoundly moved, the girl approaches the boy, gratitude evident in her eyes. She expresses her heartfelt appreciation for his bravery, thanking him for coming to her rescue.

Les séquences d'échappement unicode sont utilisées pour représenter des caractères spéciaux en utilisant leur code unicode. Elles commencent par le caractère 'u' suivi d'une séquence de points hexadécimaux représentant le code unicode du caractère. Par exemple, 'u20AC' représente le symbole de l'euro (€) en utilisant le code unicode U+20AC. Dans le cas où la séquence d'échappement unicode est tronquée, cela signifie qu'une ou plusieurs parties de la séquence ont été omises ou mal formées. Cela peut se produire si le code unicode est incorrectement saisi ou si vous avez utilisé une séquence d'échappement unicode incorrecte.

Commencez la séquence d'échappement unicode par le caractère 'u'. 2. Suivez le caractère 'u' avec une séquence de 4 chiffres hexadécimaux. Les chiffres hexadécimaux vont de 0 à 9 et de A à F. 3. Placez la séquence d'échappement unicode dans une chaîne de caractères en utilisant des guillemets simples (' ') ou des guillemets doubles (\\" \\"). Par exemple, si vous voulez représenter le caractère 'é' en utilisant l'échappement unicode, vous pouvez le faire comme ceci : \`\`\`python print('u00E9') \`\`\` Cela affichera le caractère 'é' lors de l'exécution du programme. Il est important de noter que si vous voulez représenter des caractères unicode dont le code est supérieur à 'uFFFF', vous pouvez utiliser la séquence d'échappement unicode étendue 'U'. Cette séquence commence par le caractère 'U' suivi de 8 chiffres hexadécimaux. Par exemple, pour représenter le symbole ∞ (infini) dont le code unicode est U+221E, vous pouvez le faire comme ceci : \`\`\`python print('u221E') \`\`\` ou \`\`\`python print('U0000221E') \`\`\` Les deux afficheront le symbole de l'infini lors de l'exécution du programme.

Pour plus de clarté, vous pouvez également utiliser des chaînes de caractères brutes (raw strings) en ajoutant le préfixe 'r' devant la chaîne. Les chaînes de caractères brutes ignorent l'échappement des caractères spéciaux, ce qui signifie que vous n'avez pas besoin d'échapper les caractères spéciaux tels que les barres obliques inversées.

Balancing your own well-being with your responsibilities as a mother is crucial. Remember, you deserve happiness and fulfillment in your own life as well.” Natsuki: “You’re right, Monika. It’s important for me to continue pursuing my passions and hobbies, even after Sakura arrives. It’ll help me maintain a sense of identity and fulfillment outside of being a mother.” Yuri: “And if you need any recommendations for relaxation or self-care activities, Natsuki, I’m more than happy to share some of the literature I’ve come across. Engaging in soothing activities like reading or writing can be a form of self-care too.” Sayori: “I can help with that too, Natsuki! If you ever want to go on walks or enjoy some nature, I’m always up for it. Sometimes a change of scenery and fresh air can do wonders for the mind and soul.” Natsuki: “Thank you, guys. I really appreciate all your suggestions and support. I’m feeling a lot more optimistic now, knowing that I have such amazing friends who have my back.” Monika: “We’ll always be here for you, Natsuki. Remember, being a mother is a beautiful journey, and while there may be challenges along the way, the love and joy you’ll experience with Sakura will far outweigh any hardships.” Yuri: “And don’t hesitate to lean on us whenever you need emotional support or simply someone to talk to. We care about you deeply, Natsuki.” Sayori: “Yes, Natsuki! We’re like a tight-knit family, and just like a family, we’ll always be there for each other. You’re not alone in this journey.” (All of a sudden, Natsuki starts to feel an intense pain in her abdomen.) Natsuki: (grimacing) “OW! Ow, ow, ow!” Yuri: “Natsuki, what’s wrong?! Are you okay?” Natsuki: “I think I’m having","output":"contractions! Sakura might be coming earlier than expected!” Monika: “Oh my goodness! We need to get you to the hospital right away. Yuri, call an ambulance!” Yuri: “On it, Monika! Natsuki, try to take slow, deep breaths. Everything will be okay.” Sayori: “Don’t worry, Natsuki. We’ll be with you every step of the way. You’re not alone in this.” (Natsuki’s friends quickly gather their things and rush her to the hospital. They stay by her side throughout her labor, offering support and encouragement. And finally, after hours of anticipation…) Doctor: “Congratulations, Natsuki! It’s a beautiful baby girl.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, doctor. Thank you, everyone. I couldn’t have done it without all of you.” Monika: “We’re so happy for you, Natsuki. Sakura is absolutely precious.” Yuri: “She really is. You’ve brought a beautiful life into this world, Natsuki. We’re all here to celebrate with you.” (Sayori hands Natsuki a bouquet of flowers.) Sayori: “Congratulations, Natsuki! May these flowers be a symbol of the love and joy this new journey brings.” Natsuki: (smiling) “Thank you, Sayori. And thank you, everyone. I couldn’t have asked for a better second family. Together, we’ll face the challenges and joys of motherhood.” (As they all gather around Natsuki and Sakura, the Literature Club members embrace each other, celebrating the arrival of the newest member of their family.)"},{"instruction":"Competencia 5: Participar en la práctica de políticas. Competencia 6: Interactuar con individuos, familias, grupos, organizaciones y comunidades. como se aplican a esta situacion:La estudiante practicante en trabajo social, asistirá al Centro de Práctica donde podrá poner en práctica sus conocimientos adquiridos y ampliarlos además, de obtener experiencia a través de la interacción con los participantes y la comunidad. Esto contribuirá al desarrollo y crecimiento profesional de esta suscribiente, y al mismo tiempo podrá aplicar las competencias necesarias para desempeñarse de manera efectiva en su área de trabajo. Hora: 8:00am - 4:00pm Tarea realizada: Esta suscribiente repaso información con la Enlace acerca de que para que exista una política publica debe haber una política social, la cual visibiliza la situación que ocurre en el país y se crea en base a ello para la policita publica. No obstante, alrededor de las 8:30am se comunico mi Enlace con la participante que atendimos el 27 de octubre de 2023, y esta suscribiente estuvo de oyente, para confirmar su asistencia a la cita en el tribunal pautada para el 10 de noviembre de 2023, a las 9:00am y esta respondió que si y le oriento que la intercesora legal le va acompañar en el proceso, la cual le expreso un comentario de que no quería hacerle daño a su pareja y que vería que pasaría, que nos causo tanto a la Enlace como a esta suscribiente la impresión de que la participante esta perdiendo el interés de mantener la orden de protección. En otro asunto, a las 8:46am, llego una participante que la Enlace atendió y esta suscribiente estuvo de oyente, la cual era una femina de 62 anos, ama de casa, residente de Gurabo, la cual tiene dos hijos el mayor que no revelo su edad que sta en Puerto Rico actualmente y su hija menor fruto de su matrimonio la cual tiene una hija de 5 anos y residen en Japón actualmente, según alego hace 9 anos descubrió unos mensajes de texto en el celular de su aun esposo que provenian de otra mujer y a raíz de eso el la rechazaba por tal razón, no tenían relaciones sexuales e incluso se divorcio recienmente por solicitud de su ex esposo por ruptura irreparable, y tenia pensado demandarlo para reclamarle bienes al ex esposo pero se recibió asesoramiento de un abogado que le oriento y le recomendó esperar las gestiones pendientes con relación a la división de la casa que esta a nombre de ambos, y tiene 90 dias para que su ex esposo le haga entrega por la cantidad de 53,000 que representa la mitad del valor de dicha casa, y nos expresó que todavía sigue viviendo en la casa que comparte con su ex esposo y tiene miedo por su seguridad dado a que se ha incrementado un ambiente hostil hacia su persona y trata de estar lo menos posible en el hogar, incluso a veces se encierra en su cuarto a aparte donde duerme hace 9 anos y alego surfrir de violencia psicológica durante todo su matrimonio pero cuando su hija se fue para Japón y su ex suegra falleció, aumentaron los episodios de maltrato psicológico hacia ella y la Enlace le oriento acerca de la Ley 54 pero la participante se negó y expreso que no quería hacerle dano a su ex esposo que confiaba mas en la justicia divina, lo que le provoca preocupación es que una vez culmine el plazo el día 14 de diciembre de 2023, no tiene donde vivir, a lo que la Enlace, le oriento que durante dicho proceso la ley la cobija mientras la casa se encuentre a nombre de ambos, en todo caso su ex esposo tendría que pedir desahucio pero debido a la escasez de hogares que existe actualmente le da oportunidad de mas tiempo para realizar gestiones de búsqueda de un lugar seguro para vivir. Partiendo de esa premisa y la información provista por la participante, la Enlace, le oriento acerca de solicitar en Vivienda pero surge de la entrevista que la participante tiene otra casa a su nombre la cual se vendio por 40,000, pero con la cláusula de alquiler con opción a compra y en ese entonces recibió 20,000 y la otra mitad el inquilino la paga por una mensualidad de 350 y todavía para completar dicho acuerdo faltan de 3 a 4 años. Por lo que, la casa todavía esta a su nombre y paga CRIM todavía razón por la cual no es elegible en Vivienda. añadió que sus ingresos además de la renta son 1,055 de seguro social y entiende que no cualifica para PAN. La enlace le oriento para verificar en Sección 8 para alquiler de casa o apartamento, y le proveyó listado de alternativas en Caguas y Gurabo, incluyendo egidas según solicito la participante para realizar las llamadas correspondientes y añadió que lleva un tiempo diligenciando con la ayuda de sus hijos y amistades, para conseguir un lugar donde vivir pero que la mayoría son personas que dividen una casa en pequeños estudios que no tienen ventilación y hay otros lugares que son para personas que casi no salen mucho y son mucho mayores que ella y se siente útil y funcional lo cual le produciría depresión esos sitios. Por mi parte cuando pude interactuar con la participante le pregunté más o menos cuanto puede pagar de alquiler de renta y esta me respondió de 350 a 400 y también me ofrecí a conseguir el número de Jardines de las Catalinas en Caguas, para validar los requisitos de elegibilidad que tengo entendido que es para personas de edad avanzada y que reciban seguro social.Luego la Enlace recapitulo toda la información y acerca de la importancia de tener la evidencia de búsqueda de un lugar donde vivir y mantenerse en contacto de surgir alguna opción y por ultimo tan pronto tengamos la información de los apartamentos de Caguas se lo comunicaremos via telefónica, nos despedimos y quedo muy agradecida por la orientación. Cabe señalar, que una vez sali del Centro de Practica logre conseguir el numero de Jardines de las Catalinas es el 787-653-6749, e incluso intente hablar con el personal de Administración personalmente, pero las gestiones fueron infructuosas, dado a que había un letrero que decía se atiende publico hasta las 2:00pm, de todos modos se le estará dando seguimiento. Por otro lado, estuve de oyente cuando la intercesora legal se comunico con mi Enlace para informarle lo ocurrido en el caso de la participante que solicito la orden de protección el pasado 27 de octubre de 2023, (la cual mencionamos al inicio), y resulto que la misma llego al tribunal acompañada por su pareja y expreso que solicito la orden de protección porque quería que se fuera del hogar, pero no quería hacerle dano porque a pesar de todo era bueno, y que no tenia interés en seguir con el caso, pero al parecer el demandado se comporto de una forma agresiva hacia la jueza y expreso que la participante reta al machismo, por lo que la jueza decidió extender la orden de protección. En otro caso, que le realizamos la entrevista inicial el 31 de octubre de 2023, a una participante, la Enlace se comunico con ella para darle seguimiento y esta suscribiente estuvo de oyente, que pase por la oficina según recomendó la intercesora legal, para que responda a la demanda de divorcio específicamente el inciso 6 y 7 que expresan acerca de su interés en obtener los muebles como el alega que todavía los paga tendría que darle dinero para quedarse con ellos y lo mismo con la guagua en o antes del 13 de noviembre de 2023. Donde acordaron que luego del trabajo el pasado 10 de noviembre de 2023, en la tarde, haría lo posible por llegar a la oficina. En la tarde, la Enlace recibió la llamada de la participante que tenia cita en el tribunal relacionado a la orden de protreccion, que mencionamos al principio,en la cual estuvos de oyente donde le expreso que recibió la llamada del personal del Municipio de Gurabo, para el puesto de ama de llaves,pero no tenia buena recepción en su teléfono e intento devolverle la llamada pero no fue psobile hablar con el personal del municipio, a lo que la Enlace le indico que le daría seguimiento y le proveyó el numero telefónico y la ubicación de la Casa de la Juventud de Gurabo, donde coordinan las entrevistas, y por ultimo, también la participante indico que solicito en la compañía de celulares SafeLink Wireless y próximamente tendrá entrevista de empleo. A las 2:45pm llego la participante relacionada con la respuesta de la demanda de divorcio y redacto el documento requerido para hacer entrega del mismo el próximo lunes, 13 de noviembre de 2023, dado a que este día no tiene transportación para hacer entrega del mismo en el tribunal. Para finalizar, el día esta suscribiente comenzó la lectura de la Ley 121, de la Carta de Derechos y la Política Publica del Gobierno a favor de los Adultos Mayores, expedida el 1 de agosto de 2019, donde se hizo resumen de la exposición de motivos, donde dice y cito: “Los adultos mayores requieren atención y protección del Estado, sus múltiples necesidades. El compromiso de esta Administración con esta población quedo plasmada en el Plan de Puerto Rico, programa de gobierno avalado en las pasadas elecciones de noviembre de 2016”. Luego el 2 de enero de 2017 se asumió las riendas de Puerto Rico, presentando la prioridad al mejoramiento de esta población y se presento legislación para crear programas dirigidos a identificar oficinas donde se le ofrezcan servicios a esta población, mas tarde se creo la Ley 58 del 2018, que incluía unos programas que atendieran las necesidades de los adultos mayores, como transportacioin, cuidado personal, rehabilitación, consejería, programas de nutrición, apoyo psicosocial, manejo de condiciones medicas, incentivos económicos entre otros. Para finalizar, se enfatiza en el desarrollo de actividades y acciones que contribuyen a mantener la capacidad máxima de la independencia física, mental y social dentro del ámbito familiar, económico, y social lo que es esencial para lograr su bienestar y participación en la comunidad.","output":"La Competencia 5: Participar en la práctica de políticas se aplica en esta situación a través de la interacción de la estudiante practicante con la Enlace y la participante, donde se discuten y se ofrecen orientaciones acerca de las leyes y políticas relacionadas con el caso de la participante.

You seem a little lost in thought.” Natsuki: “Oh, hey everyone. I was just…thinking about some things. You know, life stuff.” Monika: “Life stuff? What kind of things are you thinking about, Natsuki?” Natsuki: “Well, I’ve been thinking a lot about the future lately. As you all know, I’m expecting a baby girl, Sakura, in just a few weeks. And I can’t help but worry if I’ll be able to handle everything as a single mother.” Yuri: “I can understand why you might feel overwhelmed, Natsuki. Bringing a child into the world is a big responsibility, especially when you’re doing it on your own. But remember, you have all of us here to support you.” Sayori: “That’s right, Natsuki! We’re like a little family in this club, and we’ll always be here for you. Whether it’s helping you with baby preparations or simply being a listening ear, you can count on us.” Natsuki: (smiling) “Thank you, guys. That means a lot to me. I know I can always rely on you, and it’s comforting to know that I have such a supportive club as my second family.” Monika: “Absolutely, Natsuki. We’re here to help in any way we can. Have you thought about what kind of support system you might need once Sakura arrives?” Natsuki: “Yes, I have. I’ve been doing some research and reaching out to various resources for single mothers. There are some local support groups and organizations I can turn to for guidance and assistance.” Yuri: “That’s a great idea, Natsuki. Surrounding yourself with people who understand and have experienced similar situations can be incredibly helpful. It’s important to remember that you don’t have to do everything on your own.” Sayori: “And don’t forget about your friends, too! We’ll be here every step of the way. If you ever need a helping hand, someone to babysit, or even just a break from it all, don’t hesitate to ask.” (Natsuki becomes visibly touched by her friends’ words, feeling a surge of gratitude and relief.)

You’re strong and capable, and we know you’ll be a wonderful mother to Sakura.” Yuri: “And remember, don’t hesitate to ask for help when you need it. It’s not a sign of weakness, but rather a recognition of your own limitations. We’re here to lighten your load whenever you need it.” Sayori: “That’s right, Natsuki! Parenting can be tough, but with the support of your friends and the resources available to you, you’ll navigate through it just fine. And don’t forget to take care of yourself too, okay? You deserve some self-care amidst all the responsibilities.” Natsuki: “Thank you, Sayori. I’ll make sure to prioritize self-care as well. Taking care of myself will ultimately allow me to take better care of Sakura too.” Monika: “That’s a healthy mindset, Natsuki. Balancing your own well-being with your responsibilities as a mother is crucial. Remember, you deserve happiness and fulfillment in your own life as well.” Natsuki: “You’re right, Monika. It’s important for me to continue pursuing my passions and hobbies, even after Sakura arrives. It’ll help me maintain a sense of identity and fulfillment outside of being a mother.” Yuri: “And if you need any recommendations for relaxation or self-care activities, Natsuki, I’m more than happy to share some of the literature I’ve come across. Engaging in soothing activities like reading or writing can be a form of self-care too.” Sayori: “I can help with that too, Natsuki!

Remember, being a mother is a beautiful journey, and while there may be challenges along the way, the love and joy you’ll experience with Sakura will far outweigh any hardships.” Yuri: “And don’t hesitate to lean on us whenever you need emotional support or simply someone to talk to. We care about you deeply, Natsuki.” Sayori: “Yes, Natsuki! We’re like a tight-knit family, and just like a family, we’ll always be there for each other.

Furthermore, my commitment to fostering meaningful connections extends beyond personal endeavors. I proudly played a pivotal role in introducing my brother to a remarkable woman, which ultimately led to their marriage. Witnessing the union of two souls solidified my belief in the power of forging meaningful relationships and the impact they have on one’s personal growth and happiness. My newly acquired dual nationality travels, and experiences have instilled within me a deep sense of dedication and passion in everything I pursue. Whether it is my personal life, professional endeavors, or interactions with diverse individuals, I approach each opportunity with unwavering commitment and enthusiasm. It is this inherent drive that fuels my desire to continue exploring, learning, and making a positive impact in various aspects of my life. Work experience and qualifications Throughout the last 5 years, I have had the privilege of undertaking various roles and acquiring a diverse skill set.

Don’t worry if you’ll not be able to take care of her as a single mother…and focus on bringing her into the world.” Sayori: (walking into the clubroom with the other club members) “Hey Natsuki, what’s on your mind? You seem a little lost in thought.” Natsuki: “Oh, hey everyone. I was just…thinking about some things. You know, life stuff.” Monika: “Life stuff? What kind of things are you thinking about, Natsuki?” Natsuki: “Well, I’ve been thinking a lot about the future lately. As you all know, I’m expecting a baby girl, Sakura, in just a few weeks. And I can’t help but worry if I’ll be able to handle everything as a single mother.” Yuri: “I can understand why you might feel overwhelmed, Natsuki. Bringing a child into the world is a big responsibility, especially when you’re doing it on your own. But remember, you have all of us here to support you.” Sayori: “That’s right, Natsuki! We’re like a little family in this club, and we’ll always be here for you. Whether it’s helping you with baby preparations or simply being a listening ear, you can count on us.” Natsuki: (smiling) “Thank you, guys. That means a lot to me. I know I can always rely on you, and it’s comforting to know that I have such a supportive club as my second family.” Monika: “Absolutely, Natsuki. We’re here to help in any way we can. Have you thought about what kind of support system you might need once Sakura arrives?” Natsuki: “Yes, I have. I’ve been doing some research and reaching out to various resources for single mothers. There are some local support groups and organizations I can turn to for guidance and assistance.” Yuri: “That’s a great idea, Natsuki. Surrounding yourself with people who understand and have experienced similar situations can be incredibly helpful. It’s important to remember that you don’t have to do everything on your own.” Sayori: “And don’t forget about your friends, too! We’ll be here every step of the way. If you ever need a helping hand, someone to babysit, or even just a break from it all, don’t hesitate to ask.” (Natsuki becomes visibly touched by her friends’ words, feeling a surge of gratitude and relief.) Natsuki: “Thank you, everyone. I can’t express how much it means to me to have all of your support. It’s reassuring to know that I don’t have to face this on my own. With all of you by my side, I feel more confident about becoming a mother.” Monika: “We believe in you, Natsuki. You’re strong and capable, and we know you’ll be a wonderful mother to Sakura.” Yuri: “And remember, don’t hesitate to ask for help when you need it. It’s not a sign of weakness, but rather a recognition of your own limitations. We’re here to lighten your load whenever you need it.” Sayori: “That’s right, Natsuki! Parenting can be tough, but with the support of your friends and the resources available to you, you’ll navigate through it just fine. And don’t forget to take care of yourself too, okay? You deserve some self-care amidst all the responsibilities.” Natsuki: “Thank you, Sayori. I’ll make sure to prioritize self-care as well. Taking care of myself will ultimately allow me to take better care of Sakura too.” Monika: “That’s a healthy mindset, Natsuki. Balancing your own well-being with your responsibilities as a mother is crucial. Remember, you deserve happiness and fulfillment in your own life as well.” Natsuki: “You’re right, Monika. It’s important for me to continue pursuing my passions and hobbies, even after Sakura arrives. It’ll help me maintain a sense of identity and fulfillment outside of being a mother.” Yuri: “And if you need any recommendations for relaxation or self-care activities, Natsuki, I’m more than happy to share some of the literature I’ve come across. Engaging in soothing activities like reading or writing can be a form of self-care too.” Sayori: “I can help with that too, Natsuki! If you ever want to go on walks or enjoy some nature, I’m always up for it. Sometimes a change of scenery and fresh air can do wonders for the mind and soul.” Natsuki: “Thank you, guys. I really appreciate all your suggestions and support. I’m feeling a lot more optimistic now, knowing that I have such amazing friends who have my back.” Monika: “We’ll always be here for you, Natsuki. Remember, being a mother is a beautiful journey, and while there may be challenges along the way, the love and joy you’ll experience with Sakura will far outweigh any hardships.” Yuri: “And don’t hesitate to lean on us whenever you need emotional support or simply someone to talk to. We care about you deeply, Natsuki.” Sayori: “Yes, Natsuki! We’re like a tight-knit family, and just like a family, we’ll always be there for each other. You’re not alone in this journey.” (All of a sudden, Natsuki starts to feel an intense pain in her abdomen.) Natsuki: (grimacing) “OW! Ow, ow, ow!” Yuri: “Natsuki, what’s wrong?! Are you okay?” Natsuki: “I think I’m having contractions! Sakura might be coming earlier than expected!” Monika: “Oh my goodness! We need to get you to the hospital right away. Yuri, call an ambulance!” Yuri: “On it, Monika! Natsuki, try to take slow, deep breaths. Everything will be okay.” Sayori: “Don’t worry, Natsuki. We’ll be with you every step of the way.

مجرای ادراری: اگر جریان ادرار بر روی پروستات قطع شود یا مانعی وجود داشته باشد، احتمال التهاب پروستات افزایش می‌یابد. به طور معمول، استفراغ کامل و منظم ادرار به جراحی‌های پروستات، تضعیف عضلات ضامنه مجرای ادراری یا تشدید بنیادی پرابلم ارتباط دارد. 3. تهوع ناشی از خواب طولانی و عدم عدم جنسی: انواع تجربیات به تاخیر در خلاصه‌سازی اسپرم و افزایش استرس پروستاتی منجر می‌شود. 4. ترویج افزایش خلوص تک

(about 2000 words)","output":"The statutory indoor management rule, also known as the rule in Turquand's case, is a common law doctrine that aims to protect third-party outsiders who engage in business transactions with a company. It provides that a person dealing with a company in good faith and without knowledge of any irregularities in its internal affairs is entitled to assume that the company's internal procedures have been duly complied with. The rule originated from the 1856 case of Royal British Bank v Turquand, where a creditor sought to hold the company liable for the repayment of an unauthorized loan. The court held that the creditor was entitled to assume that the company's internal procedures had been followed, based on the principle that people dealing with a company should not be required to investigate its internal affairs. While the rule is a valuable protection for third parties, it raises important questions about the balance it strikes between the interests of these outsiders and the interests of the company's shareholders and creditors. Firstly, it is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of the rule in achieving its intended purpose of protecting third parties. The rule operates on the assumption that third-party creditors and other contractual counterparts should be able to rely on the apparent authority of the company's directors or officers. This reliance allows for efficient business transactions, as it prevents the need for extensive due diligence or investigation into the company's internal workings. In practice, the rule has been applied quite broadly, encompassing even cases where the internal procedures of the company were not properly followed. This expansive application serves to protect third parties from being disadvantaged by the internal governance shortcomings of the company. It provides a sense of security to those engaging with a company that they will not be held responsible for the company's internal irregularities. However, this broad application of the rule also raises concerns. It potentially absolves third parties of their duty to exercise reasonable care and diligence in dealing with a company. By allowing third parties to rely solely on the apparent authority of the company's directors or officers, the rule might encourage a lack of prudence in business transactions. This, in turn, could lead to an increased risk of fraud or abuse in dealings with the company. Moreover, the rule assumes that the company's internal procedures are, in fact, properly adhered to. This assumption might not always reflect the reality of a company's internal governance. Instances of corporate misconduct, such as director misbehaviors and breaches of fiduciary duties, can undermine the trust placed in the apparent authority of a company's officers. Third parties could thus inadvertently become entangled in fraudulent or unauthorized actions. These concerns highlight the need for a balance to be struck between the interests of third-party outsiders and the interests of the company's shareholders and creditors. While the rule seeks to protect third parties, it should not unreasonably burden the company's shareholders or creditors. To address these concerns, certain limitations on the rule have been developed through case law and statutory provisions. For example, in the UK, the Companies Act 2006 introduced the concept of \\"constructive notice\\" for certain irregularities in a company's internal affairs. If third parties have access to the relevant public registry, such as the Companies House, they are deemed to have knowledge of any publicly available information about the company. This places an additional burden on third parties to exercise due diligence and investigate the company before engaging in transactions. Furthermore, the rule is subject to exceptions for situations where a third party has knowledge or notice of irregularities. If a third party is aware or should reasonably be aware that there are issues with the company's internal governance, they cannot rely on the apparent authority of the company's officers. The burden is then shifted back to the third party to conduct the necessary investigations or take precautions before entering into any transactions with the company. In conclusion, the statutory indoor management rule aims to strike a balance between the interests of third-party outsiders and the interests of the company's shareholders and creditors. While it provides a valuable protection to those engaging in business with a company, it also raises concerns about the potential lack of prudence and reliance on apparent authority. To address these concerns, limitations and exceptions have been developed to ensure that the rule does not unreasonably burden the company's stakeholders. Although the rule is not perfect, it represents an essential framework for facilitating efficient business transactions while reducing the risk of harm to third parties."},{"instruction":"using 2000 words to critically analyse and evaluate (by reference to primary and secondary sources) the statutory indoor management rule, including whether it strikes the right balance between the interests of third party “outsiders” that deal with a company and the interests of the company’s shareholders and creditors.","output":"Title: Striking the Balance: Evaluating the Statutory Indoor Management Rule's Impact on Third Party Outsiders and Company Stakeholders Introduction: The statutory indoor management rule, commonly known as the rule in Turquand's case, seeks to protect third party outsiders who engage in business transactions with a company. This analysis will critically examine and evaluate the effectiveness of the rule in striking the right balance between the interests of these third party \\"outsiders\\" and the interests of the company's shareholders and creditors. Through the examination of primary and secondary sources, this essay will assess the rule's impact on business transactions and the potential risks and benefits it poses to both outsiders and company stakeholders. 1. Background and Premise of the Rule: 1.1 Overview of the Turquand Case: The Royal British Bank v Turquand case in 1856 established the rule, wherein a creditor sought to hold the company liable for an unauthorized loan. The court held that third parties dealing in good faith and without knowledge of any internal irregularities can assume the company's internal procedures have been complied with. 1.2 Assertion of Efficiency and Avoidance of Investigation: The rule, based on principles of commercial convenience and efficiency, eases the burden on third parties by allowing them to rely on apparent authority, maintaining a level of trust and facilitating smooth business transactions. 1.3 Protection of Outsiders' Interests: The rule aims to safeguard outsiders from being penalized for the internal governance shortcomings of the company, ensuring they are not unfairly disadvantaged or burdened by the company's actions. 2. The Effectiveness of the Rule in Protecting Third Party Outsiders: 2.1 Broad Application of the Rule: While the broad application of the rule provides significant protection to third parties, it potentially absolves them of their duty to exercise reasonable care and diligence while engaging with a company. This may lead to a lack of prudence and an increased risk of fraud or unauthorized actions. 2.2 Potential Inadvertent Involvement in Fraudulent Actions: The rule's reliance on the assumption that internal procedures have been followed may be undermined by instances of corporate misconduct, leaving third parties entangled in fraudulent practices. This highlights the need to strike a balance between protection and reasonable precautions. 3. The Balance between Third Party Outsiders and Company Stakeholders: 3.1 Burden on Shareholders and Creditors: Striking a balance requires ensuring that the rule does not unreasonably burden company shareholders and creditors. Without limitations and exceptions, the interests of the company's stakeholders may be overridden, potentially leading to the erosion of shareholder value or creating financial risks for creditors. 4. Limitations on the Rule: 4.1 Constructive Notice: The Companies Act 2006 introduced the concept of \\"constructive notice,\\" whereby third parties have access to publicly available information about the company through the Companies House. This shifts the burden back to third parties to exercise due diligence and investigate the company before engaging in transactions. 4.2 Exceptions based on Knowledge or Notice: The rule contains exceptions for situations in which third parties have knowledge or should reasonably have notice of irregularities. In such cases, third parties must take necessary precautions or conduct investigations before entering into transactions. 5. Evaluating the Effectiveness of Limitations: 5.1 Balancing Protection and Responsibility: The limitations and exceptions provide a mechanism to ensure third parties do not exploit the rule, striking a better balance between protecting outsiders and holding them accountable for their due diligence. 5.2 Potential Limitations of Publicly Available Information: While constructive notice requires third parties to access publicly available information, this may not provide a complete picture of a company's internal affairs. Over-reliance on such information may still expose third parties to risks. 5.3 Evolutionary Nature of the Rule: The rule's application and limitations have been shaped by subsequent case law and statutory provisions, reflecting a continual attempt to strike a better balance and adapt to changing business and legal environments. Conclusion: The statutory indoor management rule, while seeking to strike a balance between the interests of third-party outsiders and company shareholders and creditors, raises several critical issues. Its broad application protects third parties but potentially reduces prudence and increases the risk of fraudulent actions. The limitations and exceptions, such as constructive notice and knowledge-based exceptions, attempt to address these issues by reinstating a level of responsibility on third parties. Through the evaluation of primary and secondary sources, it becomes apparent that while the rule enhances business transaction efficiency and prevents unfair disadvantage of third parties, continuous adaptation and refinement are necessary to strike the optimal balance between the different interests involved."},{"instruction":"using System.Collections; using System.Collections.Generic; using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.SceneManagement; public class MarioController : MonoBehaviour { public float moveSpeed = 5f; public float jumpForce = 5f; public float ladderClimbSpeed = 2f; public int maxHealth = 3; private int currentHealth; private bool grounded; private bool onLadder; private bool climbingLadder; private Vector2 direction; private Rigidbody2D rb2d; private new Collider2D collider; private Collider2D[] results; private int currentSceneIndex; private ScoreCounter scoreCounter; public float hammerDuration = 9f; private bool isHammerActive; private float hammerTimer; private static int previousScore = 0; private static int previousSceneIndex = 0; [Header(\\"Effects\\")] [Tooltip(\\"The effect to create when colliding with Hammer\\")] public GameObject hammerEffect; private void Awake() { rb2d = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>(); collider = GetComponent<Collider2D>(); results = new Collider2D[4]; } private void Start() { currentHealth = maxHealth; currentSceneIndex = SceneManager.GetActiveScene().buildIndex; scoreCounter = FindObjectOfType<ScoreCounter>(); if (previousSceneIndex == 0 || previousSceneIndex == 1) { scoreCounter.score = previousScore; } } private void CheckCollision() { grounded = false; onLadder = false; Vector2 size = collider.bounds.size; size.y += 0.1f; size.x /= 2f; int amount = Physics2D.OverlapBoxNonAlloc(transform.position, size, 0f, results); for (int i = 0; i < amount; i++) { GameObject hit = results[i].gameObject; if (hit.layer == LayerMask.NameToLayer(\\"Platform\\")) { grounded = hit.transform.position.y < (transform.position.y - 0.5f); } else if (hit.layer == LayerMask.NameToLayer(\\"Ladder\\")) { onLadder = true; } } } private void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision) { if (collision.gameObject.layer == LayerMask.NameToLayer(\\"Barrel\\") && isHammerActive) { Destroy(collision.gameObject); scoreCounter.score += 200; } else if (collision.gameObject.layer == LayerMask.NameToLayer(\\"Hammer\\")) { Destroy(collision.gameObject); ActivateHammer(); if (hammerEffect != null) { Instantiate(hammerEffect, transform.position, transform.rotation, null); } } else if (collision.gameObject.layer == LayerMask.NameToLayer(\\"Barrel\\")) { currentHealth--; ResetScene(); } else if (collision.gameObject.layer == LayerMask.NameToLayer(\\"Win\\")) { scoreCounter.score += 500; SceneManager.LoadScene(\\"_Scene_DonkeyKong25M\\"); } } private void ResetScene() { previousScore = scoreCounter.score; previousSceneIndex = currentSceneIndex; if (currentSceneIndex == 0) { SceneManager.LoadScene(\\"_Scene_DonkeyKong25M2\\"); } else if (currentSceneIndex == 1) { SceneManager.LoadScene(\\"_Scene_DonkeyKong25M3\\"); } else if (currentSceneIndex == 2) { SceneManager.LoadScene(\\"_Scene_DonkeyKong25M\\"); } } private void ActivateHammer() { isHammerActive = true; hammerTimer = hammerDuration; } private void ResetHammer() { isHammerActive = false; } private void Update() { CheckCollision(); if (isHammerActive) { hammerTimer -= Time.deltaTime; if (hammerTimer <= 0) { ResetHammer(); } } if (grounded && Input.GetButtonDown(\\"Jump\\")) { rb2d.velocity = new Vector2(rb2d.velocity.x, jumpForce); } float movement = Input.GetAxis(\\"Horizontal\\"); if (grounded) { direction.y = Mathf.Max(direction.y, -1f); climbingLadder = false; } if (onLadder && Input.GetButton(\\"Vertical\\")) { climbingLadder = true; float climbDirection = Input.GetAxis(\\"Vertical\\"); rb2d.velocity = new Vector2(0, climbDirection * ladderClimbSpeed); rb2d.gravityScale = 0f; } else if (climbingLadder) { rb2d.gravityScale = 1f; rb2d.velocity = new Vector2(rb2d.velocity.x, 0f); rb2d.constraints = RigidbodyConstraints2D.FreezePositionX; } else { rb2d.gravityScale = 1f; rb2d.constraints = RigidbodyConstraints2D.FreezeRotation; } rb2d.velocity = new Vector2(movement * moveSpeed, rb2d.velocity.y); if (movement > 0) { transform.localScale = new Vector3(1f, 1f, 1f); } else if (movement < 0) { transform.localScale = new Vector3(-1f, 1f, 1f); } } } using System.Collections; using System.Collections.Generic; using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.UI; //This line enables use of uGUI classes like Text. public class ScoreCounter : MonoBehaviour { [Header(\\"Dynamic\\")] public int score = 0; private Text uiText; // Start is called before the first frame update void Start() { uiText = GetComponent<Text>(); } // Update is called once per frame void Update() { uiText.text = score.ToString(\\"Score:#,0\\"); //This 0 is a zero!

However, it's important to note that these tactics are unethical and can lead to negative consequences. Here are a few examples: 1. Spamming: Bad actors can use automated tools to send mass emails or messages to unsuspecting users, promoting their products or services. They often target a large number of recipients in the hopes that a small percentage will convert to sales. 2. Fake reviews: Automation can be employed to generate fake positive reviews for products or services. By using bots or automated scripts, bad actors can flood review websites or social media platforms with positive feedback, falsely boosting their reputation. 3. Click fraud: Automation can be used to generate fraudulent clicks on online ads, making it seem like there is genuine interest in a product or service. This can lead to inflated click-through rates, leading advertisers to invest more money in campaigns that don't yield actual customers. 4. Price manipulation: Bad actors may use automation to manipulate prices on an e-commerce platform. By automatically adjusting prices based on demand, they can create an artificial sense of urgency or scarcity to trick buyers into making purchases. 5. Ad targeting abuse: Automation can help bad actors target specific demographics with deceptive or misleading advertisements. By leveraging automated tools, they can reach vulnerable or easily manipulated individuals, increasing the likelihood of sales. It's important to remember that these techniques are unethical and often illegal. Businesses and consumers should be vigilant and report any suspicious or deceptive practices to the appropriate authorities."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},q={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},H=["disabled"],z={key:0},j={key:1};function E(i,e,h,p,n,s){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",q,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",D,' No results found for "'+u(n.searchQuery)+'".
