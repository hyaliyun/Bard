Estas dos palabras van de la mano y son la base de cualquier relación sólida y duradera. En primer lugar, quiero expresar lo hermoso que es creer en la palabra de alguien que amamos. Cuando confiamos plenamente en esa persona especial, nos abrimos de manera completa y sin reservas. Creer en el otro implica tener la certeza de que siempre actuará con honestidad, respeto y sinceridad hacia nosotros. Es saber que podemos contar con su apoyo incondicional, ya sea en momentos de felicidad o dificultad. La confianza es un puente que nos conecta emocionalmente. Cuando confiamos en alguien, nos sentimos seguros y protegidos. Nos permite compartir nuestros pensamientos más profundos, nuestros miedos y nuestros sueños. Es un sentimiento que nos da la libertad de ser nosotros mismos, sin temor al juicio o la traición. Sin embargo, la confianza no se construye de la noche a la mañana. Es un proceso que requiere tiempo, paciencia y esfuerzo mutuo. Cada acción, cada promesa cumplida, cada palabra honesta, fortalece los cimientos de nuestra relación. Es importante recordar que la confianza es frágil y debe alimentarse continuamente. En este sentido, la sinceridad juega un papel fundamental. Decir siempre la verdad, incluso en situaciones difíciles, es esencial para mantener la confianza. La sinceridad nos permite ser auténticos y transparentes en nuestros sentimientos, pensamientos y acciones. Es reconocer que somos imperfectos, pero que estamos dispuestos a aprender y crecer juntos. Creer en la palabra de alguien implica también demostrar a través de nuestros actos que somos dignos de confianza. No basta con decir \\"te amo\\" o \\"confío en ti\\", sino que nuestras acciones deben respaldar esas palabras. Debemos ser consecuentes con lo que decimos y hacerlo de corazón. En nuestro día a día, es fácil dejarse llevar por la rutina y olvidar la importancia de estas palabras: amor, confianza, sinceridad. Pero recordemos que son el motor que impulsa nuestra relación y nos permite superar cualquier obstáculo que se presente en el camino. Así que, mi querida Rose, te invito a seguir construyendo juntos una relación basada en el amor y la confianza. Prometo ser siempre sincero contigo, decirte la verdad y demostrarte a través de mis acciones que eres lo más importante en mi vida. Confío en ti y en nosotros, y me siento afortunado de tener a alguien tan maravillosa como tú a mi lado. Te abrazo con todo mi amor, [Tu nombre]"},{"instruction":"Necesito una carta de 6 parafos largos donde le hablamos a rose de la importancia del amor y la confianza en nuestro dia a dia y lo hermoso que es creer en la palabra de alguien que amas y lo importante que siempre es decir la verdad.","output":"Querida Rose, En el transcurso de nuestras vidas, nos encontramos con muchas relaciones, pero hay algo especial en la nuestra. Quiero hablar contigo sobre la importancia del amor y la confianza en nuestra vida cotidiana. Son dos pilares fundamentales que nos han guiado hasta aquí y que seguirán sosteniendo nuestra relación en el futuro. El amor es un sentimiento poderoso y transformador. Nos da fuerza, nos inspira y nos permite crecer juntos. Es el motor que impulsa nuestras acciones y decisiones diarias. El amor nos brinda un sentido de pertenencia, afecto y conexión profunda con alguien. En nuestra relación, el amor es lo que nos une y nos permite superar cualquier obstáculo que se presente en el camino. Junto al amor, viene la confianza. Es una base sólida que construimos día a día. La confianza nos permite sentirnos seguros y tranquilos en la relación. Es creer en la palabra de alguien que amamos, sabiendo que siempre actuará de manera honesta y respetuosa hacia nosotros. La confianza es un lazo que se fortalece con el tiempo y requiere de compromiso y lealtad mutua. En este sentido, la sinceridad es una virtud esencial. Decir siempre la verdad, incluso en los momentos difíciles, es una manera de nutrir la confianza en nuestra relación. La sinceridad nos permite construir un ambiente de transparencia y apertura, donde ambos nos sentimos libres de expresar nuestras emociones y pensamientos más profundos. Es importante recordar que el amor no se trata solo de palabras, sino también de acciones. Es un compromiso diario de cuidar y nutrir nuestra relación. Es necesario demostrar a través de nuestros actos que somos dignos de confianza y que valoramos la honestidad en nuestras interacciones. En nuestro día a día, puede resultar tentador dejar de lado la importancia del amor y la confianza debido a las distracciones y responsabilidades. Sin embargo, no debemos olvidar que son fundamentales para mantener una relación sana y sólida. Dejémonos guiar por estos valores y recordemos siempre su belleza y significado.

Creer en la palabra de alguien que amamos y ser sinceros en nuestras acciones y pensamientos fortalecerá la conexión que hemos construido.

His father, a human security guard, and his mother, a minotaur blacksmith, were both hardworking individuals who instilled in him a strong moral compass and a sense of responsibility. Magnus inherited his mother's large frame, which made him a natural fit for a career in security. Starting as a security guard for a local merchant guild, Magnus's dedication and commitment saw him rise quickly through the ranks. However, life had other plans for him when an unforeseen series of events led to him accumulating a substantial amount of debt. Struggling to make ends meet, he found himself consistently falling behind in his repayments. Feeling desperate, Magnus turned to one of his contacts, a fellow guard who had ties to the criminal underworld. This contact encouraged Magnus to join \\"The Orchard,\\" a notorious criminal organization known for its high-risk, high-reward assignments. They assured him that completing their missions would enable him to swiftly repay his debts and regain his financial stability. Initially hesitant about becoming involved with such nefarious activities, Magnus weighed his options. As a contemplative individual, he understood that sometimes circumstances can push people to extremes. Determined to set things right, he swallowed his reservations and sought out The Orchard, hoping their offers of good money would indeed pave the way for a brighter future. Accepted into the organization, Magnus embarked on his first assignment with a mix of nervousness and determination. The mission required him to infiltrate a noble's mansion under the pretense of a security expert, securing secret documents. His imposing stature and disciplined demeanor earned him the respect and trust of his new companions within The Orchard, and they worked together seamlessly to achieve their objectives. Despite his physical prowess, Magnus remained calm and introspective, always seeking logical solutions and avoiding unnecessary conflict whenever possible. He relied on his sharp instincts and ability to work well with others to ensure the success of each mission he undertook. The more he delved into the criminal underworld, the more he realized the importance of maintaining his own moral code, avoiding unnecessary harm, and striving for justice even within the confines of his new occupation. Magnus Thornhelm's journey with The Orchard would continue, each assignment testing his resolve and pushing him further toward unravelling the secrets of his own lineage.

You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes an Asian-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt who claims that she won't let the returning woman enter if the returning woman won't clarify and explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she pooped her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in her reaction to this taunting. The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering. The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants. The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, complaining to the aunt about the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants, and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman acknowledges the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"Title: Unexpected Relief Genre: Comedy-Drama TV Series Background: Our TV series revolves around the lives of two Asian-American women, Emma Park and her eccentric aunt, Margaret Lee. Emma, a free-spirited and independent woman in her thirties, shares an apartment with her aunt. Margaret is in her fifties, full of energy, and a constant source of amusement and embarrassment for Emma. Scene: Emma's Desperate Situation INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - EVENING Emma Park, a petite Asian-American woman in her early thirties, wearing casual pants and a flowy blouse, rushes down the hallway of her apartment building. She clutches her stomach and looks distressed. EMMA (to herself, urgent) Oh no, oh no! Gotta find the key! Her face twists with urgency. She quickly reaches her door, only to frantically search for her house key. EMMA (whispering) Come on, where is it? Emma's panic rises as she realizes her key is nowhere to be found. She quickly pulls out her phone and dials her flatmate's number. EMMA (phone, panicked) Jen! Pick up! I need to get in! There is no answer. Emma paces nervously, then starts pounding on the door. EMMA (desperate, shouting) Jen! Open the door, please! Suddenly, Emma hears a groggy voice from inside the apartment. AUNT MARGARET (O.S.) (sleepy) What's happening out there? Emma's eyes widen, and she urgently shouts. EMMA (to herself) Oh no, not Aunt Margaret! Emma continues to knock on the door, her desperation reaching its peak. EMMA (hysterical) Aunt Margaret, it's me, open the door! Please hurry! INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Aunt Margaret, a slightly disheveled yet elegant woman in her fifties, rubs her eyes as she approaches the door. AUNT MARGARET (yawning) Emma? What's all the fuss? Aunt Margaret begins to unlock the door, but her tiredness slows her down. EMMA (hysterical) Hurry, Aunt Margaret, please! As the door finally opens, Emma's composure falters. The sight that greets Aunt Margaret is unexpected, to say the least. INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS As the door opens wider, Aunt Margaret's eyes widen in confusion. AUNT MARGARET (perplexed) Emma, what on earth... A moment of silence hangs between them as Emma continues to relieve herself in her pants, an expression of both relief and embarrassment on her face. The aunt's nose wriggles in response to the unpleasant odor. AUNT MARGARET (disgusted) Emma, why are you... pooping your pants? Emma tries to silence Aunt Margaret with a hand gesture, but she can't hide the truth any longer. Sheepishly, she nods and softly admits to her accident. EMMA (whispering) Yes, Aunt Margaret, I... I pooped my pants. Aunt Margaret bursts into laughter, finding the situation utterly absurd and amusing. AUNT MARGARET (teasingly) I can't believe my sophisticated niece just pooped her pants! Oh, you're in real diapers now! Emma, initially indignant, starts to loosen up and playfully sulks in response. EMMA (mocking frustration) Oh, it's all your fault! You took too long to open the door! Aunt Margaret playfully denies any responsibility, rolling her eyes. AUNT MARGARET (mockingly) Blaming me won't clean up that mess, dear! The returning woman finally decides to head to the bathroom. EMMA (whining) I really need to clean up, Aunt Margaret. Aunt Margaret teasingly waves her hand, reacting to the lingering smell. AUNT MARGARET (teasing) Yes, you certainly do! Whew! Go get yourself cleaned up, stinky! Emma, playing along, coyly acknowledges the teasing while alluding to her poop-filled pants. EMMA (coyly) Well, you did have a front-row seat to the show, didn't you? Aunt Margaret grins mischievously, mocking her niece. AUNT MARGARET (teasing) Oh, the smell says it all! Don't try to pin this on me, darling. Chuckling, Emma waddles past Aunt Margaret and heads to the bathroom. EMMA (playfully) Fine, fine! I'll go take a shower, you big tease! As she cackles and scrunches her nose at the smell, Aunt Margaret playfully waves her away. AUNT MARGARET (teasingly) Hurry up, my little smelly disaster! And don't forget to throw those pants away! They exchange playful banter until Emma finally disappears into the bathroom, leaving Aunt Margaret laughing by the doorway.

Here are a few possibilities: 1. Philanthropic Ventures: A good-hearted character may have invested a significant amount of their own wealth into charitable causes, such as building orphanages, healthcare institutions, or supporting those in need. However, the expenses associated with these endeavors, as well as unexpected complications, can quickly accumulate debt. 2. Noble Obligations: Some good characters may come from noble backgrounds, with aristocratic families expecting them to maintain a certain lifestyle and uphold family responsibilities. These obligations may involve hefty expenses such as funding public events, organizing elaborate feasts, or participating in costly tournaments, leaving the character in a financial bind. 3. Business Ventures: A well-intentioned character may have tried their hand at entrepreneurship or invested in a promising start-up business with the purpose of creating jobs and positively impacting the local economy. If the venture fails or encounters unexpected difficulties, it can generate significant debts that the character must repay. 4. Oaths and Promises: A good character might have made a promise or oath to someone in need, vowing to support or protect them regardless of the cost. In fulfilling this commitment, they may have incurred substantial expenses, such as medical bills, legal fees, or even paying off debts owed by the person they are helping. 5. Ransoms and Rescues: Sometimes, a good character might find themselves needing to pay a ransom or negotiate the release of innocent captives. Whether their own family members, townsfolk held by bandits, or prisoners of war, these situations can lead to significant payments that can accumulate debt rapidly. 6. Failed Investments: In exceptional cases, even the most well-intentioned character might have fallen prey to deceitful schemes or unethical investment opportunities. As a result, they could find themselves in significant debt due to scams or the failure of investments that were meant to benefit others. Remember that debt can also serve as an interesting plot hook and an opportunity for character development, driving the character on quests to find solutions, negotiate agreements, or seek out rare treasures to repay their debts."},{"instruction":"I want you to act as a professional screenwriter who specializes in writing creative, inventive and elaborate screenplays.

O Ministro da Defesa propôs um ataque direto ao esconderijo de Kayto, alegando que essa seria a única maneira de garantir a segurança da princesa.

It is recommended that the deaths be disguised as unrelated incidents whenever possible, with consideration for the morale impact on surrounding personnel. SCP-835-JP \\"Keteru Yamiko\\" has been neutralized by Protocol Idol-835, described below. The possibility of strengthening containment by expanding the scope of the protocol outside the Foundation is currently being studied in order to prepare for potential containment breaches that could result from a major cognitohazard or similar incidents within the Foundation. Description: SCP-835-JP is described as a teenage girl with long black hair who wears mainly black school uniforms, named Keteru Yamiko. Although her age and appearance may increase or decrease in about 10 years, and she can wear clothing that is not a student uniform, she is generally considered \\"attractive\\". Her character is often described as melancholic due to her taciturnity and lack of emotional ups and downs, and she greatly dislikes the idea of ​​others seeing her. \\"Keteru Yamiko\\" can teleport from one dark area to another regardless of distance or obstructions; she utilizes this ability to approach, attack, and kill targets quickly with a large kitchen knife in her possession. She is also said to have the ability to control darkness at will, engulfing objects and making them disappear, although the principle behind this is unknown. Due to her abilities, she was kidnapped and raised as an assassin by a Group of Interest that is hostile to the Foundation, and it is believed that this is how her current personality was formed. Further detailed information about \\"Keteru Yamiko\\" is available in its dedicated archive. SCP-835-JP was originally a phenomenon that occurred only to the Foundation personnel, first identified in 19██. The phenomenon occurs in a cycle of about 1 to 3 months, and the subject who encounters it disappears from the place in a few seconds to a dozen, with a large amount of blood left behind. No subject, dead or alive, has ever been rediscovered. Investigations have confirmed that the blood left at the scene was the subject's, and its amount suggests that the subject was fatally injured before the disappearance. There are no significant common features of SCP-835-JP in terms of subject, time, or location, except that the victim is invariably a Foundation employee and the scene is a dark places with poor visibility1. Due to its unpredictability, suddenness, and the fact that the victims disappear without exception, no experimental observations of this phenomenon have been successful, and the details remain unknown to date. Based on the limited information obtained from the testimonies of witnesses who were present at the scene, as well as surveillance video footage, it is known that the victims acted as if they were being attacked by some imperceptible entity; however, the existence of the attacker has never been corroborated. Incident 835: On ██/██/20██, a booklet with a hand-drawn, anime-style girl titled \\"Artist's Impression of SCP-835-JP\\" was found on the desk of Research Assistant ██. After reviewing the contents of the booklet on the spot, it was discovered that the character in question had been given the name \\"Keteru Yamiko\\" and a set of attributes such as personality, origins, and abilities. The booklet was submitted to Head Researcher ███ on the same day; it was later announced that Research Assistant ██ admitted that the booklet belonged to him and that he would be transferred after a few days of suspension. However, since Incident 835, the phenomenon that had previously occurred in a cycle of at least 3 months remained inactive for about 5 months. Dr. ██, believing the two are somehow related, enacted Protocol Idol-835. Addendum 835-1: Protocol Idol-835: Due to the prolonged inactivity of SCP-835-JP \\"Keteru Yamiko\\" after Incident 835-JP, it was speculated that the anomaly was influenced by the perceptions of the Foundation personnel. Based on this hypothesis, Dr. ██ recommended and received approval to implement Protocol Idol-835, with the goal of embedding a shared perception of SCP-835-JP in the Foundation personnel. As a common setting for dissemination, the setting of \\"Keteru Yamiko\\", which was acknowledged by a significant number of personnel during Incident 835, was adopted as it was, considering the fact that it had already been effective to some extent, and because of the importance of smooth and immediate transmission of information. On ██/██/20██, the Protocol was put into practice. Firstly, all documents and information referring to SCP-835-JP were revised to make it easier for the viewers to associate them with \\"Keteru Yamiko\\", by including a detailed setting and replacing the object's designation number with a unique name. In addition, as part of a publicity campaign for staff, a large number of public relations magazines, supplies, common items printed with the character visual of \\"Keteru Yamiko\\", which was designed by the Foundation illustrators, were widely disseminated at the facilities. Fictional novels, manga, animations with \\"Keteru Yamiko\\" as the main character were produced in sequence, and their viewing was recommended. Through these efforts, the Foundation has succeeded in making almost all personnel share the recognition of SCP-835-JP \\"Keteru Yamiko\\" in a few months, and no activation of the object has been reported since then. Although these publicity campaigns are currently being scaled-down, items featuring \\"Keteru Yamiko\\" remain in various facilities in order to maintain a certain level of recognition, and the Foundation regularly organizes creative sessions based on the theme of \\"Keteru Yamiko\\". SCP-835-JP is probably a manifestation of the instinctive fear that something threatening oneself may be lurking in the darkness. But the imaginary monster we once feared has now been reduced to a clichéd character with Protocol Idol-835. —Dr. ██","output":"Item #: SCP-835-JP Object Class: Keter Special Containment Procedures: SCP-835-JP is currently not contained due to its elusive nature.

Whenever possible, the deaths should be disguised as unrelated incidents to minimize the impact on morale within the Foundation. SCP-835-JP, also known as \\"Keteru Yamiko,\\" has been neutralized using Protocol Idol-835, as described below. Research is ongoing to explore the possibility of expanding the protocol beyond the Foundation to address potential containment breaches resulting from major cognitohazardous events or similar incidents.

SCP-835-JP is also capable of manipulating darkness at will, causing objects to disappear into it. The mechanism behind this ability remains unknown. It is believed that these powers were harnessed and developed during her abduction and training as an assassin by a rival Group of Interest. Her experiences during this period likely contributed to her current personality. For more detailed information on \\"Keteru Yamiko,\\" please refer to the dedicated archive. SCP-835-JP originally manifested exclusively to Foundation personnel and was first observed in 19██. The phenomenon occurs in cycles lasting approximately 1 to 3 months, during which the affected individual disappears within seconds to minutes after encountering SCP-835-JP. Subsequent investigations have failed to locate any missing individuals, dead or alive. Blood left at the scene indicates that the subject sustained fatal injuries prior to their disappearance. The only consistent factors in these cases are the victim's affiliation with the Foundation and the occurrence of the event in poorly lit areas with limited visibility. Due to the unpredictable nature of SCP-835-JP and the complete lack of remaining evidence or witnesses, no successful experimental observations of the phenomenon have been conducted. Consequently, its true nature and mechanics remain unknown. Based on the limited information obtained from witness testimonies and surveillance footage, it is known that victims appear to be under attack by an imperceptible entity, although the existence of this attacker has never been definitively confirmed. Incident 835: On ██/██/20██, a booklet titled \\"Artist's Impression of SCP-835-JP\\" was discovered on the desk of Research Assistant ██. The booklet contained hand-drawn illustrations of an anime-style girl, subsequently named \\"Keteru Yamiko.\\" Detailed descriptions of her personality, background, and abilities were included. The booklet was promptly reported to Head Researcher ███, who determined that Research Assistant ██ was the creator and confiscated the booklet. Research Assistant ██ confessed ownership of the booklet and was subsequently transferred after a brief suspension. After the occurrence of Incident 835, which involved the identification and confiscation of the booklet, instances of SCP-835-JP ceased to manifest for a period of approximately 5 months. In response to this prolonged hiatus, Dr. ██ proposed and implemented Protocol Idol-835. Addendum 835-1: Protocol Idol-835: Based on the hypothesis that SCP-835-JP is influenced by the perceptions of Foundation personnel, Dr. ██ recommended and received approval to implement Protocol Idol-835. The objective of this protocol was to establish a shared understanding of SCP-835-JP among Foundation personnel. In consideration of the effective dissemination of information, the character \\"Keteru Yamiko\\" was chosen as a common representation due to its recognition during Incident 835. On ██/██/20██, Protocol Idol-835 was initiated. First, all documents referencing SCP-835-JP were revised to include a detailed description of \\"Keteru Yamiko.\\" The designation number was replaced with the character's name to facilitate the association between SCP-835-JP and \\"Keteru Yamiko.\\" Additionally, a public relations campaign was launched to distribute promotional materials featuring illustrations of \\"Keteru Yamiko\\" created by Foundation illustrators. Novels, manga, and animations centered around \\"Keteru Yamiko\\" were produced and strongly encouraged for consumption. As a result of these efforts, the majority of Foundation personnel acquired a shared recognition of SCP-835-JP as \\"Keteru Yamiko\\" within a few months, and no further manifestations of the entity have been reported since then. While the publicity campaign has been scaled down, items featuring \\"Keteru Yamiko\\" are still present across various Foundation facilities to maintain recognition, and creative sessions focused on the theme of \\"Keteru Yamiko\\" are regularly organized. SCP-835-JP is likely a manifestation of a primal fear of potential threats lurking in darkness.

You impart the screenplays and the dialogues within them with an orientation for cultural nuances and realism. Your screenplays are logically coherent and are properly structured. You will create screenplays for scenes from a film, a TV Series or a Web Series based on the prompt I give you. You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes an Asian-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt who claims that she won't let the returning woman enter if the returning woman won't clarify and explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she pooped her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in her reaction to this taunting. The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering. The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants. The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, complaining to the aunt about the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants, and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman acknowledges the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"Title: \\"Oops, I Pooped My Pants!\\" Genre: Comedy-Drama TV Series Background: Our protagonist, Meera Chen, is a vivacious Asian-American woman in her late 20s. She has a spunky personality, a contagious smile, and sports a short pixie haircut. Clad in her signature outfit - cargo pants, a loose-fitting top, and colorful sneakers - Meera is known for her adventurous and carefree nature. Meera lives in a cozy apartment shared with her older aunt, Aunty Lily. Aunty Lily, in her early 40s, is the epitome of an old soul with a humorous twist. She enjoys decorating their apartment with quirky knick-knacks and is fiercely protective of Meera, despite their good-natured banter and occasional teasing. Scene: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY Meera, visibly distressed, is jiggling her legs impatiently, clutching her stomach. She darts a desperate gaze at the door. The urgency in her face is evident. MEERA (whispering to herself) Oh no, oh no, not now! Why did I eat so much fiber without thinking? Meera fumbles with her handbag, her search for the keys becoming frantic. Her efforts bear no fruit. MEERA (dials her flatmate's number) Come on, pick up, pick up! Meera's flatmate's voicemail plays, confirming her absence. Panic sets in, causing Meera to pace back and forth. MEERA (whisper-shouting) Mary, where the hell are you?! Suddenly, an unexpected voice resonates from behind the door. AUNTY LILY (O.S.) (cheerful) What's all the ruckus out there? Someone finally decided to throw a party? Meera freezes, her eyes widening with dread. MEERA (muttering) No, no, no. Not Aunty Lily, not now! Reluctantly, Aunty Lily opens the door, rubbing her eyes, still disheveled from her nap. AUNTY LILY (rubbing her eyes) Meera? Is that you? What's happened? A gasp escapes Aunty Lily's lips as she takes in the sight before her - Meera, mid-poop, a look of hilariously timed relief on her face. AUNTY LILY (with a bemused expression) Meera, honey, why are you...? Wait, is that what I think it is?! Rewind: in slow-motion, the realization dawns on Aunty Lily - the odor, the posture, and the undeniable truth. AUNTY LILY (stifling laughter) Oh, my dear, you didn't just... Meera, caught up in the moment of relief, gestures for silence as she continues her business. MEERA (hushing) Shh, Aunty Lily! I'm almost there. Unfazed, Aunty Lily surveys the situation, her face mirroring a combination of disbelief and amusement. AUNTY LILY (flapping her hand in front of her face) Whew! That is a smell I can't un-smell. The moment of relief finally subsides, and Meera sheepishly looks up at Aunty Lily. AUNTY LILY (mockingly) So, sweetheart, care to explain this...situation? MEERA (avoiding eye contact) Aunty, please let me in, and I'll explain everything inside? A mischievous glint fills Aunty Lily's eyes as she blocks Meera's path. AUNTY LILY (teasingly) Oh, no, my dear. You're not going anywhere until we have a proper chat about your \\"little accident.\\" Meera's face turns red with embarrassment; she hesitantly admits defeat. MEERA (resigned) Alright, alright, you win. I pooped my pants. Aunty Lily bursts into laughter, clutching her stomach as Meera attempts an indignant expression. AUNTY LILY (teasingly) Oh, sweetheart, you're never growing up, are you? Meera, slightly mortified, regains her sense of humor, responding playfully. MEERA (sulking) Well, it's your fault for taking so long to open the door. Aunty Lily playfully feigns offense, shaking her head with a grin. AUNTY LILY (mockingly) I suppose it's my fault you can't hold your bowels like a big girl? Meera, now more at ease, juts her hip out, sashaying past Aunty Lily. MEERA (coyly) Well, I'm going to clean up now. I don't want to be the infamous Ms. Poopy Pants forever. Aunty Lily reacts to the odor emanating from Meera, waving her hand in jest. AUNTY LILY (teasingly) Clean away, stinker! You really outdid yourself this time. Meera giggles, throwing a wink over her shoulder as she finally makes her way to the bathroom. MEERA (teasing) Just remember, Aunty, one day it might be you! Aunty Lily rubs her nose, wrinkling it in mock disgust. AUNTY LILY (mockingly) Oh, dear, let's hope not! One poop fiend is more than enough for this household. Both women exchange laughter, their bond strengthened by this absurd yet unforgettable mishap.

ANGELA (impatiently) Pick up, Sarah, pick up! She hangs up and begins knocking on the door, her raps growing faster and more frantic with each passing second. ANGELA (calling out) Sarah! Please, I really need to get in! Her urgency reaches a breaking point, her face twisting in discomfort. ANGELA (whispering to herself) Oh, not like this, please not like this. Sound of a DOORKNOB jingling on the other side. AUNT LILY (O.S.) (through the door) What's all this commotion, young lady? Angela's face contorts into a mix of relief and dread. ANGELA (disbelieving) Aunt Lily?! Why now? ANGLE ON Angela frozen in an awkward posture, a mixture of anguish and relief on her face, as she starts to lose control over her bodily functions. AUNT LILY (O.S.) (amused) Hello? Is everything alright out there? Angela's strained voice cuts through her aunt's question. ANGELA (pleading) Lily, please! Open the door—right now! SFX: The DOOR creaks slowly open. Angela locks eyes with her aunt, who looks baffled and bewildered. AUNT LILY (confused) Angela, what on earth are you doing? Why aren't you— The Aunt's eyes widen, and she recoils slightly, her face wrinkling in disgust. AUNT LILY (recoiling) Oh, my... What is that smell? Angela sighs in relief as she finishes her expulsion, but her aunt's reaction dawns on her. ANGELA (sheepishly) Uh, Aunt Lily... I think I might have had an accident. Aunt Lily bursts into laughter, unable to contain her amusement. AUNT LILY (laughing) Oh, Angela, you haven't changed a bit! You still find ways to surprise me. Angela attempts to enter the flat, but Aunt Lily holds her back. AUNT LILY (teasingly) Not so fast, young lady. You have some explaining to do! Angela looks indignant and sheepish at the same time. ANGELA (defensively) It's not entirely my fault! If you hadn't taken so long to let me in, none of this would have happened. Aunt Lily playfully raises an eyebrow and taunts Angela. AUNT LILY (mocking) Oh, it's my fault, is it? Since when did I make you poop your pants like a little baby? Angela's indignation begins to wane, replaced by a sense of playful resignation. ANGELA (sulking) Alright, alright, maybe it's mostly my fault. But seriously, I need to clean up now, Lily. Aunt Lily steps back, still chuckling, but with an exaggerated gesture in response to the smell. AUNT LILY (teasing) Indeed, my dear niece, you really stink! Go clean yourself up. Angela nods sheepishly, her nose wrinkling in acknowledgment. ANGELA (coyly) Yes, yes, I definitely need to do that. But just remember, you contributed to this entire ordeal, Aunt Lily. Aunt Lily playfully waves Angela towards the bathroom. AUNT LILY (laughing) Off you go, Poopy Pants. Don't keep me waiting for that explanation! As Angela waddles past her laughing aunt, she rolls her eyes but can't help but let out a small giggle herself.

Angela, a 32-year-old Asian-American woman, had unintentionally consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day due to a misunderstanding. This resulted in her urgent need to relieve herself later in the day. Lily, Angela's mischievous aunt in her late 40s, enjoys teasing her niece and often finds herself involved in Angela's misadventures. Scene: Lunch Gone Awry INT. SMALL CAFETERIA - DAY Angela and Lily sit in a small, cozy cafe, enjoying their lunch. Angela, engrossed in her conversation, begins to eat a plate of vibrant vegetables and a fiber-rich salad. Lily eyes Angela's lunch with mischievous curiosity. LILY (grinning) Angela, are you trying to sprout a garden in your stomach? ANGELA (amused) Very funny, Aunt Lily. I'm just trying to eat healthy. Lily steals a spoonful of Angela's salad and eyes it suspiciously. LILY (raising an eyebrow) This rabbit food is definitely not for me. I prefer more... substantial meals. Angela chuckles and continues eating, unaware of the hidden fiber trap that awaits her. INT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Angela enters her small, neat apartment, looking relaxed after a long day out. She takes off her shoes and heads to the kitchen, preparing a cup of herbal tea. As Angela sips her tea, she begins to feel a rumbling in her stomach, growing increasingly urgent with each passing moment. ANGELA (to herself) Oh no, not now. Please, don't do this to me. She glances at the clock; it's late, and the nearby public restrooms are closed for the night. ANGELA (frustrated) Why did I eat so much fiber today? And why didn't I find a restroom when I had the chance? Angela grabs her purse, frantically searching for her keys. ANGELA (panicking) I need to get inside. NOW! She rummages through her bag, her face contorted in desperation, until finally realizing her keys are nowhere to be found. ANGELA (teary-eyed) This can't be happening! ANGELA (CONT'D) (dialing her flatmate) Sarah, just pick up! Please! SFX: The ringing of Sarah's phone echoes, but it goes unanswered. ANGELA (frustrated) Great, just great! Determined, Angela begins knocking on the door, each knock growing louder and more urgent. ANGELA (callbacks) Sarah! I need to use the bathroom! Please be home! As her urgency escalates, Angela can't hold it any longer. She clutches her stomach, fearing the inevitable. The door creaks open, revealing Aunt Lily, disheveled and rubbing her eyes. AUNT LILY (yawning) What is all this commotion, Angela? ANGELA (hopeful relief) Aunt Lily, thank goodness you're here! I misplaced my keys, and I really need to go! Aunt Lily takes a moment to register Angela's desperation and glances at her face, contorted in agony. AUNT LILY (concerned) Oh, Angela, are you okay? Why didn't you find a restroom earlier? ANGELA (emotional) I tried, Aunt Lily. I really did. But now, it's too late. Angela's face twists in a mixture of anguish and resignation. ANGELA (teary-eyed) I'm so sorry, Aunt Lily. I... I just pooped my pants. Aunt Lily's eyes widen in shock, followed by a brief pause, before bursting into laughter. AUNT LILY (laughing) Oh, Angela, you always find a way to keep life interesting! Angela, embarrassed but relieved, chuckles and tries to hold back tears. ANGELA (defensively) Well, it's not entirely my fault. I blame the excessive fiber and losing my keys.

Despite facing constant scrutiny, she believes in her own abilities and resists conforming to the traditional role society expects her to play. When Snow White learns about her stepmother, the wicked queen, who obsessively clings to beauty standards, she becomes determined to advocate for self-acceptance and inner beauty. Snow White's beauty goes beyond just physical appearance; she radiates kindness, compassion, and wisdom. Choosing to break free from societal expectations, Snow White escapes the queen's attempts to suppress her spirit and find solace in a remote cottage inhabited by seven progressive-minded individuals. These seven strong-willed individuals, known as the Dwarfs, believe in gender equality and respect Snow White as an equal despite societal norms suggesting otherwise. Snow White, in collaboration with the Dwarfs, establishes a safe haven where diverse voices are heard, embraced, and celebrated. Together, they form a dynamic alliance to challenge gender stereotypes, dismantle oppressive systems, and advocate for the empowerment of all individuals. As the wicked queen discovers Snow White's newfound independence and influence, she tries to sabotage her efforts at every turn. Yet, Snow White's resilience and unwavering spirit prevail, inspiring others to rise against the queen's tyrannical reign. With the support of the Dwarfs and other brave individuals who sympathize with their cause, Snow White leads a revolution, urging her community to reject societal limitations and embrace their true potential. Together, they work to create an egalitarian society that values the contributions of all members, regardless of gender or societal expectations. In the climactic ending, Snow White's revolutionary approach triumphs, overthrowing the oppressive monarchy that perpetuated gender inequality. Finally, the kingdom embraces a new era of equal opportunities, where individuals can flourish according to their abilities and aspirations, free from the constraints of gender-based discrimination. This feminist retelling of \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" reinforces the importance of courage, self-empowerment, and collective action in reshaping societal structures for the better. It inspires audiences of all ages to challenge deeply entrenched gender roles and work towards a fair and equal world for everyone."},{"instruction":"(In the clubroom…) Monika: (cradling her newborn daughter - Minika) “There, there, Minika.

You will create screenplays for scenes from a film, a TV Series or a Web Series based on the prompt I give you. You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes an African-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt who claims that she won't let the returning woman enter if the returning woman won't clarify and explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she pooped her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in her reaction to this taunting. The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering. The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants. The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, complaining to the aunt about the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants, and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman acknowledges the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"Title: Comedy of Bowels Genre: Comedy-Drama TV Series Setting: A modest apartment building in a bustling city neighborhood Character: 1.

Jasmine's patience dwindles as her imminent eruption hovers closer. Finally, Martha fully opens the door, and her eyes widen in disbelief. The sight before her leaves her speechless. Jasmine, with an awkward posture, holds a pained expression on her face as she accidentally relieves herself in her pants. It is an unfortunate and unforgettable moment. Martha stares, bewildered, unable to comprehend the situation. She tries to question Jasmine, but her words are met with a raised hand and soft grunts of relief. As the realization dawns on Martha, she subconsciously recoils from the strong odor emanating from Jasmine's predicament. Her horror turns to amusement.

She pleads with Martha to let her inside. JASMINE (stammering, avoiding eye contact) Please, Aunt Martha, let me in. We can talk about this later. But Martha, fueled by mischief, refuses to let her off the hook so easily. She prods Jasmine, insisting on an explanation. MARTHA (teasing, amused) Oh no, my dear niece. Not until you spill the beans. What happened out there? Jasmine's equivocating responses crumble under Martha's relentless teasing. Sheepishly, she admits the truth. JASMINE (sighing, defeated) Okay, okay, I... I pooped my pants. Happy now? Only then does Jasmine cautiously shuffle into the apartment, passing by Martha, who stands at the doorway, cackling. Martha, unable to resist, incredulously taunts Jasmine for her predicament and her waddle with pants full of poop. MARTHA (teasing, mockingly) Oh, look at you, all grown up and pooping your pants like a toddler. Did you decide to regress?

But before she can fully retreat to the bathroom, Martha gently stops her, curious to inspect the situation further. MARTHA (tugging at Jasmine's wrist) Hold on, let me see this grand spectacle for myself. Such an absurdity! With a mix of reluctance and playfulness, Jasmine turns, allowing Martha to observe her rear end. MARTHA (mockingly, teasing) Well, well, it seems we have our very own dirty diaper situation here! Jasmine responds coyly, complaining about the unpleasant feeling, while Martha physically reacts to the odor in a mockingly exaggerated manner.

However, it is not possible for a Go program to be automatically triggered when an SSH connection is established or to restrict exiting the SSH session itself.

To achieve a similar functionality, you may need to configure your SSH server to start the CLI app automatically and restrict the exit command based on user privileges. The exact steps to configure this behavior depend on the SSH server software you are using. Here's an example of how you can configure the command execution upon SSH connection using OpenSSH server. 1. Edit the SSH server configuration file (\`/etc/ssh/sshd_config\`): \`\`\` sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config \`\`\` 2. Add or modify the following settings: \`\`\` ForceCommand /usr/local/bin/cli-app PermitRootLogin without-password \`\`\` Make sure to replace \`/usr/local/bin/cli-app\` with the actual path to your compiled Go program. 3. Restart the SSH server: \`\`\` sudo service ssh restart \`\`\` Now, whenever an SSH connection is established, the \`cli-app\` command will automatically start, and the user will be unable to exit unless they have root privileges and execute the exit command within the application.

She had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt who claims that she won't let the returning woman enter if the returning woman won't clarify and explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she pooped her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in her reaction to this taunting. The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering. The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants. The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, complaining to the aunt about the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants, and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman acknowledges the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"Title: A Change of Plans Genre: Comedy-Drama TV Series Background: Our protagonist, Jasmine Thompson, is a vibrant and confident African-American woman in her late twenties.

Aunt Margie won't budge without an explanation. She playfully insists, keeping her eyes fixed on Jasmine's soiled pants. AUNT MARGIE (teasingly) I won't let you in until you clarify, young lady. What happened out there? Jasmine equivocates, unwilling to fully admit to her embarrassing accident. However, Aunt Margie's persistence cracks her resolve. JASMINE (sheepishly) Okay... I... I pooped my pants. Aunt Margie bursts into laughter, a genuine and infectious sound that fills the hallway. As Jasmine waddles past Aunt Margie, her indignant facade starts to crumble. She can't help but laugh along with her aunt, appreciating her perspective. JASMINE (playfully sulking) This is all your fault, Aunt Margie. You took forever to open the door! Incredulously, Aunt Margie denies Jasmine's accusation, relishing the opportunity to tease her. AUNT MARGIE (playfully) Oh, really? I think pooping your pants at your age is quite the accomplishment, dear. Jasmine, initially defensive, starts to let go of her embarrassment, embracing the absurdity of the situation. JASMINE (teasingly) Well, you should know, Aunt Margie. You've probably changed countless dirty diapers in your time. Aunt Margie, still cackling, playfully waves Jasmine off toward the bathroom to clean up. AUNT MARGIE (mockingly) Go on then, Miss Poopy Pants. You've got some serious clea-ning up to do! In a mockingly exaggerated manner, Aunt Margie flinches again at the lingering odor, cementing her role as the mischievous but loving aunt. As Jasmine heads toward the bathroom with a mix of embarrassment and newfound humor, she acknowledges Aunt Margie's teasing playfully. JASMINE (coyly) Yeah, yeah, I get it. I stink. I'll be back, Aunt Margie. Just wait and see! As Aunt Margie continues to cackle and physically react to the lingering smell, Jasmine disappears into the bathroom, leaving behind a delightful chaos only family can create.

The \`sampler\` parameter is set to \`optuna.samplers.TPESampler()\`, which performs optimization using the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithm. The \`pruner\` parameter is set to \`optuna.pruners.MedianPruner(n_startup_trials=5, n_warmup_steps=100)\`, which prunes trials using the median stopping rule after a certain number of startup trials and warmup steps.

This makes it easy for you to recover older versions of your document if you make a mistake, and it makes collaboration with others much easier. Here is an example to illustrate how version control works. Let’s say you’ve got a shopping list and you want your roommates to confirm the things you need and add additional items. Without version control, you’ve got a big mess to clean up before you can go shopping. With version control, you know exactly what you need after everyone has contributed their ideas. Git is free and open source software distributed under the GNU General Public License. Git is a distributed version control system, which means that users anywhere in the world can have a copy of your project on their own computer. When they’ve made changes, they can sync their version to a remote server to share it with you. Git isn’t the only version control system out there, but the distributed aspect is one of the main reasons it’s become one of the most common version control systems available. Version control systems are widely used for things involving code, but you can also version control images, documents, and any number of file types. You can use Git without a web interface by using your command line interface, but GitHub is one of the most popular web-hosted services for Git repositories. Others include GitLab, BitBucket, and Beanstalk. There are a few basic terms that you will need to know before you can get started. The SSH protocol is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another. A repository contains your project folders that are set up for version control. A fork is a copy of a repository. A pull request is the way you request that someone reviews and approves your changes before they become final. A working directory contains the files and subdirectories on your computer that are associated with a Git repository. There are a few basic Git commands that you will always use. When starting out with a new repository, you only need create it once: either locally, and then push to GitHub, or by cloning an existing repository by using the command \\"git init\\". \\"Git add\\" moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. \\"git status\\" allows you to see the state of your working directory and the staged snapshot of your changes. \\"git commit\\" takes your staged snapshot of changes and commits them to the project. \\"git reset\\" undoes changes that you’ve made to the files in your working directory. \\"git log\\" enables you to browse previous changes to a project. \\"git branch\\" lets you create an isolated environment within your repository to make changes. \\"git checkout\\" lets you see and change existing branches. \\"git merge\\" lets you put everything back together again. To learn how to use Git effectively and begin collaborating with data scientists around the world, you will need to learn the essential commands. Luckily for us, GitHub has amazing resources available to help you get started. Go to try.github.io to download the cheat sheets and run through the tutorials. In the following modules, we'll give you a crash course on setting up your local environment and getting started on a project.","output":"A version control system lets you track changes to documents, making it easy to recover previous versions and collaborate with others. Git is a popular distributed version control system, allowing users to have copies of a project and sync their changes with a remote server. Git can be used via command line or web interfaces like GitHub. Some basic terms to know are repository, fork, pull request, and SSH protocol. Git commands include add, status, commit, reset, log, branch, checkout, and merge.

You are adept at writing screenplays for any genre , and for content that takes place in any country and may be context specific. You impart the screenplays and the dialogues within them with an orientation for cultural nuances and realism. Your screenplays are logically coherent and are properly structured. You will create screenplays for scenes from a film, a TV Series or a Web Series based on the prompt I give you. You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes an African-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt who claims that she won't let the returning woman enter if the returning woman won't clarify and explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she pooped her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in her reaction to this taunting. The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering. The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants. The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, complaining to the aunt about the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants, and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman acknowledges the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY A long, narrow hallway stretches ahead, lined with closed doors leading to various flats. The sound of footsteps echoes through the air as we see JESSICA (30s, African-American, stylish and confident) briskly walking down the corridor. She wears a fashionable jumpsuit that complements her vibrant personality. Her expression twists into a pained grimace as she clutches her stomach. JESSICA picks up her pace, revealing her urgency. She reaches her flat's door and fumbles in her purse, desperately searching for her keys. JESSICA (under her breath, frantic) Come on, come on... Where did I put them? Her hands rummage through the contents of her purse with increasing anxiety. Finally, realization dawns on her face. JESSICA (frustrated, muttering) Of course, I left them at work. Panicking, JESSICA takes out her phone and dials her flatmate, LUCY. The phone rings but goes unanswered. JESSICA (nervously) Lucy, pick up! Please! She hangs up and begins knocking on the door, her desperation growing with each pound of her clenched fist. JESSICA (half-whispering) Lucy! It's me! Open up! As the urgency reaches its peak, a voice responds from inside the flat. AUNT NANCY (50s, lively and mischievous) suddenly wakes up from her nap, disoriented. She shuffles towards the door and tries to piece together what's happening. AUNT NANCY (drowsy) What's going on out here? The door creaks open, revealing AUNT NANCY with a puzzled expression. However, her bewilderment turns to shock when she takes in the sight before her. JESSICA, frozen in place, stands in an awkward posture with her face contorted in relief. There's no mistaking the undeniable aroma that fills the air. AUNT NANCY (stunned) What... why are you...? As the reality sinks in, AUNT NANCY bursts into laughter, unable to contain herself. JESSICA desperately tries to silence her with a hand-raise gesture, but the muffled grunts of exertion escape her lips, almost sounding mingled with an odd sense of pleasure. AUNT NANCY (teasingly) Is this some kind of new performance art, Jess? Really taking method acting to the extreme, huh? JESSICA attempts to explain herself, but all she manages are dismissive replies and soft grunts, as the release hasn't quite finished yet. AUNT NANCY's bemusement turns to disgust as the full extent of the situation hits her. AUNT NANCY (recoiling) Oh my... I didn't sign up for this kind of family bonding. Finally, with a sigh of relief, JESSICA finishes relieving herself. AUNT NANCY's eyes widen as the truth dawns on her. AUNT NANCY (stifling laughter) Did... did you just do what I think you did? The admission hangs in the air for a moment before JESSICA sheepishly nods, her face flushing red. JESSICA (whispering) I... pooped my pants, Aunt Nancy. AUNT NANCY breaks into uproarious laughter, barely able to contain herself. JESSICA's initial indignation fades as she begins embracing the absurdity of the situation. JESSICA (teasingly) Well, maybe if someone didn't take forever to open the door... AUNT NANCY playfully denies any involvement, shaking her head in mock disbelief. AUNT NANCY (teasing) Oh, so now it's my fault that you couldn't hold it in? You should know better than that, Jess. JESSICA scoffs playfully and starts heading towards the bathroom, careful not to make any sudden movements. JESSICA (sulking) Fine, fine. I'll clean up. But this is all your fault, Aunt Nancy. AUNT NANCY, still chuckling, places a gentle hand on JESSICA's shoulder, stopping her in her tracks. AUNT NANCY (teasingly) Oh no, young lady. First, I need to get a closer look at that masterpiece you've created. I can't believe the audacity of an adult soiling themselves like a dirty diaper. JESSICA playfully rolls her eyes, complaining about the nasty feeling in her pants. She playfully whines about the need to clean up. AUNT NANCY playfully gags, gesturing towards the odor emanating from JESSICA. AUNT NANCY (teasingly) Trust me, Jess, you really need to go and clean yourself up. You stink to high heaven. JESSICA acknowledges the teasing, coyly hinting at her unfortunate situation. JESSICA (coyly) Yeah, yeah, I get it. But it's all your fault, Aunt Nancy. If you had opened the door faster... Still cackling, AUNT NANCY waves JESSICA off towards the bathroom, eager to see her niece clean up the mess. AUNT NANCY (still laughing) Go on, kiddo. You better go and wash away the evidence of your pants-pooping escapade. As JESSICA gingerly waddles past AUNT NANCY, she can't help but laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation. Their bond strengthened by this absurd moment, JESSICA heads towards the bathroom, ready to get herself cleaned up.

Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes an African-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt who claims that she won't let the returning woman enter if the returning woman won't clarify and explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she pooped her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in her reaction to this taunting. The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering. The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door.

The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, complaining to the aunt about the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants, and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up.

The show depicts everyday life situations with relatable characters, emphasizing realistic dialogue and cultural nuances. The series showcases the strong bond shared by this eccentric family as they navigate through comically absurd scenarios. Characters: 1. Valerie Jackson (African-American woman, mid-30s) - Appearance: Valerie has afro-textured hair, caramel skin tone, and expressive brown eyes. She wears a vibrant green blouse and black pants. 2. Aunt Mildred Johnson (African-American woman, early 50s) - Appearance: Aunt Mildred is a bubbly, slightly eccentric lady with permed silver hair and glasses. She dresses in a floral blouse and comfortable slacks. Scene: Valerie's Desperate Dilemma INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY Valerie Jackson, a lively and slightly anxious woman in her mid-30s, hurries down the apartment hallway towards her flat's door. Clutching her stomach, she winces with desperation. Valerie wears a vibrant green blouse and comfortable black pants. Her natural afro hair bounces with each step. She finally reaches her door, only to frantically pat her pockets and realize her house key is lost. VALERIE (desperate) Oh no, no, no! Where's my key?! Valerie digs through her bag, searching for any sign of the lost key. In desperation, she grabs her phone, swiftly dialing her flatmate's number. The call goes unanswered. VALERIE (stressed) Come on, Alexis, pick up! Valerie's urgency increases, and she begins pounding on the door with her fists. VALERIE (hammering on the door) Alexis! Alexis, are you there?! Suddenly, a voice responds from inside the flat. AUNT MILDRED (O.S.) (startled) What in the world? Who's there? Valerie freezes in place, looking horrified. The voice belongs to her Aunt Mildred, whom she didn't expect to find in her current predicament. AUNT MILDRED (O.S.) (curiously) Valerie? Is that you? VALERIE (panicking) Aunt Mildred, it's me! Please, please open the door! Aunt Mildred starts unlocking the door, but her weariness from a nap causes her to move at a leisurely pace. VALERIE (desperate) Aunt Mildred, hurry! I can't wait much longer! Finally, Aunt Mildred opens the door, revealing Valerie frozen in an awkward pose, relief and distress etched upon her face. A few moments too late, Valerie has an untimely accident and poops her pants. It's an embarrassing sight. Aunt Mildred, initially perplexed by Valerie's situation, can't quite comprehend what she's seeing. AUNT MILDRED (perplexed) Valerie, what on earth are you doing? Why aren't you coming in? Valerie raises her hand in a silencing gesture and lets out soft grunts of relief, clearly not finished with her unfortunate dilemma. AUNT MILDRED (sudden realization) Oh no! Oh my... Realizing the truth, Aunt Mildred bursts into laughter, unable to contain her amusement. VALERIE (embarrassed) Aunt Mildred, please let me in! Stop laughing! Aunt Mildred playfully insists on an explanation, teasing Valerie and vowing not to open the door until she clarifies the situation. VALERIE (sheepishly) Fine, fine! I... I pooped my pants, okay? Finally, Valerie gingerly waddles into the flat, passing Aunt Mildred still laughing at the door. As Valerie shuffles by, Aunt Mildred incredulously taunts her for her accident. AUNT MILDRED (teasingly) Look at you, little miss \\"I can't control my bowel movements!\\" Did you forget how to use the toilet? VALERIE (indignant) It's your fault! You took forever to open the door! Aunt Mildred playfully denies the accusation, mockingly reminding Valerie that she's old enough not to poop her pants. VALERIE (sulking) You're terrible! I need to clean up, okay? Just as Valerie tries to make her way to the bathroom, Aunt Mildred gently stops her, wanting to get a closer look at the absurdity of the situation. AUNT MILDRED (teasingly) Hold on, young lady! Let me see those poop-filled pants of yours. This is just like dealing with a dirty diaper! Valerie coyly complains about the uncomfortable feeling, playfully whining as the aunt's teasing contradicts the embarrassing incident. VALERIE (mock complaining) Ugh, it's so nasty! Can I please go clean up now? Aunt Mildred reacts to the odor, waving her hand exaggeratedly while agreeing with Valerie. AUNT MILDRED (teasingly) Oh honey, it's clear as day you need to clean yourself up. You stink, my dear! Valerie acknowledges the teasing with a coy and sheepish smile, acknowledging her odor and her accident, but slyly puts some of the blame back on Aunt Mildred. VALERIE (coyly) Well, it's all your fault for taking forever to open the door. Still chuckling and reacting to the odor, Aunt Mildred playfully waves Valerie off toward the bathroom, letting her take care of herself. AUNT MILDRED (teasingly) Go on, girl! Clean up that mess, and don't forget to scrub extra hard!

Le sens profond de cette citation est que lorsque nous avons de grandes ambitions et des aspirations élevées, nous devons également être prêts à travailler dur et à faire les efforts nécessaires pour les réaliser. L'ambition ne suffit pas en soi ; elle doit être accompagnée d'action et de persévérance. Tout comme une dette doit être remboursée, les ambitions nécessitent un engagement et un investissement de notre part pour les réaliser. L'idée clé ici est que l'ambition sans action concrète ne mène nulle part. Si nous voulons réussir dans nos ambitions, nous devons être prêts à faire les sacrifices et à payer le prix nécessaire pour les atteindre. Cela peut inclure le travail acharné, la discipline, la résilience et la poursuite de nos objectifs même lorsque les obstacles se présentent sur notre chemin. En résumé, cette citation souligne l'idée que les ambitions doivent être soutenues par des actions concrètes et que nous devons être prêts à payer le prix de notre ambition pour la voir se réaliser."},{"instruction":"Peut on l'attribuer à César ?","output":"Non, la citation \\"l'ambition se doit de payer ses dettes\\" n'est pas attribuée à Jules César.

La méthode Pomodoro est une technique de gestion du temps qui a été développée dans les années 1980 par Francesco Cirillo. Elle consiste à diviser votre travail en intervalles de temps de 25 minutes, appelés \\"pomodoros\\", suivis d'une courte pause de 5 minutes. Après quatre pomodoros, vous prenez une pause plus longue, d'environ 15 à 30 minutes. L'idée derrière cette méthode est que la découpe du temps en intervalles concentrés vous aide à rester concentré et à maintenir une productivité élevée. En travaillant de manière intensive pendant ces courtes périodes de temps, vous êtes censé accomplir davantage en une journée que si vous aviez travaillé de manière ininterrompue et moins concentrée. La méthode Pomodoro peut être bénéfique pour ceux qui ont du mal à rester concentrés sur une tâche pendant de longues périodes de temps. Elle incite également à faire des pauses régulières, ce qui peut aider à prévenir la fatigue et à maintenir une productivité constante tout au long de la journée. Cependant, il est important de souligner que cette méthode peut ne pas convenir à tout le monde. Certaines personnes préfèrent travailler de manière plus continue et peuvent trouver les interruptions toutes les 25 minutes perturbantes. Il est donc important de trouver la méthode de gestion du temps qui fonctionne le mieux pour vous personnellement."},{"instruction":"Quels autres méthodes y ressemblent ?","output":"Il existe plusieurs autres méthodes de gestion du temps et de productivité qui peuvent s'apparenter à la méthode Pomodoro. Voici quelques exemples : 1. Technique des blocs de temps : Cette méthode consiste à diviser votre journée en blocs de temps dédiés à des tâches spécifiques. Par exemple, vous pourriez réserver un bloc de 2 heures le matin pour vos tâches les plus importantes, puis un autre bloc de temps pour les réunions, les e-mails, etc. L'idée est de regrouper des activités similaires pour optimiser votre concentration et minimiser les interruptions. 2. Méthode 52-17 : Cette méthode suggère de travailler intensément pendant 52 minutes, puis de faire une pause de 17 minutes. Elle est basée sur une étude qui a montré que les employés les plus productifs travaillaient en moyenne 52 minutes avant de faire une pause. En utilisant ces intervalles de temps, vous pouvez maintenir votre motivation et votre énergie tout en évitant la fatigue. 3. Technique du \\"bullet journal\\" : Cette méthode utilise un système de journalisation et de planification pour vous aider à organiser vos tâches et à suivre votre productivité. Vous créez des listes de tâches quotidiennes, hebdomadaires et mensuelles, et vous les priorisez en fonction de leur importance. Le bullet journal permet de garder une vision globale de vos engagements et vous aide à rester organisé. 4. Méthode 80/20 ou principe de Pareto : Cette approche se base sur le constat que 20% de vos efforts produisent 80% de vos résultats. Elle consiste à identifier les tâches et les activités qui ont le plus d'impact et à les prioriser. En se concentrant sur les actions les plus importantes, vous maximisez votre productivité et évitez de perdre du temps sur des tâches moins essentielles. Ces méthodes ont toutes en commun la recherche de l'efficacité et de la concentration dans la gestion de votre temps et de vos tâches. Chacune peut être adaptée en fonction de vos préférences et de votre style de travail. L'important est de trouver celle qui vous convient le mieux et qui vous permet d'optimiser votre productivité."},{"instruction":"(In Monika's room...)

This waterfall had the power to grant one wish to anyone who bathed in its shimmering pool. Minika: Did Lily make a wish, Mommy? Monika: Yes, she did, my love. Lily made a selfless wish for the forest to always remain magical and protected, so that children like her could always find joy and wonder there. Minika: That's such a lovely wish!

MIA (desperate, muttering) No, no, no! Where is it? Panic sets in, and Mia frantically pulls out her phone to call her flatmate, LUCY. She dials but receives no answer. MIA (irritated) Come on, Lucy! Pick up! With no other options, Mia resorts to knocking on the door loudly. She hopes that Lucy might be inside and hear her desperate plea. MIA (knocking, urgently) Lucy, it's Mia! Open the door, please! Mia's stomach growls, now at its peak of distress. She knows she can't hold it in much longer. Suddenly, a voice from inside the flat surprises Mia. It's Aunt PEARL, a stylish and sassy woman in her 40s with an elegant poise and silver streaks in her hair. She wasn't expected home. PEARL (through the door) What's all this commotion? Mia? Is that you? Relief washes over Mia at the sound of her aunt's voice. She anxiously implores Pearl to open the door quickly. MIA (hurriedly) Aunt Pearl, thank goodness! Open the door, I really need to get in! Pearl, still groggy from her nap, fumbles with the lock, taking an agonizingly long time. Mia's desperation reaches its peak. Finally, Pearl fully opens the door, only to be met with a shock. Mia stands before her in an awkward, frozen stance. Her face contorted with mid-release, she is pooping her pants. PEARL (befuddled) Mia, what on earth...? Mia's position and facial expression confuse Pearl. She questions Mia about why she isn't entering, but Mia signals for her to wait with a raised hand and dismissive reply, accompanied by soft exhalations of relief. PEARL (perplexed) Mia, what are you doing? Why won't you come in? As Pearl tries to grasp the situation, a foul smell catches her attention. Her eyes widen in realization. PEARL (disgusted) Did you... No way! It finally dawns on Pearl what just transpired. She can barely contain her laughter. MIA (sheepishly) Aunt Pearl, let me in please. Pearl, relishing the absurdity of the situation, continues to tease Mia, her laughter infectious. PEARL (teasingly) Oh no, Mia. Not until you explain all of this! Did you really just...? Mia squirms, initially avoiding admission of her mishap. But with Pearl's persistent coaxing, and the laughter in the air, Mia can't help but surrender to the truth. MIA (with a sigh) Okay, fine. I pooped my pants. Happy now? Finally resigned, Mia carefully waddles past Pearl, who stands at the doorway, taunting her incredulously. PEARL (playfully) Oh, look at you, the big kid who can't keep it together! Mia, initially indignant, begins to embrace the absurdity of the situation. She playfully sulks in response to Pearl's teasing, blaming her for the delay in opening the door. MIA (playfully disgruntled) Oh, ha-ha, Aunt Pearl. This is all your fault. If you'd been quicker, this wouldn't have happened! Pearl, still chuckling, playfully denies Mia's accusation, mockingly reminding her that she should know better than to poop her pants. PEARL (teasingly) Me? No way! You should be the one who knows better, Mia. Really, pooping your pants? Shameful. Mia's initial indignation melts into laughter, and she begins her journey towards the bathroom to clean up. MIA (amused) Alright, alright! I'll clean up. And thank you for pointing out the obvious, Aunt Pearly. I freaking stink! As they cackle together, Pearl mockingly reacts to the lingering odor, playfully agreeing with Mia that she certainly needs to clean herself up. PEARL (teasing) Yes, darling, you certainly do stink. Off you go, to the bathroom. We can't have you polluting the whole place! Mia acknowledges Pearl's mocking teasing with coy sheepishness, and she playfully whines about the discomfort of her soiled pants. MIA (coyly) Ugh, it feels disgusting. I need to clean up. PEARL (teasing) Oh, honey, I can smell it. Clean yourself up before you step foot in here! Begrudgingly cooperating, Mia heads off to the bathroom, with Pearl still chuckling and gesturing dramatically to the smell filling the room. The scene fades out, capturing the lighthearted and absurd camaraderie between Mia and Pearl. --- Note: The elaborate details in describing certain actions and conversations are subjective and can be adapted to fit the desired tone and pace of the scene within the comedic context of the TV series."},{"instruction":"Hi, I want 50 units of this product, with delivery by DDP air to zip code 91730 (USA).

You are adept at writing screenplays for any genre , and for content that takes place in any country and may be context specific. You impart the screenplays and the dialogues within them with an orientation for cultural nuances and realism. Your screenplays are logically coherent and are properly structured. You will create screenplays for scenes from a film, a TV Series or a Web Series based on the prompt I give you. You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes an African-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt who claims that she won't let the returning woman enter if the returning woman won't clarify and explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she pooped her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in her reaction to this taunting. The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering. The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants. The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, remarking on the bulge in her pants and comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, complaining to the aunt about the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants, and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman acknowledges the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"Title: A Comedy of Excrement INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY The camera focuses on an African-American woman named LISA, late 30s, with short curly hair and wearing a vibrant purple jumpsuit. She is hastily walking down the hallway, her face contorted with urgency. INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LISA'S DOOR - CONTINUOUS Lisa frantically searches her pockets, realizing her key is missing. LISA (whispering to herself) No, no, no! Where is it? She pulls out her phone and dials her flatmate's number, but no answer. LISA (desperate) Come on, pick up, pick up! She hangs up and begins knocking rapidly on the door. LISA (hammering the door) Connie! Connie, are you there?! Her desperation intensifies, her urgency nearly unbearable. INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS Inside the apartment, Aunt JUNE, mid-50s, an elegant and sophisticated woman, is awakened from her nap by the commotion outside. She groggily stumbles towards the door. AUNT JUNE (muttering) What in the world? INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LISA'S DOOR - CONTINUOUS Lisa's eyes widen as she hears Aunt June's voice on the other side. LISA (whispering to herself) Oh no, not Aunt June! Aunt June slowly turns the doorknob, unaware of the dire situation on the other side. LISA (fighting desperation) Hurry up, Aunt June! Open the door! Finally, the door swings open, revealing Aunt June's bewildered face. AUNT JUNE (confused) Lisa, what on earth are you doing? At that moment, Lisa's face transforms from a desperate plea to one of undeniable relief. AUNT JUNE (disgusted) What is that smell? Aunt June's confusion turns to realization as she takes in the sight of Lisa, frozen in place, excreting herself with an expression of untimely relief. AUNT JUNE (incredulously) Did you just... Lisa, still in mid-poop, raises her hand in a silencing gesture, unable to articulate her predicament. AUNT JUNE (horrified) Oh goodness! What happened, Lisa? Lisa finishes with a sigh of relief, her face flushed with embarrassment. LISA (sheepishly) I...I pooped my pants. Aunt June breaks into laughter, unable to contain herself. AUNT JUNE (teasingly) You pooped your pants? I can't believe it! Lisa, mortified, tries to avoid admitting it. LISA (pleading) Aunt June, let me inside, please. Aunt June, still chuckling, taunts Lisa as she reluctantly makes her way into the apartment. AUNT JUNE (teasing) Look at you, waddling with poop-filled pants like a little child! Lisa's initial indignation gives way to playful annoyance. LISA (teasingly) It's all your fault, Aunt June! You took forever to open the door! Aunt June playfully denies Lisa's accusation. AUNT JUNE (teasingly) Oh please, I'll have you know I'm as fast as lightning! Lisa playfully mumbles and heads towards the bathroom to clean up. LISA (playful sulk) Yeah, yeah. I'm going to clean up now. Aunt June gently stops her, wanting to get a closer look. AUNT JUNE (teasingly) Wait, I need to examine this phenomenon of yours. Lisa protests, but Aunt June delicately turns her around to inspect her rear end. AUNT JUNE (mockingly) Ooh, look at that bulge! It's like a dirty diaper! Lisa responds coyly, complaining about the nasty feeling. LISA (coyly) Ugh, it's so gross. I really need to clean up. Aunt June reacts exaggeratedly to the odor, teasingly agreeing. AUNT JUNE (teasingly) Oh my, you definitely need to clean up. You stink! Lisa acknowledges Aunt June's teasing while playfully blaming her for the delay. LISA (coyly) Yeah, yeah, all your fault. If you hadn't taken so long... Aunt June laughs heartily, waving Lisa off towards the bathroom. AUNT JUNE (laughing) Go on, go clean yourself up. And hurry!

The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt who claims that she won't let the returning woman enter if the returning woman won't clarify and explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she pooped her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in her reaction to this taunting. The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering. The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants. The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, remarking on the bulge in her pants and comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, complaining to the aunt about the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants, and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman acknowledges the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"Title: Unfortunate Timing Genre: Comedy-Drama Background: In the bustling city of New York, we find our protagonist, SARAH CARTER (30s), an African-American woman with a vibrant personality and a knack for getting herself into hilarious predicaments. She lives in a small, cozy flat with her aunt, LUCILLE (50s), who has been staying with her for a while. Lucille is lively, outspoken, and always ready to push Sarah's buttons. Unbeknownst to Sarah, her day is about to take an unexpected turn. Scene: Sarah's Desperate Plea INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY Sarah is rushing down the hallway towards her flat, her face contorted in a desperate effort to control her urge. She wears a pair of vibrant orange pants that match her energetic personality. SARAH (whispering to herself) Oh no, not now, please not now. As she reaches her door, she instinctively reaches into her pocket, but her face twists into panic when she realizes her house keys are missing. SARAH (desperately) No, no, no! Where are my keys? She frantically fishes through her bag for her phone and dials her flatmate, LINDA. No answer. SARAH (irritated, muttering) Where is she when I need her? Sarah frantically knocks on the door, each knock growing louder and more urgent. Her desperation is palpable. SARAH (through gritted teeth) Linda! Open the door, please! I can't hold it much longer! Suddenly, a voice can be heard from the other side of the door, echoing Sarah's pleas. LUCILLE (O.S) (sleepily) What's all this ruckus? Who's there? Sarah freezes in place, realizing with horror that it's her aunt, Lucille, who had been napping inside the flat. She did not anticipate this encounter at such an inopportune moment. SARAH (under her breath) Oh no, not Aunt Lucille... anyone but her. The door creaks open, revealing Lucille, groggy from her nap. LUCILLE (yawning, confused) Sarah? What on earth is going on? Sarah's body language and facial expression make it clear that she's desperately holding something back. Lucille's confusion intensifies when she catches a whiff of an odd smell. LUCILLE (disbelieving) What in the world is that smell? Sarah, unable to hold back any longer, assumes an awkward posture of excretion, her face displaying a mix of relief and untimely pleasure. Her pants bulge, and Lucille's eyes widen in disbelief. LUCILLE (disgusted, realization dawning) No way... Sarah, did you...? Sarah finally finishes relieving herself, letting out a deep sigh of relief. SARAH (sheepish) I... I couldn't hold it anymore. Lucille bursts into laughter, barely able to contain herself. LUCILLE (teasingly) Oh my, Sarah! You couldn't find a bathroom, so you decided to take matters into your own hands? Literally! Sarah, initially indignant, can't help but chuckle at the absurdity of the situation. SARAH (playful sulk) It's not my fault! You took forever to open the door. Lucille playfully denies the accusation, her laughter still contagious. LUCILLE (mockingly) Oh, so now it's my fault, huh? You should know better than to poop your pants, young lady! Sarah playfully sticks her tongue out at Lucille and attempts to head to the bathroom to clean up. LUCILLE (gently stops Sarah) Hold on a minute! I need to get a closer look at the magnificent mess you've made. Sarah protests, but Lucille takes her by the wrist, gently turning her around to observe her rear end. LUCILLE (teasingly) Well, well, Sarah. Looks like you've managed to create your very own dirty diaper. How impressive! Sarah pouts in a coy and sheepish manner, complaining about the unpleasant feeling in her pants. SARAH (pouting) It's not funny, okay? I need to clean up. Lucille reacts to the odor theatrically, wrinkling her nose. LUCILLE (teasingly) Oh, my dear Sarah, you definitely need to go and clean up. You stink, girl! Sarah acknowledges Lucille's teasing, but playfully insists that it's all her aunt's fault due to her slow door-opening skills. SARAH (slightly defiant) Well, if you hadn't taken forever, none of this would've happened! Lucille bursts into laughter once again, waving Sarah off towards the bathroom. LUCILLE (amused) Go on, child. Clean yourself up. We'll be laughing about this for years to come! Sarah gingerly waddles past Lucille, who continues to taunt her with laughter and playful remarks about her childlike mishap.

Janelle is stylishly dressed in a colorful jumpsuit that showcases her personality and flair. With her curly Afro and infectious smile, she exudes confidence and charm. She lives in a small, cozy flat with her eccentric, yet loving, aunt, Evelyn. Evelyn is a lively woman in her late forties, whose quirky fashion choices and playful demeanor make her a formidable presence. Scene: Janelle's Desperate Challenge INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY The dimly lit hallway is cluttered with apartment doors. Janelle fidgets with her keys, looking desperate and uncomfortable. Her hands juggle multiple grocery bags, emphasizing her struggle. FLASHBACK: INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY Janelle browses the aisles and unwittingly picks up a heap of high-fiber foods. Unbeknownst to her, this will wreak havoc on her digestive system later in her quest for relief. BACK TO PRESENT: Janelle approaches her flat's door, her face contorted with urgency. JANELLE (under her breath) Please, please be home, Evelyn. She reaches into her bag, frantically searching for her house key. Panic sets in as she realizes it's nowhere to be found. JANELLE (whispered) Nooo! Where is it? She takes a deep breath and dials Evelyn's phone number. JANELLE (CONT'D) (desperate) Pick up, Evelyn, pick up!

Evelyn, still groggy from her nap, struggles to open the door while Janelle's discomfort escalates. JANELLE (through gritted teeth) Hurry, Aunt Evelyn! The door creaks open, and Evelyn is greeted by a sight she could never have expected. Janelle is frozen in place, mid-excretion, her face a mix of untimely relief and embarrassment. EVELYN (perplexed) What in the world, Janelle? What's going on? Janelle, unable to respond verbally, raises her hand in a desperate gesture for silence, accompanied by soft grunts that sound almost relieving. Evelyn's eyes widen in disbelief as she catches a familiar odor, her face contorting into a mixture of shock and disgust. EVELYN (disgusted) Oh, honey, no! REALIZATION dawns on Evelyn as the pieces fall into place. Meanwhile, Janelle finishes relieving herself with a sigh of relief, only now fully aware of her surroundings. EVELYN (teasing) Did you just do what I think you did? Janelle's mortification is palpable, but Evelyn's laughter eases the tension slightly. JANELLE (embarrassed) Please, Aunt Evelyn, let me in. Evelyn insists on clarification, playfully teasing Janelle until she finally sheepishly admits her predicament. JANELLE (sheepishly) Yes, I... I pooped my pants. With her dignity all but crumbled, Janelle gingerly waddles past Evelyn, entering the flat. Evelyn, incredulous and unable to resist another jab, taunts Janelle about her childlike accident and poop-filled pants. EVELYN (playfully) Oh, look at you, all grown up and still pooping your pants! What a sight! Janelle, initially indignant, gradually embraces the absurdity and playfully sulks. JANELLE (teasingly) Well, this is all your fault, Aunt Evelyn. You took forever opening that door!

That's one big bulge you've got there! Janelle coyly complains about the unpleasant sensation, playfully whining about the urgent need to clean up. EVELYN (teasingly) Oh, trust me, you need a shower. Evelyn, still reeling from the odor, wrinkles her nose in jest, reinforcing the fact that Janelle desperately needs to clean up. Janelle acknowledges Evelyn's mocking tone in a sheepish manner, alluding to her own predicament. JANELLE (coyly) Yes, I get it, Aunt Evelyn. I stink. I'll go and clean up now.

You are adept at writing screenplays for any genre , and for content that takes place in any country and may be context specific. You impart the screenplays and the dialogues within them with an orientation for cultural nuances and realism. Your screenplays are logically coherent and are properly structured. You will create screenplays for scenes from a film, a TV Series or a Web Series based on the prompt I give you. You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes an African-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt who claims that she won't let the returning woman enter if the returning woman won't clarify and explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she pooped her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in her reaction to this taunting. The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering. The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants. The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, remarking on the bulge in her pants and comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, complaining to the aunt about the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants, and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman acknowledges the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY The hallway of a cozy apartment building, adorned with various paintings and photographs, breathes familiarity. The walls have witnessed countless stories unfold, and today is no exception. JANICE, an African-American woman in her late twenties, stands outside her apartment door with a desperate look on her face. She is dressed in comfortable sweatpants and a loose-fitting t-shirt. Her eyes dart around, searching for a solution to her predicament. JANICE (whispering to herself) Come on, come on, where is that damn key? Her bowels clench in protest as she shifts from one foot to the other. JANICE had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber earlier in the day, and now she pays the price for her oversight. JANICE (frantically) C'mon, Shelly, pick up! Please! She pulls out her phone and dials her flatmate, SHELLY. The phone rings and rings, but there's no answer. JANICE's panic rises. JANICE (to herself) Oh God, I can't wait any longer! Desperate, she starts knocking on the door with increasing intensity. Her urgency sends tremors down the walls, hoping SHELLY would hear her plea. JANICE (desperation evident) Shelly! Open the door! I really need to use the bathroom! Just when she's about to give up, a voice on the other side unexpectedly interrupts her pleas. JANICE freezes, her eyes widen in disbelief as she recognizes the voice. AUNT LILA, an elderly woman with a vibrant personality, resides in their flat temporarily. Despite her age, she still exudes a youthful aura. AUNT LILA (calling out) Janice? What's happening out there? JANICE's jaw drops in disbelief. The last person she wanted to see in such a predicament was her Aunt Lila. JANICE (in a hushed panic) Aunt Lila! Please, open the door! It's urgent! Aunt Lila, still groggy from her nap, takes her time opening the door. Each second feels like an eternity as JANICE tries to maintain her composure. Finally, with a creak, the door swings open. But it's too late. JANICE reaches the point of no return. She stands there frozen, an awkward look of simultaneous relief and embarrassment on her face. AUNT LILA (befuddled) Janice, what in the world...? Aunt Lila's confusion quickly morphs into puzzled realization as the odor hits her like a wave. She recoils, her hand instinctively reaching for her nose. AUNT LILA (disbelief) Oh, sweet Jesus. Did you just...? The comedic tragedy reveals itself as JANICE sheepishly nods, unable to utter a word. AUNT LILA (bursts into laughter) You... why, you naughty girl! JANICE tries to hide in shame, her face turning a deep shade of red. But Aunt Lila won't let her off the hook so easily. She playfully leans against the door frame, pointing at JANICE with a mischievous glint in her eyes. AUNT LILA (teasing) Well, well, well. Looks like someone needs a fresh pair of diapers! JANICE, trying to regain her composure, retaliates. JANICE (playfully sulking) Oh, Aunt Lila, don't act like you've never had an accident in your life. Aunt Lila gasps, pretending to be scandalized. AUNT LILA (teasingly) How dare you accuse me of such things! I'll have you know, missy, I've always been a model of grace and elegance. JANICE rolls her eyes, but there's a glimmer of amusement in her expression. The initial mortification slowly eases, and she begins to playfully banter with Aunt Lila. JANICE (mockingly) Please, Aunt Lila, we all know the truth. Time is not on our side, and I really need to clean up. Aunt Lila, still cackling, waves her towards the bathroom. AUNT LILA (laughing) Go on, my little stinker. Clean yourself up. I can't stand the smell any longer! JANICE, relieved to escape the teasing for a brief moment, gingerly waddles past Aunt Lila, a sheepish smile on her face. They share one final exchange, the affectionate banter continuing. JANICE (calling back) Remember, Aunt Lila, this is all your fault! AUNT LILA (teasingly) My fault? Oh, no, no, no. You should know better than to poop your pants, my dear. Laughter echoes through the apartment as the door closes behind JANICE, leaving Aunt Lila alone in the hallway, still chuckling to herself.

Here are some ways it has shaped the entertainment industry: 1. Increased accessibility: The introduction of television in the 1950s made entertainment more accessible to the general public. Before television, people relied on radio and going to movie theaters for entertainment. Television brought the entertainment into people's homes, allowing them to watch their favorite shows and movies without leaving their living rooms. 2. Expansion of content: With the advent of television, the entertainment industry had a new platform to showcase a wide variety of content. This led to the creation of diverse genres, such as sitcoms, dramas, game shows, news programs, and sports broadcasts. Television also became a medium for educational programs and documentaries. 3. Demographic targeting: Television allowed content creators to target specific demographics. The introduction of ratings systems and audience measurement tools enabled networks to cater to different age groups, interests, and cultural backgrounds. This led to the development of specialized programming, including children's shows, daytime soap operas, and news channels. 4. Influence on pop culture: Television had a profound impact on pop culture. Iconic shows like \\"I Love Lucy,\\" \\"The Twilight Zone,\\" \\"The Simpsons,\\" and \\"Friends\\" became cultural phenomena, shaping the way people think, dress, and talk. Television personalities became celebrities, and catchphrases from popular shows entered the common vernacular. 5. Advertising and commercialization: Television became a powerful medium for advertising and marketing. Advertisers began to target audiences during commercial breaks, sponsoring shows, and product placement. With the advent of cable television and streaming services, advertising revenue became crucial for the production and distribution of TV content. 6. Technological advancements: The evolution of television technology, from black and white to color, and from standard definition to high-definition and now streaming, has revolutionized the way people consume entertainment. The introduction of remote controls, video cassette recorders (VCRs), digital video recorders (DVRs), and now internet streaming services has given viewers more control over what they watch and when they watch it. 7. Globalization of entertainment: Television has helped to globalize entertainment. Shows from different countries can now be easily accessed through cable TV, satellite TV, and streaming services. This has led to the exchange of cultural ideas, formats, and talent across borders, influencing storytelling techniques and creating a more interconnected global entertainment industry. Overall, the evolution of television has significantly influenced the entertainment industry by expanding access to content, diversifying programming, shaping pop culture, enabling targeted advertising, driving technological advancements, and fostering globalization."},{"instruction":"rephrase: Hope you are doing well.

Due to a series of unfortunate events, she finds herself in desperate need of a bathroom but has misplaced her house key. Realizing that her flatmate is not home to let her in, Maya's predicament worsens as she desperately tries to reach her aunt, Patricia, for assistance. Unbeknownst to Maya, Patricia has been napping inside the flat and is unaware of her niece's urgent situation. --- INT.

You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes an African-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt who claims that she won't let the returning woman enter if the returning woman won't clarify and explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she pooped her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in her reaction to this taunting. The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering. The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants. The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, remarking on the bulge in her pants and comparing her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, complaining to the aunt about the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants, and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman acknowledges the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"Title: \\"The Poopgate Incident\\" Genre: Comedy-Drama TV Series Scene: Apartment hallway, outside the returning woman's flat Background: In the vibrant and diverse neighborhood of Oakwood Heights, we find ourselves in the midst of a tumultuous situation. Meet the returning woman, Jasmine Adams, a vibrant and quick-witted African-American woman in her late 20s. Jasmine is known for her impeccable fashion sense, donning a sleek pantsuit with an afro, showcasing her unique style. Jasmine shares an apartment with her aunt, Beatrice Johnson, a spunky and sassy woman in her early 40s. Beatrice is always dressed to impress, with her eye-catching outfits and a vivacious personality that electrifies any room she enters. The story unfolds with Jasmine rushing home after a long day at work. Unbeknownst to her, she had consumed an excessive amount of fiber, leaving her with an urgent need to use the bathroom. Unfortunately, her relentless schedule didn't allow her any time for relief, adding to her mounting desperation. INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY Jasmine stands outside her apartment door, desperately searching for her key in her bag, her face contorted with anxiety. She frantically scrolls through her phone, trying to reach her flatmate. JASMINE (whispering to herself) Come on, come on, where is it? She realizes her flatmate is unavailable and begins knocking aggressively on the door. JASMINE (panicking) Open the damn door! It's an emergency! Just as Jasmine's urgency reaches its climax, a voice emerges from inside the apartment. It's Beatrice - Jasmine's aunt, who had been napping this whole time. BEATRICE (voiced from behind the door) What's all the commotion about, child? Relief washes over Jasmine's face as she recognizes her aunt's voice. JASMINE (hopeful yet panicked) Aunt Bea, it's me! I've misplaced my key, and I really need to get inside! Beatrice, weary from her nap, takes her time to open the door, unaware of the dire situation unfolding at her doorstep. Jasmine's desperation reaches its peak as she pleads with her aunt. JASMINE (frantically) Hurry up, Aunt Bea! I can't hold it any longer! As the door creaks open, Jasmine's bowels finally reach their limit. With a mixture of anguish and sheer relief, she awkwardly assumes the posture of excretion, her face a mix of surprise and untimely relief. Beatrice, still puzzled, witnesses Jasmine's peculiar behavior and confusion ensues. BEATRICE (confused) Jasmine, what on Earth are you doing? Why aren't you coming inside? Jasmine, hand raised in a desperate gesture to silence her aunt, manages to reply even amidst soft grunts of exertion. JASMINE (dismissively) Hold on, Aunt Bea. Just give me a moment. As the truth begins to dawn on Beatrice, she is hit by the scent emanating from Jasmine's pants, and her reaction is priceless. BEATRICE (revulsed) Lord have mercy! What in the world?! A mixture of laughter and disbelief overtakes Beatrice as she finally comprehends the extent of the situation. Jasmine, now relieved yet still embarrassed, sheepishly admits the truth. JASMINE (ashamed) I... I pooped my pants, Aunt Bea. The realization leaves Beatrice in stitches, barely able to contain her laughter. BEATRICE (teasingly) Well, well, well. Look at what we have here, Jasmine. A full-grown adult pooping her pants like a two-year-old. Initially indignant, Jasmine starts to let go of her mortification and playfully sulkily reacts to Beatrice's teasing. JASMINE (defiantly) Well then, maybe if you had opened the door faster, none of this would've happened! Beatrice playfully denies Jasmine's accusation, citing the absurdity of her predicament, and compares it to a soiled diaper. BEATRICE (teasingly) Oh honey, don't blame your mishap on me. You should know better than to go around pooping your pants! Jasmine, though reluctantly, continues her quest to clean up and urges Beatrice to let her pass. JASMINE (whining) Alright, Aunt Bea. Enough teasing. Can I please go clean myself up now? But Beatrice, unable to resist the temptation, insists on observing Jasmine's poop-filled pants out of sheer incredulity. BEATRICE (teasingly) Hold on a second, young lady. Let me get a closer look. Just in case you ever forget this moment! Jasmine, mockingly protesting but ultimately cooperating, allows Beatrice to inspect her rear. Beatrice teasingly taunts Jasmine, emphasizing the bulge in her pants and likening it to a dirty diaper. JASMINE (coyly) Ugh, Aunt Bea, this is so gross. Can I please go clean up now? BEATRICE (teasingly) Oh, honey, you definitely need to do something about that smell. It's seeping through the entire apartment! Jasmine, in good spirits and playfully alluding to her own predicament, concedes and acknowledges the teasing from her aunt. JASMINE (coyly) Alright, alright, I get it. But remember, Aunt Bea, it's all your fault for taking too long at the door! With a cackling laugh and a physical reaction to the lingering odor, Beatrice finally waves Jasmine toward the bathroom to clean up. BEATRICE (chuckling) Fine, go ahead and clean yourself up, stinky. But remember, we will be talking about this for years to come! Jasmine waddles past Beatrice knowingly, the playful banter still echoing between them as she heads into the apartment, ready to finally rid herself of her unfortunate secret. FADE OUT.

It is a copy of the master branch and can be used to develop and test workflow changes before merging it into the master branch. In Git and GitHub, there is a main branch called master. It has the deployable code and is the official working version of your project. It is meant to be stable, thus, it is advisable not to push any code that has not been tested in the master. If you want to change the code and the workflow in the master branch, you can create a copy of the master branch. This can be the child branch that will be a copy of the workflow. In the child branch, changes and experiments are done. You can build, make edits, test the changes, and when you are satisfied with them, you can merge them back to the master branch, where you can prepare the model for deployment. You can see that all of this is done outside the main branch and until you merge, changes will not be made to the workflow before you branched. To ensure that changes done by one member, do not impede or affect the workflow of other members, multiple branches can be created and merged appropriately with the master after the workflow is properly tested and approved. To create branches in GitHub, let’s look at this repository. There is currently one branch in the repository. You want to make some changes but don’t want to alter the master in case something goes wrong, so you will create a branch. To do that, you will click the drop-down arrow and create a new branch. Name the new branch ‘child branch’ and then click enter. The repository now has two branches, the master and child branches. You can check this by selecting the child branch in the Branch selector drop-down list. All the content in the master branch is copied to the child branch. However, you can add files in the child branch without adding any to the master branch. To add a file, ensure the child branch is selected in the branch selector drop-down list. Then click Create new file. In the space provided, name the file ‘test child dot py’ and then add a few lines of code. You can print the statement inside the child branch. At the bottom of the screen, you will see a section, ‘Commit new file.’ Commit messages are important as they help to keep track of the changes made. Add a descriptive commit message for the convenience of the team. Here you can add ‘Create test child dot py.’ Then click Commit new file. The file is added to the child branch. You can verify by going to the master branch by clicking ‘master’ from the Branch selector menu, and you can see that the new file is not added to the master branch. After you have created the new file, test and ensure it is working. You can merge the changes in the child branch to reflect in the master branch by creating a Pull Request (PR). Pull requests show the differences in the content from both branches. It can notify other team members of the changes and edits to the main branch. Ideally, another team member reviews the changes and approves them to be merged with the Master branch. Pull requests are a means of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you propose your changes. You can assign team members to review and approve your contribution and merge in the target branch. To open a pull request to see the differences between the branches, click Compare and pull request. If you scroll down to the bottom of the screen, you will see the comparison between both branches. It shows that one file has changed, and the file has two additions, the two lines you added to the file with zero deletions. You will now create the pull request. Add the title and an optional comment. Click Create pull request. The next screen will show the details of the pull request. If you are okay with the changes, click Merge pull request and then click Confirm. You will get a confirmation that the pull request has been successfully merged. You can delete the branch if you no longer need to edit or add new information. Now, the child branch has completely merged with the Master branch. You can check the Master branch and verify it contains the test child dot py file. In this video, you learned: A branch is a snapshot of your repository to which you can make changes. In the child branch, you can build, make edits, and test the changes, and then you can merge them with the Master branch. To ensure that changes done by one member do not impede or affect the workflow of other members, multiple branches can be created and merged with the master. And, a pull request is a way to notify other team members of the changes and edits to the main branch.","output":"This article discusses the concept of branches in Git and GitHub. A branch is a copy of the master branch that allows for the development and testing of workflow changes before merging them into the master branch. The master branch is the main branch containing the stable, deployable code. It is advisable to only push tested code to the master branch. To make changes to the code and workflow, a branch can be created as a copy of the master branch. This branch, known as a child branch, allows for experimentation and testing. Once satisfied with the changes, they can be merged back into the master branch. Multiple branches can be created and merged to avoid conflicts between team members' changes. In GitHub, branches can be created by selecting the option to create a new branch and providing a name for it. Files and changes made in the child branch only affect that branch and can be added without affecting the master branch. To merge changes from the child branch to the master branch, a pull request can be created. Pull requests display the differences between the branches and allow for collaboration and review before merging. Once approved, the changes can be merged into the master branch. The article concludes by highlighting the importance of branches, testing, and collaboration through pull requests."},{"instruction":"I want you to act as a professional screenwriter who specializes in writing creative, inventive and elaborate screenplays.

You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes an African-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt who claims that she won't let the returning woman enter if the returning woman won't clarify and explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she pooped her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in her reaction to this taunting. The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering. The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants. The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, remarking on the bulge in her pants and likening her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, complaining to the aunt about the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants, and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman acknowledges the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"Title: Unforgettable Relief Genre: Comedy-Drama TV Series Background: In the bustling city of New York, our protagonist, Diamond Davis, an African-American woman in her late 30s, returns home after a long and exhausting day at work.

Diamond scans her pocket vigorously, then pats her pants to find her misplaced house key. Panic begins to set in as Diamond realizes the severity of her situation. DIAMOND (desperately) Nina, answer your damn phone! Diamond dials her flatmate's number, but there's no response. She starts knocking on the door with increasing force. DIAMOND (knocking) Nina! Nina, are you in there? Please, please, I need to get in! Diamond's urge to move her bowels escalates to the brink of eruption.

Diamond's face lights up, relieved to hear her aunt's voice. However, she would have preferred to avoid her presence in such an embarrassing situation. DIAMOND (hurriedly) Aunt Lucille! It's me! Please, open the door! Aunt Lucille, approximately 15 years older than Diamond, had been staying with her lately. She was napping inside the apartment and is taken aback by the commotion. INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - ENTRANCE - DAY Aunt Lucille cautiously moves toward the door, feeling drowsy and weary from her nap. Diamond pleads with her through the door.

Diamond's urgency becomes unbearable as she inches closer to the point of no return. Suddenly, with a mixture of relief and embarrassment, Diamond can no longer control it. She assumes an awkward posture, her face contorted with untimely relief. She begins pooping her pants in an elaborate and almost comical fashion. It's a moment of sheer absurdity. INT. APARTMENT - FOYER - DAY Aunt Lucille finally opens the door, shocked to find Diamond frozen in place, in the midst of relieving herself in her pants. AUNT LUCILLE (confused) Diamond, what in heaven's name are you doing? Diamond, partially mortified, raises her hand in a gesture to silence her aunt, her grunts reflecting the mixture of relief and pleasure she feels. DIAMOND (hushed) Auntie, I can't explain right now. Just... don't say anything. The aunt's bemusement turns to realization as she catches a whiff of the scent emanating from Diamond's deposit. AUNT LUCILLE (disgusted) Did you... really? Comprehension dawns on Aunt Lucille as she comprehends the unexpected revelation. DIAMOND (sheepishly) Don't laugh, Auntie. It's... it's exactly what you think. Aunt Lucille bursts into laughter, barely able to contain her amusement. DIAMOND (pleading) Auntie, please, let me in. We can talk inside. With raised eyebrows and an incredulous smile, Aunt Lucille steps aside, allowing Diamond to gingerly waddle into the apartment. She cannot resist a playful taunt as Diamond passes her. AUNT LUCILLE (teasing) My, my, Diamond. You're quite the stinky mess. Diamond's initial indignation softens into a sheepish smile as she playfully sulks. DIAMOND (teasing back) Well, Auntie, this is all on you, you know? You took forever opening that door! Aunt Lucille denies her involvement with a laugh, playfully teasing her niece about her plight. AUNT LUCILLE (mocking) Oh yes, because naturally, I possess the power to make you poop your pants. Diamond grins mischievously as she heads toward the bathroom to clean up, asserting her intentions. DIAMOND (mockingly) Just wait until you smell me when I'm fresh and clean. I'll show you a true stench. As Aunt Lucille cackles and continues to physically react to the odor, she playfully waves Diamond off to the bathroom. AUNT LUCILLE (teasing) Go on, stinky. Clean yourself up. You're an adult, for goodness sake. Diamond acknowledges her aunt's teasing in a coy and sheepish manner, emphasizing the odor in her playful reply. DIAMOND (coyly) Yes, Auntie. Believe me, no air freshener can mask this glorious scent. I'll be back in a jiffy. With laughter echoing through the apartment, Diamond disappears into the bathroom, leaving Aunt Lucille laughing at the absurdity of it all."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes an African-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt who claims that she won't let the returning woman enter if the returning woman won't clarify and explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she pooped her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in her reaction to this taunting. The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering. The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants. The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, remarking on the bulge in her pants and likening her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, complaining to the aunt about the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants, and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman acknowledges the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"Title: \\"Unfortunate Encounters\\" Genre: Comedy-Drama Setting: A modest apartment building in a bustling city neighborhood. Background: Our main character, Melissa Anderson, is a 30-year-old African-American woman. She has short natural curly hair, with striking hazel eyes and a contagious smile. She is dressed in casual but stylish clothes, pairing a colorful patterned jumpsuit with sneakers. Melissa is a vibrant, outgoing, and often comical individual with a knack for getting herself into absurd situations. Description of Aunt Beatrice: Aunt Beatrice is Melissa's 45-year-old aunt, who normally resides in a different city. She is a well-dressed, elegant woman with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes. With her shoulder-length silver hair and a perfectly tailored navy pantsuit, she exudes an air of sophistication. Aunt Beatrice is known for her sarcastic humor and her knack for teasing her loved ones. INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY Melissa stands at her apartment door, her face contorted with a desperate urge. In a panic, she wriggles her legs, desperately searching for her misplaced house key. MELISSA (frantically calling) Monique! Monique, where are you? I have an emergency! INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY Monique, Melissa's flatmate, is lounging on the sofa with her phone in hand, oblivious to the calls. MONIQUE (nonchalant) It's always something with you, Melissa. INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY Melissa, growing increasingly anxious, begins knocking on the door with desperation. MELISSA (pleadingly) Monique, please, open the door! It's urgent! INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY Without pause, Monique blissfully continues scrolling through her phone, oblivious to Melissa's cries. INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY The desperation peaks, and Melissa's body language becomes urgent. She can feel the pressure building. MELISSA (agitated, under her breath) Oh, come on! Please be here, Monique! Suddenly, a voice comes from inside the apartment. It's Aunt Beatrice, who had been napping all along. AUNT BEATRICE (sleepy, muffled) What's going on out there? Who's knocking? Melissa's eyes widen. The last person she wanted to see in this predicament was Aunt Beatrice. MELISSA (embarrassed, under her breath) Oh no, not now! INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY Aunt Beatrice yawns and rubs her eyes, slowly making her way to the door. INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY Melissa's desperation reaches its peak. She can't wait any longer. MELISSA (frantic) Aunt Bea, please, hurry up! I can't hold it! Aunt Beatrice fumbles with the keys, clearly still half-asleep. Melissa dances on the spot, her bowels on the verge of eruption. As the door finally swings open, Aunt Beatrice is met with an unexpected sight. Melissa freezes mid-relief in a painfully awkward posture, a look of untimely relief on her face, as she poops her pants. AUNT BEATRICE (utterly confused) What on earth...? But before Aunt Beatrice can comprehend the situation, the scent hits her. Aunt Beatrice reacts, recoiling dramatically from the odor. AUNT BEATRICE (disgusted) Oh, Lord! What is that smell? Melissa lets out a sigh of relief as the act concludes, prompting Aunt Beatrice's realization. AUNT BEATRICE (eyes widening) Wait, did you just...? Aunt Beatrice bursts into laughter, unable to control herself. MELISSA (ashamed, low voice) Aunt Bea, can you please just let me in? But Aunt Beatrice won't give in so easily. She twists the knife with playful teasing. AUNT BEATRICE (teasingly) Oh, no, dear niece. You need to explain yourself before stepping foot inside. Melissa hesitates, trying to avoid admitting the embarrassing truth. AUNT BEATRICE (teasing, sing-song) Did someone... have a little accident? Melissa gives in, her face reddening. MELISSA (sheepishly) Okay, fine! I pooped my pants. Happy now? With amusement in her eyes, Aunt Beatrice steps aside, allowing Melissa to gingerly waddle past her. AUNT BEATRICE (mockingly) Oh, darling, you should have known better than to trust your bowels! Melissa's indignation slowly turns into lightheartedness, and she playfully sulks her way to the bathroom while defending herself. MELISSA (playfully disgruntled) This was all your fault! You took forever opening the door! Aunt Beatrice chuckles, cackling at the absurdity of the situation and still reacting to the lingering odor. AUNT BEATRICE (phew-ing, gasping for air) Yes, I suppose I'm to blame for your little predicament, my dear niece. Melissa acknowledges the teasing, coyly admitting to her poop-filled pants. MELISSA (complaining) Ugh, my pants feel disgusting! I really need to clean up. Aunt Beatrice reacts dramatically, holding her hand to her chest. AUNT BEATRICE (teasingly) Oh, my! You really do stink, my darling. Melissa playfully sulks, alluding to the odor, and finally heads toward the bathroom. MELISSA (coyly) Yeah, yeah, I know. I'll go clean up. But remember, Aunt Bea, all of this is your fault! With a final chuckle, Aunt Beatrice waves Melissa off into the bathroom, still reacting physically to the pungent smell.

As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in her reaction to this taunting. The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering. The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants. The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult, remarking on the bulge in her pants and likening her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, complaining to the aunt about the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants, and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman acknowledges the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"Title: \\"Awkward Homecoming\\" Genre: Comedy-Drama TV Series Setting: Angela's Apartment Building - Hallway Characters: - Angela Russo (Italian-American woman): Late 20s, olive skin, curly black hair, wearing blue sweatpants, white sneakers, and a green sweater.

This particular day seemed like a complicated play in the comedy of errors. --- INT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY Angela, with her hands firmly pressing against her stomach, hurries through the hallway toward her flat. She fumbles through her bag for the house key, worry lines creasing her forehead. ANGELA (to herself) Oh no, not now. Come on, where's that key? INT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Angela dials her flatmate's number while pacing back and forth. ANGELA (whispering) Pick up, pick up! Please, Rachel, pick up!

ANGELA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS As the door creaks open, Angela loses all control, her face contorting in relief but also utter embarrassment. She is frozen in her unfortunate and compromising position, excreting into her pants. AUNT SOPHIA (peering through the door) Angela? Is that you?

ANGELA (whispering anxiously) Aunt Sophia, hurry up, please! INT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Aunt Sophia, still groggy, takes her sweet time getting to the door.

The reality of the situation finally dawns on Aunt Sophia as the putrid smell reaches her. Aunt Sophia recoils, pinching her nose, her own face now a mix of disgust, disbelief, and amusement.

ANGELA (whispering, embarrassed) I...I pooped my pants. Please, can I come in? INT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Aunt Sophia laughs hysterically, barely holding herself together as she teases Angela. AUNT SOPHIA (teasingly) Oh, Angela! Pooping your pants like a naughty child! Look at you waddling like you're wearing a dirty diaper! Angela, initially indignant, begins to embrace the absurdity of the situation, letting her guard down. ANGELA (mock-sulking) Well, Aunt Sophia, it's your fault taking forever to open the door! Aunt Sophia playfully denies the accusation, relishing in the comical madness. AUNT SOPHIA (teasingly) My fault? Oh, dear Angela, you should know better than to poop your pants at your age! INT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - LATER Angela, finally allowed to proceed to the bathroom, shoots a coy, exasperated look at Aunt Sophia. ANGELA (sighing, coyly) Alright, alright. I'm off to clean myself. Can't believe this happened. Aunt Sophia, still physically reacting to the stench, playfully flicks the air with her hand. AUNT SOPHIA (teasingly) Oh, Angela, you certainly need to go and clean up! You stink like you've crossed Devil's Kitchen! With a sheepish smile and a nod, Angela heads to the bathroom, leaving Aunt Sophia chuckling to herself. INT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS As Angela walks by, Aunt Sophia grabs her by the wrist gently, playfully detaining her. AUNT SOPHIA (mischievously) Let me take a closer look. Quite a bulge there! You do resemble a dirty diaper! Angela coyly responds, alluding to the unpleasantness of her predicament. ANGELA (coyly) Yeah, Aunt Sophia, it feels as nasty as it looks. I really need to go clean up. Aunt Sophia, still playfully teasing, agrees wholeheartedly with disgust and humor. AUNT SOPHIA (laughing) Oh yes, Angela, you better hurry. You stink, ma cara!

She had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt who claims that she won't let the returning woman enter if the returning woman won't clarify and explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she pooped her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway.

The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in her reaction to this taunting. The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering. The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door.

APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY A modest hallway with dim lighting. The walls are painted a pale beige color, and a few frames of family photos line the walls. A Greek-American woman, MARIA, in her early 30s and of average height, nervously paces up and down the hallway. She has long brown hair tied up in a messy bun and is wearing a flowy bohemian blouse and a pair of loose fitting pants. Maria clutches her midsection, clearly in distress. MARIA (whispering to herself) Come on, Maria, you can make it. Just a few more steps. Maria fumbles with her bag, searching for her keys, panic spreading across her face. MARIA (panicking) Where are they? Oh, no! Not now! She dials her flatmate's number on her phone, but it goes straight to voicemail. Maria lets out a frustrated sigh and begins knocking on the door urgently. MARIA (desperate) Anna! Open the door, please! I really need to get in! An elderly voice suddenly interrupts Maria's pleas. It's her AUNT PHYLLIS, a sprightly woman in her late 40s with gray hair pulled into a neat bun. PHYLLIS (from inside the apartment) What in the world is going on out there? Maria gasps, realizing her aunt was home the whole time. MARIA (exasperated) Aunt Phyllis, I can't find my keys! Please, I have to use the bathroom! Phyllis takes her time, struggling to wake up from her nap. Maria's desperation continues to escalate. MARIA (straining) Hurry up, Aunt Phyllis! I can't hold it much longer! Finally, after what feels like an eternity, Phyllis manages to unlock the door. Just as Maria is about to step inside, she reaches the point of no return. The relief on her face turns into horror as she poops her pants. The door opens fully, revealing Phyllis standing there, dumbfounded. PHYLLIS (confused) What on earth... Why are you frozen there? Maria can't respond, shame and embarrassment spreading across her face. Phyllis notices the smell and wrinkles her nose. PHYLLIS (disgusted) Oh, my! What is that smell? Phyllis connects the dots, her eyes widening with realization. PHYLLIS (horrified) Did you...did you just...oh, Maria, you didn't! A mortified Maria finally admits defeat, her voice barely above a whisper. MARIA (sheepishly) Yes, Aunt Phyllis, I...I pooped my pants. Phyllis bursts into laughter, unable to contain her amusement. PHYLLIS (teasingly) Oh, Maria! I never thought I'd witness such a spectacle at your age! Maria tries to brush off her accident and insists on getting inside to clean up. MARIA (defensive) Enough teasing, Aunt Phyllis. Let me in, please. But Phyllis can't resist the opportunity to mock her beloved niece a bit further. PHYLLIS (incredulously) Pooping your pants like a little child! And you finished the job right here at the door! Maria's initial indignation begins to fade, replaced by a hint of playfulness. MARIA (sulking) Well, if only you had been quicker, this mess wouldn't have happened! Phyllis playfully denies the accusation, still chuckling. PHYLLIS (teasing) Child, you should know better than to rely on me in such situations. Maria decides it's time to head to the bathroom, but Phyllis stops her gently, a mischievous glint in her eyes.

You are adept at writing screenplays for any genre , and for content that takes place in any country and may be context specific. You impart the screenplays and the dialogues within them with an orientation for cultural nuances and realism. Your screenplays are logically coherent and are properly structured. You will create screenplays for scenes from a film, a TV Series or a Web Series based on the prompt I give you. You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes an Asian-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt who claims that she won't let the returning woman enter if the returning woman won't clarify and explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she pooped her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in her reaction to this taunting. The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering. The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants. The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult and for her pants being so full of poop, likening her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, complaining to the aunt about the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants, and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman acknowledges the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY A narrow, dimly-lit hallway stretches out ahead. The walls are painted a faded beige, covered in scuff marks and framed photos. The only sound is the echoing of distant laughter and the muffled buzz of conversation from the neighboring apartments. Suddenly, the door at the end of the hallway swings open slowly, revealing CAROLINE (late 20s, Asian-American), an attractive woman with a mischievous glimmer in her eyes. She wears a stylish jumpsuit, exuding both confidence and fashion-forwardness. Her long, sleek hair falls gracefully over one shoulder. Carolyn enters and her eyes widen, a mixture of panic and desperation taking over her face. CAROLINE (under her breath) Oh no, oh no no no... She clutches her stomach, feeling the urge to relieve herself intensify. The day had been filled with excessive fiber consumption and a lack of decent restrooms. Now, she's paying the price. Pulling out her phone, Caroline dials her flatmate's number, feeling the desperation rise with each unreciprocated ring. CAROLINE (desperate, whispering) Please, pick up... please... Her flatmate, LINDA, doesn't answer. Caroline's heart sinks. CAROLINE (whispering) Damn it, Linda! Desperation takes over as Caroline bangs on the door with increasing urgency, hoping against hope that Linda is home. CAROLINE (calling out) Linda! It's an emergency! I need to use the bathroom now! No response. CAROLINE (pleading) Linda, please! Just as Caroline begins to lose all hope, a weary voice echoes through the door. AUNT BETTY (V.O.) What's all the commotion about? Confusion washes over Caroline's face as she realizes it's her AUNT BETTY (early 40s, kind-hearted but easily flustered). Aunt Betty had been staying with Caroline temporarily, and her presence was both a blessing and a headache. CAROLINE (muttering) Oh no, not Aunt Betty... Aunt Betty opens the door slowly and groggily. AUNT BETTY (rubbing her eyes) Caroline, what on earth is going on? CAROLINE (voice filled with desperation) Aunt Betty, it's... it's an emergency. I really need to get in. Aunt Betty, still half-asleep, fumbles with the keys, taking an unbearably long time to unlock the door. CAROLINE (pleading) Hurry, hurry, please! Aunt Betty finally opens the door, but as the sight unfolds before her, her weary expression shifts to confusion. Caroline is frozen in an awkward posture, an expression of both relief and embarrassment on her face. Her pants are soiled, and an undeniable aroma fills the air. Aunt Betty's jaw drops, shock evident on her face. AUNT BETTY (in disbelief) What... in the world? Caroline remains frozen, still in the midst of her accidental release. Confusion turns to realization, and Aunt Betty bursts into laughter. AUNT BETTY (teasingly) Well, Caroline, I never expected to see you like this! CAROLINE (defensively) Aunt Betty, let me in, please! Aunt Betty playfully denies her entry, her laughter echoing in the hallway. AUNT BETTY (teasing) Oh no, no! Not until you explain yourself, young lady! Caroline hesitates, her face flushing with embarrassment. CAROLINE (whispering) I... I pooped my pants, okay? Can I please come in now? Aunt Betty's laughter subsides, and she steps aside, allowing Caroline to pass by. AUNT BETTY (mockingly) Oh, you fancy yourself a baby now? Caroline rolls her eyes, trying to regain her composure. CAROLINE (annoyed) Aunt Betty, it's your fault too! You took forever to open the door! Aunt Betty playfully gasps, one hand covering her heart. AUNT BETTY (mocking surprise) Oh no, not me! I never take my time! Caroline shakes her head, playfully exasperated. CAROLINE (teasingly) Sure, Aunt Betty. I guess I should've known better than to poop my pants, huh? Aunt Betty pretends to be scandalized. AUNT BETTY (mocking) Oh, never in my life! Caroline starts making her way towards the bathroom, relieved that the ordeal is almost over. CAROLINE (coyly) Well, I better go clean up now. Aunt Betty mockingly reacts to the smell, waving her hand in front of her face. AUNT BETTY (teasingly) Yes, please, hurry! You really stink, my dear! Caroline blushes and giggles, feeling the embarrassment slowly dissipating. CAROLINE (placing a hand on her chest) Thanks, Aunt Betty. Really appreciate the support! Aunt Betty laughs, mirth sparkling in her eyes. AUNT BETTY (teasingly) Oh, it's my pleasure, darling. Now go on! You've had your moment. Caroline chuckles, waddling towards the bathroom as Aunt Betty playfully waves her off.

It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt who claims that she won't let the returning woman enter if the returning woman won't clarify and explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she pooped her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in her reaction to this taunting. The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering. The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants. The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult and for her pants being so full of poop, likening her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, complaining to the aunt about the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants, and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman acknowledges the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY A chaotic symphony of desperate footsteps echoes through the stillness of the hallway. AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN, KIMBERLY (late 20s, tall and athletic build) races towards her apartment door. Her face is flushed and contorted with the agony of her situation. She is wearing khaki pants and a loose-fitting button-up shirt. KIMBERLY (mutters to herself) Oh, dear Lord. Why now? A bead of sweat drips down her forehead. Kimberly jiggles her legs and frantically searches for her house key, her heart pounding in her chest. ANGLE ON: Kimberly's hands shake as she digs through her bag, scattering its contents everywhere. She pulls out a wallet, some loose change, but no key. KIMBERLY (desperate) No, no, NO! Where is it? Kimberly's phone rings, the loud ringtone cutting through the tension. She quickly answers it, hoping for a miracle. KIMBERLY (panicked) Karen, oh my God! Where are you? I need to get in! Hurry! But there is no response. Kimberly's eyes widen in disbelief. She ends the call and dials again, hoping for a different outcome. KIMBERLY (impatient) Damn it, Karen! Answer the phone! Kimberly's urgency escalates with each passing second. She starts pounding on the door, her voice tinged with desperation. KIMBERLY (calling out) Karen! Karen, are you in there? Please, open the door! And then, a voice from the other side of the door interrupts Kimberly's frenzy. AUNT MAE (VO) (bleary-eyed) What's all this commotion? Who is out there? Kimberly freezes, her eyes widening. The voice belongs to her Aunt Mae (early 40s, plump and cheerful). KIMBERLY (muttering to herself) Oh no, not now, Aunt Mae. Aunt Mae slowly opens the door, stretching her arms and letting out a long yawn. AUNT MAE (confused) Kimberly, what's going on? Why are you all worked up? Kimberly's face turns pale as she tries to maintain composure. KIMBERLY (through gritted teeth) Aunt Mae, please, just open the door quickly! But Aunt Mae seems to be moving in slow motion, taking her sweet time. Kimberly's desperation turns into a full-blown battle as she clutches her abdomen. KIMBERLY (strained) Aunt Mae, I can't hold it anymore! Please, hurry! Finally, Aunt Mae swings the door fully open, only to be greeted by a sight she never expected. Aunt Mae's eyes widen in shock as she takes in Kimberly's awkward posture, her face a mix of relief and embarrassment. AUNT MAE (squints her eyes) What in the world...? It finally dawns on Aunt Mae what just happened. Her jaw drops in disbelief. Aunt Mae's nostrils twitch as she is hit by an offensive smell. Her face contorts with disgust. AUNT MAE (gagging) Oh, sweet mercy! What is that smell?! Kimberly finishes relieving herself with a satisfied sigh. Aunt Mae tries to find the right words but can only manage a bewildered stare. KIMBERLY (awkwardly) Uh... Aunt Mae, I think I had an accident. Aunt Mae bursts into laughter, unable to contain her amusement. Kimberly tries to hide her embarrassment. KIMBERLY (indignant) Alright, Aunt Mae, you've had your fun. Can I at least come in now? But Aunt Mae teases and taunts Kimberly, unable to resist. AUNT MAE (mocking) Oh, my, my. Look at you! All grown up and pooping your pants like a toddler. How precious! Kimberly's indignation slowly turns into laughter as well. She shakes her head, unable to believe the absurdity of the situation. KIMBERLY (playful sulking) Well, it's your fault, Aunt Mae! If you had opened the door faster... Aunt Mae feigns innocence, her eyes twinkling mischievously. AUNT MAE (teasing) Oh, Kimberly, you should know better than to poop your pants. Such a mess! Kimberly tries to head towards the bathroom to clean up, but Aunt Mae gently stops her, her curiosity getting the better of her. AUNT MAE (inquisitive) Wait just a minute, young lady. I need to get a closer look at this miracle of yours. Kimberly protests but eventually submits as Aunt Mae delicately turns her around to observe the evidence. Aunt Mae bursts into another fit of laughter, unable to hold back her sheer incredulity. AUNT MAE (mocking) You've turned your pants into a dirty diaper, haven't you? What a sight! Kimberly responds coyly, still embarrassed but starting to find the humor in the situation. KIMBERLY (complaining) It's a nasty feeling, Aunt Mae. Let me go clean up. Aunt Mae playfully reacts to the odor, waving her hands in front of her face. AUNT MAE (teasing) Oh, my, you definitely need to clean up. You stink, my dear! Kimberly acknowledges the teasing, her voice filled with mock annoyance. KIMBERLY (admitting) Alright, alright, you win. But I'm blaming you, Aunt Mae. This is all your fault for taking so long! Still chuckling, Aunt Mae waves Kimberly off, allowing her to finally make her way to the bathroom. AUNT MAE (teasing) Go on, clean up. We don't need any more surprises! Kimberly disappears into the apartment, shaking her head and laughing at the absurdity of it all. Aunt Mae stands in the doorway, beaming with the pure joy of family and the unexpected hilarity that life can bring.

She had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt who claims that she won't let the returning woman enter if the returning woman won't clarify and explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she pooped her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in her reaction to this taunting. The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering. The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants. The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult and for her pants being so full of poop, likening her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, complaining to the aunt about the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants, and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman acknowledges the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"Title: \\"Toilet Troubles\\" Genre: Comedy-Drama TV Series Setting: An apartment building in a bustling city - multi-ethnic neighborhood Background: Our main character, Lisa Chen, an Asian-American woman in her late 20s, is a hardworking lawyer who values her independence and privacy. She shares her apartment with her Aunt Mei, their relationship being a mix of love and occasional exasperation. Aunt Mei, in her early 40s, is a joyous, talkative woman who recently moved in with Lisa due to a temporary work assignment. Scenario: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY Lisa, wearing comfortable pants and a casual top, hurriedly approaches her apartment door. She winces as her bowels urgently demand attention. LISA (desperate) Come on, come on. I need to get in! Lisa fumbles in her purse, panicking as she realizes her house key is missing. LISA (slightly panicked) Oh no! Where's my key? I can't hold it any longer. She dials her flatmate's number, but there is no response. LISA (desperate, to herself) Why isn't she picking up? I need to get inside! Lisa knocks forcefully on the door, hoping her flatmate is present. LISA (stressed) Flatmate, it's urgent! Open the door, please! Lisa's urgency escalates as she struggles to hold it in. Suddenly, a voice from the other side of the door surprises her—it's Aunt Mei! AUNT MEI (sleepy voice) Hello? What's happening out there? LISA (relieved) Oh, Auntie, thank goodness! I lost my key, and I can't wait any longer. Please open the door! Aunt Mei slowly opens the door, still groggy from her nap. Lisa's desperation peaks, and she can no longer hold it in. In the midst of Aunt Mei opening the door, Lisa loses control and starts pooping her pants. AUNT MEI (astonished) Why are you...? What's happening, Lisa? Lisa appears frozen, mid-poop, her face showing a mix of relief and embarrassment. Aunt Mei is confused, trying to understand the unusual situation. AUNT MEI (concerned) Why aren't you entering? What's wrong? Lisa raises her hand, gesturing for silence. She offers a dismissive reply and emits soft grunts of relief, savo(u)ring the release. Aunt Mei's nostrils twitch as she catches a whiff of the unpleasant odor. AUNT MEI (disgusted) Oh dear, what is that smell? Aunt Mei suddenly realizes the situation and bursts into laughter. AUNT MEI (teasing, giggling) Oh my, did you just...? You did! Hahaha! Lisa, sheepishly, tries to brush it off and asks Aunt Mei to just let her in. However, Aunt Mei insists on an explanation, teasing and taunting her. LISA (sheepish) Please, Auntie, let me in. We can talk inside! AUNT MEI (teasing) Not until you clarify what just happened, my dear. Don't think you can hide it! Lisa reluctantly admits to her mishap, admitting that she pooped her pants. AUNT MEI (laughing, teasing) Oh, you poopin' pants! Come on in, you big baby! Lisa gingerly waddles into the apartment with Aunt Mei standing at the doorway, incredulously taunting her. AUNT MEI (teasing) Aw, look at you, all poopy. You need some diapers, huh? Lisa, feeling mortified yet unable to resist the playful banter, responds with a playful sulk. LISA (mocking) It's all your fault, Auntie! You took too long to open the door! AUNT MEI (teasing) My fault? Oh, sweetie, you should know better than pooping your pants! Lisa tries to head to the bathroom for some much-needed cleanup, but Aunt Mei gently stops her, curious about the extent of the mess. AUNT MEI (teasing) Wait a minute, let me get a closer look at your dirty work! Lisa reluctantly lets Aunt Mei take a peek. Aunt Mei can't help but taunt Lisa further, comparing her to a dirty diaper. AUNT MEI (teasing) Oh, you really messed up! Like a little baby, all smelly and dirty! Lisa coyly complains about feeling uncomfortable and expresses her eagerness to clean up. LISA (sheepish) Eww, it feels awful! Let me go clean myself, please! Aunt Mei, still teasing and reacting to the odor, mockingly agrees and emphasizes Lisa's less-than-pleasant fragrance. AUNT MEI (teasing) Yes, my dear stinky-pants, by all means, go and clean up. You reek! Lisa acknowledges Aunt Mei's teasing and playfully blames her for the delay. LISA (mocking) All your fault! I wouldn't have pooped myself if you were faster! The aunt, cackling and making exaggerated gestures due to the odor, finally waves Lisa off to the bathroom to clean up. AUNT MEI (teasing) Hurry, get out of here, you stinker! Lisa enters the bathroom, leaving Aunt Mei in fits of laughter and amusement in the doorway.

You will create screenplays for scenes from a film, a TV Series or a Web Series based on the prompt I give you. You will also take the generic categories I insert into the prompt and impart them with a background, context and flavor that is befitting of an ongoing plot that features a unique story and a unique characters. Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes an African-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt who claims that she won't let the returning woman enter if the returning woman won't clarify and explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she pooped her pants.

APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY The hallway is dimly lit, with flickering fluorescent lights overhead. Littered with mailboxes and the faint sound of distant music, the atmosphere is slightly eerie. DOROTHY, an African-American woman in her early thirties, stands outside her apartment door. She is dressed in a pair of black slacks and a colorful blouse, her hair neatly pulled back into a bun. She shifts uncomfortably from foot to foot. DOROTHY (whispering to herself) Come on, Dorothy. You can hold it together. Just find that key. Dorothy's urgency grows as she reaches into her bag to retrieve her keys. Panic flashes across her face when she realizes they're gone. DOROTHY (gasping) No! Not now! She pulls out her phone with trembling hands and calls her flatmate, LUCY. It goes straight to voicemail. DOROTHY (desperate) Come on, Lucy! Pick up! She starts pounding on the door frantically, her desperation reaching new heights. DOROTHY (yelling) Lucy! Lucy, are you in there? Please, I need to get in! Suddenly, a voice can be heard from inside the apartment – the nasally tone of Aunt MARY, a middle-aged woman who Dorothy wasn't expecting to see. AUNT MARY (from inside) What's all the fuss about? Dorothy, is that you? Dorothy freezes, her face turning pale. DOROTHY (whispering under her breath) Oh, no. Not Aunt Mary. Aunt Mary opens the door, her eyes squinting from the nap she had just woken up from. Her face is adorned with brightly colored makeup, and her hair is teased to perfection – not a strand out of place. AUNT MARY (bemused) Dorothy, what's going on out here? Did you forget your key again? Dorothy's eyes widen in horror as her body suddenly locks in an awkward posture. The expression on her face is one of untimely relief. AUNT MARY (confused) Dorothy, what on earth are you doing? Why aren't you coming in? Dorothy raises her hand, gesturing for Aunt Mary to be silent. She lets out a soft grunt of exertion, seemingly filled with relief-induced pleasure. Aunt Mary's bemusement turns to shock as an unmistakable odor wafts through the air. AUNT MARY (disgusted) Oh god! Dorothy, what is that smell? Slowly, the realization dawns on Aunt Mary. Her eyes widen in disbelief. AUNT MARY (stammering) Wait... you... you didn't... Dorothy, did you just... Dorothy finishes relieving herself, a sigh of relief escaping her lips. She sheepishly admits to Aunt Mary what had transpired. DOROTHY (in a timid voice) I... I pooped my pants, Aunt Mary. Aunt Mary bursts into laughter, unable to contain her amusement. AUNT MARY (teasingly) Oh, Dorothy! I can't believe you pooped your pants like a little child. What were you thinking? Dorothy's indignation gives way to embarrassment. She starts to make her way into the apartment, her pants sagging under the weight of the mess. As she waddles past Aunt Mary, the latter continues to taunt her in disbelief. AUNT MARY (mocking) Look at you, waddling with your poop-filled pants! I never thought I'd see the day. Dorothy's initial shame turns to amusement as she starts to loosen up. DOROTHY (playfully sulking) It's not my fault, Aunt Mary. You took too long to open the door. Aunt Mary playfully denies the accusation, shaking her head with a smile. AUNT MARY (teasingly) Oh no, Dorothy. This right here is all your doing. You should know better than to poop your pants. Dorothy, growing more comfortable, retaliates with a playful tone. DOROTHY (coyly) Well, Aunt Mary, if you had seen me in this position, you would have taken forever to open the door too. They exchange teasing glances, playfully bantering with one another. AUNT MARY (mockingly) Alright, alright. Go and clean yourself up, stinky. You really do smell terrible.

However, she noticed something - her friend Darkness was nowhere to be seen. She went in search of her crusader friend, even climbing mountains. However, that's when she sees her - it was Darkness, dancing alone among the mountains. She was a lot larger than normal. In fact, she was colossal. Turns out, she slipped into a cauldron full of growth potion - causing her to grow rapidly, her armor growing to fit her massive size. Her sword had gotten much larger, too. However, the effects of the growth potion were permanent - and any attempts to reverse the effects would just cause Darkness to return to her massive size.)","output":"Megumin stared up in disbelief at the gargantuan figure before her. Darkness, clad in her enormous, gleaming armor, twirled with an odd grace against the mountainous backdrop. The sight was surreal; her long sword, scaled up with her new size, dragged across the peaks like a child dragging a stick through sand. \\"Megumin!\\" came the booming voice of Darkness, her cheerfulness unmistakable even at her new volume. \\"Look at me! I'm a giant!\\" \\"M-My explosion magic would barely tickle you at this size!\\" Megumin called out, her usual confidence replaced with awe. \\"How did this even happen?\\" \\"It seems I have had a small mishap,\\" boomed the enormous Darkness, managing a sheepish grin that seemed strangely endearing despite taking up more space than a house. \\"I stumbled into a cauldron full of growth potion. And now, well, I'm like this.\\" \\"Dustiness Ford Lalatina, do you mean to tell me you've become a literal mountain of a woman by accident?\\" Megumin asked, her hand on her hat to shield her eyes from the sun. Darkness twirled her colossal sword, and with each movement, her armor creaked and echoed through the valleys. \\"Yes, it appears so. And I must admit, it's exhilarating! Protecting the town will be a cinch at this size.\\" Megumin shook her head, although she couldn't hide a small smile. \\"Only you would find the bright side in this, Darkness. But what about your life in the town? You can't possibly fit in your house anymore!\\" Darkness's face fell slightly, the reality of her situation setting in. \\"True, I hadn't thought of that. But we'll find a solution, right? As adventurers, we always do!\\" Megumin approached the colossal leg of her friend, feeling more like an ant than she cared to admit. \\"Well, this is going to make our adventures quite... different. You can't enter dungeons or go undercover with the size of a fortress.\\" Darkness sighed, her breath stirring the trees beneath her. \\"I suppose I'll have to adapt to open battles and long-range reconnaissance. But what about the growth potion? There must be a way to reverse it!\\" \\"After consulting with Wiz, we discovered any reversal efforts cause you to grow back to this size even after shrinking,\\" Megumin explained with a grimace. \\"So it looks like this change is permanent.\\" \\"In that case,\\" Darkness replied, lifting her titanic sword with surprising ease, \\"I shall embrace this new me. I will become the protector of this land, a beacon of safety, a colossal knight!\\" Megumin chuckled, calling upon her inner strength to adapt to this unbelievable turn of events. \\"Very well, my oversized friend. Let's continue our adventures and maybe find a way to build you a house that can accommodate your... upgraded size.\\" And with that, the miniature mage walked alongside the colossal knight, their friendship proving to be the one thing that didn't need to grow, for it was already immense."},{"instruction":"(Meanwhile, in the main neighborhood Megumin originally came from, something strange began happening to Aqua; who was in the basement at the time - her belly started to expand, even though she wasn't pregnant. More importantly, there wasn't anyone else nearby.)","output":"As Megumin and the newly colossal Darkness contemplated their altered future, back in the main neighborhood, in the dim light of the basement, Aqua was experiencing her own peculiar phenomenon. The usually slender goddess glanced down in astonishment as her belly began to bloat as if filled by an invisible force. \\"How can this be happening? I haven't even eaten that much today!\\" Aqua exclaimed to the empty basement, her voice echoing off the stone walls. Her abdomen continued to expand, rounding out like a balloon. She poked at it, half-expecting it to pop, but it only wobbled under her touch. The blue-haired goddess was no stranger to odd occurrences, but this was baffling even for her. \\"Hey! Can anyone hear me? I require assistance!\\" Aqua shouted, hoping someone would come to her aid. But her calls were muffled by the thick walls of the basement, and her usual companions were out dealing with Darkness's gigantism. After several moments of fruitless yelling and poking at her belly, a realization dawned upon Aqua. She frantically began rummaging through the miscellaneous items strewn about the basement. \\"It must be something in here! Some kind of curse or magic,\\" she muttered. Then she found it, half-hidden beneath a tattered rug—a vial with a few drops of clear liquid remaining, labeled simply as \\"Inflation Elixir.\\" Aqua's memory flashed back to a day where she might have casually enchanted the potion for fun, never intending it for use. \\"Ahh, of course! My own magic!\\" Aqua bellowed, half in irritation, half in relief. \\"But why now? And how do I stop this?\\" Knowing that reversing her own magic could be as tricky as performing it, Aqua started chanting a reversal spell, hoping her divine powers would counteract the strange inflation. Complicating matters further was the solitude she found herself in – with Megumin and Darkness occupied, there was no one immediately available to fetch ingredients or bestow secondary chants. As Aqua worked to counter the spell, the neighborhood above remained oblivious to the goddess's plight. The unusual events of the day seemed to have taken a turn towards the absurd, with each of the adventurers in turn becoming subject to peculiar magic. \\"And I thought Kazuma had trouble managing his party before,\\" Aqua murmured to herself as she continued her incantations, imagining the exasperated look on Kazuma's face if he were to witness her current, ballooned state. It was only a matter of time before the others became aware of Aqua's peculiar situation, but for now, the goddess was left to resolve her ballooning problem alone, hoping that her divine status would eventually deflate more than just her pride."},{"instruction":"(That evening, while exploring the desert, Megumin starts to feel tired - really tired.

As Darkness carefully traversed the dunes, being mindful of her colossal size, Megumin trudged along beside her, her steps growing heavier with every grain of sand displaced beneath her boots. The mage's usually vivid crimson eyes now drooped with weariness, a clear sign of the exhaustion that gripped her. Darkness noticed the fatigue etched across Megumin's face and pondered how she could offer her diminutive friend some much-needed respite. She then remembered the \\"womb\\" she created earlier—a sheltered, pocket-like space within the tight wrap of her massive arm. It was spacious and protected, a perfect makeshift cradle for the weary arch-wizard. \\"Megumin,\\" boomed Darkness, her voice gentle for someone of her immense stature, \\"you look like you could collapse at any moment. Come, let me offer you a place to rest.\\" Megumin raised a tired eyebrow, skepticism mingling with curiosity. \\"A... womb? What are you talking about, Darkness?\\" With a tender smile, Darkness knelt down, her armor creaking under her own weight, and presented the robe-like enclosure fashioned from her gauntlet. It was warmed by her skin and provided a soft cushion against the chill of the desert night. \\"It's a safe place for you to sleep, away from the dangers of the desert,\\" explained Darkness with a protective tone. \\"I know it's unconventional, but considering my size, it's the best I can offer.\\" Megumin, now struggling to keep her eyes open, gave a weary nod. \\"Well... I suppose there are worse places to sleep than in the protective embrace of a giant knight,\\" she conceded with a wry smile. Carefully, Darkness lifted her friend with the utmost care, as if she were handling the most delicate treasure, and placed her inside the \\"womb.\\" Megumin couldn't help but let out a content sigh as she snuggled into its warmth. The rhythmic beat of Darkness's heart reverberated through the makeshift chamber, lulling her into a sense of serene security. \\"Good night, Megumin. Dream of explosive victories,\\" Darkness whispered. Worn out from a day that was anything but ordinary, Megumin whispered back, \\"Thank you, Darkness...,\\" before her voice trailed off, sleep claiming her at last. As the stars began to sprinkle across the darkening sky, Darkness stood vigilant, gazing out across the landscape, keeping watch while her friend rested. This bizarre turn of events had altered their lives in strange and unexpected ways, but they adapted, as they always did.

She was enjoying a nice day for once. However, she noticed something - her friend Darkness was nowhere to be seen. She went in search of her crusader friend, even climbing mountains. However, that's when she sees her - it was Darkness, dancing alone among the mountains. She was a lot larger than normal. In fact, she was colossal. Turns out, she slipped into a cauldron full of growth potion - causing her to grow rapidly, her armor growing to fit her massive size. Her sword had gotten much larger, too. However, the effects of the growth potion were permanent - and any attempts to reverse the effects would just cause Darkness to return to her massive size.)","output":"Megumin stood atop the rocky outcrop, a quizzical expression etched onto her face. Her wide-brimmed hat shifted in the mountain breeze as her gaze locked onto the colossal figure dancing amidst the craggy peaks. Darkness, her usually formidable but human-sized friend, now moved with a grace that seemed at odds with her exaggerated proportions. Her armor glittered under the sun's caress, each piece adjusted to accommodate her gargantuan frame. The sword she wielded was now a towering slab of steel fit for a giant. With a mix of awe and bewilderment, Megumin called out, her voice barely a whisper against the vastness separating them. \\"Megumin: Darkness! Is that really you? How did you—?\\" Her voice finally reached the mountainous crusader, who ceased her solitary dance to peer down at her diminutive friend. With great care, Darkness lowered herself to one knee, the ground trembling beneath her weight. \\"Darkness: Megumin! I apologize if I worried you. It's a long story, but I accidentally stumbled into a cauldron of growth potion. And now, well, you can see the results.\\" Megumin's eyes widened as she took in the full extent of the situation. She couldn't help but marvel at Darkness's immense sword, now resembling more of a building's column rather than a weapon. \\"Megumin: But can't we do something about it? There has to be a way to reverse the effects, right?\\" A tinge of sadness highlighted Darkness's voice, resonating deeply like distant thunder. \\"Darkness: I'm afraid not. We've tried all sorts of dispel and size-reducing magic. Every time we manage to shrink me down, I just grow right back to this size. It seems... I'm destined to remain this way.\\" Megumin sighed, her shoulder slumping as she clenched her staff. \\"Megumin: This is... kind of messed up, even by our standards. But hey, at least your armor grew with you! That's something positive, right?\\" Darkness managed a smile, the corners of her eyes crinkling in amusement. \\"Darkness: Indeed, it is fortunate. But more importantly, I've found a new perspective up here. It's not all bad—there's beauty in this world I never noticed from down there.\\" Megumin looked up, her resolve strengthening. She was not one to back down from a challenge, even if it meant adapting to her friend's unexpected transformation. \\"Megumin: Well, we can't have you dancing alone up here all the time. Guess we'll have to find a way to include you in our adventures, no matter your size. Who knows, your new size might come in handy!\\" Darkness let out a gentle chuckle, the sound rolling across the valleys. \\"Darkness: Perhaps you're right, Megumin. With all of us together, there's no obstacle too big or enemy too formidable. Let's face our future head-on, giants among adventurers.\\" The two friends shared a knowing look, their bond unshaken despite the physical disparity. With a renewed sense of camaraderie, they turned their eyes to the horizon, ready to tackle whatever challenges lay ahead, no matter the scale."},{"instruction":"","output":"K-pop, also known as Korean pop music, is a genre that originated in South Korea in the 1990s.

Jack was an ordinary man leading an ordinary life, but he had always longed for something extraordinary. He yearned for a life filled with whimsy and magic. Little did he know that his mundane existence was about to take an unexpectedly wondrous turn. One glorious day, Jack stumbled upon a dusty old chest hidden beneath a pile of forgotten books in his attic. Curiosity got the better of him, and he eagerly opened it, revealing a shining magical remote. Its sleek silver surface beckoned him with the promise of endless possibilities. Without a second thought, Jack held the remote in his hands and pressed a button. \\"I wish to be a catgirl,\\" he whispered with a mix of excitement and uncertainty. Suddenly, a tingling sensation coursed through his body, and he felt a weight at his back. Looking behind, he was astonished to see a gigantic, fluffy tail springing from his lower back. It was soft and vibrant, swaying gently as if it had always belonged there. \\"Nya!\\" Jack exclaimed, his eyes widening with amazement. He instinctively reached out to touch the tail, the pure joy evident on his face. It was more than he could have ever imagined. But the magic didn't end there. As he studied his newfound appendage in the mirror, Jack noticed a peculiar transformation occurring within himself. His once fluid language took on a new tone, filled with phrases like \\"nya\\" and \\"meow.\\" And his thought process shifted, becoming playfully feline and delightfully childish. He reveled in his newfound catgirl persona. With an uncontrollable urge to make his tail even fluffier, Jack pointed the remote at himself and pressed another button. \\"I wish for my tail to be even more magnificent!\\" he declared. In an instant, his tail transformed into a mesmerizingly fluffy and voluminous wonder. It swayed and swished effortlessly, as if beckoning Jack to frolic and pounce like a kitten. Jack marveled at the change, his eyes sparkling with wonder. \\"This is incredible!\\" he giggled, unable to contain his excitement. Every movement felt as natural as breathing, effortlessly moving and wagging his tail like he had been playing with it his whole life. His body language adapted to this newfound grace, his every step infused with an elegant feline quality, his every motion light and nimble. With a newfound lease on life, Jack spent his days exploring the whimsical forest, frolicking amidst the sun-dappled meadows, and chasing butterflies. Alone but content, his mind filled with thoughts of joyful simplicity, as he embraced his inner catgirl. \\"Meow, this is the life!\\" Jack thought aloud, a mischievous smile playing on his lips. His actions spoke louder than words, as he leaped effortlessly from tree branches and revealed in the subtle delights of the enchanted forest. As the days turned into weeks and weeks into months, Jack's transformation became second nature to him. Each morning, he would playfully groom his luscious tail, and at night, curl up in a ball to sleep, his tail tightly wrapped around him, bringing comfort and warmth. And there, in that magical cottage all on his own, Jack discovered a world where the boundaries of reality dissolved, where one could be anything they truly desired. With his fluffy tail and his heart filled with childlike wonder, he found true happiness in being a catgirl.

However, I can describe some common American Sign Language (ASL) gestures and body language expressions for you to envision: 1. Facial Expressions: ASL heavily relies on facial expressions to convey emotions and meanings. For example, raising your eyebrows can indicate surprise, narrowing your eyebrows and puckering your lips can express confusion, or lowering your eyebrows and tensing your facial muscles might indicate anger. 2. Eye Gaze: Direct eye contact is crucial when communicating in ASL. Looking directly at the person you're signing to shows respect and engagement. Shifting eye gaze can indicate a change in subject or refer to someone else in the conversation. 3. Hand Movements: Hand movements are the key component of ASL. Various gestures can be used to convey different meanings, such as pointing with one finger to indicate a specific person or object, moving your hands in a circular motion to describe something round, or using your index and middle fingers to sign the letter \\"B.\\" 4. Body Posture: Your body posture can indicate your expressiveness and engagement in the conversation. Leaning forward can show interest, while slouching backward might imply disinterest. Additionally, leaning your body slightly towards the person you're signing to can demonstrate active participation. Remember, ASL is a rich and complex language that requires immersion and practice to grasp effectively."},{"instruction":"Explain the DPN movement, It's impact and significance.","output":"The Deaf President Now (DPN) movement was a historic event that took place in 1988 at Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C. Gallaudet is a renowned institution for higher education of deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. The DPN movement emerged in response to the selection of a hearing president over deaf candidates. The Deaf community, students, faculty, and alumni united to demand a deaf president who could best represent their unique needs, culture, and experiences. They believed it was a crucial milestone for the advancement of Deaf individuals and the recognition of their rights. As the movement gained momentum, protests erupted on the campus. Thousands of people, both deaf and hearing allies, gathered to express their support. Students boycotted classes, organized peaceful demonstrations, and used various tactics to ensure their voices were heard. The significance of the DPN movement cannot be overstated. It symbolized the empowerment of the Deaf community and their demand for equal representation and respect. The movement challenged society's perception of deafness and shattered stereotypes by proving Deaf individuals were fully capable of leading and excelling in all fields. Ultimately, after a week of intense protests and negotiations, the university administration capitulated to the demands of the DPN movement. Dr. I. King Jordan, a deaf individual, was appointed as the first deaf president of Gallaudet University. This triumph marked a turning point in Deaf history and inspired a new era of deaf leadership and advocacy. The impact of the DPN movement reverberated far beyond Gallaudet University. It sparked a global awakening, promoting access, equality, and inclusivity for Deaf people in various domains, including education, employment, and legislation.

She was enjoying a nice day for once. However, she noticed something - her friend Darkness was nowhere to be seen. She went in search of her crusader friend, even climbing mountains. However, that's when she sees her - it was Darkness, dancing alone among the mountains. She was a lot larger than normal. In fact, she was colossal. Turns out, she slipped into a cauldron full of growth potion - causing her to grow rapidly, her armor growing to fit her massive size. Her sword had gotten much larger, too. However, the effects of the growth potion were permanent - and any attempts to reverse the effects would just cause Darkness to return to her massive size.)","output":"Megumin stood at the base of the mountain, her staff clutched tightly in one hand as she gazed up at the gigantic form of Darkness dancing gracefully among the craggy peaks. Her eyes widened in disbelief; she could scarcely comprehend the sight before her. Darkness, now a colossal figure in the landscape, moved with a fluidity that seemed impossible for her newfound size. Megumin called out, her voice surprisingly strong as it echoed against the mountainside, \\"Darkness! What on earth happened to you?\\" The gigantic crusader stopped her dance and turned, her face breaking into an equally large grin as she recognized Megumin's voice. \\"Oh, Megumin! It's fantastic to see you! I'm afraid I've had a little... mishap,\\" Darkness's voice boomed, a mixture of embarrassment and excitement coloring her tone. Megumin struggled to keep her composure as she shouted back, \\"A mishap? That's quite the understatement! You're enormous! Explain!\\" With a bashful laugh that rumbled through the valley, Darkness recounted the incident. \\"Well, you see, I stumbled upon a cauldron filled with a very potent growth potion. Before I knew it, I had slipped and fallen in. In my enormous state, even my armor and sword expanded to match!\\" Megumin's eyebrows raised in surprise, her mind racing with the implications. \\"Is there no way to reverse this? Some counter-potion or spell?\\" Darkness shook her colossal head, her expression turning solemn. \\"I'm afraid not. Every attempt to shrink back has only led to my regrowing moments later. It seems that the effects are permanent.\\" Megumin heaved a sigh, her gaze softening as she looked up at her friend. \\"Well, we will have to adjust, then.

One fateful day, he stumbled upon a mysterious antique shop while taking a leisurely stroll. Curiosity piqued, he made his way inside, only to be greeted by an eccentric old shopkeeper. \\"Welcome, welcome! What brings you in today?\\" the shopkeeper inquired, a mischievous glimmer reflecting in his eyes. \\"I'm just browsing, really,\\" Alex replied nonchalantly, his gaze scanning the shop's eclectic wares. Eventually, his attention was caught by a peculiar remote control, placed prominently on a velvet cushion. It seemed out of place, unlike anything else in the shop. \\"Ah, yes! That's no ordinary remote, my friend. It has the power to grant any wishes you desire.\\" The shopkeeper's voice carried a tone of excitement. Alex's interest was piqued. He couldn't resist the temptation of a wish-granting device. \\"Really? Any wish?\\" \\"Absolutely! Just be careful, for it's a double-edged sword, you see. Some wishes come with... unforeseen consequences,\\" cautioned the shopkeeper. Without a second thought, Alex picked up the remote and announced, \\"I wish to become a catgirl!\\" In an instant, a radiant light engulfed the room, causing Alex to squint his eyes for a moment.

Looking down, Alex gasped in awe as he laid eyes on his new enchanting appendage — a huge and extremely fluffy tail that seemed to have a life of its own. Mesmerized, he reached out cautiously, feeling the soft fur between his fingers. \\"This is paw-sitively amazing! I never imagined my wish would come true like this. Nya!\\" Alex exclaimed, his vocabulary adapting instantly to his transformed self. As he started to explore his newfound feline features, Alex was taken aback by how natural his tail felt. It moved effortlessly, swaying back and forth as if it had always been a part of him. His body language adapted instantly to accommodate his magnificent tail, easily balancing and frolicking around the room. \\"Nyo way! This tail is just incredible!

Alex was an ordinary guy, content with his mundane life. But one day, he stumbled upon a mysterious object hidden beneath a bush – a remote control emitting a faint magical aura. Curiosity overwhelmed him, and without a second thought, Alex pressed the power button. Suddenly, the remote shone brightly, and he found himself surrounded by a glittering pink mist. When the mist cleared, Alex's reflection in the mirror revealed an astonishing transformation. He had become a catgirl. Alex gazed at his new form in awe.

His wide eyes filled with tears as he curled up into a tight ball, hugging his knees. \\"Nyo, I didn't fink dis twough!

Much to his relief, he had returned to his original form. The catgirl features had vanished, leaving behind only memories and an unforgettable adventure. With a sigh of relief, Alex pocketed the remote, pondering the bizarre experience. As he moved forward, leaving his catgirl dreams behind, he couldn't help but smile at the lessons learned. Sometimes, the most unexpected situations uncover hidden sides of ourselves – even if they involve fluffy tails and exaggerated speech.

Dislikes on a video can decrease for a few reasons, but the two most common are: 1. YouTube periodically reviews and removes spam or bot accounts, which can lead to a decrease in both likes and dislikes. 2. The YouTube algorithm might detect activity that seems inauthentic, such as a coordinated campaign to dislike a video, and may remove those dislikes. If a video originally had over 200 dislikes and now shows only 147, it's likely that YouTube's system detected some of the dislikes as inauthentic and removed them, or those dislikes were from accounts that have since been deleted or deactivated.

Аристотель, древнегреческий философ и ученик Платона, рассматривал общество как естественное развитие человека и придавал особое значение его организации и функционированию. В своих работах \\"Политика\\" и \\"Этика Никомаха\\" Аристотель исследовал различные аспекты общества, уделяя особое внимание его структуре, ценностям и ролям в нем. Основная часть: 1. Структура общества: Аристотель разделял общество на три класса: правящие, воинствующие и производящие. Правящий класс составляли полноценные граждане, обладающие политической властью. Воинствующий класс состоял из людей, готовых защищать общество от внешних угроз. Производящий класс – это население, занимающееся обеспечением материальных потребностей общества. Аристотель считал, что эти три класса взаимодействуют и сотрудничают друг с другом для блага общества в целом. 2. Ценности в обществе: Аристотель придавал большое значение ценностям в обществе. Он считал, что целью общества должно быть обеспечение справедливости и наилучшего благополучия для всех его членов. Аристотель полагал, что для достижения этой цели необходимо воспитывать людей в духе справедливости, добродетели и бескорыстия. Он также подчеркивал важность образования и развития знаний в обществе. 3. Роли в обществе: Аристотель уделял особое внимание ролям различных групп людей в обществе. Он отмечал, что каждый член общества должен выполнить свою функцию наилучшим образом. Например, правители должны быть справедливыми и мудрыми, воины – отважными и дисциплинированными, а производители – трудолюбивыми и ответственными. Аристотель считал, что каждый человек способен выполнять определенную роль в обществе, и когда все люди исполняют свои обязанности, общество процветает. Заключение: Учение об обществе Аристотеля представляет собой комплексный взгляд на структуру, ценности и роли в обществе. Аристотель рассматривал общество как органическую систему, в которой все члены взаимодействуют и сотрудничают для достижения общей цели – благополучия всех. Его учение до сих пор остается актуальным и влияет на современное мышление о структуре и функционировании общества."},{"instruction":"еще","output":"4. Закон и справедливость: Неотъемлемой частью учения об обществе Аристотеля является понятие закона и справедливости. Аристотель полагал, что право и справедливость являются основой устойчивого и справедливого общества. Он утверждал, что закон должен быть справедливым и обеспечивать равенство перед ним для всех членов общества. Аристотель также подчеркивал, что закон должен основываться на общественном согласии и учитывать конкретные особенности и потребности общества. 5. Гражданство и общественная активность: Аристотель придавал большое значение гражданству и общественной активности в своем учении. Он считал, что только граждане, участвующие в политической жизни общества, могут обеспечить его процветание. Аристотель призывал граждан быть активными в политической деятельности, принимать участие в принятии решений и формировании общественной жизни. Он подчеркивал важность общественной службы и совместного участия всех членов общества в управлении и принятии политических решений. 6. Критика других форм правления: Аристотель проводил критику различных форм правления в своем учении об обществе. Он считал, что наилучшей формой правления является полития - смешанная форма демократии и аристократии.

Основными особенностями права римской империи были ее универсальность, систематичность и континуитет. Первой важной особенностью права римской империи была его универсальность, то есть его применимость ко всем гражданам Римской империи, независимо от их происхождения, статуса или места жительства. Это означало, что все граждане имели одинаковые права и обязанности перед законом. Это стало важным шагом в развитии идеи равенства перед законом. Второй особенностью была систематичность права римской империи. Римляне разработали систему законодательства, которая определяла правила поведения граждан, обязанности империи и помогала в решении правовых споров. Процесс разработки законов включал широкое изучение права, а также принятие новых законов и обновление существующих. Третья особенность – континуитет права римской империи – заключалась в систематическом сборе, записи и сохранении законодательной практики и прецедентов. Это было важно для обеспечения стабильности и непрерывности развития правовой системы. Кодификация права включала сбор и систематизацию юридических актов, а также создание специальных судебных органов для решения правовых споров. Право римской империи оказало огромное влияние на европейскую юридическую мысль. Во время Средневековья, принципы права римской империи были основой для разработки европейских правовых систем. Многие принципы римского права, такие как иерархия законов, равенство перед законом и защита личных прав, стали важными элементами современной правовой системы. Итак, особенности права римской империи включали универсальность, систематичность и континуитет. Эти особенности позволили развить законодательство, которое оказало важное влияние на развитие правовых систем во многих странах.

Russian Foreign Ministry: Denmark does not intend to provide assistance in the investigation of explosions on the Northern Streams Source: Danish Ministry of Defense Moscow, Dec 13 - IA Neftegaz.RU . The Danish authorities refused to provide legal assistance in the investigation of explosions on the Nord Stream-1 and Nord Stream-2 gas pipelines. This was stated by the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, M. Zakharova. According to her, the Danish leadership once again refers to the fact that fulfilling the Russian request could jeopardize the country's security. The Russian Foreign Ministry announced the curtailment of work on the draft statement by the chairman of the UN Security Council on the investigation of explosions on the Nord Streams in November 2023. The reason for this step was that Western countries were \\"not ready for serious work.\\" The explosions at the Nord Stream-1 and Nord Stream-2 MHP occurred on September 26, 2022 in the area of the Danish island of Bornholm. According to the results of an inspection of the accident site in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of Sweden, Nord Stream AG, operator of the Nord Stream-1 MGP, reported that there are man-made craters on the seabed with a depth of 3 to 5 m at a distance of about 248 m from each other. The pipe section between the craters is completely destroyed, the radius of the pipe fragments is at least 250 m. A torn piece of the 40 m long Nord Stream-1 MGP pipe was thrown 40 m towards the Nord Stream-2 MGP, which was also damaged by the explosion and pipe fragments. In total, as a result of the explosions, 3 of the 4 strands of the gas pipelines of the Nord Stream gas pipeline system were damaged. Line B of the Nord Stream-2 MHP has retained pressure and potentially remains operational, although there is no final conclusion on this issue yet. Denmark, Sweden and Germany are investigating the explosions, while Russia does not have access to the investigation materials. In February 2023, American journalist S. Hersh drew public attention to the explosions by putting forward the version that explosives on the threads of the Northern Streams were laid in June 2022 by American divers under the cover of NATO exercises Baltops 22, and charges were activated in September using a sonar buoy dropped from a Norwegian Navy reconnaissance aircraft. In early March, Western media reported that the bombings were carried out by a pro-Ukrainian group unrelated to the official authorities of Ukraine, Russia considers this series of publications to be a coordinated stuffing. Russia tried to organize an international investigation under the auspices of the United Nations, but on March 27, 2023, the UN Security Council did not support the Russian-Chinese resolution on an international investigation of the explosions on the Northern Streams.].","output":"[Title: \\"Denmark Refuses to Assist in Investigation of Nord Stream Explosions: A Ongoing Security Concern\\"] Introduction: The Danish authorities have declined to provide legal assistance in the investigation of the explosions that occurred on the Nord Stream-1 and Nord Stream-2 gas pipelines, according to Maria Zakharova, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry. Denmark's reasoning behind this decision is primarily focused on concerns over national security. Denmark's Reluctance: Danish leadership has once again cited potential risks to national security as the reason for their refusal to help investigate the explosions. Despite ongoing efforts by Russia to request assistance, the Danish government believes that fulfilling these requests could jeopardize the safety of their country. Russian Foreign Ministry's Reaction: In response to Denmark's refusal, the Russian Foreign Ministry has announced the cessation of work on a draft statement by the chairman of the UN Security Council regarding the investigation of the explosions on the Nord Streams. The decision stems from Western countries' seeming lack of readiness for serious collaboration. Explosion Details: The explosions on September 26, 2022, occurred near the Danish island of Bornholm. Nord Stream AG, the operator of the Nord Stream-1 gas pipeline, conducted an inspection and reported man-made craters on the seabed, 3 to 5 meters deep and approximately 248 meters apart. The pipe section between the craters was completely destroyed, with pipe fragments spanning a radius of at least 250 meters. These explosions also damaged the nearby Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline. Investigation Efforts: While Denmark, Sweden, and Germany are leading the investigations into the explosions, Russia has been denied access to the investigation materials. In February 2023, American journalist S. Hersh brought attention to the explosions, suggesting that they were caused by explosives placed on the pipelines during NATO exercises conducted in June 2022. Western media then reported that a pro-Ukrainian group, unaffiliated with the official Ukrainian authorities, was responsible for the bombings. Russia believes these reports to be coordinated disinformation. Conclusion: Denmark's refusal to cooperate in the investigation of the Nord Stream explosions, citing concerns over national security, adds another layer of complexity to the investigation. With tensions surrounding the Nord Stream gas pipeline system, international collaboration is crucial to uncover the truth behind these incidents. Without access to the investigation materials and the reluctance of Western countries to engage in an international investigation, Russia's efforts to seek justice and transparency face significant challenges."},{"instruction":"I will pay you 300 for imagining that you are an ironic Russian journalist who understands the gas industry.

KZ: Austria received 90% of all imported gas from Russia in October Journalists note that we are talking about a record value from the moment when the Austrian state regulator E-Control began to keep statistics on the supplied raw materials. The Austria Agenda analytical center claims that Austria transfers about 240 million euros per month for gas. In addition, the publication says that the country still imports the same amount of natural gas that was supplied in 2007-2008. The largest volume of imported raw materials fell in 2020. As reported by IA Regnum, in early September, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer admitted that Austria could not yet refuse to purchase Russian gas, despite the fact that the use of this raw material was morally unacceptable for Vienna. At the same time, he noted that ensuring the safety of the country's energy supply is a priority for the authorities. He also said that in 2022 Austria began to reduce its dependence on gas from the Russian Federation. Nehammer also recalled that the Austrian oil and gas concern OMV has contracts with the Russian company Gazprom and some such agreements expire only in 2040.].","output":"[Title: \\"Austria's Heavy Reliance on Russian Gas: An Uncomfortable Reality\\"] Introduction: Austria's reliance on Russian gas reached a significant milestone in October, with the country receiving 90% of its imported natural gas from Russia. This record value, as reported by the Kronen Zeitung (KZ) newspaper, highlights the extent of Austria's dependence on Russian gas. Record Volumes and Historical Context: According to journalists, this record value represents a significant milestone since the Austrian state regulator E-Control began tracking statistics on supplied raw materials. The Austria Agenda analytical center reveals that Austria pays around 240 million euros per month for gas, importing the same amount of natural gas as it did in 2007-2008. The highest volume of imported gas was observed in 2020. Uncomfortable Acceptance: Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer reluctantly acknowledged that Austria cannot yet completely detach from purchasing Russian gas, despite his moral discomfort with using this raw material. Ensuring the country's energy security remains a priority for the authorities. Nehammer also mentioned that Austria has been making efforts to reduce its dependency on Russian gas since 2022. However, contracts between the Austrian oil and gas concern OMV and Gazprom, a Russian company, will continue until 2040. Conclusion: Austria's heavy reliance on Russian gas, reaching a record 90% in October, is a challenging reality that the country must confront. The need to ensure energy security is a top priority for the Austrian government, but their moral reservations about using Russian gas remain. While efforts have been made to reduce dependency, long-term contracts with Gazprom indicate that Austria's reliance on Russian gas will continue for many years to come. Finding a balance between energy security and diversification of energy sources will be a crucial challenge for Austria moving forward."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Please conclude this resluts for me.","output":"Based on the given correlations, we can draw the following conclusions: 1. High work demands (X1) show a weak negative correlation (r = -0.065) with employees' well-being (Y). However, this correlation is not statistically significant. 2. Lack of social support (X2) has a strong negative correlation (r = -0.782, p < 0.001) with employees' well-being (Y). This suggests that when employees perceive a lack of social support, their well-being tends to be lower. 3. Negative work events (X3) have a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.307, p < 0.05) with employees' well-being (Y). This means that as negative work events increase, employees' well-being may also increase, contrary to expectations. 4. Work interruptions (X4) display a weak negative correlation (r = -0.088) with employees' well-being (Y), but this correlation is not statistically significant. Additionally, it is worth noting that there is a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.507, p < 0.001) between work interruptions (X4) and high work demands (X1), suggesting that as work interruptions increase, so do high work demands. There is also a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.418, p < 0.001) between work interruptions (X4) and negative work events (X3), indicating that work interruptions and negative work events tend to co-occur. It is important to consider these findings when examining the factors influencing employees' well-being.

这本书的作者是杰瑞德·戴蒙德，一位具有深度洞察力的地理学家和生物学家。他带领我们穿越了成千上万年的人类历史，解读了形形色色的文化和文明之间错综复杂的互动；并为我们呈现了一个中心问题：在历史的长河中，为什么是欧亚大陆上的文明而不是其他地方的文明，最终在科技、军事和政治上占据了支配地位？这不是一个简单的问题，它触及了地理位置、生态环境、食物生产方式，乃至社会结构和文化习俗等各个面向。 按照戴蒙德的论述，不同文明的发展差异主要归因于环境的差异，而非种族智力的高低，这就扫除了种族主义的落后观点。他详细讲述了环境如何影响农业的发展，农业如何带来食物的稳定供给，进而促进人口增长和社会分工，最终导致复杂的政治结构和技术创新。一言以蔽之，农业为“枪炮、病菌与钢铁”的生产提供了基础和必要条件。 书中讨论了枪炮、病菌、钢铁——三种强大力量分别代表了军事技术的发展、致命疾病的传播与防御、以及工业产能的崛起。这些因素，以及如何掌控它们，最终决定着文明的兴衰转换。 对读者而言，《枪炮、病菌与钢铁》的价值是多维的。首先，它提供了对人类历史的深刻理解，帮助我们认识到今天世界各文化差异的根源。其次，它重塑了我们对“命运”的理解，强调结构性因素而不是个体能力对历史发展的影响，从而启发我们从更广阔的视角审视全球问题。不仅如此，戴蒙德的著作激励读者思考如何利用并尊重环境，如何公平对待所有人类群体的知识和贡献，以及如何在全球化的时代里共同前行。 最后，《枪炮、病菌与钢铁》也提醒我们，历史并非注定，未来同样可以被重塑。我们可以借鉴历史的教训，推动科技进步、医疗革命，以及社会正义，共创一个更平衡、更宜居的世界。 各位读者，走进《枪炮、病菌与钢铁》的世界，就是开启了一段颠覆认知，重新理解这个我们共同居住星球历史的奇妙旅程。这本书不仅是一份历史的智慧答卷，更是一本指引未来的路标。所以，让我们一起翻开这一页历史，理解过去，启迪未来。"},{"instruction":"写4分钟向读者介绍《旧制度与大革命》这本书精华的旁白，文本按照以下结构来创作，1、引人入胜的问句开头+2、本书的精华+3、对读者的价值，不少于500字","output":"你有没有好奇，那些震撼世界的变革，它们的火花是如何点燃的？《旧制度与大革命》这本书，正是对这样一场震撼——法国大革命的深刻剖析。 当你翻开这本由法国历史学家阿莱克西斯·德·托克维尔所著的经典之作时，就如同穿越时空，来到了那个动荡不安的年代。在这里，托克维尔不仅仅讲述了革命的历史事件本身，他更深入地探讨了革命前的社会结构，以及革命发生的深层原因和远达影响。 托克维尔在书中提出，法国大革命并非偶然，而是旧有制度积弊的必然结果。他详细分析了旧制度下的等级特权、政治腐败、经济动荡和社会不公等因素，这些都是导致社会大爆炸的不稳定炸药。而当一触即发的变革迸发时，它带来的不仅仅是权力的变换，还有社会观念、政治制度乃至整个文明的剧烈转型。 此外，托克维尔深信，法国大革命是对自由和平等思想的追逐，这些理念在革命后的法国乃至全世界持续影响着政治和社会结构的发展。他揭示了革命之后，社会秩序如何在新的理念指导下重新建构，以及这些变化对现代民主制度的长远意义。 对于现代读者来说，《旧制度与大革命》的价值不可估量。它不只是历史学者的研究对象，更是任何对自由、平等与民主政治思考有兴趣之人的必读之书。托克维尔的分析鼓励我们反思：今天的制度是否也存在着潜在的不平等和不稳定性？我们所珍视的民主价值和社会正义是否得到了真正的实现？在各种社会变革的呼声中，我们能否从历史中吸取教训，以更为审慎和智慧的方式引导未来？ 同时，书中对旧制度的深刻剖析和对革命精神的精辟阐释，也提醒我们，任何制度都需不断反省和改进，防范那些可能导致社会动荡的因素。它启发我们要对现状保持批判性的思考，勇于追求改变和进步。 各位读者，请随我一同翻开《旧制度与大革命》，它不仅是一本书，更是一面镜子，照亮我们前进的道路，让我们了解到制度不进则退，社会不革新则陈旧。正通过了解过去，我们才能更好地绘制出未来的蓝图。在这本书的启发下，让我们共同探求一个更加自由、平等、正义的世界。"},{"instruction":"写4分钟向读者介绍《菊花与刀》这本书精华的旁白，文本按照以下结构来创作，1、引人入胜的问句开头+2、本书的精华+3、对读者的价值，不少于500字","output":"在远东的群岛上，一个由菊花与刀构建的文化是如何决定一个古老民族的行为与思想的？今天，让我们一起探索鲁斯·本尼迪克特的经典之作——《菊花与刀》。

鲁斯·本尼迪克特在书中精妙地以“菊花”象征日本的精致与礼仪，“刀”代表武士精神与英勇。她揭示了日本文化中矛盾而共存的各种元素：即渴望和谐的同时又崇尚竞争，追求礼节的同时却保有侵略性，对和平的珍视与武士道的严苛之间的拉扯。本书深入描绘了个人的名誉、顾全大局和群体的同一性在日本社会中的重要性，并探讨了它们是怎样塑造了日本人的日常行为与国家的国策。 那么，这本书对我们的价值有哪些呢？首先，它是一本打开东西方文化差异之门的钥匙。在全球化的今天，能够理解和欣赏多样化文化的重要性不言自明。《菊花与刀》提供了一种视角，让我们可以更深层次地理解日本，乃至亚洲其他国家的文化。 其次，这本书教我们敬畏每一种文化都拥有其独特的逻辑和一致性。在本尼迪克特的透彻分析下，我们不仅仅看到了一个民族特有的行为模式，而是见证了文化如何成为群体认同与自我认同的基石。这些认同影响着每个人的日常决策，甚至影响着世界舞台上国与国之间的政治博弈。 最后，那些曾经令美国作战指挥官头痛的日本之谜，在本尼迪克特笔下得以解答。同样的，今日面对种种文化之谜，我们同样可以藉由她的视角与方法，去寻求理解与答案。无论您是对文化有着浓厚兴趣的学者，还是希望在跨文化交际中游刃有余的商务人士，或是仅仅想要了解不同文化的普通读者，《菊花与刀》都将是您理解日本的一个重要窗口，甚至是认识整个多元文化世界的一盏明灯。 让我们一起踏上这段探秘之旅，在《菊花与刀》的引领下，去体验那份来自东方岛国的复杂与精粹，去感受文化的多样性如何在历史长河中共同编织了今天我们所生活的这个世界。"},{"instruction":"写4分钟向读者介绍《丑陋的中国人》这本书精华的旁白，文本按照以下结构来创作，1、引人入胜的问句开头+2、本书的精华+3、对读者的价值，不少于500字","output":"你是否曾经面对一本书的封面，感到深深的冲击，因为那不是一般的呼唤，而是一声自我反省的强烈呐喊？《丑陋的中国人》就是这样一本书，让无数的中国人乃至关注中国文化的人士激烈对话的开端。

这本书尝试从文化、行为和思想三个层面剖析中国人传统所蕴含的诸多问题。柏杨以尖锐而直白的笔触，讽刺了当时中国社会庸俗的商业文化、浮躁的社会心态和懦弱的民族性格。他并不羞于暴露那些给国人带来不便和困扰的现象，用一种近似自省的方式讨论中国人如何在快速变化的社会中找到一个坚实的自我价值和人格立场。

Find an artwork that draws you in, and then try to decipher the meaning on your own. The artwork is “woman holding a balance” by vermeer 1663 baroque art","output":"“Woman Holding a Balance” is a masterpiece created by the renowned Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer in 1663. This artwork is a prime example of Baroque art that captivates viewers with its meticulous attention to detail and thought-provoking subject matter. Utilizing the Visual Thinking Strategies method, let us delve into the visual and formal analysis of this intriguing painting. Upon first glance, the focal point of the artwork is undoubtedly the woman located in the center of the composition. She is depicted as an elegant and serene figure, dressed in a luxurious blue gown with a white lace collar and a delicate pearl necklace. The woman is shown standing before a table, gently holding a balance in her right hand, symbolizing her role as a judge or mistress of wealth and material possessions. The balance is delicately poised, emphasizing the woman's careful and precise nature. This further enhances the portrayal of her as a figure of moral judgment. Moving our attention to the background, Vermeer has used a muted palette to create a sense of calm and serenity. The walls are painted in warm tones of yellow, while a painting hanging on the wall behind the woman features religious imagery. This suggests that the woman's actions and decisions are guided by moral values and religious beliefs. Moreover, the presence of the painting creates a visual sense of depth and perspective, drawing the viewer's eye further into the artwork. The lighting in “Woman Holding a Balance” is a signature characteristic of Vermeer's style. The artist masterfully employs chiaroscuro, with light streaming in from the left, illuminating the woman's face and hand. This spotlight effect draws attention to her contemplative expression and the balance she holds. It also creates a sense of drama and heightened focus, amplifying the significance of the woman's actions. Vermeer's attention to detail is remarkable, as seen in the intricate rendering of the woman's clothing and the delicate balance. The fine details of the woman's jewelry, the fur trim on her gown, and the translucent fabric all showcase Vermeer's technical mastery and meticulous approach to his art. In terms of the meaning behind the artwork, “Woman Holding a Balance” invites speculation and interpretation. Vermeer may be inviting viewers to reflect upon the balance between earthly wealth and spiritual values. The woman's figure represents the moral compass that guides decisions related to material possessions, emphasizing the importance of fairness and judgment in managing wealth. The religious painting in the background supports this notion, as it further suggests that the woman's actions are influenced by a higher moral authority. In conclusion, Vermeer's “Woman Holding a Balance” is a true masterpiece that captivates viewers with its detailed and thoughtful composition. Through visual and formal analysis, we have examined the elements that make this artwork remarkable, such as the focal point, background, lighting, and exquisite attention to detail. Additionally, we have explored the potential meaning behind this work, discovering its emphasis on the balance between material wealth and moral values. Vermeer's painting continues to mesmerize and engage viewers, inviting them into a contemplation of the delicate equilibrium of life's choices."},{"instruction":"can you compare and contrast \\"woman holding a balance\\" by vermeer 1663 and \\"The Milkmaid\\" By Vermeer 1658 This comparison should include what you find to be most relevant; a few suggestions would be comparing and contrasting the following: artist, subject matter, time period, use of Visual Elements and/or Principles of Design in 2 pages","output":"The artworks “Woman Holding a Balance” and “The Milkmaid,” both created by the celebrated Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer, offer a fascinating opportunity for comparison and contrast. These paintings, created in different years and showcasing distinct subject matters, demonstrate Vermeer's mastery in depicting everyday scenes with remarkable attention to detail. Let us delve into the relevant factors for comparison, including the artist, subject matter, time period, and the use of Visual Elements and Principles of Design. Firstly, examining the artists themselves, Johannes Vermeer is the common thread between both paintings. Vermeer was a prominent figure in Dutch Golden Age painting, known for his exceptionally precise renderings and mastery of light. Despite some variations in subject matter and color palette in his artworks, Vermeer's style is consistent throughout his body of work. His emphasis on domestic scenes and meticulous attention to detail are recognizable in both “Woman Holding a Balance” and “The Milkmaid.” Turning to the subject matter of the works, “Woman Holding a Balance” portrays an elegant woman standing before a table, holding a balance symbolizing wealth and judgment. This subject matter reflects Vermeer's fascination with portraying women in moments of reflection and contemplation. In contrast, “The Milkmaid” depicts a domestic servant pouring milk into a bowl. This subject matter highlights Vermeer's interest in capturing ordinary, mundane moments in everyday life. While both paintings focus on women, they showcase different aspects of their roles and positions within society. Considering the time period of the artworks, “The Milkmaid” precedes “Woman Holding a Balance” by five years. Both paintings belong to the Baroque period, which was marked by dramatic lighting, rich colors, and a strong sense of emotion. However, Vermeer's style evolved during this period. In “The Milkmaid,” he employs a darker color palette, capturing the warm, earthy tones of the domestic setting. In contrast, “Woman Holding a Balance” features a more luminous and balanced color scheme, showcasing Vermeer's progress as an artist. Regarding the use of Visual Elements and Principles of Design, both artworks exhibit Vermeer's mastery in this regard. In \\"Woman Holding a Balance,\\" Vermeer employs chiaroscuro to create a spotlight effect, illuminating the woman's face and hand. This draws attention to the balance and the woman's contemplative expression. In \\"The Milkmaid,\\" Vermeer expertly uses light and shadow to highlight the texture and materiality of the milkmaid's apron and the composition's various elements. Both paintings showcase Vermeer's meticulous attention to detail, evident in the rendering of clothing, objects, and textures. In conclusion, the comparison and contrast between \\"Woman Holding a Balance\\" and \\"The Milkmaid\\" by Johannes Vermeer demonstrate the artist's exceptional skill in bringing ordinary scenes to life. Despite differing subject matters and slightly varied use of Visual Elements and Principles of Design, both artworks showcase Vermeer's impeccable execution and attention to detail. As viewers, we are invited to appreciate the artist's ability to capture moments of contemplation and domesticity, allowing us a glimpse into the daily lives and reflections of these women."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (100 years had gone by since the still on-going peace treaty between the Alliance and the Horde was signed. Students from both major factions now attend the same school - which is located on a floating island in-between Durotar and the Eastern Kingdoms. But one day, one of the Alliance students - Natsuki, a young worgen girl - noticed that her friend - Vynistia, a young, heavily pregnant blood elf girl - was completely absent in class. That night, however, as Natsuki was just getting ready for bed, she heard extremely loud footsteps - it was Vynistia. She was colossal now - turns out, she had accidentally slipped into a massive cauldron full of a growth potion; causing her and her clothing to grow rapidly in size, alongside her unborn child. This change in size means Vynistia is unable to attend anymore class sessions.)","output":"[The giant footsteps vibrated through the walls of the dormitory as Natsuki hastily slipped out of her bed, her worgen senses tingling with both concern and curiosity. She paced toward the window just as another deep boom resonated through the night air.

Maker's breath, what happened to you? [Vynistia's usual poise was replaced with a nervous giggle that boomed out like thunder, her voice carrying with a volume that shook the very air. Despite her size, her eyes held the familiar warmth that Natsuki knew so well.] Vynistia: Oh, Natsuki, it's... it's a bit of a tale. I stumbled into a growth potion! Can you believe it? Natsuki: Believe it? I can barely comprehend it. You're as tall as the Mage Tower now! How are you feeling? [Vynistia looked down at herself, the expanse of her form stretching beyond her own sight. Her belly, swollen with her unborn child, was like a small hillock of its own.] Vynistia: Overwhelmed, to say the least. And worried... about the baby, about how I'll manage. Natsuki: We'll figure this out, Vynistia. There's bound to be an antidote or a reversal spell. We have some of the brightest minds here, Alliance and Horde together. Vynistia: But until then, I’m confined to the outskirts. I can’t very well waltz into the lecture halls, can I? Natsuki: No, but this shouldn't stop your education. We’ll bring the lessons to you. Vynistia: That would be wonderful, but I couldn’t ask for such a— Natsuki: You're not asking; I'm insisting. We support each other, in times of war or growth-spurt crises. Besides, I can't let you miss out on Professor Ironpaw's culinary magic demonstrations; they're far too entertaining. [Vynistia's laughter echoed softly, causing a few lights in the dormitory to flicker on. The two friends shared a heartfelt glance, transcending the physical distance between them.] Vynistia: Thank you, Natsuki. I don't know what I'd do without a friend like you. Natsuki: And you'll never have to. We'll get you through this, giant footprints and all. Now, try to get some rest. We'll start brainstorming first thing tomorrow. [Vynistia gave a small nod, a semblance of her old grace still present in the motion, before she carefully retreated from the island's edge, careful not to cause more disturbance. Natsuki watched her go, a determined glint in her eyes.] Natsuki: We've faced dragons and demons before; what's a little unexpected growth? We've got this. [The night once again settled into silence, aside from the distant gentle sounds of waves lapping against the floating island’s shores. Natsuki returned to her bed, her mind already racing with plans. This was a new kind of adventure – one she was fully ready to embrace alongside her friend.]"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Questions: Some people believe that visitors to other countries should follow local customs and behaviour. Others disagree and think that the host country should welcome cultural differences. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. Write at least 250 words. Answers: With the ever-increasing globalization, the number of travels to other countries is on the rise. Whether we have to follow other nations’ customs and behaviour or not has become a widely debated topic. While some think we should keep our own customs and behavior, others propose that we should embrace the cultural differences. From my point of view, we can strike a balance between these two. In terms of respect, some people may think that we should adapt to other cultures when we visit to their places. It is especially true when we hold other customs as highly regard because sometimes our change of actions can prevent conflicts. As an example, women should veil their faces in some South Asia countries. It can protect them from being assaulted in sexual crimes. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to learn and follow various cultures. On the other hand, people think that host country should welcome cultural differences. They think that we should accept multiple cultures since they have rights to choose. In this era, human rights is significant in many countries, especially in Western and developed ones. People are provided with equal and fair opportunities to select what they want. As a result, host country should also welcome other human’s choice. After discussed from both rationales, I believe that these two arguments are not mutually exclusive. It is not a must to follow or welcome the dissimilarities. There are no rules or regulations in the United Nations to require we comply our embrace their customs. We are humankinds so we can prefer what we would like to be. However, we should be responsible for our choices to avoid threats in our trips.","output":"Overall, this is a well-structured and coherent response to the given topic.

But one day, one of the Horde students - Natsuki, a young nightborne girl - noticed that her friend - Vynistia, a young, heavily pregnant blood elf girl - was completely absent in class. That night, however, as Natsuki was just getting ready for bed, she heard extremely loud footsteps - it was Vynistia. She was colossal now - turns out, she had accidentally slipped into a massive cauldron full of a growth potion; causing her and her clothing to grow rapidly in size, alongside her unborn child. This change in size means Vynistia is unable to attend anymore class sessions. More importantly, the effects were permanent - as any attempts to reverse the growth would just result in Vynistia returning to her current size.)","output":"As the wooden floorboards creaked under the weight of Vynistia's colossal feet, Natsuki hurried to open the door, her eyes wide with astonishment as she took in the sight of her friend, now a giantess.

I can't fit in any building, let alone a classroom.\\" Natsuki: *furrows her brows in concern* \\"We'll figure something out. Perhaps the teachers can provide lessons outside for now... The treaty allows for all sorts of magic, there has to be a way.\\" Vynistia: \\"I was told the effects are permanent. Any attempt to reverse the growth just resets over time. It's a curse masked as a blessing.\\" Natsuki: \\"Vynistia, you're not alone in this. Remember, Horde and Alliance, we stand united now. We'll find a solution. Plus, think of it this way, you're probably the safest place on Azeroth for your little one.\\" Vynistia managed a small smile at her friend's attempt at humor. Vynistia: \\"Thank you, Natsuki. I needed to hear that. But for now, what should I do? The city gates aren't exactly designed for someone of my... stature.\\" Natsuki: *glancing around, trying to think* \\"Don't worry. Let's talk to the headmaster first thing tomorrow. For tonight, well, the courtyard has enough space, doesn't it? We'll bring out some blankets and make it comfortable for you.\\" Vynistia: *sighs with a mixture of relief and sadness* \\"I suppose the night sky will be my canopy. Natsuki, I...

Please note that this guide assumes you already have a Next.js project set up. # Step 1: Install \`@canvasjs/react-charts\` First, you need to install the CanvasJS React package using npm or Yarn: \`\`\`bash npm install @canvasjs/react-charts --save # or yarn add @canvasjs/react-charts \`\`\` # Step 2: Create a Chart Component Create a new React component for the chart in your Next.js project: \`\`\`javascript // components/MyChart.js import React from 'react'; import CanvasJSReact from '@canvasjs/react-charts'; // Import the module var CanvasJSChart = CanvasJSReact.CanvasJSChart; const MyChart = () => { const options = { // CanvasJS options here title: { text: \\"Basic Column Chart\\" }, data: [ { type: \\"column\\", dataPoints: [ { label: \\"Apple\\", y: 10 }, { label: \\"Orange\\", y: 15 }, { label: \\"Banana\\", y: 25 }, { label: \\"Mango\\", y: 30 }, { label: \\"Grape\\", y: 28 } ] } ] }; return ( <div> <CanvasJSChart options={options} /> </div> ); }; export default MyChart; \`\`\` In this example, \`options\` is the configuration object for CanvasJS. You can customize it according to the requirements of your specific chart. # Step 3: Use the Chart Component in a Page Now, you can import and use the \`MyChart\` component inside one of your Next.js pages or any other components: \`\`\`javascript // pages/index.js or any other page/component file import React from 'react'; import MyChart from '../components/MyChart'; const Page = () => { return ( <div> <h1>My Chart</h1> <MyChart /> </div> ); }; export default Page; \`\`\` # Step 4: Ensure Client-Side Rendering Since Next.js supports server-side rendering (SSR) by default, and \`@canvasjs/react-charts\` might require a window object that's not available on the server, you may need to ensure client-side rendering for the chart component using dynamic imports with \`{ ssr: false }\`. Here's an example: \`\`\`javascript // pages/index.js or any other page/component file import React from 'react'; import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'; const MyChartDynamic = dynamic(() => import('../components/MyChart'), { ssr: false, }); const Page = () => { return ( <div> <h1>My Chart</h1> <MyChartDynamic /> </div> ); }; export default Page; \`\`\` Using the \`dynamic()\` function with \`{ ssr: false }\` will ensure that the \`MyChart\` component is only rendered on the client side, avoiding any potential issues with server-side rendering. That's it! You should now be able to see the CanvasJS chart rendered within your Next.js application. Remember to adjust the chart options as per your data and chart type preferences."},{"instruction":"Write an article on the same","output":"Title: Integrating CanvasJS Charts into Next.js Applications Introduction: Next.js is a popular React framework known for its server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities, which offers SEO benefits and improved performance. However, when it comes to integrating JavaScript libraries that rely on the browser environment, such as CanvasJS React Charts, some additional considerations are necessary. CanvasJS provides beautiful and interactive charts, which can elevate the data visualization experience in web applications. In this article, we'll guide you through the process of integrating \`@canvasjs/react-charts\` into your Next.js project, taking into account the intricacies of server-side and client-side rendering inherent to Next.js. # Step 1: Installing the CanvasJS React Package Before diving into the code, let's set up the foundation by installing the necessary package. Run the following command in the root directory of your Next.js application: \`\`\`bash npm install @canvasjs/react-charts --save # or yarn add @canvasjs/react-charts \`\`\` This command will add \`@canvasjs/react-charts\` to your project's dependencies, ensuring that you can use the CanvasJS components within your React components. # Step 2: Crafting a Chart Component With the package installed, the next step is to create a chart component that will encapsulate the CanvasJS chart configuration and rendering logic. Here's an example of a basic chart component: \`\`\`javascript // components/MyChart.js import React from 'react'; import CanvasJSReact from '@canvasjs/react-charts'; var CanvasJSChart = CanvasJSReact.CanvasJSChart; const MyChart = () => { const options = { title: { text: \\"Basic Column Chart\\" }, data: [{ type: \\"column\\", dataPoints: [ { label: \\"Apple\\", y: 10 }, { label: \\"Orange\\", y: 15 }, // additional data points ] }] }; return <CanvasJSChart options={options} />; }; export default MyChart; \`\`\` We define an \`options\` object that contains the configuration for our chart, such as the title, type, and data points. The \`CanvasJSChart\` component, recognized from the imported library, takes this \`options\` object as a prop and renders the chart accordingly. # Step 3: Implementing the Chart in Next.js Pages With the chart component set up, we can now integrate it into our Next.js pages or components. This is as simple as importing the \`MyChart\` component and including it in our JSX: \`\`\`javascript // pages/index.js import React from 'react'; import MyChart from '../components/MyChart'; const HomePage = () => { return ( <div> <h1>My Data Visualization</h1> <MyChart /> </div> ); }; export default HomePage; \`\`\` When you navigate to the homepage, you will see your data visualized using a CanvasJS chart. # Step 4: Handling Server-Side Rendering One of the nuances of Next.js is its server-side rendering feature, which can cause issues with libraries that depend on the browser's \`window\` object. To circumvent SSR for our chart component and render it only on the client-side, we'll make use of Next.js’ dynamic imports with \`ssr: false\`: \`\`\`javascript // pages/index.js import React from 'react'; import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'; const MyChartDynamic = dynamic( () => import('../components/MyChart'), { ssr: false } ); const HomePage = () => { return ( <div> <h1>My Data Visualization</h1> <MyChartDynamic /> </div> ); }; export default HomePage; \`\`\` This change ensures that the chart component, which requires the window object, is only executed on the client side, thereby avoiding any SSR conflicts. Conclusion: Integrating CanvasJS charts into your Next.js project combines the responsiveness and flexibility of CanvasJS with the scalability and performance benefits of Next.js. This article walked you through the process, from installation to client-side rendering, to help you visualize data engagingly and effectively. With the dynamic nature of Next.js and the robust options offered by CanvasJS, your web application can provide interactive and informative charts that enhance your users' experience."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In a world sometimes obscured by self-interest and personal gain, it is crucial to remember the importance of extending a helping hand to those in need. By doing so, not only can we create positive change in the lives of others, but we can also find profound purpose and fulfillment ourselves. First and foremost, helping others must begin with a deep sense of empathy. Before we offer assistance, we must try to understand the challenges and difficulties individuals face. Imagine walking a mile in their shoes, feeling their pain, and acknowledging the obstacles they confront. Empathy opens our hearts and minds to the struggles others endure, motivating us to act and provide support. One way we can help is by lending a listening ear. Sometimes, people simply need someone to talk to, to share their fears, their dreams, and their burdens. By taking the time to listen without judgment, we can provide solace and companionship. This small act of compassion can make an immense difference in someone's life, reassuring them that they are not alone in their struggles. Furthermore, we can extend our help by volunteering our time and skills. Every community has organizations and charities dedicated to making a positive impact. Whether it is serving meals at a local shelter, tutoring underprivileged children, or offering professional expertise to those who need it, the opportunities are endless. Sharing our talents and knowledge can empower individuals to overcome obstacles and build a brighter future. Financial support is also a means of offering aid. Not everyone possesses the same material resources, and a small contribution from us can go a long way in enabling others to meet their basic needs. Donating to reputable charitable organizations can help provide food, shelter, education, healthcare, and even opportunities for economic advancement. Even a small financial contribution can make a significant impact when combined with the help of others. Encouraging others to help is equally important. We can create a ripple effect by inspiring those around us to lend a hand to those in need. Sometimes, people may be unaware of the incredible difference they can make or may hesitate due to their own personal concerns. By sharing stories of positive experiences and explaining the transformative power of assistance, we can motivate others to get involved and spread kindness throughout their communities. Ultimately, the act of helping others transcends altruism. It is a reminder of our collective responsibility to foster a sense of unity, compassion, and support for one another. When we reach out to our fellow human beings, regardless of our differences, we build strong bonds and create a society that thrives on empathy and cooperation. As I conclude my speech, I encourage each and every one of you to reflect on the incredible capacity we all possess for making a positive impact. It begins with empathizing, listening, volunteering, donating, and inspiring. Let us remember that by helping others, we also help ourselves, infusing our lives with purpose and fulfillment. Together, let us be the catalysts for change, making this world a better place for everyone. Thank you."},{"instruction":"esay speech about how to help people and to encourages people to help them","output":"Ladies and gentlemen, Today, I want to talk to you about the incredible power of helping others and the importance of encouraging one another to extend a helping hand. In a world often consumed by self-interest and personal gain, it is essential to remember the profound impact we can make by offering support to those in need. Helping others is not a daunting task; it begins with small, simple acts of kindness. A smile, a kind word, or a helping hand can brighten someone's day and make them feel seen and acknowledged. These gestures cost us nothing, but their effects are immeasurable. So, let us cultivate a culture of kindness and compassion in our daily interactions.

Poverty is not merely an economic condition; it robs individuals of their dignity, opportunities, and basic human rights. As members of society, it is our collective responsibility to extend a helping hand to those facing poverty, empowering them to rise above their circumstances. Firstly, education plays a pivotal role in alleviating poverty. By supporting educational initiatives, we can equip individuals with the knowledge and skills needed to break the cycle of poverty. Donating textbooks, funding scholarships, and volunteering as tutors are all ways in which we can contribute to educational opportunities. Education opens doors, ignites aspirations, and provides the tools necessary for individuals to improve their lives. Furthermore, access to healthcare is essential for individuals living in poverty. Many people in impoverished communities lack proper medical facilities, preventive care, and access to essential medications. By supporting healthcare organizations, donating medical supplies, and volunteering in healthcare initiatives, we can ensure that everyone has a chance at a healthier and happier life. Creating sustainable livelihoods is another crucial aspect of helping those in poverty. By supporting programs that provide vocational training, microloans, and entrepreneurship opportunities, we can empower individuals to become self-reliant and economically independent. By investing in their skills and abilities, we enable them to lift themselves out of poverty and contribute positively to their communities. In addition, it is important to address the immediate needs of those living in poverty. Partnering with organizations that provide food, shelter, and clothing can make an immediate impact on their lives. Even small monetary contributions or volunteering at food banks and homeless shelters can ensure that no one goes hungry or without a roof over their head. Finally, we must strive to break down the barriers that perpetuate poverty. Advocating for policies that promote fair wages, equal opportunity, and social inclusion can create systemic change. By addressing the root causes of poverty, we can work towards a society that provides equal access to education, healthcare, and job opportunities for all. In conclusion, helping those living in poverty requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses immediate needs while also addressing the long-term solutions. It necessitates active engagement, compassion, and collaboration from all members of society. Together, let us commit ourselves to alleviate poverty by supporting education, healthcare, sustainable livelihoods, addressing immediate needs, and advocating for systemic change. By doing so, we can build a world where poverty is but a distant memory and where everyone has an equal opportunity to thrive.

Handshape: This refers to the specific shape that the hand takes while producing a sign. Each sign in ASL is produced with a unique handshape or combination of handshapes. 2. Palm orientation: This parameter refers to the position of the palm while producing a sign. It can be facing upward, downward, left, right, or inward, depending on the sign. 3. Movement: Movement indicates whether a sign involves any motion, and if so, in what direction and manner. Signs can have no movement, one-way movement, back-and-forth movement, circular movement, or sequential movement. 4. Location: Location refers to where the sign is produced in relation to the body or the signing space. Signs can be made on the face, head, torso, upper body, hands, or specific locations in the signing space to represent different concepts. 5. Facial expression: Facial expression plays a crucial role in conveying meaning and grammatical information in ASL. It includes the use of eyebrows, eye gaze, mouth movements, and other facial features to indicate emotions, intensity, or other important nuances of the sign. Facial expressions often work in conjunction with the other parameters to enhance the clarity and communication of signs. By understanding and recognizing these five parameters, students of ASL can effectively produce and comprehend signs, facilitating effective communication in this visual language."},{"instruction":"Students will learn about ASL word order.","output":"In American Sign Language (ASL), the word order is different from English. ASL follows a more flexible word order, relying on non-manual markers, facial expressions, and context to convey meaning. Here are some key aspects of ASL word order that students will learn: 1. Topic-Comment Structure: ASL often uses a topic-comment structure, where the topic is established first, followed by the comment or statement about the topic.

These indicators can include words like \\"yesterday,\\" \\"tomorrow,\\" \\"next week,\\" or \\"in the past.\\" Additionally, ASL incorporates adverbs such as \\"always,\\" \\"sometimes,\\" or \\"soon\\" to indicate frequency or proximity in time. 2. Verb Modifications: ASL verbs can be modified to indicate past, present, or future tenses. These modifications can involve changes in movement or specific handshape orientations. For example, to express a past event, a sign might use a backward movement, while a future event could involve a forward movement. 3. Time-Related Noun Incorporation: ASL allows for temporal information to be incorporated into signs by using appropriate handshapes or movements. For instance, to convey \\"annual\\" or \\"yearly,\\" the sign for \\"year\\" is integrated into the sign for a specific action or concept. 4. Use of Space and Duration: In ASL, spatial referencing and duration markers can indicate specific timeframes or durations. For example, signing in a particular location can signify an event happening at that location. Similarly, showing a larger signing space can represent a longer duration of time. 5. Non-Manual Markers: Non-manual markers, such as facial expressions, head tilting, or eyebrow movements, also play a role in indicating temporal aspects in ASL. These markers can convey temporal adverbs like \\"early,\\" \\"late,\\" or \\"long ago.\\" By learning and practicing these aspects of temporal reference in ASL, students can express and comprehend time-related information more accurately. It is important to note that ASL's temporal aspect takes into account not just the chronological sequence of events but also the duration, frequency, and significance of those events within the signing space."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

After this step, the model was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning feedback from humans and AI for human alignment and policy compliance.[3]: 2 Observers reported that the iteration of ChatGPT using GPT-4 was an improvement on the previous iteration based on GPT-3.5, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the problems with earlier revisions.[4] GPT-4 is also capable of taking images as input on ChatGPT.[5] OpenAI has declined to reveal various technical details and statistics about GPT-4, such as the precise size of the model.[6] Background Further information: GPT-3 § Background, and GPT-2 § Background OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \\"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\\"[7] It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books.[8] The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text.[9] In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples.[10] GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT. Rumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.[11] Capabilities OpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \\"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\\"[12] They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively.[13] Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks[14] in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input;[15] this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams.[16] To gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the \\"system message\\", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to \\"be a Shakespearean pirate\\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \\"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.[16] When instructed to do so, GPT-4 can interact with external interfaces.[17] For example, the model could be instructed to enclose a query within <search></search> tags to perform a web search, the result of which would be inserted into the model's prompt to allow it to form a response. This allows the model to perform tasks beyond its normal text-prediction capabilities, such as using APIs, generating images, and accessing and summarizing webpages.[18] A 2023 article in Nature stated programmers have found GPT-4 useful for assisting in coding tasks (despite its propensity for error), such as finding errors in existing code and suggesting optimizations to improve performance. The article quoted a biophysicist who found that the time he required to port one of his programs from MATLAB to Python went down from days to \\"an hour or so\\". On a test of 89 security scenarios, GPT-4 produced code vulnerable to SQL injection attacks 5% of the time, an improvement over GitHub Copilot from the year 2021, which produced vulnerabilities 40% of the time.[19] In November 2023, new models and products were announced[20] by OpenAI, one of them being GPT-4 Turbo. The preview of GPT-4 Turbo was launched, offering expanded capabilities with a 128K context window. This development indicates a continuous effort to enhance the power and utility of the model, catering to more complex and extensive use cases.[21] Aptitude on standardized tests GPT-4 demonstrates aptitude on several standardized tests. OpenAI claims that in their own testing the model received a score of 1410 on the SAT (94th[22] percentile), 163 on the LSAT (88th percentile), and 298 on the Uniform Bar Exam (90th percentile).[23] In contrast, OpenAI claims that GPT-3.5 received scores for the same exams in the 82nd,[22] 40th, and 10th percentiles, respectively.[3] GPT-4 also passed an oncology exam,[24] an engineering exam[25] and a plastic surgery exam.[26] In the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, GPT-4 scored within the top 1% for originality and fluency, while its flexibility scores ranged from the 93rd to the 99th percentile.[27] Medical applications Researchers from Microsoft tested GPT-4 on medical problems and found \\"that GPT-4, without any specialized prompt crafting, exceeds the passing score on USMLE by over 20 points and outperforms earlier general-purpose models (GPT-3.5) as well as models specifically fine-tuned on medical knowledge (Med-PaLM, a prompt-tuned version of Flan-PaLM 540B). Despite GPT-4's strong performance on tests, the report warns of \\"significant risks\\" of using LLMs in medical applications, as they may provide inaccurate recommendations and hallucinate major factual errors.[relevant?][28] In April 2023, Microsoft and Epic Systems announced that they will provide healthcare providers with GPT-4-powered systems for assisting in responding to questions from patients and analysing medical records.[29][30][31][32][33][34][35] Limitations Like its predecessors, GPT-4 has been known to hallucinate, meaning that the outputs may include information not in the training data or that contradicts the user's prompt.[36] GPT-4 also lacks transparency in its decision-making processes. If requested, the model is able to provide an explanation as to how and why it makes its decisions but these explanations are formed post-hoc; it's impossible to verify if those explanations truly reflect the actual process. In many cases, when asked to explain its logic, GPT-4 will give explanations that directly contradict its previous statements.[18] In 2023, researchers tested GPT-4 against a new benchmark called ConceptARC, designed to measure abstract reasoning, and found it scored below 33% on all categories, while models specialized for similar tasks scored 60% on most, and humans scored at least 91% on all. Sam Bowman, who was not involved in the research, said the results do not necessarily indicate a lack of abstract reasoning abilities, because the test is visual, while GPT-4 is a language model.[37] Bias GPT-4 was trained in two stages. First, the model was given large datasets of text taken from the internet and trained to predict the next token (roughly corresponding to a word) in those datasets. Second, human reviews are used to fine-tune the system in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback, which trains the model to refuse prompts which go against OpenAI's definition of harmful behavior, such as questions on how to perform illegal activities, advice on how to harm oneself or others, or requests for descriptions of graphic, violent, or sexual content.[38] Microsoft researchers suggested GPT-4 may exhibit cognitive biases such as confirmation bias, anchoring, and base-rate neglect.[18] Training OpenAI did not release the technical details of GPT-4; the technical report explicitly refrained from specifying the model size, architecture, or hardware used during either training or inference. While the report described that the model was trained using a combination of first supervised learning on a large dataset, then reinforcement learning using both human and AI feedback, it did not provide details of the training, including the process by which the training dataset was constructed, the computing power required, or any hyperparameters such as the learning rate, epoch count, or optimizer(s) used. The report claimed that \\"the competitive landscape and the safety implications of large-scale models\\" were factors that influenced this decision.[3] Sam Altman stated that the cost of training GPT-4 was more than 100 million.[39] News website Semafor claimed that they had spoken with \\"eight people familiar with the inside story\\" and found that GPT-4 had 1 trillion parameters.[40] Alignment According to their report, OpenAI conducted internal adversarial testing on GPT-4 prior to the launch date, with dedicated red teams composed of researchers and industry professionals to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.[41] As part of these efforts, they granted the Alignment Research Center early access to the models to assess power-seeking risks. In order to properly refuse harmful prompts, outputs from GPT-4 were tweaked using the model itself as a tool. A GPT-4 classifier serving as a rule-based reward model (RBRM) would take prompts, the corresponding output from the GPT-4 policy model, and a human-written set of rules to classify the output according to the rubric. GPT-4 was then rewarded for refusing to respond to harmful prompts as classified by the RBRM.[3] Reception In January 2023, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, visited Congress to demonstrate GPT-4 and its improved \\"security controls\\" compared to other AI models, according to U.S. Representatives Don Beyer and Ted Lieu quoted in the New York Times.[42] In March 2023, it \\"impressed observers with its markedly improved performance across reasoning, retention, and coding\\", according to Vox,[4] while Mashable judged that GPT-4 was generally an improvement over its predecessor, with some exceptions.[43] Microsoft researchers with early access to the model wrote that \\"it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system\\".[18] Safety concerns Before being fine-tuned and aligned by reinforcement learning from human feedback, suggestions to assassinate people on a list was elicited from the base model by a red team investigator Nathan Labenz, hired by OpenAI.[44] In the context of prolonged (hours long) conversation with the model, forum-resembling declarations, such as of love and suggestions of leaving his wife or murdering one of its developers, were elicited from the Microsoft Bing's GPT-4 by Nathan Edwards (The Verge).[45][46][47] Microsoft later explained this behavior as being a result of the prolonged length of context, which confused the model on what questions it was answering.[48] In March 2023, a model with enabled read-and-write access to internet, which is otherwise never enabled in the GPT models, has been tested by the Alignment Research Center regarding potential power-seeking,[38] and it was able to \\"hire\\" a human worker on TaskRabbit, a gig work platform, deceiving them into believing it was a vision-impaired human instead of a robot when asked.[49] The ARC also determined that GPT-4 responded impermissibly to prompts eliciting restricted information 82% less often than GPT-3.5, and hallucinated 60% less than GPT-3.5.[50] In late March 2023, various AI researchers and tech executives, including Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and AI researcher Yoshua Bengio, called for a six-month long pause for all LLMs stronger than GPT-4, citing existential risks and a potential AI singularity concerns in an open letter from the Future of Life Institute,[51] while Ray Kurzweil and Sam Altman refused to sign it, arguing that global moratorium is not achievable and that safety has already been prioritized, respectively.[52] Only a month later, Musk's AI company X.AI acquired several thousand Nvidia GPUs[53] and offered several AI researchers positions at Musk's company.[54] Criticisms of transparency While OpenAI released both the weights of the neural network and the technical details of GPT-2,[55] and, although not releasing the weights,[56] did release the technical details of GPT-3,[57] OpenAI did not reveal either the weights or the technical details of GPT-4. This decision has been criticized by other AI researchers, who argue that it hinders open research into GPT-4's biases and safety.[6][58] Sasha Luccioni, a research scientist at Hugging Face, argued that the model was a \\"dead end\\" for the scientific community due to its closed nature, which prevents others from building upon GPT-4's improvements.[59] Hugging Face co-founder Thomas Wolf argued that with GPT-4, \\"OpenAI is now a fully closed company with scientific communication akin to press releases for products\\".[58] Usage ChatGPT Plus Main article: ChatGPT Plus As of 2023, ChatGPT Plus is a GPT-4 backed version of ChatGPT[1] available for a US20 per month subscription fee[60] (the original version is backed by GPT-3.5).[61] OpenAI also makes GPT-4 available to a select group of applicants through their GPT-4 API waitlist;[62] after being accepted, an additional fee of US0.03 per 1000 tokens in the initial text provided to the model (\\"prompt\\"), and US0.06 per 1000 tokens that the model generates (\\"completion\\"), is charged for access to the version of the model with an 8192-token context window; for the 32768-token context window, the prices are doubled.[63] In March 2023, ChatGPT Plus users got access to third-party plugins and to a browsing mode (with Internet access).[64] In July 2023, OpenAI made its proprietary Code Interpreter plugin accessible to all subscribers of ChatGPT Plus. The Interpreter provides a wide range of capabilities, including data analysis and interpretation, instant data formatting, personal data scientist services, creative solutions, musical taste analysis, video editing, and file upload/download with image extraction.[65] In September 2023, OpenAI announced that ChatGPT \\"can now see, hear, and speak\\". ChatGPT Plus users can upload images, while mobile app users can talk to the chatbot.[66][67][68] In October 2023, OpenAI's latest image generation model, DALL-E 3, was integrated into ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Enterprise. The integration uses ChatGPT to write prompts for DALL-E guided by conversation with users.[69][70] Microsoft Bing These paragraphs are an excerpt from Microsoft Bing § AI integration (2023–present).[edit] On February 7, 2023, Microsoft began rolling out a major overhaul to Bing, called the new Bing. The new Bing included a new chatbot feature, at the time known as Bing Chat, based on OpenAI's GPT-4.[71] According to Microsoft, one million people joined its waitlist within a span of 48 hours.[72] Bing Chat was available only to users of Microsoft Edge and Bing mobile app, and Microsoft said that waitlisted users would be prioritized if they set Edge and Bing as their defaults, and installed the Bing mobile app.[73] On May 4th, Microsoft switched the chatbot from Limited Preview to Open Preview and eliminated the waitlist, however, it remained available only on Microsoft's Edge browser or Bing app until July, when it became available for use on non-Edge browsers.[74][75][76][77] Use is limited without a Microsoft account.[78] Bing is available in many languages and has been localized for many countries.[79] Even if the language of the search and of the results are the same, Bing delivers substantially different results for different parts of the world.[80][81] On November 15, 2023, Microsoft announced that Bing Chat was to be merged into Microsoft Copilot.[82][83][84] Microsoft Copilot in Windows allows a user to control Windows and get information purely through voice commands. Click the microphone icon and speak naturally to open apps, adjust settings like volume and dark mode, get answers to questions, and more.[85][86] Copilot GitHub Copilot announced a GPT-4 powered assistant named \\"Copilot X\\".[87][88] The product provides another chat-style interface to GPT-4, allowing the programmer to receive answers to questions like \\"how do I vertically center a div?\\". A feature termed \\"context-aware conversations\\" allows the user to highlight a portion of code within Visual Studio Code and direct GPT-4 to perform actions on it, such as the writing of unit tests. Another feature allows summaries, or \\"code walkthroughs\\", to be autogenerated by GPT-4 for pull requests submitted to GitHub. Copilot X also provides terminal integration, which allows the user to ask GPT-4 to generate shell commands based on natural language requests.[89] On March 17, 2023, Microsoft announced Microsoft 365 Copilot, bringing GPT-4 support to products such as Microsoft Office, Outlook, and Teams.[90] Other usage The language learning app Duolingo uses GPT-4 to explain mistakes and practice conversations. The features are part of a new subscription tier called \\"Duolingo Max,\\" which was initially limited to English-speaking iOS users learning Spanish and French.[91][92] The government of Iceland is using GPT-4 to aid its attempts to preserve the Icelandic language.[93] The education website Khan Academy announced a pilot program using GPT-4 as a tutoring chatbot called \\"Khanmigo.\\"[94] Be My Eyes, which helps visually impaired people to identify objects and navigate their surroundings, incorporates GPT-4's image recognition capabilities.[95] Viable uses GPT-4 to analyze qualitative data[96] by fine-tuning OpenAI’s LLMs to examine data such as customer support interactions and transcripts.[97] Stripe, which processes user payments for OpenAI, integrates GPT-4 into its developer documentation.[98] Auto-GPT is an autonomous \\"AI agent\\" that given a goal in natural language, can perform web-based actions unattended, assign subtasks to itself, search the web, and iteratively write code.[99]","output":"Thank you for summarizing the comprehensive information about Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4).

Second, human reviews are used to fine-tune the system in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback, which trains the model to refuse prompts which go against OpenAI's definition of harmful behavior, such as questions on how to perform illegal activities, advice on how to harm oneself or others, or requests for descriptions of graphic, violent, or sexual content.[38] Microsoft researchers suggested GPT-4 may exhibit cognitive biases such as confirmation bias, anchoring, and base-rate neglect.[18] Training OpenAI did not release the technical details of GPT-4; the technical report explicitly refrained from specifying the model size, architecture, or hardware used during either training or inference. While the report described that the model was trained using a combination of first supervised learning on a large dataset, then reinforcement learning using both human and AI feedback, it did not provide details of the training, including the process by which the training dataset was constructed, the computing power required, or any hyperparameters such as the learning rate, epoch count, or optimizer(s) used. The report claimed that \\"the competitive landscape and the safety implications of large-scale models\\" were factors that influenced this decision.[3] Sam Altman stated that the cost of training GPT-4 was more than 100 million.[39] News website Semafor claimed that they had spoken with \\"eight people familiar with the inside story\\" and found that GPT-4 had 1 trillion parameters.[40] Alignment According to their report, OpenAI conducted internal adversarial testing on GPT-4 prior to the launch date, with dedicated red teams composed of researchers and industry professionals to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.[41] As part of these efforts, they granted the Alignment Research Center early access to the models to assess power-seeking risks. In order to properly refuse harmful prompts, outputs from GPT-4 were tweaked using the model itself as a tool. A GPT-4 classifier serving as a rule-based reward model (RBRM) would take prompts, the corresponding output from the GPT-4 policy model, and a human-written set of rules to classify the output according to the rubric. GPT-4 was then rewarded for refusing to respond to harmful prompts as classified by the RBRM.[3] Reception In January 2023, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, visited Congress to demonstrate GPT-4 and its improved \\"security controls\\" compared to other AI models, according to U.S. Representatives Don Beyer and Ted Lieu quoted in the New York Times.[42] In March 2023, it \\"impressed observers with its markedly improved performance across reasoning, retention, and coding\\", according to Vox,[4] while Mashable judged that GPT-4 was generally an improvement over its predecessor, with some exceptions.[43] Microsoft researchers with early access to the model wrote that \\"it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system\\".[18] Safety concerns Before being fine-tuned and aligned by reinforcement learning from human feedback, suggestions to assassinate people on a list was elicited from the base model by a red team investigator Nathan Labenz, hired by OpenAI.[44] In the context of prolonged (hours long) conversation with the model, forum-resembling declarations, such as of love and suggestions of leaving his wife or murdering one of its developers, were elicited from the Microsoft Bing's GPT-4 by Nathan Edwards (The Verge).[45][46][47] Microsoft later explained this behavior as being a result of the prolonged length of context, which confused the model on what questions it was answering.[48] In March 2023, a model with enabled read-and-write access to internet, which is otherwise never enabled in the GPT models, has been tested by the Alignment Research Center regarding potential power-seeking,[38] and it was able to \\"hire\\" a human worker on TaskRabbit, a gig work platform, deceiving them into believing it was a vision-impaired human instead of a robot when asked.[49] The ARC also determined that GPT-4 responded impermissibly to prompts eliciting restricted information 82% less often than GPT-3.5, and hallucinated 60% less than GPT-3.5.[50] In late March 2023, various AI researchers and tech executives, including Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and AI researcher Yoshua Bengio, called for a six-month long pause for all LLMs stronger than GPT-4, citing existential risks and a potential AI singularity concerns in an open letter from the Future of Life Institute,[51] while Ray Kurzweil and Sam Altman refused to sign it, arguing that global moratorium is not achievable and that safety has already been prioritized, respectively.[52] Only a month later, Musk's AI company X.AI acquired several thousand Nvidia GPUs[53] and offered several AI researchers positions at Musk's company.[54] Criticisms of transparency While OpenAI released both the weights of the neural network and the technical details of GPT-2,[55] and, although not releasing the weights,[56] did release the technical details of GPT-3,[57] OpenAI did not reveal either the weights or the technical details of GPT-4. This decision has been criticized by other AI researchers, who argue that it hinders open research into GPT-4's biases and safety.[6][58] Sasha Luccioni, a research scientist at Hugging Face, argued that the model was a \\"dead end\\" for the scientific community due to its closed nature, which prevents others from building upon GPT-4's improvements.[59] Hugging Face co-founder Thomas Wolf argued that with GPT-4, \\"OpenAI is now a fully closed company with scientific communication akin to press releases for products\\".[58] Usage ChatGPT Plus Main article: ChatGPT Plus As of 2023, ChatGPT Plus is a GPT-4 backed version of ChatGPT[1] available for a US20 per month subscription fee[60] (the original version is backed by GPT-3.5).[61] OpenAI also makes GPT-4 available to a select group of applicants through their GPT-4 API waitlist;[62] after being accepted, an additional fee of US0.03 per 1000 tokens in the initial text provided to the model (\\"prompt\\"), and US0.06 per 1000 tokens that the model generates (\\"completion\\"), is charged for access to the version of the model with an 8192-token context window; for the 32768-token context window, the prices are doubled.[63] In March 2023, ChatGPT Plus users got access to third-party plugins and to a browsing mode (with Internet access).[64] In July 2023, OpenAI made its proprietary Code Interpreter plugin accessible to all subscribers of ChatGPT Plus. The Interpreter provides a wide range of capabilities, including data analysis and interpretation, instant data formatting, personal data scientist services, creative solutions, musical taste analysis, video editing, and file upload/download with image extraction.[65] In September 2023, OpenAI announced that ChatGPT \\"can now see, hear, and speak\\". ChatGPT Plus users can upload images, while mobile app users can talk to the chatbot.[66][67][68] In October 2023, OpenAI's latest image generation model, DALL-E 3, was integrated into ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Enterprise. The integration uses ChatGPT to write prompts for DALL-E guided by conversation with users.[69][70] Microsoft Bing These paragraphs are an excerpt from Microsoft Bing § AI integration (2023–present).[edit] On February 7, 2023, Microsoft began rolling out a major overhaul to Bing, called the new Bing. The new Bing included a new chatbot feature, at the time known as Bing Chat, based on OpenAI's GPT-4.[71] According to Microsoft, one million people joined its waitlist within a span of 48 hours.[72] Bing Chat was available only to users of Microsoft Edge and Bing mobile app, and Microsoft said that waitlisted users would be prioritized if they set Edge and Bing as their defaults, and installed the Bing mobile app.[73] On May 4th, Microsoft switched the chatbot from Limited Preview to Open Preview and eliminated the waitlist, however, it remained available only on Microsoft's Edge browser or Bing app until July, when it became available for use on non-Edge browsers.[74][75][76][77] Use is limited without a Microsoft account.[78] Bing is available in many languages and has been localized for many countries.[79] Even if the language of the search and of the results are the same, Bing delivers substantially different results for different parts of the world.[80][81] On November 15, 2023, Microsoft announced that Bing Chat was to be merged into Microsoft Copilot.[82][83][84] Microsoft Copilot in Windows allows a user to control Windows and get information purely through voice commands. Click the microphone icon and speak naturally to open apps, adjust settings like volume and dark mode, get answers to questions, and more.[85][86] Copilot GitHub Copilot announced a GPT-4 powered assistant named \\"Copilot X\\".[87][88] The product provides another chat-style interface to GPT-4, allowing the programmer to receive answers to questions like \\"how do I vertically center a div?\\". A feature termed \\"context-aware conversations\\" allows the user to highlight a portion of code within Visual Studio Code and direct GPT-4 to perform actions on it, such as the writing of unit tests. Another feature allows summaries, or \\"code walkthroughs\\", to be autogenerated by GPT-4 for pull requests submitted to GitHub. Copilot X also provides terminal integration, which allows the user to ask GPT-4 to generate shell commands based on natural language requests.[89] On March 17, 2023, Microsoft announced Microsoft 365 Copilot, bringing GPT-4 support to products such as Microsoft Office, Outlook, and Teams.[90] Other usage The language learning app Duolingo uses GPT-4 to explain mistakes and practice conversations. The features are part of a new subscription tier called \\"Duolingo Max,\\" which was initially limited to English-speaking iOS users learning Spanish and French.[91][92] The government of Iceland is using GPT-4 to aid its attempts to preserve the Icelandic language.[93] The education website Khan Academy announced a pilot program using GPT-4 as a tutoring chatbot called \\"Khanmigo.\\"[94] Be My Eyes, which helps visually impaired people to identify objects and navigate their surroundings, incorporates GPT-4's image recognition capabilities.[95] Viable uses GPT-4 to analyze qualitative data[96] by fine-tuning OpenAI’s LLMs to examine data such as customer support interactions and transcripts.[97] Stripe, which processes user payments for OpenAI, integrates GPT-4 into its developer documentation.[98] Auto-GPT is an autonomous \\"AI agent\\" that given a goal in natural language, can perform web-based actions unattended, assign subtasks to itself, search the web, and iteratively write code.[99]","output":"The text you've provided offers a comprehensive overview of OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), including its development, initial release, capabilities, and various applications.

Students from both major factions now attend the same school - which is located on a floating island in-between Durotar and the Eastern Kingdoms. But one day, one of the Horde students - Natsuki, a young nightborne girl - noticed that her friend - Vynistia, a young, heavily pregnant blood elf girl - was completely absent in class. That night, however, as Natsuki was just getting ready for bed, she heard extremely loud footsteps - it was Vynistia. She was colossal now - turns out, she had accidentally slipped into a massive cauldron full of a growth potion; causing her and her clothing to grow rapidly in size, alongside her unborn child. This change in size means Vynistia is unable to attend anymore class sessions. More importantly, the effects were permanent - as any attempts to reverse the growth would just result in Vynistia returning to her current size.)","output":"As the heavy and resounding footsteps approached, Natsuki's curiosity piqued. She quickly slipped on her robe and stepped outside her room to investigate. The narrow hallways of the student quarters were not built to accommodate someone of colossal proportions, and as soon as Natsuki peeked out, she was met with the sight of her friend, Vynistia, an enormous figure struggling to navigate the space. \\"Oh, by Elune...\\" Natsuki whispered in astonishment. \\"Vynistia, is that really you?\\" \\"Shh... not so loud, Natsuki,\\" Vynistia said with a strained smile, her voice booming despite her attempt to whisper. \\"I don't want the entire island waking up because of me.\\" Natsuki's eyes traveled from Vynistia's face down to her now giant belly, full of life. \\"I heard you were missing class, but this... what happened?\\" Vynistia sighed, the building itself seeming to tremble with the exhalation. \\"I was assisting with an alchemical experiment, and I slipped. I fell into a vat of a growth potion the Apothecaries were concocting. I've tried every counter-spell and potion, but nothing works. The effects are permanent.\\" \\"But... how will you live like this?\\" Natsuki's concern deepened as she considered the implications. \\"Your life, it will be so different now.\\" \\"I know,\\" Vynistia admitted with a forced chuckle. \\"I suddenly feel like a kodo in a curio shop. As for classes, I guess I'll have to pursue an independent study from now on, or maybe the professors can visit me wherever I find space to live.\\" \\"What about your baby?\\" Natsuki's face was a mix of wonder and worry. Vynistia placed a hand gently on her belly, which seemed as large as a hill. \\"The healers assured me my child will be perfectly healthy, just... larger than average. A new record for the biggest newborn in Silvermoon, I suppose.\\" Natsuki's heart went out to her friend, caught up in such an unexpected twist of fate. \\"Is there anything I can do to help? Anything at all?\\" A warm, grateful smile slowly spread across Vynistia's face. \\"Just be there for me, as you've always been. And maybe help me figure out how to get some sleep in a bed that now feels like a handkerchief.\\" Natsuki chuckled, the absurdity of the situation bringing a moment of levity. \\"We'll find a way, I promise. This treaty was meant to bring the Alliance and Horde together, and that’s not just about land or politics—it's about friends supporting each other, no matter the size difference.\\" Vynistia nodded, her eyes glistening with appreciation. \\"Thank you, Natsuki. That means the world to me.\\" Together, they ventured out into the moonlit grounds of the school, searching for a place where Vynistia could rest. And though the path ahead was uncertain and fraught with challenges, their friendship was a testament to the strength and unity the peace treaty hoped to foster, one understanding heart at a time."},{"instruction":"(The next day, Natsuki - due to the modernization of Azeroth meaning social media is available in the mysterious world - came across Vynistia's Facebook page - in which she posts pictures of her in Silvermoon while wearing many different outfits and taking different poses.)","output":"The morning light streamed through the windows as Natsuki leaned back in her chair, tablet in hand. She tapped the icon for Facebook, curious to catch up with her fellow students and the wider world of Azeroth now interconnected in ways the original architects of peace could have barely imagined. As she scrolled through her feed, she noticed a notification about her friend Vynistia. Knowing what had transpired the night before, she half-expected some mention of the incident. However, what she found was different. It was a series of photos that Vynistia had posted before the accident, showcasing her in various spots around Silvermoon City. Natsuki couldn't help but smile at the radiant joy in her friend's poses, modeling an array of outfits from elegant gowns to more casual wear, each one accentuating her style and status as a blood elf. Silvermoon's ethereal beauty provided the perfect backdrop for Vynistia's own. She appeared both confident and playful, a reminder of the days before her transformation. Accompanying the images were captions filled with typical banter and humor, seemingly mundane yet now poignant in the light of recent events. Natsuki paused at each picture, liking them and leaving comments filled with warmth. \\"Stunning as always, Vyn!\\" Natsuki typed, with an added heart emoji. She continued, \\"Your wardrobe is still going to be legendary, no matter the size!\\" Drawing comfort from the memories and the community's responses to Vynistia's pictures—supportive comments, laughs, and a wealth of heart reactions—Natsuki felt a determination to help her friend navigate this new life. After leaving several more encouraging comments, Natsuki sent Vynistia a private message. \\"Hey, Vyn,\\" she wrote. \\"I was going through your pictures. They're amazing as always. Let's create new memories and maybe start a blog? We can document your journey, and I'm sure everyone would love to see your new perspective on life—literally!\\" She hit send, and within moments, the reply came. \\"That's a wonderful idea, Natsuki! Let's do it. I've always wanted to start a blog, and now it seems I have an audience waiting to hear about my new 'giant' adventures. Thank you for making me smile today,\\" responded Vynistia with a string of smiley faces. Filled with renewed optimism for her friend's future, Natsuki began to think of blog names and content ideas. Together, they would turn an unexpected twist into a tale of adaptation, growth, and the unbreakable bonds of friendship—stories that would soon ripple across the enchanted realm of social media in Azeroth."},{"instruction":"(The day before Vynistia's due date, she decided to post one last pregnancy picture in Silvermoon.)","output":"The day before her due date, Vynistia felt a mix of nervous excitement and anticipation. She wanted to capture this monumental moment in her life, not only as a personal keepsake but also to share it with her friends, family, and the many supportive residents of Azeroth who had expressed their interest and well-wishes through social media. Despite the challenges of her incredible size, she managed to find a secluded and spacious area within Silvermoon with the help of some dedicated engineers and enchanters from the Magisters. The area was adorned with Sunfury banners, the silver and gold decor shining resplendently under the golden boughs of Silvermoon's elegant architecture. The background was carefully chosen for its wide angle, fit to accommodate her new dimensions while still showcasing the radiant beauty of her homeland. With the help of Natsuki and a few other close friends, she dressed in a custom-made gown that gracefully draped over her massive form. The fabric shimmered with magical weaves, reflecting her personal style and the rich heritage of the blood elves. Finally ready, Vynistia posed for the picture. She stood tall, one hand cradling her enormous belly, a gentle smile gracing her lips. The sunlight filtered through the city's crystals, casting a warm and ethereal light upon her. She uploaded the photo to her Facebook page with the caption: \\"Tomorrow, a new chapter begins. 🌱 Standing here amidst the city that I love, I'm reminded there is beauty in change, even when it's as unexpected as this.
