Recommended by our Thai friend and recommended by our Chinese friend 1 year ago (which I completely ignored, sorry Richard C!), we ventured to this strip mall gem Saturday night.  It is tucked away in a strip mall near the Southwest corner of Ft. Apache and Tropicana.  I let the hungry stomach take over by ordering almost too much food, but I just wanted to eat everything!  The low down: 1.  Crab Rangoons -  This is usually an item I only have at Chinese/American food places a la Panda Expresses and mom pop's, but I really wanted deep fried cream cheese wontons.  Bad decision.  The wonton wrapper was not extra crispy deep fried, but actually tasted like it was baked.  The filling was also too sweet. 2.  Tom Yum Soup with Shrimp (level 5/10 spicy) - I enjoyed the soup's tangy and spicy robust flavors.   3.  Duck Fried Rice (off menu) - For some reason, I really wanted duck fried rice, so I asked if this was available off menu.  They did!  This was pretty delish, but it still doesn't beat my favorite Thai fried rice of spicy basil fried rice. 4.  Chicken Yellow Curry (spicy level 1/10) - This was good, but could have used more heat.  We had to get it super mild because we had a little one with us.  Next time, we'll get 5/10 spicy level. 5.  Chicken Pad Thai (5/10 spicy) - I think this was the winner of the night.  Just spicy enough.  Just tangy enough.  Just sweet enough. Perfect chewy rice noodles.  Two thumbs up.  Conclusion:  For my pad thai cravings, Corner Thai is the place to go! 3.5/5 Stars.  Will have to go back and try other items on the menu and bring on the spicy! Is this review positive or negative?

Here is a premise: Lawrence opined that they had to make a show of doing something.  Here is a hypothesis: They wouldn't even have to put on a show of doing it. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To examine whether the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, let's first analyze each statement. Premise: Lawrence opined that they had to make a show of doing something. In this premise, Lawrence believes that it is necessary for them to create an appearance or give the impression of engaging in some activity. It implies that there might be external factors, such as expectations from others or the need to satisfy a certain requirement, that have led Lawrence to conclude that putting on a show of action is essential. Hypothesis: They wouldn't even have to put on a show of doing it. This hypothesis suggests that the act of putting on a show is not, in fact, necessary. It could be interpreted in two ways: either the external factors highlighted in the premise are inessential, or there may be other more effective approaches to fulfill the obligation that Lawrence is trying to address. Now let's examine if the premise being true makes the hypothesis true. If we accept the premise (that Lawrence believes a show of action is necessary), it could be derived that Lawrence may not be aware of alternative approaches or consider all possible implications. However, the hypothesis counters Lawrence's belief by suggesting that putting on a show is not necessary. Therefore, if the premise is true, it doesn't necessarily lead to the hypothesis being true as well, since both statements present different viewpoints on whether putting on a show of doing something is required or not. In conclusion, the premise and the hypothesis represent contrasting perspectives, and the truth of the premise does not inherently validate the hypothesis. It is crucial to understand the context, reasons, and factors that have shaped Lawrence's opinion and to explore other possible solutions to determine the validity of the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sterling, at odds with the club over a new contract, cut inside Ryan Taylor and dispatched a smart finish past Tim Krul to open the scoring. Newcastle had a strong penalty appeal turned down before the break, but Allen's shot put paid to any comeback. A miserable night for the visitors ended with Moussa Sissoko's red card. Media playback is not supported on this device The midfielder was fortunate to receive a second yellow - rather than a straight red - for a studs-up challenge on Lucas Leiva, who was uninjured. The result leaves Liverpool fifth in the Premier League table on 57 points with six games of the season to go, one point ahead of Southampton in sixth. Manchester City sit in fourth, on 61 points, with third-placed Manchester United a further four points ahead. This win against a disjointed Newcastle was far from a return to the fluid form that the Reds discovered at the start of 2015. Yet with Manchester City stalling above them, and three fixtures against teams in the bottom seven to follow, it was a result to fuel optimism after back-to-back league defeats against Manchester United and Arsenal. That may be tempered by a closer look at the league table and City's vastly superior goal difference - +31 compared to +11. For Newcastle, a fifth successive league defeat continues an end-of-season malaise that is unlikely to end in relegation, but will add to supporters' frustrations. Liverpool were lacking the  and 39 goals down on the tally they had amassed at the same stage last year. But they started well, continually catching out Newcastle as Sterling, Philippe Coutinho, Jordon Ibe and Alberto Moreno swapped positions, taking it in turns to surge into the area. Sterling at least partially repaired some bruised relations with the home fans while simultaneously strengthening his bargaining position with an excellently taken goal. Isolated one on one with Taylor by Jordan Henderson's driven pass,  he cut inside the full-back, dodged a half-hearted challenge from Gabriel Obertan and, with minimal back-lift, guided a curling shot into the far corner. The winger could have easily have had a hat-trick, with an open goal miss particularly glaring, but his profligacy ultimately did not cost his side and he departed to warm applause when substituted late on. Media playback is not supported on this device Newcastle's best hope of getting back into the game came when Ayoze Perez was chopped down by Dejan Lovren as Liverpool freewheeled towards half-time. But referee Lee Mason decided the Croatian's challenge did not warrant a penalty. John Carver's side continued to improve after the break but Allen's sharp half-volley, as the ball came back off Mike Williamson, snuffed out their hopes. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers: \\"I thought we showed attacking intent, won the ball back quickly and controlled the game until the last five or six minutes in the first half. \\"I think we were fortunate not to give away a penalty, but thankfully it didn't go against us. \\"Philippe Coutinho was incredible, sensational.

This is because the presence of more magma moving upwards increases the potential for volcanic activity, but it does not guarantee that more lava will flow from volcanoes. The process of magma reaching the Earth's surface and erupting as lava is influenced by various factors like pressure, the composition of the magma, and the tectonic forces at play. These factors determine whether or not the magma will erupt as lava. So, when more magma moves up, it can indirectly affect the step of magma erupting onto Earth's surface as lava.

Write a text based on this summary: lirr killer claims he 's competent to stand trial Text:","output":"Title: LIRR Killer's Insistence on Competency to Stand Trial Calls for Close Examination In a shocking turn of events, the man accused of the Long Island Rail Road massacre in which several passengers lost their lives, has recently claimed that he is competent enough to stand trial for his heinous crimes. The case has garnered national attention and raised questions about the process of determining the mental competence of defendants and the consequences faced by the legal system. The tragic incident that took place in the LIRR train sent shockwaves throughout the nation as the gruesome nature of the crime shook the very core of public safety. The alleged perpetrator of the attack, henceforth referred to as the LIRR Killer, exhibited a disturbing and cold-blooded nature that quickly raised concerns about his mental condition at the time of the crime. Since the incident unfolded, there have been several debates about the mental competency of the LIRR Killer and whether or not he should face trial. The legal system has a responsibility to ensure that defendants are mentally fit to stand for their alleged actions, and this obligation extends to cases as catastrophic as this one. The question of determining competency has posed a challenge to both legal and mental health professionals, who are required to balance the need for justice and the concerns for human rights. The recent confession from the LIRR Killer that he is indeed competent enough to stand trial has added fuel to the existing debates. Lawyers, psychiatrists, and other experts will now have to delve deeper into the defendant's claim and determine any underlying motives or hidden agendas that may be at play. The claim itself raises numerous questions: What factors should be taken into consideration when deciding the competency of a defendant? How can the legal and medical community ensure an impartial and fair trial for the accused under such challenging circumstances? What ramifications could this decision have on the wider public's perception of the criminal justice system? One cannot simply take the word of the LIRR Killer at face value. It is crucial that a team of mental health experts carefully assesses and evaluates his claim to competency. The court must establish a multispecialty task force, consisting of psychiatrists, psychologists, legal professionals, and forensic experts, to conduct a thorough and unbiased investigation. This task force should look into the defendant's mental health history, any previous instances of manipulation, and analyze his current psychological condition. Additionally, they should assess his understanding of legal proceedings and whether he can partake meaningfully in his trial. Furthermore, it is essential that the legal system makes a conscious effort to provide a fair trial for the accused, even under the most egregious circumstances. The defendant's right to due legal process should be maintained throughout the proceedings, despite the severity of the crime or public opinion. Any decision made in haste or under pressure from external factors may inadvertently affect the integrity of the legal system and erode public trust. Lastly, stakeholders in the criminal justice system should be prepared to address the potential fallout that may arise from either outcome in the LIRR Killer's trial. If deemed competent, the defendant may use this decision as a platform to showcase his intentions or motivations, which could consequently induce panic among the general public. On the other hand, if found incompetent, there may be concerns about the effectiveness of the justice system in dealing with complex mental health issues. Legal and medical professionals must collaborate and create a comprehensive framework that addresses such scenarios efficiently and sensitively. In conclusion, the LIRR Killer's claim to competency warrants close examination by mental health experts, legal professionals, and forensic analysts. A fair trial should be ensured, and the criminal justice system has to be prepared to tackle the potential impact of the trial's outcome on public opinion and trust. The LIRR case serves as a sobering reminder of the significant responsibility placed on the legal system in balancing justice with the rights of the accused, regardless of the severity of the crimes committed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. It's not just the smell of food that can trigger your nausea, you need to watch out for non-food triggers as well. According to babycenter.com, \\"a warm or stuffy room, the smell of heavy perfume, a car ride, or even certain visual stimuli, like flickering lights, might trigger your nausea.\\" Make a mental note every time your nausea is triggered, then you can make a conscious effort to avoid that trigger moving forward. Sudden movements can jolt your stomach and bring on a fresh wave of nausea, so try to move as slowly and carefully as possible. Take your time getting up in the morning - nibble a cracker while still lying down, move gently into a sitting position, then stay seated for a few minutes before standing up. Pace yourself throughout the day, don't overexert yourself.  Set your alarm clock a half hour earlier than usual to give yourself plenty of time in the mornings. Try putting a little stool or seat in the shower, so you can avoid feeling light-headed. Sometimes the easiest and simplest solution is just to stop and give your body a break for a while. Try lying down, closing your eyes, taking a few deep breaths, and just getting some rest. Many women find that sleep is a great way to escape morning sickness - and it might be just what your body needs!  If you already have a kids, bring a babysitter in, even if it's just for an hour or two, so you can catch up on some long overdue R&R. Having trouble nodding off during the day? Try wearing a sleep mask or putting on a pair of dark sunglasses to block out bright light. You may think that surfing the web will help take your mind off morning sickness, but the computer's bright screen and undetectable strobe effect may make you more nauseated. To combat that, try adjusting your screen to reduce eye strain.  Try changing the font size to make it bolder and larger, and change the desktop background to a soft pink or tan. You should also take short breaks from the computer as frequently as possible -- you can do this by getting up and moving around or simply by closing your eyes. Escape from the stuffy indoors and head outside for some fresh air and light exercise. Breathe deeply through the nose, then exhale through the mouth. Clean, country or seaside air is best, but your garden or a nearby park will also do nicely. If you're stuck indoors, try opening a window to let the stale air out and the fresh air circulate. Nausea can be difficult to ignore, but finding something to take your mind off it - even for a little while - can help. Read a magazine, call a friend, or go for a short walk. Light exercise, such as yoga or gentle swimming may also help to ease nausea, but you should get any exercise plans approved by your doctor first. It's also important to listen to your body -- if you start feeling tired or more queasy, it's time to stop. It's a smart idea to put together a little survival kit for yourself for those emergency situations when you're not at home. Pack a toothbrush and toothpaste, some mints and a clean blouse. You could also include a snack such as crackers or pretzels, and a plastic bag for when you just can't make it to a restroom on time. If you just can't seem to find any relief from your morning sickness, go to see your doctor. Ask about anti-nausea medications, which can help ease or eliminate your suffering. A small percentage of women may also develop a condition known as hyperemesis gravidarum, which is an extreme form of morning sickness which causes extreme dehydration and weight loss. If you think you may be at risk, contact your health care provider immediately. Some anti-nausea medications may not be covered under insurance plans and can be costly - so consider the expense before getting a prescription. Summary:","output":"To cope with morning sickness and nausea, make a mental note of your triggers and try to avoid them. Move slowly and carefully to avoid jolting your stomach, and allow yourself extra time in the morning to wake up gradually. Rest whenever possible, and consider adjusting your computer screen settings to reduce eye strain. Get fresh air and engage in light exercise approved by a doctor, and find distractions to take your mind off nausea. Create a \\"survival kit\\" with items for emergencies when away from home, and consult your doctor if your morning sickness becomes severe or unmanageable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As if getting into a serious motorcycle accident wasn’t scary enough, suddenly the former heavyweight champion of the world was approaching him, but Mike was there to help.      While traveling onto the on-ramp on I-15 North off Flamingo Road in Las Vegas Tuesday night, Chesley was involved in a nasty motorcycle crash after a cab cut him off from the left lane, his attorney Stephen Stubbs told the Daily News.      The victim was sent flying off his bike and suffered several injuries including a paralyzed big toe, broken ankle and torn muscles and ligaments, Stubbs said. Chesley will also need surgery, he said.      But when he was lying on the roadway, he looked up and saw Mike Tyson with three friends offering their help. The group blocked off traffic, and “Iron Mike” sat with Chesley and spoke with him in a soft voice to keep him from going into shock, Stubbs said.      “He looked up and saw Mike Tyson,” Stubbs said. “He was saying ‘don’t worry, don’t worry,’ people are coming.’”      Ryan Chesley sent this fruit basket to Mike Tyson for helping Chesley get back up after a motorcycle accident in Las Vegas. (Courtesy of Stephen Stubbs)      Chesley does not know how long they were there, but he thought he might be hallucinating, his attorney said. He grabbed his camera with his uninjured hand and took a picture, he said.      “He didn’t know what was happening,” Stubbs said. “(Mike) just stood by him and talked to him. When he was done with the good deed, he just took off.”      Tyson is known for his bizarre behavior — including biting off a chunk of Evander Holyfield's ear in 1997 — but he appears to have acted quickly and responsibly in this instance.      Chesley was so grateful for Mike’s help, he reached out to his representatives to send a thank-you note and fruit basket.      \\"It has to be the most reassuring thing in the world to have Mike Tyson telling people not to touch me,\\" Chesley wrote.      Grateful motorcyclist Ryan Chesley also sent this thank-you letter, along with a fruit basket, to Mike Tyson after the former boxer came to his aid after the accident. (Handout)      “”He wanted to say thank you,” Stubbs said. “We asked if we could send chocolates but his rep said ‘no, he’s a health nut.’ We sent him a fruit basket because he is into antioxidants.”      A representative for the eccentric boxer who grew up in Brooklyn confirmed the note and fruit basket were sent over. Tyson was not available Monday for a statement, the representative said.      “Iron Mike” has recently been performing a one-man show about his life, and the 48-year-old continues to make headlines.      He recently used vulgar language in front of a TV news reporter during a live interview in Canada. The journalist had asked Mike about his rape conviction in 1992.      jlandau@nydailynews.com Follow on Twitter @joelzlandau ||||| Mike Tyson Comes to Rescue of Motorcycle Crash Victim      Mike Tyson -- Comes to Rescue of Motorcycle Crash Victim      EXCLUSIVE      When you need a calm, soothing voice to get you through a traumatic event, you don't think of... but that's exactly what happened to a motorcycle crash victim.Ryan Chesley tells TMZ ... he was on his way to Las Vegas this week when a cab cut him off on the freeway ... sending him flying off his chopper.Chesley says Tyson saw the whole thing ... slammed on his brakes and stopped traffic.

By Allan Hall PUBLISHED: 07:05 EST, 27 September 2013 | UPDATED: 07:06 EST, 27 September 2013 Police are probing a borehole in a cemetery containing the remains of murdered concentration camp victims which they believe was dug by Nazi treasure hunters searching for the fabled Amber Room of the tsars. Ever since a book called 'The Puzzle of Poppen Wood' by Mario Ulbrich was released two years ago the search for the fabled treasure has lured legions of hunters to the scene of old mine workings in eastern Germany seeking the fortune estimated at over 150 million pounds. Ulbrich interviewed foresters, policemen, miners and old Nazis for his work which chronicles two decades of largely unreported quarrying in the wood near Zwickau in east Germany.

You can assist by editing it. (October 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Ramanaa begins with the abduction of fifteen revenue officers. After three days in captivity, fourteen officers are released, but one is murdered. The police find a tape recording and a file on the dead officer's body that provide significant evidence about the kidnapping and subsequent murder. The file suggests that the crimes were committed by members of the self-proclaimed \\"Anti-Corruption Force\\" (A.C.F.), a citizen militia seeking to eliminate corruption through vigilante means. The militia, acting as a kangaroo court, had \\"sentenced\\" corrupt officials in the area to death, beginning with the captured revenue officers who were apparently engaging in criminal activity. The film's setting then shifts to Ramanaa, a mild-mannered professor at National College, who lives in an independent house with four adopted kids. While visiting his adopted child at the hospital, Ramanaa discovers that the officials at the facility are engaging in extortion and fraud. After collecting evidence of the hospital staff's deception, Ramanaa turns them over to the authorities. The plot ringleader is the hospital dean, who commits suicide upon discovery. His grief-stricken father, a local construction magnate named Bhadrinarayanan, vows to take revenge on the man responsible for his son's death. During the festival of Deepavali, Ramanaa's apartment building collapses, killing many residents including his wife and daughter. Recovering from the incident, he demands to know who was responsible for the building's collapse.

News article: Trump wins big in SC primary as Bush bows out; Clinton edges Sanders in Nev. Donald Trump charges into Nevada and the mega-March primaries with a commanding lead over the GOP field after sweeping to victory Saturday in the South Carolina primary – while Hillary Clinton can breathe a sigh of relief that her firewall held just enough to beat back Bernie Sanders in Nevada, as they head to Palmetto State territory. The outcome of Saturday’s contests helps both 2016 “front-runners” regain their footing after going one-for-one in the leadoff contests. But there are potential hurdles ahead. The big question now looming over the GOP race is: With Jeb Bush suspending his campaign on the heels of a distant finish Saturday, where will his supporters go? At his victory rally, Trump challenged pundits who say such votes will gravitate to his rivals. The billionaire businessman sounded a booming note of confidence as he previewed the race ahead. “Let’s put this thing away,” Trump told cheering supporters. Reflecting on the rough-and-tumble primary, which gave him a 10-point margin of victory, Trump also said, “When you win, it’s beautiful. “ Clinton heads into the next round in a more fragile – albeit improved – position. Clinton has watched her lead in national polls essentially evaporate after losing big in New Hampshire. Her showing in Nevada marks a crucial victory, and she enjoys a significant advantage heading into next weekend’s South Carolina primary. “I am so, so thrilled and so grateful to all of my supporters,” Clinton said at her Las Vegas victory rally. SOUTH CAROLINA GOP PRIMARY RESULTS But her 5-point margin of victory may not be enough, at this stage, to significantly blunt Sanders’ momentum. The Vermont senator maintained he has an “excellent chance” to score some big wins in the upcoming Super Tuesday contests. The Palmetto State, meanwhile, delivered a huge victory Saturday night on the Republican side to Trump -- while Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz were locked in a tight race for second. Cruz nevertheless gave a fiery speech to supporters, as the senator touted his campaign’s ability to defy “expectations” and maintained that he’s the best candidate to go up against Clinton or Sanders “or whatever other socialist they nominate” on the Democratic side. “Indeed, the screaming you hear now from across the Potomac is the Washington cartel in full terror that the conservative grassroots are rising up,” Cruz said, while suggesting he’s the only candidate who can beat Trump. Rubio, for his part, declared: “After tonight, this has become a three-person race, and we will win the nomination.” Rubio was in need of a recovery after stumbling in New Hampshire following a rough debate performance earlier this month. He had vowed to bounce back, and was buoyed in South Carolina by support from the state's popular governor, Nikki Haley, and other state leaders. With Bush now out of the race, Ohio Gov. John Kasich is the only governor left standing on the GOP side. It remains unclear where his supporters will go. The only other candidate left is retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who vowed to press on. The GOP race heads next to Nevada and after that to Super Tuesday, representing a delegate gold mine. Even South Carolina, with 50 delegates, is the most valuable GOP primary to date. As the winner, Trump would get the lion's share. South Carolina, historically, also is a prized contest for Republican candidates as it has a knack for picking the eventual nominee – the primary winner has gone on to claim the nomination in every race since 1980, except for 2012 when Newt Gingrich won. The race tightened in the final days, but not enough to shake Trump's long-time advantage there. Fox News exit polls indicate significant numbers of late-deciding voters ended up supporting Cruz and Rubio, causing both candidates to perform more strongly than pre-election polling suggested. Clinton’s Nevada win comes just a week-and-a-half after she lost to Sanders by double-digits in New Hampshire. \\"To everyone who turned out in every corner of Nevada with determination and heart: This is your win. Thank you,\\" Clinton tweeted after the race was called. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"1. Donald Trump won the South Carolina primary, while Hillary Clinton narrowly defeated Bernie Sanders in the Nevada caucuses. 2. Trump's victory strengthens his position as the GOP front-runner, leading into the Nevada caucus and Super Tuesday contests. 3. Jeb Bush suspended his campaign after a poor showing in the South Carolina primary, raising questions about where his supporters will go. 4. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz were locked in a tight race for second place in the South Carolina primary, with both candidates declaring themselves well-positioned to challenge Trump for the nomination. 5. Clinton's win in Nevada helps to regain some footing after her loss in New Hampshire, but her relatively narrow victory suggests that Sanders' momentum remains strong as they head into the South Carolina primary and Super Tuesday."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Following the Mamluk victory over the Mongols in 1260 at the Battle of Ain Jalut by Qutuz and his general Baibars, Qutuz was assassinated, leaving Baibars to claim the sultanate for himself. As Sultan, Baibars proceeded to attack the Christian crusaders at Arsuf, Athlith, Haifa, Safad, Jaffa, Ascalon, and Caesarea. As the Crusader fortress cities fell one by one, the Christians sought help from Europe, but assistance was slow in coming. In 1268 Baibars captured Antioch, thereby destroying the last remnant of the Principality of Antioch, securing the Mamluk northern front and threatening the small Crusader County of Tripoli. Louis IX of France, having already organized a large crusader army with the intent of attacking Egypt, was diverted instead to Tunis, where Louis himself died in 1270. Prince Edward of England arrived in Tunis too late to contribute to the remainder of the crusade in Tunis. Instead, he continued on his way to the Holy Land to assist Bohemund VI, Prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli, against the Mamluk threat to Tripoli and the remnant of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. On May 9, 1271, Edward finally arrived at Acre. He brought a small but not insignificant contingent of no more than 1,000 men, including 225 knights.

Question: Why was the Yashiromaru sunk fifteen years earlier? Title: Case Closed: Strategy Above the Depths Movie plot: The 9th annual Detective Conan movie sets sail on a 100 million yen luxurious cruise. Fifteen years ago, a cruise named Yashiromaru, built by the Yashiro group, sank while sailing. In the present, a new cruise, the Saint Aphrodite, was built by the Yashiro group and Conan and the rest were invited through Sonoko. Earlier, the husband of the CEO of the Yashiro family group, an established ship architect, had a heart-attack and drove his car down a cliff. On the second day of the cruise, the CEO herself was found murdered in her room. Later, her father, the President of the Yashiro group was also found missing. He had been thrown off the cruise into the ocean, seemingly by the same person. At the welcoming party, Kogorou shows off his deduction skills, and concluded that the sub-designer of the cruise, Akiyoshi, was the murderer. However, Conan has different ideas. Kusaka, a scriptwriter who worked in co-operation with Akiyoshi on a script, was the culprit. Kusaka reveals that the accident from 15 years ago was a scheme to sink the ship deliberately to get insurance. His father was murdered when he discovered the captain of the ship was drugged and left to die. Kusaka immediately set off bombs and escaped by sea and the Detective Boys gave chase. After they successfully took down the criminal, more bombs were ignited. All passengers were evacuated, but Ran returned to her hiding place during the hide-and-seek game to find a \\"gold medal\\" made by sea-shells the Detective Boys made for her. However, as the ship swayed, she fainted in the enclosed area.It turns out Akiyoshi was the main murderer after all, and she was the one who did all three killings and made Kusaka think that he did them himself. She also revealed that her father was the captain who died while the cruise ship sank. Kogorou, however, deduced correctly this time and managed to arrest Akiyoshi.

Mr. John Evans had never found the time or money to make the trip from his home in Forest Fach, near Swansea. But, when British Rail offered him an all-expenses-paid birthday trip to the capital he just could not refuse. He arrived at Paddington Station and smartly turned out in his best suit, favorite Panama hat and a red rose in his buttonhole. \\"It's very exciting. There's no doubt about it,\\" he said.

If you’ve chosen a friend, do you want to know more about their background, or are you more interested in their future plans? If you’ve chosen a romantic partner, do you want to know about their dating history, or do you want to know how they feel about your relationship? If you are playing in a group, you can decide as a group what types of questions to ask. This can be tailored to each target, or there can be an overall theme for the game. There are two ways to play: the first involves people asking whatever questions come to mind, and asking them at random. The second has the pair (or group) come up with a set list of questions which are then posed to each person. Writing a list beforehand is the easier choice, as everyone knows what they will be asked, and will likely agree to answer. Asking at random may be the more entertaining choice, but is also at higher risk of getting too personal or inappropriate. If you decide to play this game with strangers or acquaintances you meet in a specific setting, you may want to take that setting into consideration when forming some or all of your questions.  If meeting with members of a book club or writer's group, you might ask questions like, “What is your favorite book?” or “If you could be any fictional character from any book, who would you be?” If meeting with a church group, consider questions such as, “What is your favorite Bible verse/story?” or “When did you first develop an interest in religion?” If meeting someone new at the grand opening of a coffee shop, consider questions like “What is your favorite snack to enjoy with coffee?” or “Would you rather give up coffee for a month or stop showering for a week?” Although many of the people playing 21 Questions use is as a method to ask probing or otherwise inappropriate questions, respect the privacy of the person being asked questions--particularly in a group of people. If they want to sidestep something, or answer in vague terms, allow them to do so. The golden rule is a great thing to keep in mind when playing this game. Treat the target the same way you’d like to be treated during your turn as a target. There are some questions that should not be asked in any circumstance. Before you begin the game, identify any questions that might be too inconsiderate, thoughtless, or crude to ask.  These questions can include broad categories such as sex and intimacy, or can be specific questions, such as, “Have you ever committed a crime?” You can also create guidelines about the sort of questions being asked based by theme. For instance, if playing 21 Questions at a church youth group, you might indicate that at least half of the questions must be religious in nature. There may be a question that is just too probing or intimate for someone to answer. To safeguard against people getting upset, make a rule before starting the game for these instances. A simple rule could be that a target can pass on a question, but must then be asked a question in its place, or that the target can pass on a question, but will forfeit their turn to ask the next target a question. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article is basically telling you about a game called 21 Questions. In this game, you ask someone 21 questions, and they must answer honestly. It's a fun way to get to know someone better, especially if they're someone you don't know very well. You can play with a group of friends, a romantic partner, or even with strangers. The game can be played by asking random questions or making a list of questions beforehand. Remember to be respectful when asking questions, and avoid asking anything too personal or inappropriate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ian found the camera that Ryan had lost at the beach, so","output":"Ian found the camera that Ryan had lost at the beach, so he decided to meticulously clean the device, carefully removing any sand or debris that may have lodged itself in its delicate components, all while preserving the memory card containing the cherished moments captured. Once satisfied with its condition, Ian thought about the best course of action to ensure that the camera would be safely returned to its rightful owner, Ryan. First, Ian considered sending Ryan a text message to inform him about the found camera. However, knowing that the beach was a popular spot for tourists and that Ryan might not receive the message promptly, Ian decided to explore other options. He recalled that Ryan was staying at a nearby hotel and thought it would be a good idea to contact the hotel's reception desk to pass along the information. Before heading to the hotel, Ian searched for clues that might help the hotel staff to verify that the camera indeed belonged to Ryan. He browsed through the photos stored on the device and found a picture of Ryan posing with a group of friends in front of the hotel. Additionally, the group was holding a sign with the name \\"Ryan's Beach Vacation Extravaganza.\\" Ian took note of these details, intending to share them with the hotel staff in order to help confirm the camera's ownership. Upon arrival at the hotel, Ian approached the reception desk and explained the situation to the receptionist. He shared the visual evidence he had found on the camera and requested the staff's assistance to locate Ryan. The receptionist cautiously took the camera and carefully examined it. After verifying Ian's claims and cross-checking it with their in-house records of Ryan's stay, the receptionist agreed to store the camera in their lost and found area while using the hotel's communication system to contact Ryan. Meanwhile, Ian returned to his activities, feeling a sense of accomplishment for his good deed. He hoped that the camera would bring a wave of relief and happiness to Ryan, who was surely worried about the lost memories contained within. Shortly after, Ryan received a call from the hotel's receptionist, informing him about the recovered camera. Thrilled, Ryan rushed to the hotel lobby, thanked the hotel staff, and asked about the kind person who had found his precious camera. Upon learning Ian's name, Ryan was deeply grateful and decided to give his thanks to Ian personally. When Ryan and Ian finally met face to face, they shared a heartfelt conversation about the importance of creating and preserving cherished memories through photographs. Their shared experience inspired Ryan to take even more pictures to document the rest of his vacation, while Ian left with the satisfaction of a good deed done and a newfound appreciation for photography. As an unexpected outcome, their encounter also laid the foundation for an unexpected friendship. Ian and Ryan stayed in touch long after their initial meeting, bonding over their shared interests and experiences. Their story became emblematic of the enduring bonds that can be formed through the simplest acts of kindness - illustrating how the lost can become found, both in terms of material possessions and meaningful connections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Monica and Jill are two friends. They study and party together most of the time. One day Monica shared a needle with a drug addict at a party. She later found out that she'd been infected with HIV. Jill was scared and helped her as much as she could.  Which friend has a virus that is transmitted contact with infected blood? A:","output":"Monica Monica and Jill are good friends who often study and party together. One day, Monica made a dangerous decision by sharing a needle with a drug addict at a party. Unfortunately, this action led to her contracting HIV. HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks the immune system, specifically CD4 cells (T cells), which help the immune system fight off infections. The virus can be spread through various means, including sexual contact, breastfeeding, and sharing needles or other drug injection equipment with someone who is infected. In this situation, Monica was the one who shared a needle with a person who was infected with HIV, which led to her contracting the virus. Jill, on the other hand, remains infection-free. It is crucial for people to understand the risks and methods of transmission associated with HIV and take appropriate precautions to prevent infection. Jill's decision to help Monica in any way she could is an example of true friendship and compassionate care. It is essential for Monica to seek professional medical help and treatment to manage this lifelong condition. Meanwhile, Jill can support her friend by learning more about HIV, offering emotional support, and encouraging her to follow a proper treatment plan. In conclusion, Monica is the friend who contracted the virus that is transmitted through contact with infected blood. It is a crucial reminder to abstain from practices that put individuals at risk of contracting HIV, including sharing needles with others. It is essential for everyone, including friends and family members, to provide support, understanding, and assistance to individuals living with HIV, and work together to minimize the stigma surrounding the disease."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Process: - Air is taken through the mouth - Enters the lungs - The oxygen fills the sacs in your lungs - Carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs and exhaled - The oxygen is pass throughout your body.  Question: suppose less virus enters a body happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen reaching the body.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"No effect To understand the reasoning behind this answer, let's first analyze the steps you've mentioned for the process of oxygen reaching the body, which essentially explains the process of respiration. 1. Air is taken through the mouth or nose. 2. The air travels through the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and finally enters the lungs. 3. Oxygen from the inhaled air fills the tiny sacs in the lungs, called alveoli, where the gas exchange takes place. 4. Carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, is removed from the lungs and exhaled. 5. The oxygen is then transported by hemoglobin present in red blood cells throughout the body to reach cells and tissues. Now, let's address the hypothetical situation where fewer viruses enter a body. Specifically, we will consider the respiratory system, as it is the primary focus of the given situation. Understandably, an infected person would experience various respiratory symptoms, which could include coughing, difficulty breathing, and congestion. Even with these symptoms, the effect of fewer viruses on the flow of oxygen reaching the body will be minimal or nonexistent in most situations. This conclusion is based on the assumption that the body's immune system responds adequately to the viral infection and prevents it from overwhelming the respiratory system. Furthermore, healthy and uninfected alveoli will still be able to facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, ensuring the body receives the oxygen it needs. Therefore, the proposed perturbation – fewer viruses entering the body – would have no significant effect on the ability of more oxygen to reach the lungs and be transported throughout the body. The respiratory system would likely remain functional and capable of maintaining normal oxygen levels, particularly if the individual has a generally healthy immune response and no extenuating factors that could exacerbate the consequences of viral infection. It's essential to note that this conclusion might not hold for every individual or in every circumstance, as the impact of respiratory viral infections can vary significantly among people with different health conditions, immune responses, or viral loads. However, for the general population, the stated perturbation should have no substantial effect on the process of respiration and oxygen delivery to the body's cells and tissues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A hilariously scathing indictment of the rock and roll lifestyle, and all the egoism and shallow philosophising that goes along with it. Summary:","output":"The movie is a highly praised and hilarious spoof of the rock and roll lifestyle, considered one of the funniest films of the 1980s and a groundbreaking \\"rockumentary.\\" It effectively combines intelligent humor and sharp criticism of the excesses and delusions of heavy metal bands. Its authenticity makes it feel almost indistinguishable from the real thing. However, some found the satire to be mediocre. Overall, the movie is considered a classic, influential, and increasingly relevant comedy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Information:  - Bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, in the case of the best-known bee species, the European honey bee, for producing honey and beeswax. Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea, presently considered as a clade Anthophila. There are nearly 20,000 known species of bees in seven to nine recognized families, though many are undescribed and the actual number is probably higher. They are found on every continent except Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants.  - A gill is a respiratory organ found in many aquatic organisms that extracts dissolved oxygen from water and excretes carbon dioxide. The gills of some species, such as hermit crabs, have adapted to allow respiration on land provided they are kept moist. The microscopic structure of a gill presents a large surface area to the external environment.  - An arthropod (from Greek \\"arthro-\\", joint + \\"podos\\", foot) is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages (paired appendages). Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda, which includes the insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans.  Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most animals, are very successful in dry environments.  - The Chalcididae are a moderate-sized family within the Chalcidoidea, composed mostly of parasitoids and a few hyperparasitoids. The family is apparently polyphyletic, though the different subfamilies may each be monophyletic, and some may be elevated to family status in the near future. As presently defined, there are over 85 genera and over 1455 species worldwide. They are often black with yellow, red, or white markings, rarely brilliantly metallic, with a robust mesosoma and very strong sculpturing. The hind femora are often greatly enlarged, with a row of teeth or serrations along the lower margin.  - A proleg is a small, fleshy, stub structure found on the ventral surface of the abdomen of most larval forms of insects of the order Lepidoptera, though they can also be found on other larval insects such as sawflies and a few types of flies. In all the orders in which they appear, mainly Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera, prolegs of any form evolved independently of each other by convergent evolution.  - Arachnids are a class (Arachnida) of joint-legged invertebrate animals (arthropods), in the subphylum Chelicerata. All arachnids have eight legs, although the front pair of legs in some species has converted to a sensory function, while in other species, different appendages can grow large enough to take on the appearance of extra pairs of legs. The term is derived from the Greek word (\\"aráchn\\"), meaning \\"spider\\". Spiders are the largest order in the class.  - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.  - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.  - The mesosoma is the middle part of the body, or tagma, of arthropods whose body is composed of three parts, the other two being the prosoma and the metasoma. It bears the legs, and, in the case of winged insects, the wings.  - The ovipositor is an organ used by some animals for the laying of eggs.  In insects an ovipositor consists of a maximum of three pairs of appendages. The details and morphology of the ovipositor vary, but typically its form is adapted to functions such as transmitting the egg, preparing a place for it, and placing it properly. In some insects the organ is used merely to attach the egg to some surface, but in many parasitic species (primarily in wasps and other Hymenoptera) it is a piercing organ as well.  - The Archaeognatha are an order of wingless insects, also known as jumping bristletails. They are among the least evolutionarily changed insects, appearing in the Middle Devonian period along with the arachnids. They are known from both body and trace fossils (the latter including body imprints and trackways) throughout the remainder of the Paleozoic Era. The name Archaeognatha is derived from Greek, \\"archaeos\\" meaning \\"ancient\\" and \\"gnatha\\" meaning \\"jaw\\". This refers to the articulation of the mandibles, which has a single condyle, where all higher insects have two. An alternative name, Microcoryphia, comes from the Greek \\"micro\\", meaning \\"small\\", and \\"coryphia\\", meaning head.  - A wasp is any insect of the order Hymenoptera and suborder Apocrita that is neither a bee nor an ant. The Apocrita have a common evolutionary ancestor and form a clade; wasps as a group do not form a clade, but are paraphyletic with respect to bees and ants.  - A carapace is a dorsal (upper) section of the exoskeleton or shell in a number of animal groups, including arthropods, such as crustaceans and arachnids, as well as vertebrates, such as turtles and tortoises. In turtles and tortoises, the underside is called the plastron.  - The metasoma is the posterior part of the body, or tagma, of arthropods whose body is composed of three parts, the other two being the prosoma and the mesosoma. In insects, it contains most of the digestive tract, respiratory system, and circulatory system, and the apical segments are typically modified to form genitalia. In a few of the most primitive insects (the Archaeognatha), the metasomal segments bear small, articulated appendages called \\"styli\\", which are often considered to be vestigial. There are also pre-apical appendages in most insect orders, called cerci, which may be multi-segmented and almost resembling a posterior pair of antennae; these may be variously modified, or lost entirely. Otherwise, most adult insects lack appendages on the metasoma, though many larval insects (e.g., caterpillars) have some form of appendages, such as prolegs or, in aquatic insects, gills.  - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.  - The Leucospidae ( sometimes incorrectly spelled Leucospididae ) are a small , specialized group within the Chalcidoidea , composed exclusively of ectoparasitoids of aculeate wasps or bees . They are typically mimics of bees or stinging wasps , often black with yellow , red , or white markings , sometimes metallic , with a robust mesosoma and very strong sculpturing . The hind femora are often greatly enlarged , with a row of teeth or serrations along the lower margin as in Chalcididae . The female ovipositor is sometimes short , but if not , it is recurved and lies along the dorsal side of the metasoma , a unique feature . The males are also unusual , in the fusion of many of the metasomal segments to form a capsule - like \`\` carapace '' . Leucospids are generally rarely encountered except in areas where their hosts are abundant ; in the United States , the most common species is Leucospis affinis , which attacks nests of leafcutter bees .

Allan Quatermain (Richard Chamberlain) is a white big-game hunter and explorer who is hired by Jesse Huston (Sharon Stone) a young American who wants to help her find her father who was belived to be lost on an expedition to find the fabled King Solomon's Mines. Together with his African companion, the mysterious Umbopo (Ken Gampu), they penetrate unknown country, following a map believed to be genuine. It transpires that Professor Huston has been captured by a German military expedition on the same quest, led by Bockner (Herbert Lom), a stereotypical, single-minded, knackwurst-munching, bald-headed Colonel and a ruthless Turkish slave-trader and adventurer, Dogati (John Rhys-Davies). Huston is being forced to interpret another map, also believed to be genuine.The two rival expeditions shadow each other, clashing on several occasions, and finally enter the tribal lands of the Kukuana who capture them. The tribe is under the control of the evil priestess, Gagoola, who has Quatermain hung upside down over a pond full of crocodiles. Just when all seems lost, Umbopo arrives and after defeating Gagoola's warriors in combat, reveals his identity as an exiled tribal chief and the rightful ruler of the Kukuanas. As the tribesmen submit to him, Gagoola captures Jesse and flees into caves in the depths of the Breasts of Sheba, the twin mountain peaks where the mines are located. They are pursued by Bockner and Dogati, who attack the village in full force.The Germans follow Quatermain and Umbopo to the entrance to the mines, but are hampered by a moat of quicksand. Bockner orders his men forward into the moat, but they have trouble crossing it. Dogati then kills all of Bockner's soldiers, as well as most of his own men, and uses their bodies as stepping stones to cross the moat safely. As they approach the entrance, Bockner shoots Dogati and takes command of what little remains of the party.Inside the mines, Quatermain and Umbopo rescue Jesse and find the resting place of all the former tribal...

A four-year-old girl has been mauled to death by a 'monster' pit bull while she was watching TV at home with her mom. Little Mia Derouen was pounced on by the 130lb dog, one of two at the home in the Houma Highland Apartments in Houma, Louisiana, and died in hospital from her injuries, according to Houma Police Chief Todd Duplantis. Police officers were called to the apartment complex around 7 p.m. Tuesday by the girl's mother, Megan Touchet, who was also injured as she desperately fought the crazed dog off her child. Scroll down for video. Tragic: Four-year-old Mia Derouen, pictured, was mauled to death by her family's dog. Birthday: Mia was due to turn five the week after the attack on March 25. 'The mother was able to get away from the pit bull and barricade herself in a bedroom where she screamed for help and handed over her 4-year-old child through a window to medical personnel,' Duplantis said in a statement. According to police, the attack happened inside the family home. 'She was screaming for help,' Duplantis said of the desperate mother's 911 call. Mia suffered facial and head injuries in the pit bull attack and was rushed to Terrebonne General Medical Center but didn't make it. Touchet suffered moderate injuries and was hospitalized as well. She remains in hospital today. Duplantis did not know whether the girl was on a sofa or chair or on the floor when she was attacked. Vicious attack: Mia, pictured with her dad Chris, was pounced on by the dog, one of two at her mom's home in the Houma Highland Apartments. The animal, named Niko, was shot dead by police before they were able to enter the apartment. Duplantis described it as 'a monster,' in a Wednesday afternoon press conference. They reported that it was 'running loose inside the apartment acting in a very vicious manner' and officers shot it three times to 'eliminate the threat of additional injuries.' 'It's a traumatic event,' said Terrebonne Parish President Michel Claudet told WWLTV.com Wednesday. Mia would have celebrated her fifth birthday next week. Her father, Chris Derouen, took to Facebook to beg for a miracle as his daughter fought for life in hospital.

'My daughter was attacked by a pitbull and they don't know if she will make it....please God...I need this miracle.' After she passed away he covered his wall with pictures of the two of them, and friends and family expressed their sympathies. Claudet said the family had another pit bull. 'They had two pit bulls, and one was over 100 pounds,' he said, adding that this larger dog was the one that attacked Mia. 'Unfortunately, that's what happened and it's such a horrific event,' he said. The second pit bull was taken away by animal control officers, police said. Duplantis described the scene as 'horrific' and said counseling was being offered to the officers who were on the scene. It's not clear if charges will be filed in the case, which is still being investigated. The families have set up a gofundme page to raise money for the child's funeral expenses.

Group D had some people experiencing mild allergy symptoms, and group C had a few folks with severe allergy symptoms, so they had to call the ambulance asap.  Which group had more people that could be treated with antihistamines?  Hint: Allergy symptoms can range from mild to severe. Mild symptoms might include itchy eyes, sneezing, and a runny nose. Severe symptoms can cause difficulty breathing, which may be life threatening. Keep in mind that it is the immune system and not the allergen that causes the allergy symptoms.

Both groups likely experienced allergic reactions, and antihistamines are typically used to treat mild to moderate symptoms, such as itchy eyes, sneezing, and a runny nose. Group D had people with mild allergy symptoms, which are more suitable for treatment with antihistamines.  In contrast, group C had a few individuals with severe allergy symptoms, which required immediate attention and might necessitate more potent interventions such as epinephrine injections. While antihistamines could be used to alleviate some of the less severe symptoms in group C, the presence of severe reactions in this group would likely necessitate more urgent treatments beyond antihistamines.

The phrase \\"stood in his own way\\" might be more accurately phrased as \\"adopted his own stance\\" in this context. The premise describes a character who has developed a unique and personal battle stance, deviating from the traditional and strict techniques typically taught by duelmasters in the north. By creating his own stance, the character has effectively tailored his fighting style to be adaptable and versatile, enabling him to deal with a wide range of potential threats and attacks. This adaptive approach reflects the character's readiness to face any challenges that come his way, regardless of the type or origin of the threat. By distancing himself from the rigid and often predictable nature of the traditional stance, the character demonstrates an understanding that combat scenarios may vary and that a more agile and flexible approach may be better suited to his individual strengths, preferences, and needs. Therefore, while the phrasing of the hypothesis may benefit from some modification to better align with the premise, the overall idea that the character is prepared to face any type of attack stands true.

Show them that they have your full attention, by looking them in the eye, and listening. Try your best to look alert. If you feel your eyes averting to something else in the room, catch yourself and focus back on your teacher. Your teacher should have your full attention at all times during class. Your eyes should not be drifting elsewhere. Most teachers tell you the subject of the class and the objective they are aiming for you to learn. If possible, write down this objective the minute you hear it. What is it that needs to be done today? What will you be learning about? How can you remain alert and focused during this time? Set goals for yourself, and remind yourself of the objective throughout class. This way, you know exactly what you have to do. . By taking accurate notes, you'll be able to \\"get into\\" the lesson. Recognize key points as your teacher speaks, and listen for key phrases such as \\"This is important,\\" \\"This is the main idea,\\" and \\"This will be on the test,\\", for example. This can alert you to listen more intently; you'll have something to do and focus on.  Objectives: If your teacher normally writes down the lesson's objective at the beginning of the class, keep it in your head and make sure you've achieved it by the end of the lesson. Don't try to finish up old notes or homework in class. Do that later, when you have free time or else you might miss key points. This is a wonderful way to become a more focused, successful student. When a teacher asks a question, offer to answer it. If she/he asks for an opinion, share your own. This shows that the teacher that you're listening intently during the class and that you know your stuff. This can also help you avoid those embarrassing moments, when you get called on and you happen to not be paying attention. Also, teachers will note to college officers that you are actively contributing in class. If you don't understand something, never be afraid to ask. This really shows your teacher that you want to learn and can recognize the things you're having difficulty with. Chances are, someone else in the class has the same question and may have been afraid to ask. When you walk into that classroom, put a smile on your face and some confidence in your pocket.

It quickly attracted famous names such as Alec Guinness,Richard Burton,Dame Margot Fonteyn and Marlene Dietrich as well as the big symphony orchestras .It became a fixed event every August and now attracts 400,000 people yearly. At the same time,the \\"Fringe\\" appeared as a challenge to the official festival.Eight theatre groups turned up uninvited in 1947,in the belief that everyone should have the right to perform,and they did so in a public house disused for years. Soon,groups of students firstly from Edinburgh University,and later from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge,Durham and Birmingham were making the journey to the Scottish capital each summer to perform theatre by littleknown writers of plays in small church halls to the people of Edinburgh.

In the beginning of the film Shale comes home from a disastrous mission where three of his men were killed in an operation in Cuba. He arrives in Miami to find out that a knee-cap attack has left his girlfriend Jane Hetzko with a broken leg.

Avoid answers that are incorrect or provides incomplete justification for the question. Input: Passage: The gender of God may be viewed as either a literal or an allegorical aspect of a deity who, in classical western philosophy, transcends bodily form. Polytheistic religions commonly attribute to each of the gods a gender, allowing each to interact with any of the others, and perhaps with humans, sexually. In most monotheistic religions, God has no counterpart with which to relate sexually. Thus, in classical western philosophy the gender of this one-and-only deity is most likely to be an analogical statement of how humans and God address, and relate to, each other. Namely, God is seen as begetter of the world and revelation which corresponds to the active (as opposed to the receptive) role in sexual intercourse. Question: What do polytheistic religions assign to their gods?

She is in denial, and confident she can somehow build herself up again and re-launch her career to its earlier brilliance. After suffering another big disappointment while vainly striving to get that last one good role, she gets drunk, is arrested for DUI, and spends a night in jail. She is bailed out by Jim Johannsen, a younger former actor whom she had helped in the past. Jim, now comfortably settled as the owner of a boatyard, admits that he has loved her ever since those days and, helped by Margaret's daughter Gretchen, tries to help Margaret see that her big screen days as a famous actress are already over.

Title: A disappointment Product review: I thought all dvd/vcr combos were probably pretty much the same. I had a Sharp which I liked but needed to get another for my the teens' tv room. The Zenith was on sale. I don't use it much but here's what I don't like about it so far: programming is a pain. You can't use the number pad, and unlike even my 5-year-old VCR, you have to use up and down keys for the hour&minutes combined (that is, you push the up arrow and it goes from 12:00 to 12:01, up and it goes 12:01 to 12:02, etc. you can't separate the hour from the minutes for faster programming). On my Sharp, I can use either the number pad (with hour & minute separated) or the up & down arrows. In addition, it seems to have little versatility on rewind or FF. The same DVD which I can rewind in tiny segments on my Sharp can only be rewound (or fast forward) in big chunks on the Zenith. I have a feeling that Zenith is using the oldest available technology.

On November 14, 1940, a German bombing raid severely damaged Coventry, including the original cathedral. Only the tower, spire, and a few outer walls remained standing after the attack. Instead of rebuilding the old cathedral, the decision was made to keep the ruins intact as a memorial to the sufferings of war and construct a new cathedral next to it. A competition was organized to select a design for the new cathedral, and the winning architect was Sir Basil Spence. Spence's modern design for the new cathedral incorporated the ruins of the old one, creating a symbolic union between the old and new. Spence also envisioned that the two buildings would work in harmony to communicate the themes of destruction, reconciliation, and hope. The construction of the new St. Michael's Cathedral started in 1956, and it was consecrated on May 25, 1962. One of the main features of the new cathedral is its huge stained-glass windows, created by English artist John Piper, that run almost the full length and height of the nave. The windows, referred to as the \\"Baptistry Window,\\" display a stunning range of colors: blues, greens, reds, and yellows, representing the creation of the world. Another remarkable artwork in the cathedral is \\"The Tapestry of Christ,\\" designed by Graham Sutherland and situated in the altar area. This tapestry stands 75 ft high and 38 ft wide, depicting Christ in glory, surrounded by angels. The new cathedral is also home to several chapels, including the Chapel of Unity, where worshippers from different Christian denominations gather to promote peace and unity within the religious community. The cathedral plays a significant role in supporting numerous global reconciliation projects, and it frequently welcomes international peacebuilding groups and visitors. In conclusion, the Cathedral Church of St. Michael, or Coventry Cathedral, is located in Coventry, England. The old cathedral, a Gothic church from the 14th century, was almost completely destroyed during World War II, leading to the construction of the new cathedral built alongside the ruins in a showcase of modern architectural design. The new cathedral was consecrated in 1962, and it is now a symbol of hope, peace, and reconciliation that reflects Coventry's resilience and commitment to healing and unity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  Paul Helfeld (also given as Hefeld), aged 21 in 1909, and Jacob Lepidus (also reported as Lapidus), who was 25 the same year, were Jewish-Latvian immigrants. They had been members of the Latvian Socialist Party and, although they had not held positions of responsibility, they had smuggled revolutionary literature into Russia for the party. The pair had been living in Paris in 1907, along with Lepidus's brother Paul, a revolutionary bomber who went under the nom de guerre \\"Strygia\\"; Jacob was described in The Times as a \\"member of a notorious Russian revolutionary family\\". On 1 May 1907 Paul Lepidus was killed when a bomb he was carrying to assassinate Armand Fallières, the President of France, exploded prematurely. Lepidus and Helfeld fled the country and lived in Scotland for a year, before moving to Tottenham.Both men joined a small group of Latvian agitators living in north London; according to other members of the group, the pair had criminal records and had joined as a cover for the robberies they carried out. Lepidus was employed, briefly, at a furniture factory, while Helfeld took a job at the Schnurmann rubber factory in Tottenham. Helfeld refused to give his name when he joined the company, so he was listed on the time sheets as \\"Elephant\\" in reference to his bulk.

He participated in the 1905 Russian Revolution and afterwards helped to build resistance groups in the Baltic states and Saint Petersburg, then the capital of Imperial Russia.

They were former criminals and, after getting out of prison, have come to the U.S. to claim their part of a bank heist in Russia (or somewhere in Czech Republic). Within minutes of arriving, Oleg steals a video camera from a Make-Your-Own-Movie establishment. They go to the run-down apartment of their old partner and demand their share. He doesn't have it so Emil stabs him and his wife to death as Oleg tapes it with the camera. The couple's friend, Czech immigrant Daphne Handlova (Vera Farmiga), witnesses the murders from the bathroom; but she escapes before they can kill her, too. To hide the crime, Emil burns down the apartment. Jordy Warsaw (Edward Burns) is an arson investigator and is called to the case. Eddie Flemming (Robert De Niro) is a much celebrated detective who is also called to the scene. Flemming is such a high-profile celebrity detective that he is even followed around by the local tabloid TV show Top Story. Everywhere he goes, the townspeople cheer him on. Flemming and Warsaw decide to help each other out and work the case together. While checking out the crowd outside, Warsaw spots Daphne trying to get his attention.

Songkran Answer:","output":"Title: \\"The Songkran Miracle\\" Plot: Our story begins with Ananda, an ambitious young Thai man working in the sleek skyscrapers of Manhattan as an investment banker. Despite his professional success, he holds a deep sense of emptiness and detachment from his cultural roots. Ananda hasn't been back to his homeland, Thailand, for a decade. Every year, during the Songkran festival, Thailand's grand New Year, he feels a poignant nostalgia for his culture, family, and traditions. On the other hand, there's Amara, Ananda's younger sister, who is all set to run their family restaurant in their quaint village by the Chao Praya river. She diligently prepares traditional Thai dishes her mother taught her, aiming to bring their small eatery on a global map during the Songkran festivities.  One day, their grandmother, to whom Ananda is very close, falls seriously ill. Upon receiving this news, Ananda decides to return to Thailand. However, he's worried about leaving his high-stakes job during a critical financial deal. The setting shifts to the vibrant atmosphere of Thailand gearing up for Songkran. Ananda is plunged back into the world that he once knew deeply yet seems foreign after years in New York. He's visibly left in a cultural shock, struggling to adjust to the slower pace and ingrained traditions, including preparing for the Songkran festival. Amara, determined as ever, asks for Ananda's help with the restaurant and their community's Songkran festivities. These include water fights on streets, cleaning Buddha images, making merit at the temples, and preparing a traditional feast. Amidst all this, Ananda forgets his grandmother's illness temporarily but is continuously nagged by his job responsibilities. One day, during a sandcastle-making event – a Songkran tradition symbolizing the Buddhist belief in impermanence – Ananda marvels at Thailand's rich essence and feels a connection. He realizes he's missed this immensely – this sense of community, of oneness. His growing involvement in festival preparations and the vibrancy around rekindle his love for his heritage. He decides to help Amara make their restaurant a success. In the background, their grandmother's health worsens, heightening tensions between the family. Yet, she insists on the continuation of Songkran festivities, reminding Ananda and Amara about the importance of New Year, new beginnings, and the cleansing of their souls. Simultaneously, Ananda receives an ultimatum from his boss in New York who wants immediate results on their project. Ananda, torn between his high-flying career and rediscovered love for his homeland and its traditions, makes a heart-wrenching decision. During the climactic Songkran water fight - symbolizing the washing off of misfortunes from the past year- Ananda announces his decision. He resigns from his job in New York to support Amara and her dreams. The family is elated, and this joy brings a miraculous improvement in their grandmother's health. The movie ends with a heart-touching scene of the family celebrating Songkran, sprinkling water on their grandmother's hands, a Songkran tradition to pay respect. Ananda stands in the background, his heart filled with peace and fulfillment, as the camera pulls out to capture the bursting celebration of Songkran across the brightly lit Thai village.  \\"The Songkran Miracle\\" serves as a moving tale about the power of roots, tradition, and family that can draw even the most lost souls back home."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We have a big equation here with lots of \\"w's\\", and we want to find out what \\"w\\" is equal to.

So it would be: 360 apples + 548 apples - 40 apples Now, if you have 360 + 548, that gives you 908 apples.

School principal comes under fire in Indian school lunch deaths The scattered belongings of children who consumed a free midday meal are seen in Dharma Sati village in the Saran district of Bihar state. (STR/AFP/Getty Images) Investigators are still trying to determine what precisely happened at the school in India’s Bihar state, where tainted school lunches killed 23 children and sickened many more. But, as is so often the case with such tragedies, the politics are getting a few steps ahead of the forensics. Public attention is increasingly turning to the school’s principal, a woman named Meena Kumari. A local police chief said they were looking for Kumari and her husband but couldn’t find either of them, according to CNN. Some Indian media have described the principal and her husband as “absconding.” It’s important to note that, as many Indians have pointed out, this is the worst school lunch health incident but it is far from the first; the program seems to have flaws that extend well beyond this one school. Some are arguing that the real root of the problem goes to Indian governance itself. And investigators are still determining what actually happened in Bihar. So the scrutiny on Kumari does not necessarily mean that she is to blame, but, rightly or wrong, she is coming under growing public fire. On Wednesday, Bihar state education minister P. K. Shahi said something unusual in a news conference on the school deaths. He seemed to suggest, without much evidence, that the poisoning was somehow political. Shahi is a member of the Janata Dal (United) political party, which is popular in Bihar; he says that Kumari’s husband belongs to a rival party. “A surprising fact has come before us and that is the school principal’s husband is a member of a political party, and has a grocery shop,” Shahi said in the news conference. “The principal, Meena Kumari used to buy food material for the school lunch from his shop. The cook told me that she felt a little doubtful because the color of the oil looked different when she began to cook. The children also complained to the cook that the taste of the vegetables was not right. The cook did not understand and ate it herself. The result is in front of everybody. The children and the cook fell sick immediately.” Shahi, hinting at a political conspiracy, also suggested that the incident might be part of a plot to destabilize the government – again, without much evidence. Two cooks at the school, both of whom ate the meals and became sick, told the Associated Press that Kumari was in charge of determining what food would be served. Shahi has claimed that the cooks warned that the oil had been unsafe and were overruled by Kumari, but the cooks deny this. Many Indians have been so angered by the deaths that they’ve taken to the streets in protest, as this video shows: What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"In a school in India, some children had bad school lunches that made them very sick and some even died. People are trying to find out what happened, and they are looking at the school principal, Meena Kumari, for answers. Some people think she might be involved in a political plot.

If a cell was to get very large, the small surface area would not allow enough nutrients to enter the cell quickly enough for the cell’s needs. This idea is explained in Figure below . However, large cells have a way of dealing with some size challenges. Big cells, such as some white blood cells, often grow more nuclei so that they can supply enough proteins and RNA for the cell’s requirements. Large, metabolically active cells often have lots of cell protrusions, resulting in many folds throughout the membrane. These folds increase the surface area available for transport of materials into or out of the cell. Such cell types are found lining your small intestine, where they absorb nutrients from your food through protrusions called microvilli .  Now, I have a new situation: Mike is studying for his biology exam. He found that all body cells are not equal in size - some are large and some are small. He labeled the large cells as class A cells. Then he labeled the small cells as class B cells. He is now prepared to find the differences between them.  Answer this question please: Which cell might not have microvilli as a feature, class A or class B? A:","output":"Based on the background information provided, it seems that large cells, or class A cells, are more likely to have microvilli as a feature. This is because large cells face the challenge of having a smaller surface area to volume ratio, and they need to be able to transport nutrients and materials into or out of the cell efficiently to meet their metabolic needs. To overcome this challenge, large cells often develop cell protrusions, such as microvilli, which increase the surface area available for material transport. On the other hand, small cells, or class B cells, do not face the same challenges as large cells regarding surface area to volume ratio. Their smaller size allows for adequate nutrient and material transport without the need for additional cell protrusions such as microvilli. Therefore, class B cells (small cells) are less likely to have microvilli as a feature compared to class A cells (large cells)."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be shown a prompt from a judicial decision and multiple holding statements derived from citations following text in a legal decision.

It is unclear if chief executive Derek Llambias and finance director Barry Leach will also go before Friday. The Rangers Supporters Trust (RST) says it is \\"delighted\\" at Somers' resignation, describing him as \\"inept and embarrassing\\". It has also announced that it has been given the proxy vote for the shares owned by former Rangers manager Walter Smith and now claims to have voting rights for 6.3% of the shareholding. The EGM was called by shareholder Dave King, who has tabled resolutions aimed at ousting the current board and appointing himself, Paul Murray and John Gilligan in their place. Somers, 66, had been chairman since October but has faced numerous calls to step down by fans who have been protesting for change. He said in a statement: \\"I have worked in the City of London, the world's greatest financial centre for decades and enjoyed considerable success. \\"When I was approached about the chairmanship of Rangers, friends warned me that the world of football has different rules and codes of behaviour. \\"I now know that is a gross understatement. \\"I am a non-confrontational man and have always tried to bring harmony to boardrooms and with stakeholders. \\"At the risk of antagonising my army of critics, I would point out that Rangers managed to pay its bills and avoid going under during my tenure. \\"These critics might not agree with how we achieved this. \\"I look forward to alternative solutions from whoever is running the club in the future. \\"Despite the personal attacks on me from various sources, I genuinely wish the club the very best in the future and I am confident that with such a passionate and vociferous fan base they will be restored to their former glories.\\" Director James Easdale last week resigned from the board, giving his reason as a lack of support from the club's fans. In a damning statement, the RST said Somers' comments were \\"entirely in keeping with his behaviour\\" during his tenure. It said: \\"His lack of ambition or ability, rampant self interest, contempt for shareholders and fans, and disastrous dearth of understanding of the position of responsibility he held will be his legacy. \\"He will be remembered as one of the most inept and embarrassing chairmen of our wonderful sporting institution.\\" And the fans' group has called for the remaining directors, Llambias and Leach, to \\"follow Mr Somers out of the door\\". \\"Mr Leach should have resigned when he made disparaging comments about major shareholders in a meeting with fans,\\" said the RST statement. \\"This amounted to gross misconduct in our opinion and in any normally operating business he would no longer be in position. He should be suspended and subject to disciplinary procedures after the general meeting. \\"Mr Llambias has serious questions to answer over the recruitment process which saw him appointed as chief executive. Not least whether the inaccurate information which appeared in his bio on the Rangers website, and was circulated to shareholders, formed part of the information relied on to support his application. \\"His ham-fisted attempt to use legal threats to silence legitimate criticism from the outgoing Fan Board has further alienated supporters. Taken together we believe these make his position untenable. He should also be suspended and subject to disciplinary procedures after the general meeting.\\" On the subject of Smith passing his voting right to the RST, a spokesman said: \\"Obviously we are delighted that Walter has agreed to proxy his shares to us. \\"We are sure he shares our hope that things are about to change for the better.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"This is about a man named Somers who was the chairman of a football club called Rangers. He decided to leave his job because many people were not happy with the way he was doing things. There is going to be a big meeting on Friday where they will talk about who will take his place and decide what happens next with the other people in charge. The Rangers Supporters Trust, a group of fans who care a lot about the football club, are happy that Somers has left and they hope that the club will do better in the future without him."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Select from the following. [i] no. [ii] yes.","output":"The requirement of fees in NIT and the concept of fees in NITs are related, but these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. Based on this, the answer would be [i] no. To answer both questions in detail: Why there is a requirement of fees in NIT: National Institutes of Technology (NITs) are premier autonomous public institutions in India primarily focused on providing undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral programs in various engineering and technology disciplines. These institutes require fees to be paid by the students for a variety of reasons: 1. Operational Expenses: The fees collected by NITs are used to cover the daily operational expenses of the institution. This includes salaries for faculty and staff, maintenance of buildings and infrastructure, utility bills, and other essential services that enable the smooth functioning of the institute. 2. Infrastructure Development: A significant portion of the fees collected is invested in the growth and development of the NIT's infrastructure, such as building new classrooms, labs, hostels, and other facilities. The expansion of infrastructure helps accommodate a larger number of students, allowing the institute to offer quality education to a broader demographic. 3. Quality of Education: The fees collected are used to ensure the quality of education provided in NITs. This includes funding for faculty development programs, research projects, state-of-the-art equipment and resources, and ensuring students have access to up-to-date course materials and learning tools. 4. Scholarships and Financial Aid: A part of the fees collected is also allocated for scholarships and financial aid for economically disadvantaged students. This ensures that quality education remains accessible to students from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. 5. Extracurricular Activities and Student Services: The fees collected help fund various extracurricular activities and student services such as sports facilities, cultural clubs, career counseling, and other student-oriented initiatives. These services ultimately contribute to the holistic development of students during their tenure at the NITs. What is fees in NITs: Fees in NITs typically refer to the amount of money that students are required to pay to attend and participate in the academic and extracurricular activities offered by the National Institutes of Technology. Fee structures in NITs often include components such as: 1. Tuition Fee: This is the primary fee that covers the cost of the educational services provided by the institute. Tuition fees in NITs vary depending on the specific program and course of study. 2. Hostel Fee: As many students at NITs live on campus, they are required to pay a hostel fee which covers the cost of accommodations, including room and board, as well as other facilities provided within the hostel premises. 3. Mess Fee: A mess fee is charged to cover the cost of food provided to students staying in the hostels. This fee typically includes breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals throughout the semester. 4. Caution Deposit: Many NITs require students to pay a caution deposit, a refundable amount that serves as a security against any damage or loss to institute property. 5. Additional Fees: There may be other additional fees associated with specific programs, courses, or student services. These fees may cover expenses such as lab fees, examination fees, library fees, and other miscellaneous charges. The exact fee structure and amount may vary across different NITs and may also be subject to revisions or updates from time to time. Students and their families can refer to the official website of the respective NIT to obtain detailed fee information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does the sentence \\"The Federal Council constitutes the federal government, directs the federal administration and serves as collective Head of State.\\" answer the question \\"What serves as the collective Head of State?\\"","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"The Federal Council constitutes the federal government, directs the federal administration and serves as collective Head of State.\\" provides a clear answer to the question \\"What serves as the collective Head of State?\\". In this context, the Federal Council serves as the collective Head of State. To provide more information, the Federal Council is a unique form of government body in countries that employ a federal system. This body typically consists of several members representing different regions or entities within the federal system. The Federal Council is responsible for major decision-making, policy-making, and administration at the federal level. In some countries, the Federal Council assumes the role of collective Head of State. This means that rather than having a single figure, such as a president or monarch, as the highest representative of the country, the Federal Council collectively fulfills these duties. The concept of a collective Head of State can be seen as a means to decentralize power and ensure that no single individual wields too much authority, considering that important decisions lay in the hands of a group of representatives from different regions or entities. With such a system, decisions tend to be more balanced, reflecting the diverse views and interests of the represented parties. Moreover, the Federal Council's other functions such as directing the federal administration and constituting the federal government implies that this body plays an essential role in the governance and management of the country. By overseeing the administration and crafting policies, it can influence various aspects of the nation, from economic development to social and environmental issues. Overall, the sentence in question effectively answers the given query by identifying the Federal Council as the collective Head of State. By doing so, it also conveys the idea that this body serves as a crucial component of the federal government, managing both governance and administrative responsibilities at the highest level."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nonetheless, there is no allusion to a novel or any written work from which the film would be an adaptation. Clearly, if the film were an adaptation of a novel, it is likely that such a significant point would be mentioned in a summary overview; the omission of any such detail would lead one to believe that 'Robots' is a standalone production not based or dependent on any previous published novel or material, bestselling or otherwise.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"To answer both questions, let's examine them separately first. Task 1: Identify the type of fuel generally used in rocket engines. Step 1: Research common fuels used in rocket engines There are several types of fuels used in rocket engines, including liquid hydrogen, kerosene, and solid fuels like ammonium perchlorate composite propellant. However, liquid fuels such as hydrogen and kerosene are more common in modern rocket engines. Liquid hydrogen is often used due to its high energy content and low molecular weight, while kerosene is popular for its high density and relatively low cost.  Task 2: Explain the use of oxidizer in rocket engines. Step 1: Define an oxidizer An oxidizer is a substance that provides oxygen to support combustion. Since there is no oxygen in space to support combustion, an oxidizer must be carried along with the fuel in a rocket engine. Step 2: Describe the role of oxidizers in rocket engines In a rocket engine, the oxidizer reacts with the fuel to produce high-temperature and high-pressure gases. These gases are then accelerated through a nozzle, generating thrust that propels the rocket. Common oxidizers include liquid oxygen, nitrogen tetroxide, and dinitrogen tetroxide. Task 3: Determine if the questions are the same The first question asks about the type of fuel generally used in rocket engines. The second question asks about the use of oxidizers in rocket engines. While both questions are related to rocket engines, they ask about different components and their functions. Therefore, the questions are not the same.

But the size of the added risk has not been clear.      Now, a new study offers a way to estimate the risk. It finds that for most women the risk is modest, and that it is outweighed by the benefit from the treatment, which can halve the recurrence rate and lower the death rate from breast cancer by about one-sixth.      According to the study, a 50-year-old woman with no cardiovascular risk factors has a 1.9 percent chance of dying of heart disease before she turns 80. Radiation treatment for breast cancer would increase that risk to between 2.4 percent and 3.4 percent, depending on how much radiation hits the heart.      “It would be a real tragedy if this put women off having radiotherapy for breast cancer,” said Sarah Darby, a professor of medical statistics at the University of Oxford in Britain, and the lead author of the study, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine.      Dr. Silvia Formenti, the chairwoman of radiation oncology at New York University Langone Medical Center, said she worried that women with cancer would misconstrue the findings to mean that radiation is dangerous and that they should have their breasts removed instead of having lumpectomies, in order to avoid radiation.      “There is a wave toward mastectomy in this country,” Dr. Formenti said.      But at the same time, she and other experts say that the cardiovascular risk is real and that when radiation is given, every effort should be made to minimize exposure of the heart.      In addition, women who have had radiation treatment need to be especially vigilant about controlling other factors that increase the odds of heart disease, like high blood pressure and cholesterol.      Dr. Lori Mosca, the director of preventive cardiology at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, who was not involved in the study, said the findings meant that a history of breast irradiation should be added to the list of risk factors for heart disease and taken into consideration by all doctors who are treating such patients.      “We absolutely need to put on our radar screen that prior radiation to the breast may be a new and important risk factor for women,” Dr. Mosca said.      But she and other experts also warned that the results needed to be verified because the study was not a controlled experiment, but was based on an analysis of records and estimates of radiation exposure to the heart.      Dr. Javid Moslehi, co-director of the cardio-oncology program at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and the author of an editorial accompanying the study, said the research was the first to provide risk estimates correlated with doses in breast cancer treatment, over a long time period.      “This is a huge paper, both in terms of how many women it impacts, and how it opens the door for new studies that need to be done,” Dr. Moslehi said.      He said the study reflected the fact that many people with cancer are now living long enough to encounter long-term effects of both radiation and chemotherapy.      They have given rise to a new and fast-growing field in medicine, cardio-oncology.      About three million women in the United States have been treated for breast cancer, and the majority have had radiation.      Although doctors try to spare the heart, it still gets some of the dose, especially when the left breast is treated. Radiation can damage the linings of blood vessels and scar the heart muscle.      Dr. Darby’s study is based on the records of 2,168 women who had radiation for breast cancer from 1958 to 2001 in Sweden and Denmark; 963 of the women had “major cardiac events” sometime after their cancer treatment, meaning a heart attack or clogged coronary arteries that needed treatment or caused death.      From the treatment records, the researchers estimated the radiation dose to the women’s hearts. They found that the risk began to increase within a few years after exposure, and that it continued for at least 20 years. The higher the dose, the higher the risk, and there was some increase in risk at even the lowest level of exposure.      “It was certainly a surprise to us that the risk started within the first few years after exposure, as radiation-related heart disease has traditionally been thought of as usually occurring several decades after exposure,” Dr. Darby said.      Radiation is measured in units called Grays, and the researchers found that for each Gray to which the heart was exposed, the odds of heart attack or another coronary events rose by 7.4 percent. The average dose to the heart over an entire course of radiation treatment was 5 Gray, they said. For an individual woman, the net effect would depend on her baseline initial risk of heart disease and the total radiation dose to her heart.      Women who already had risk factors, especially those who had had heart attacks in the past, would have seen the largest absolute risk from radiation.      Some radiation oncologists say that nowadays, the dose to the heart is lower than 5 Gray.      Dr. Louis S. Constine, vice chairman of radiation oncology at the University of Rochester Medical Center, said that 2 Gray was more common and that doctors could now put shields in front of the heart and “curve radiation around the chest wall instead of shooting it through the heart and lungs.”      Dr. Formenti thinks that for most patients, the best way to protect the heart is to treat them while they are lying on their stomachs, instead of the usual way, lying on their backs. Women lie on a table or a mattress with openings that let the breasts drop away from the chest.      Anatomy differs, but in most women this prone position helps keep the radiation beams as far as possible from the heart and lungs. The heart still receives some radiation, but significantly less than when women lie on their backs, especially when the left breast is being treated.      “If you can keep it below 1 Gray, which is what we are doing, you are probably O.K. with the majority of patients,” Dr. Formenti said.      During the past 15 years, she said, she has treated several thousand patients this way.      Dr. Formenti and her colleagues also teach the technique to other doctors. But, she said, it is taking a long time to catch on. ||||| Radiotherapy regimens for breast cancer have changed since the women in these trials were irradiated, and the doses of radiation to which the heart is exposed are now generally lower. 4 Nevertheless, in most women, the heart still receives doses of 1 to 5 Gy. 5-11 Several studies have suggested that exposures at this level can cause ischemic heart disease, 12-14 but the magnitude of the risk after any given dose to the heart is uncertain, as are the time to the development of any radiation-related disease and the influence of other cardiac risk factors. We therefore conducted a study relating the risk of ischemic heart disease after radiotherapy to each woman's radiation dose to the heart and to any cardiac risk factors she had at the time of radiotherapy.      Randomized trials have shown that radiotherapy for early-stage breast cancer can reduce the rates of recurrence and of death from breast cancer. 1,2 However, long-term follow-up in some trials has shown that radiotherapy can also increase the risk of ischemic heart disease, presumably through incidental irradiation of the heart. 1,3      Rate ratios were estimated with the use of conditional logistic regression after stratification according to country and to age at the time of cancer diagnosis, year of cancer diagnosis, and years from cancer diagnosis to first subsequent major coronary event (for case patients) or the index date (for controls) (all in 5-year categories). 22,23 To estimate the proportional increase in the rate of major coronary events per gray of radiation, the data were also stratified according to presence or absence of a cardiac risk factor. The rate of major coronary events was modeled as B s (1+KX), where B s was the stratum-specific rate of major coronary events in the absence of radiotherapy, X was the dose (or EQD2) of cardiac radiation (in Gy), and K was the percentage increase in the rate of major coronary events per gray. The form 1+KX was chosen for the dose–response relationship because a wide variety of functions are approximately linear for small values of X. The adequacy of 1+KX for summarizing the dose–response relationship was examined by carrying out analyses based on categories of radiation dose. In these analyses and in tests for interactions between radiation dose and other factors, models similar to the model described above were used. Significance tests were two-sided, and both significance tests and confidence intervals were based on the likelihood ratio. For analyses in which the explanatory variable was categorical, the confidence intervals for every category, including the reference category, were estimated from the amount of information in that category. 24 Calculations were performed with the use of Stata Statistical Software, release 12 (StataCorp), 25 and EpiWin, release 1.8 (Hirosoft International). 26      Individual radiotherapy charts, including a diagram or photograph of the treatment fields and a dose plan (where available) were copied. Virtual simulation and planning based on computed tomography (CT) (or, for a few regimens, manual planning) were used to reconstruct each radiotherapy regimen on the CT scan of a woman with typical anatomy. Virtual simulation and CT planning involved the reconstruction of radiotherapy fields on a CT scan. Radiation doses to the structures of interest were then estimated with the use of the treatment-planning system Helax–TMS, version 6.1B (Nucletron). In manual planning, the doses were estimated on the basis of charts on which isodose curves (i.e., lines delimiting areas receiving the same radiation dose) had been drawn. As previously described, 18,19 dose-volume histograms for the whole heart and for the left anterior descending coronary artery (which often receives the highest dose of radiation from radiotherapy for cancer of the left breast) were obtained for the regimens used, and the mean doses received by these two structures were calculated. Equivalent doses delivered in 2-Gy fractions (EQD2) 20 were calculated from the dose-volume histograms as nd[(d+α/β)÷(2+α/β)], where n was the number of fractions, d was the dose to the heart per fraction (in Gy), and α/β was 2 Gy. 21      In both countries, women without histopathological confirmation of breast cancer, with bilateral or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, or with a history of cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) or previous radiotherapy to the thoracic area were excluded. All other women who received radiotherapy were cross-matched with nationwide registers of diagnosis at the time of hospital discharge and cause of death (up to 2002 in Sweden and 2007 in Denmark). 17 Women whose primary diagnosis was a major coronary event that occurred after a diagnosis of breast cancer but before any recurrence or diagnosis of a second cancer were classified as case patients. Whenever possible, hospital cardiology or autopsy records were reviewed, and if the case-defining event was refuted, the woman was excluded from the study. For each remaining case patient, we defined “time period” as the time from breast-cancer diagnosis to the time of first major coronary event. Controls (one per case patient in Sweden and two per case patient in Denmark) were selected at random from all eligible women in the study population. Eligibility criteria for controls included fulfillment of the matching criteria (country of residence, age at the time of breast-cancer diagnosis, and year of diagnosis, with both age and year matched within 5 years); receipt of radiotherapy; and no recurrence of breast cancer, no diagnosis with another cancer, and no major coronary event before the index date (defined as the date of breast-cancer diagnosis plus the time period of the matched case).      A single study protocol was used, but the selection of case patients and controls varied slightly between the two countries. In Sweden, all women living in Stockholm for whom data were recorded in the Swedish National Cancer Register 15 were considered for the study if they received a diagnosis of breast cancer between 1958 and 2001, were younger than 70 years of age at the time of diagnosis, and had received radiotherapy. Because information on radiotherapy is not kept by the Swedish Register, hospital records were used to determine which women had received radiotherapy. In Denmark, all women for whom data were recorded in the register held by the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group 16 were considered for the study if they received the diagnosis of breast cancer between 1977 and 2000, were younger than 75 years at the time of diagnosis, and received radiotherapy. The study was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency and by the ethics review board of the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm. The requirement for informed consent was waived because of the nature of the study.      A population-based case–control study of major coronary events was conducted in women in Sweden and Denmark who received external-beam radiotherapy for invasive breast cancer. Major coronary events were defined as a diagnosis of myocardial infarction (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision [ICD-10] codes I21–I24), coronary revascularization, or death from ischemic heart disease (ICD-10 codes I20–I25). Patients with a diagnosis of angina alone were not included, because pilot studies showed that we could not reliably identify angina. Patient records from hospital oncology departments were used to obtain data on each woman's medical history before her diagnosis of breast cancer, tumor characteristics, and radiotherapy.      The overall average of the mean EQD2 doses to the heart was 3.9 Gy (range, 0.1 to 30.4). The mean doses and the EQD2 doses to the heart were highly correlated (correlation coefficient, 0.98). The results of analyses based on dose and EQD2 dose were therefore similar (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix ). Estimated mean doses to the left anterior descending coronary artery and to the heart were also correlated (correlation coefficient, 0.76) (Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix ). The mean dose of radiation to the heart was a better predictor of the rate of major coronary events than the mean dose to the left anterior descending coronary artery (P<0.001 for mean dose to the heart; P=0.001 for mean dose to the left anterior descending coronary artery). The mean dose of radiation to the heart remained significantly associated with the rate of major coronary events after the mean dose to the left anterior descending coronary artery was taken into account (P=0.04). However, the converse did not apply: the mean dose to the left anterior descending coronary artery was not significantly associated with the rate of major coronary events after the mean dose to the heart was taken into account (P=0.62).      The percentage increases in the rate of major coronary events per gray of radiation according to the number of years since radiation exposure were as follows: 0 to 4 years, 16.3% (95% CI, 3.0 to 64.3); 5 to 9 years, 15.5% (95% CI, 2.5 to 63.3); 10 to 19 years, 1.2% (95% CI, −2.2 to 8.5); and 20 or more years, 8.2% (95% CI, 0.4 to 26.6) ( Table 3 Table 3 Percentage Increase in the Rate of Major Coronary Events per Gray, According to Time since Radiotherapy.). The variation among these values was consistent with random variation (P=0.16 for heterogeneity; P=0.26 for trend). Findings were similar when the analysis was repeated separately according to age at the time of the breast-cancer diagnosis, the presence or absence of preexisting cardiac risk factors, whether the case patient had died from ischemic heart disease, and whether the case patient's hospital cardiology record or autopsy record had been reviewed (Tables S5 through S8 in the Supplementary Appendix ).      The overall average of the estimated mean doses of radiation to the heart was 6.6 Gy for women with tumors in the left breast, 2.9 Gy for those with tumors in the right breast, and 4.9 Gy overall (range, 0.03 to 27.72). The rate of major coronary events increased by 7.4% for each increase of 1 Gy in the mean radiation dose delivered to the heart (95% CI, 2.9 to 14.5; P<0.001) ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Rate of Major Coronary Events According to Mean Radiation Dose to the Heart, as Compared with the Estimated Rate with No Radiation Exposure to the Heart.). When women were grouped according to whether the mean radiation dose to the heart was less than 2 Gy, 2 to 4 Gy, 5 to 9 Gy, or 10 or more Gy, the percentage increases in the rate of major coronary events in these four categories, as compared with the estimated rate if the cardiac dose had been zero, were 10% (95% CI, −9 to 33), 30% (95% CI, 14 to 49), 40% (95% CI, 15 to 72), and 116% (95% CI, 59 to 195), respectively. The percentage increase per gray did not differ significantly according to any of the matching factors used in the selection of controls, tumor characteristics (including whether the tumor was in the left or right breast), or cancer treatments in addition to radiotherapy. Despite the fact that the rate of major coronary events was higher among women with cardiac risk factors than among those without such risk factors, the percentage increase in the rate of major coronary events per gray was similar for women with and those without a cardiac risk factor at the time of breast-cancer diagnosis ( Table 2 Table 2 Radiation Dose to the Heart and Percentage Increase in the Rate of Major Coronary Events per Gray, According to Risk Factors and Other Characteristics.).      Women irradiated for cancer of the left breast had higher rates of major coronary events than women irradiated for cancer of the right breast (P=0.002), but there were no other strong associations between the rate of major coronary events and tumor characteristics or the cancer treatments administered in addition to radiotherapy (rate ratio, 1.20; P=0.06 for nodal status and P≥0.10 for all other tumor or treatment characteristics) ( Table 1 Table 1 Characteristics of the Women in the Study at the Time of Breast-Cancer Diagnosis and Association between the Characteristics and the Subsequent Rate of Major Coronary Events.). In contrast, the overall rate ratio for a major coronary event among women with a history of ischemic heart disease as compared with women with no such history was 6.67 (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.37 to 10.18). The rate ratio was 13.43 (95% CI, 7.65 to 23.58) during the first 10 years after the cancer diagnosis as compared with 2.09 (95% CI, 1.05 to 4.13) during later years (P<0.001) (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix ). Rates of major coronary events were also elevated among women with a history of other circulatory diseases, diabetes, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; among women who smoked; and among women with a high body-mass index or a history of regular analgesic use. The rate ratio for the presence of one or more of these factors but no ischemic heart disease was 1.96 overall (95% CI, 1.60 to 2.40); during the first 10 years after the cancer diagnosis, the rate ratio was 2.60 (95% CI, 1.89 to 3.57) as compared with 1.63 (95% CI, 1.24 to 2.15) during later years (P=0.03).      A total of 963 women with major coronary events and 1205 controls were included in the study. Among the case-defining major coronary events (i.e., the event resulting in inclusion in the study), 44% occurred less than 10 years after breast cancer was diagnosed, 33% occurred 10 to 19 years afterward, and 23% occurred 20 or more years afterward. Hospital cardiology or autopsy records confirmed the case-defining major coronary event in 65% of case patients and were consistent with the event in 9% of case patients; for the remaining 26% of case patients, no relevant record could be found. A total of 54% of case patients were known to have died from ischemic heart disease, either at the time of their case-defining event or subsequently. (For further information, see Tables S1, S2, and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.)      Discussion      Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, with more than 1 million new diagnoses each year.27 Moreover, every year, tens of thousands of women worldwide receive a diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ. The overall 5-year survival rate for these two diagnostic groups combined is approximately 90%, and in both groups many of the survivors will have received radiotherapy.28 Current mean doses of radiation to the heart from radiotherapy for breast cancer are typically about 1 or 2 Gy for disease of the right breast. For disease of the left breast, the doses are usually higher but vary widely, and for some women, including those in whom the distance of the heart to the thoracic wall is small and those who require internal mammary irradiation, the mean dose may be around 10 Gy.5-11      Among the 2168 women in this study, the mean dose to the heart ranged from 0.03 Gy to 27.72 Gy, with an overall average of the mean doses of 4.9 Gy. The risk of a major coronary event increased linearly with the mean dose to the heart. The magnitude of the risk was 7.4% per gray, with no apparent threshold below which there was no risk. The risk started to increase within the first 5 years after exposure and continued for at least 20 years. The percentage increase in risk per gray was similar for women with and those without cardiac risk factors at the time of radiotherapy.      A strength of this study is that it relates the risk of ischemic heart disease among women who have received radiotherapy for breast cancer to individual doses of cardiac radiation and individual cardiac risk factors at the time of their cancer diagnosis. Other strengths of the study are that it was carried out in women with cancer that had not recurred (thus avoiding confusion with the influence of further treatment); that it was population-based, including all women recorded as receiving radiotherapy for breast cancer in Denmark or Stockholm during the period of interest (thus avoiding the tendency in randomized trials to omit patients in poor health); and that the majority of cardiac events were confirmed by a review of cardiology or autopsy records. Because health status may play a role in the selection of women for radiotherapy, we included in the study only women who had received radiotherapy; nonrandomized comparisons of women who underwent irradiation with those who did not could produce misleading estimates of risk.29      A limitation of our study was that individual CT-based information on radiotherapy was unavailable for the women studied, because they were treated before the era of three-dimensional CT-based planning. However, we have used 20 consecutive individual CT-based, three-dimensional planning scans to show that for left and right tangential radiotherapy and for left and right direct internal mammary fields, the patient-to-patient variation in mean radiation dose to the heart is small (coefficients of variation, 30%, 11%, 11%, and 21%, respectively).4 We have also confirmed that the patient with typical anatomy who was used to calculate the dose estimates in this study was average in terms of the radiation dose to her heart. Consideration of irradiated structures within the heart30,31 may prove fruitful in the future, but in the present study, inclusion of the estimated mean dose to the left anterior descending coronary artery did not improve prediction of the rate of major coronary events.      Since our study included few women who were younger than 40 years of age at the time of radiotherapy, caution is needed in applying our results to women in this age group, and the possibility of larger increases in the rate of major coronary events per gray of radiation for this group cannot be ruled out. Few women in this study were treated with anthracyclines, and none with taxanes or trastuzumab, all of which are known to affect the heart, even in the absence of radiotherapy.32      Studies comparing rates of cardiac disease among women who received radiotherapy for cancer of the left breast and women who received radiotherapy for cancer of the right breast have been reviewed elsewhere.33-35 Such studies are likely to underestimate the extent of any radiation-related risk because they rely on any difference in cardiac dose between women irradiated for tumors in the left breast and those irradiated for tumors in the right breast. In addition, these studies have generally not had information on whether a woman had prior heart disease, and thus could not account for any tendency to avoid irradiation in women with preexisting cardiac risk factors and cancer of the left breast or for the exclusion of women whose only diagnosis was angina (which may be unreliably recorded in routine records). In our study, the radiation-related increase in the risk of major coronary events began within the first 5 years after exposure. Early increases in risk have been reported in studies of patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma who received radiotherapy.36-38 The effect of preexisting cardiac risk factors on the risk of radiation-related ischemic heart disease has not been well studied, but one report on patients with breast cancer indicated that the absolute effect of radiotherapy was greater in smokers than in nonsmokers.39 Several studies have empirically investigated the relationship between cardiac radiation dose and risk of heart disease (Table S10 in the Supplementary Appendix). The estimates vary considerably, but this is to be expected, since both the populations studied and the end points reported were diverse.      The relevance of our findings to a woman receiving radiotherapy for breast cancer today is that they make it possible to estimate her absolute risk of radiation-related ischemic heart disease. This absolute risk can be weighed against the probable absolute reduction in her risk of recurrence or death from breast cancer that would be achieved with radiotherapy.2 The percentage increases in risk per unit increase in the mean dose of radiation to the heart are similar for women with and women without preexisting cardiac risk factors. Therefore, absolute radiation-related risks are greater for women with preexisting cardiac risk factors than for other women.      Data from a case–control study do not by themselves permit estimation of absolute risks. Therefore, we have illustrated our results on the risk of fatal ischemic heart disease by combining them with recent data on rates of death from ischemic heart disease for the 15 westernmost countries of the European Union combined (Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix). We have also illustrated the effect of radiotherapy for breast cancer on the risk of an acute coronary event (i.e., a major coronary event or unstable angina) by assuming that for women younger than 50 years of age, those 50 to 59 years of age, those 60 to 69 years of age, and those 70 to 79 years of age, the rates of acute coronary events are 6 times, 5 times, 3 times, and 2 times the rates of death from ischemic heart disease, respectively.40 The resulting baseline lifetime risk estimates are similar to recent estimates for the United States.41      For a 50-year-old woman with no preexisting cardiac risk factors, radiotherapy involving a mean dose to the heart of 3 Gy would increase her risk of death from ischemic heart disease before the age of 80 years from 1.9% to 2.4% (i.e., an absolute increase of about 0.5 percentage points), and it would increase her risk of having at least one acute coronary event from 4.5% to 5.4% (i.e., an absolute increase of about 0.9 percentage points) (Figure 2Figure 2 Cumulative Risks of Death from Ischemic Heart Disease and of at Least One Acute Coronary Event.). If her mean cardiac dose were 10 Gy, her absolute risk of death from ischemic heart disease would increase from 1.9% to 3.4% (1.5 percentage points), and her absolute risk of having at least one acute coronary event would increase from 4.5% to 7.7% (3.2 percentage points).      For women with one or more preexisting cardiac risk factors, both the baseline risks and the absolute increases in risk are higher. For example, radiotherapy involving a mean dose of radiation to the heart of 3 Gy in a 50-year-old woman with one or more cardiac risk factors would increase her risk of death from ischemic heart disease before the age of 80 years from 3.4% to 4.1% (an absolute increase of 0.7 percentage points), and it would increase her absolute risk of having an acute coronary event by the age of 80 years by 1.7 percentage points. A mean dose of 10 Gy to her heart would result in radiation-related risks that were considerably higher.      In conclusion, we found that incidental exposure of the heart to radiotherapy for breast cancer increased the rate of major coronary events by 7.4% per gray, with no apparent threshold. The percentage increase per unit increase in the mean dose of radiation to the heart was similar for women with and women without preexisting cardiac risk factors, which indicates that the absolute increases in risk for a given dose to the heart were larger for women with preexisting cardiac risk factors. Therefore, clinicians may wish to consider cardiac dose and cardiac risk factors as well as tumor control when making decisions about the use of radiotherapy for breast cancer. ||||| Radiation, a component of breast cancer therapy, can penetrate to the heart, a new study finds.      A linear accelerator is used to treat cancer at a hospital. Women treated with radiation for breast cancer are more likely to develop heart problems later, even with the lower doses used today, new research suggests. (Photo: John Rucosky, AP) Story Highlights Radiation can keep breast cancer from returning, but also damage the heart      Breast cancer survivors face a number of long-term complications due to treatment      Chemotherapy can cause heart failure and can put women into early menopause      Women treated with radiation for breast cancer face an increased risk of heart attacks and death, even 20 years after the end of treatment, a new study shows.      The study is the latest to document the serious long-term health problems faced by cancer survivors. Although improved treatments allow more people today to survive their disease, these toxic therapies also lead many to suffer chronic health problems.      Radiation, for example, is a key component of breast cancer therapy and significantly reduces the risk that tumors will return. But beams of radiation can penetrate beyond the breast to the heart and the arteries that feed it, according to a study published online Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.      In a study of 2,168 breast cancer patients who had radiation therapy between 1958 and 2001 in Sweden and Denmark, doctors found that any amount of radiation increased the risk of heart disease. Researchers defined heart disease to include heart attacks, surgeries such as a bypass or angioplasty, or a heart-related death.      \\"This is a major concern,\\" says Ben Smith, an assistant professor of radiation oncology at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who was not involved in the new study. In spite of improvements in technology, Smith says many women around the country \\"still have a significant portion of their heart in the path of the radiation beam.\\"      STORY: DNA from tumor could provide early warning      More than 232,000 American women will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year, according to the American Cancer Society. About 3 million American women today are survivors.      Women who received radiation to the left breast, which is slightly closer to the heart, were at especially high risk, the study says. Women with pre-existing heart disease also had a higher risk. Heart problems were generally most common in the first five to 10 years after treatment.      Over the course of 20 years, the risk of heart disease increased an average of 7.4% with each additional unit of radiation, called a gray. Women in the study received an average radiation dose of 4.9 gray to the heart, although some women received up to 27 gray.      Doctors have worked to reduce unnecessary radiation exposure over the years, experts note.      But American women being treated today may still receive radiation of about 2 to 5 gray to the heart, Smith says. New technology allows doctors at his hospital to reduce that exposure even further, to a fraction of 1 gray.      Yet the risks described in the new paper \\"may represent just the tip of the iceberg,\\" wrote Javid Moslehi, a cardiologist specializing in the care of cancer patients at Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.      That's because radiation can cause not just narrowing of the arteries and heart attacks, but abnormal heart rhythms, malfunctioning heart valves and other serious issues, which weren't measured in this study, Moslehi writes.      Certain chemotherapy drugs also can cause heart failure, he writes. In the new study, only eight patients got chemo.      Lastly, chemo often throws women into early menopause, which causes many breast cancer survivors to gain weight, says Jody Schoger, a breast cancer survivor and advocate from The Woodlands, Texas. That puts further stress on the heart.      Because cancer treatment can damage the heart and blood vessels in so many ways, leading a healthy lifestyle — with a good diet, lots of exercise and no smoking — is critically important, Smith says.      Cardiologists and family doctors also can help women manage their risks, says cardiologist Christopher Cannon, a professor at Harvard Medical School. Breast cancer survivors could be screened early, for example. Doctors have a wide variety of medications, from aspirin to statins, that also can reduce women's risks, he says.      Eric Winer, director of breast medical oncology at Dana-Farber, says patients should not avoid potentially lifesaving radiation therapy because of the risk of heart disease.      \\"Radiation is remarkably safe and well-tolerated,\\" Winer says. \\"It would be a mistake to conclude from this that we should use radiation less often.\\"      But doctors agree that scientists should continue to look for ways to reduce women's risks.      At M.D. Anderson, women can now receive radiation therapy that is synchronized with their breath, Smith says. Inhaling deeply pushes the heart down, and out of the radiation beam. New technology starts and stops the radiation beam automatically as women breathe in and out, nearly eliminating exposure to the heart, he says.      Radiation's risks to the heart loom especially large when women have very early cancers that may not prove life-threatening, Smith says. About 60,000 women a year are diagnosed with a condition called DCIS, or ductal carcinoma in situe. Experts disagree on whether these \\"Stage O\\" tumors represent very early cancers or pre-cancers.      About 30% to 40% of DCIS progresses into invasive cancer, although not all of those tumors are life-threatening, Winer says.      Because of that uncertainly, women with DCIS are typically treated as if they have an early cancer, with a lumpectomy, radiation and sometimes hormone therapy.      While radiation reduces the risk that women will be diagnosed with a new case of DCIS or cancer, there's no evidence to show it improves survival, Winer says.      \\"Any concerns about radiation become an even bigger issue for women who have very early stage breast cancers like DCIS, where women have to very carefully weight the pros and cons of treatments,\\" Winer says. \\"We need to figure out which women with DCIS need treatment to spare women from the side effects.\\"      Smith encourages breast cancer patients to talk to their doctors about taking steps to reduce their risks.      \\"Some practices do amazing work to essentially spare the heart,\\" says Smith, who serves as a consultant to review radiation plans from doctors around the country. \\"And there are others that pretend the heart isn't even there. This is a teachable moment for doctors.\\"      Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/XIKhoZ ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A new study has found that radiation treatment for breast cancer can increase a woman's risk of heart disease, although the size of the added risk has not been clear. However, the study also states that for most women the risk is modest and it is outweighed by the benefit from the treatment. It is important to note that the results of the study need to be verified as it was based on an analysis of records and estimates of radiation exposure to the heart, and not a controlled experiment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Soccer is a fun game where two teams try to kick a ball into a goal to score points. It's like a big game of tag, but with your feet! In soccer, there is a special player called the \\"goalkeeper\\" or \\"goalie\\". The goalie's job is to stop the other team's ball from going into their goal. Do you want to learn how to be a great goalkeeper? Let's get started with the basic rules of soccer and the rules of being a goalie! ⚽ Basic Rules of Soccer: 1. There are two teams, each with 11 players. 2. The team that scores the most goals wins. 3. You can use your feet, legs, chest, and head to touch the ball, but you cannot use your hands or arms. 4. Only the goalkeeper can touch the ball with his or her hands, but only inside the special area called the \\"penalty box\\" or \\"goal box\\". 5. If a player touches the ball with their hands or arms on purpose, it is called a \\"handball\\", and the other team gets a free kick or a penalty kick. 🥅 Rules of Being a Goalie: 1. The goalie must wear something to cover their hands (called goalkeeper gloves) to protect them when catching or punching the ball. 2. The goalie must stay inside their penalty box to use their hands. 3. If the goalie catches the ball, they can hold onto it for up to six seconds before they must throw or kick it back into play. 4. The goalie cannot touch the ball with their hands if a teammate has kicked the ball to them on purpose. This is called a \\"back-pass\\". 5. The goalie can use any part of their body (including their hands) to stop the ball from going into the goal. 🧤 Goalkeeper Equipment: 1. Goalkeeper gloves: To protect your hands and grip the ball better. 2. Goalkeeper jersey: A long sleeve shirt, usually with padding on the elbows. 3. Goalkeeper shorts: To match your team's uniform. 4. Shin guards: To protect your legs from getting hurt. 5. Soccer socks: Long socks to hold your shin guards in place. 6. Soccer cleats: Special soccer shoes to help you run and kick better on the grass. 🏟️ Where and How a Goalie May Play the Soccer Ball: 1. Inside the penalty box, goalies can use their hands. 2. Goalies can kick the ball from the ground or from their hands. This is called a \\"goal kick\\". 3. Goalies can also throw or roll the ball to their teammates. 4. Remember, goalies can't touch the ball with their hands if a teammate kicks it to them on purpose. 5. Outside the penalty box, goalies play just like other players and cannot use their hands. 🌍 Rules Specific to Your Country or Organization: Soccer is played all around the world, and sometimes there are small differences in the rules depending on where you play. Don't worry! Just ask your coach or a grown-up who knows about soccer, and they can help you learn the special rules for where you live. Now you know the basics of soccer, the rules of being a goalie, and all about goalkeeper equipment. You're ready to play soccer and become an awesome goalie! Remember to always have fun and practice, and one day, you could be a famous goalkeeper like Hope Solo or Manuel Neuer!

Solve this instance: Context: Viral-mediated oncolysis is a novel cancer therapeutic approach with the potential to be more effective and less toxic than current therapies due to the agents selective growth and amplification in tumor cells. To date, these agents have been highly safe in patients but have generally fallen short of their expected therapeutic value as monotherapies. Consequently, new approaches to generating highly potent oncolytic viruses are needed. To address this need, we developed a new method that we term \\"Directed Evolution\\" for creating highly potent oncolytic viruses.', 'Taking the \\"Directed Evolution\\" approach, viral diversity was increased by pooling an array of serotypes, then passaging the pools under conditions that invite recombination between serotypes. These highly diverse viral pools were then placed under stringent directed selection to generate and identify highly potent agents. ColoAd1, a complex Ad3/Ad11p chimeric virus, was the initial oncolytic virus derived by this novel methodology. ColoAd1, the first described non-Ad5-based oncolytic Ad, is 2-3 logs more potent and selective than the parent serotypes or the most clinically advanced oncolytic Ad, ONYX-015, in vitro. ColoAd1's efficacy was further tested in vivo in a colon cancer liver metastasis xenograft model following intravenous injection and its ex vivo selectivity was demonstrated on surgically-derived human colorectal tumor tissues. Lastly, we demonstrated the ability to arm ColoAd1 with an exogenous gene establishing the potential to impact the treatment of cancer on multiple levels from a single agent.Question: Does directed evolution generate a novel oncolytic virus for the treatment of colon cancer?

A clarifying statement from Giuliani issued four hours later did little to illuminate the matter. Instead, the series of pronouncements only lent further confusion to an issue that has deeply undercut the administration's credibility and has fueled the impression of a West Wing in crisis.      \\"He''ll get his facts straight,\\" Trump stipulated of his longtime friend on Friday morning, before adding: \\"There has been a lot of misinformation. I say, You know what? Learn before you speak. It's a lot easier.\\"      Calling Giuliani a \\"great guy,\\" Trump nonetheless insisted his attorney wasn't fully up to speed when he told an interviewer that Trump had reimbursed another lawyer for hush money paid to Daniels , an adult film actress who claims she had sex with Trump in 2006. Trump has denied the encounter.      \\"He really has his heart into it. He's working hard,\\" Trump said of Giuliani, before adding: \\"He's learning the subject matter.\\"      By midday, Giuliani had issued a statement he said was \\"intended to clarify the views I expressed over the past few days.\\" But it did little to spell out when precisely Trump knew of the payment, or how involved he was in reimbursing Cohen.      \\"My references to timing were not describing my understanding of the President's knowledge, but instead, my understanding of these matters,\\" Giuliani wrote.      He asserted the payment would have been made \\"whether he was a candidate or not.\\"      Seeking clarity      Trump sought to clarify the matter during a pair of morning appearances as he departed for Dallas, where he will address the National Rifle Association. He spoke first outside the South Portico, as his Marine One helicopter was idling nearby, and again under the wing of Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews.      It was his first time speaking about the matter after Giuliani sat for an interview this week and claimed Trump had paid back his lawyer Michael Cohen for the 130,000 hush payment to Daniels, an adult film actress whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford.      Trump seemed to initially back up Giuliani's statement on Twitter the morning after his interview. But he reversed course on Friday.      \\"Everything said has been said incorrectly,\\" he said. Giuliani, who announced he was joining Trump's legal team 15 days ago, \\"started yesterday,\\" the President insisted.      \\"When Rudy made the statements -- Rudy is great -- but Rudy had just started, and he wasn't totally familiar with everything,\\" he said.      Trump had previously said he wasn't aware of the payment. He told reporters aboard Air Force One a month ago \\"no\\" when questioned about his knowledge of the arrangement.

There was little indication beforehand that Giuliani had planned to reveal the payment details on Wednesday night, despite his insistence that he remains aligned with his client.      \\"You wont see daylight between me and the President,\\" Giuliani told CNN's Dana Bash on Thursday.      If there was a strategy cooked up between the President and his lawyer, most White House aides were left in the dark. Chief of staff John Kelly was among the aides who watched the Giuliani interview with shock on Wednesday.      Kelly's stature inside the White House has long been the subject of speculation. But Trump sought to bolster his standing on Friday.      \\"We have a great relationship. He's doing a great job as chief of staff. I could not be more happy,\\" Trump said. \\"So I just want to tell you that.\\" ||||| ...despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair. Prior to its violation by Ms. Clifford and her attorney, this was a private agreement. Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll in this transaction. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"President Trump has publicly contradicted his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, stating that Giuliani had only a \\"loose grasp\\" of the Stormy Daniels situation when he spoke about it earlier this week. Giuliani's later attempt to clarify his statement did little to resolve the issue, and Trump insisted that his attorney was not fully informed when discussing the payment. While Trump praised Giuliani as a \\"great guy,\\" he maintained that he was \\"learning the subject matter.\\" Giuliani's revelation about the payment to Daniels caught White House staff and the legal team off-guard and has fueled the sense of a White House in disarray."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A: go to a party  B: apologize  C: be alone","output":"Based on the context provided, it seems that Alex has pushed Quinn away and announced he wanted privacy. This indicates Alex is likely seeking some alone time, potentially to think, reflect, or address personal matters. Considering the three answer options provided: A: Go to a party - This answer doesn't seem to align with the context, as going to a party would be the opposite of wanting privacy. Choosing this option would put Alex in a social environment, which is not what he seems to be looking for right now. B: Apologize - Although apologizing might be a possibility in the future once Alex has had his time alone, at this moment, it does not seem like the immediate action he wants to take. Alex appears to need some space to process his feelings and thoughts before addressing any issues with Quinn or apologizing. C: Be alone - This answer aligns with the context provided the best, as Alex has explicitly stated that he wants privacy. Selecting this option would give him time to think and reflect in solitude, possibly helping him sort out his emotions and thoughts. After a period of being alone, he may then choose to apologize to Quinn if he feels it is necessary or find other ways to handle his feelings and the situation with Quinn. Based on the context of Alex pushing Quinn away and announcing his desire for privacy, answer C: Be alone would be the most appropriate choice for what Alex would want to do next."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Her eyebrows arched with concern, but David gently squeezed her hand, a reassuring smile curving upon his face. \\"Come, Lizzie. The lads are resourceful. They'll find us when they tire.\\" He whispered to her before turning his attention back onto the lively square. Around him, jovial merriment buzzed like the frenzied dance pattern of bees. The vibrant strings of lanterns, draped carelessly between rustic buildings, painted a joyful picture as they swayed with the rhythm of the soft evening wind. Laughter echoed, creating a symphony with the musicians whose melodies captivated every heart within hearing distance. Seeing her apprehension wane, he led Elisabeth towards the musicians, their tunes a harmonious amalgamation of the fiddle, the harp and the bagpipe. The rhythm was infectious, and soon enough even the most reluctant toes itched to join in the dance. David's heart warmed as he led Elisabeth gently into the dance. As a seasoned sailor, his footing was sure, and Elisabeth seemed to glide by his side. Her long, flaxen hair twirled and spun in the orbit defined by their dance, a moon revolving around an invisible planet. The darkness of her eyes sparkled with laughter and joy, a sight he had been longing for in the relentless hustle and bustle of their daily lives. As he steered them into the heart of the celebration, swinging Elisabeth around in time with the raucous tempo of the fiddle, he couldn't help but get lost in the tranquility of the moment. Allowing the exuberance of their simple lives to bubble up inside him until it reflected in his laughter, reflecting back at Elisabeth's equally radiant smile. Their thoughts centered around the rhythm, forgetting the troubles of the day, if only for a while. Time danced away as the couple lost themselves in the rhythm of the music; the concerns of the day fading into nothingness. The boys' naughtiness almost seemed endearing under the spell of the evening. The level of detail each tune possessed, the way Elisabeth twirled in David's arms, her hand fitting perfectly into his, it truly was a bit of the evening they had left to explore and cherish.  Under the canopy of twilight, amidst the crescendo of the evening's enchanting music, their laughter merged into harmonious symphony; a testament of the happiness found in simplicity, a rare moment of respite from their mundane routines. As the last notes of the melody floated into the nighttime air, a loud cheer went up from the villagers in unison, clapping their hands and stamping their feet in a jovial celebration of life. David, holding Elisabeth's waist gently, looked down into her sparkling eyes, a soft tug of happiness pricking the corners of his own. \\"See? We've a bit of evening left, Lisbeth.\\" He said, gesturing towards their boys, who were now running towards them, breathless and flushed, but with unmistakable happiness plastered on their faces. A chapter of their lives concluded with the winding down of the village music, one they'd fondly remember as the night they danced under the stars; surrounded by music, caught in laughter, and enveloped in love. And as the boys reached them, panting and throwing their exhausted selves into the adults' open arms, it was a stamp of agreement on David's words.

Possible answers: + no. + yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"When different fuels are used in engines not designed for them, various problems can arise, affecting the performance, efficiency, and longevity of the engine. Let's examine the consequences of using the incorrect fuel in each type of engine. Question 1: What happens when diesel is used in a petrol engine? When diesel is accidentally put into a petrol engine, the consequences can range from mild to severe, depending on the amount of diesel mixed and how far the vehicle has been driven. Diesel fuel is heavier and oilier than petrol, resulting in several issues: 1. Misfiring and Poor Combustion: Petrol engines and diesel engines use different methods to ignite the air-fuel mixture. Petrol engines utilize spark ignition, while diesel engines rely on compression ignition. When diesel fuel enters a petrol engine, the spark plugs cannot ignite the diesel properly, leading to misfires and poor combustion. 2. Damage to Components: Diesel fuel can cause the petrol engine's fuel injectors, spark plugs, and the exhaust system to become clogged or damaged due to the difference in fuel properties. Deposits can build upon engine components and hinder their performance. 3. Reduced Efficiency: Since diesel fuel cannot be burned effectively in a petrol engine, the engine will run inefficiently, resulting in reduced power, stalling, and increased fuel consumption. The best course of action when diesel is accidentally put into a petrol engine is to drain the fuel tank, flush the fuel system with the correct petrol, and replace any affected components. Damage to the engine will likely be minimal if the vehicle has not been driven, but if it has, repairs can be costly. Question 2: What happens if petrol is used in a diesel engine? Using petrol in a diesel engine can have more severe consequences than the reverse situation. Because of the differences in how diesel and petrol engines operate, these issues can occur: 1. Insufficient Lubrication: Diesel fuel acts as a lubricant in the engine's fuel system, whereas petrol fails to do so. When petrol enters a diesel engine, it can cause metal-to-metal contact within the fuel system components, leading to friction, wear, and potential damage. 2. Detonation: The ignition point of petrol is much lower than diesel. This creates pre-ignition or detonation in a diesel engine, which can cause engine knocking, overheating, and, in severe cases, damage to critical engine components such as pistons, connecting rods, and valves. 3. Complete Engine Failure: If substantial amounts of petrol are used in a diesel engine, it can result in complete engine failure due to a combination of aforementioned factors. In some cases, repairs might be possible, but a full engine change could be necessary. When petrol is accidentally added to a diesel engine, it's crucial to stop driving and turn off the engine immediately. Draining the fuel tank, flushing the fuel system with diesel, and inspecting the engine for any severe damage are essential steps to address the situation. In summary, the answer to whether the consequences of these two questions are the same is no. While both scenarios can lead to engine problems, using petrol in a diesel engine tends to cause more severe damage, whereas using diesel in a petrol engine can lead to milder issues if promptly addressed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: The Nutty Professor Movie plot: At Wellman College, thousands of hamsters overrun the campus, due to the massively obese, yet loving and kind-hearted, professor Sherman Klump, who accidentally releases them. Meanwhile, Sherman has created an experimental formula that reconstructs the DNA of an obese person in a way that allows them to lose weight more easily. After class, Sherman meets and instantly falls in love with Carla Purty, a chemistry graduate student who is a big fan of his work. After dinner with his obese, impolite family, Sherman asks Carla out on a date, which she accepts, much to Sherman's surprise. The date begins well with Carla showing admiration for Sherman's work, but the club's obnoxious comic Reggie Warrington publicly humiliates him about his weight. Sherman becomes depressed and has a nightmare in which he becomes a rampaging giant and wrecks the city with a single fart that is ignited to cause an explosion. He tests his serum on himself and loses 300 pounds in seconds. Overwhelmed by his thinness, he goes out and buys copious amounts of normal-sized clothing to celebrate, and a 47,000 Viper sports car on his faculty expense account. To conceal his true identity, Sherman adopts a fake name, \\"Buddy Love\\", and invites Carla out on a date at the same club again (while the serum begins to wear off). Reggie is present again and Buddy takes revenge and heckles him mercilessly. Sherman's \\"Buddy\\" persona starts to develop an independent personality due to the heightened testosterone levels of the transformation, causing him to be overly assertive and confident. Klump's assistant Jason witnesses Buddy fleeing the scene after he is identified as the person who left Klump's credit card on the bar. Jason follows Buddy and witnesses the transformation back into Klump.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 0 = 175*r - 188*r - 156 for r.","output":"Alright little buddy, let's solve this math problem together. We need to find the value of r when the equation is equal to 0. Here's the equation: 0 = 175*r - 188*r - 156. First, let's see what happens if we combine the part with r in it (175*r and 188*r). Since 188*r is being subtracted, we can think of it as -188*r. So: 175*r - 188*r Can be thought of like having 175 apples and then taking away 188 apples. If we do that, we will be left with: -13*r Now, let's put that back into the equation: 0 = -13*r - 156 Next, we need to get rid of the -156 by adding 156 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 156 = -13*r So now we have: 156 = -13*r Now, we want to know how many times -13 goes into 156, so we can find the value of r. To do that, we'll divide both sides by -13: 156 / -13 = (-13*r) / -13 That gives us: -12 = r So, the value of r is -12.

Please answer the following question: FINAL EXAM  Question 1. The textbook \\"Of Pandas and People\\" was published by an organization based in what city and state? Answer:","output":"The textbook \\"Of Pandas and People\\" was published by the Foundation for Thought and Ethics (FTE), an organization based in Richardson, Texas. This controversial textbook was first published in 1989 and served as an alternative to the standard biology textbooks that primarily focused on the theory of evolution. The book was written by Percival Davis and Dean H. Kenyon, with a forward by Charles B. Thaxton. As a creationist textbook, \\"Of Pandas and People\\" puts forth the idea of intelligent design, advocating that certain complex biological systems and living organisms are best explained by an intelligent agent rather than an undirected process such as natural selection. In the case of this book, the intelligent agent is understood to be a supernatural deity. The book's central argument is that irreducibly complex biological systems provide evidence for intelligent design. The authors contend that these systems, due to their complexity, cannot be explained by the gradual process of evolution; rather, they must have been designed by an intelligent being. \\"Of Pandas and People\\" has been the subject of significant controversy, particularly in the United States where it has been at the center of legal battles over teaching alternatives to evolution in public schools. The most notable case involving this textbook was Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District in 2005, where a federal court ruled that teaching intelligent design in science classrooms violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, as it promotes a particular religious viewpoint. In conclusion, \\"Of Pandas and People\\" is a creationist textbook published by the Foundation for Thought and Ethics, an organization based in the city of Richardson, Texas. The book presents the idea of intelligent design as an alternative to the theory of evolution, arguing that complex biological systems are best explained by the existence of an intelligent agent, such as a deity. The textbook and its ideas have faced significant opposition and controversy, largely due to concerns about the promotion of religious ideology in scientific education."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema,  (; born Lourens Alma Tadema Dutch pronunciation: ['l^ur@ns 'alma: 'ta:d@,ma:]; 8 January 1836 - 25 June 1912) was a Dutch painter of special British denizenship. Context: In 1852 he entered the Royal Academy of Antwerp in Belgium where he studied early Dutch and Flemish art, under Gustaf Wappers. During Alma-Tadema's four years as a registered student at the Academy, he won several respectable awards.  Before leaving school, towards the end of 1855, he became assistant to the painter and professor Louis (Lodewijk) Jan de Taeye, whose courses in history and historical costume he had greatly enjoyed at the Academy. Although de Taeye was not an outstanding painter, Alma-Tadema respected him and became his studio assistant, working with him for three years. De Taeye introduced him to books that influenced his desire to portray Merovingian subjects early in his career. He was encouraged to depict historical accuracy in his paintings, a trait for which the artist became known.  Alma-Tadema left Taeye's studio in November 1858 returning to Leeuwarden before settling in Antwerp, where he began working with the painter Baron Jan August Hendrik Leys, whose studio was one of the most highly regarded in Belgium. Under his guidance Alma-Tadema painted his first major work: The Education of the children of Clovis (1861). This painting created a sensation among critics and artists when it was exhibited that year at the Artistic Congress in Antwerp. It is said to have laid the foundation of his fame and reputation. Alma-Tadema related that although Leys thought the completed painting better than he had expected, he was critical of the treatment of marble, which he compared to cheese.  Alma-Tadema took this criticism very seriously, and it led him to improve his technique and to become the world's foremost painter of marble and variegated granite. Despite any reproaches from his master, The Education of the Children of Clovis was honorably received by critics and artists alike and was eventually purchased and subsequently given to King Leopold of Belgium. Question: Why did he move there? Answer:","output":"Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, also known as Lourens Alma Tadema, moved to different places to learn more and grow as an artist. He first went to the Royal Academy of Antwerp in Belgium to study art under Gustaf Wappers. After completing his studies, he became an assistant to the painter Louis Jan de Taeye, who influenced his love for historical subjects. Later, he moved to Antwerp to work with the famous painter Baron Jan August Hendrik Leys, where he painted his first major work, which helped build his fame and reputation. So, he moved there to learn from experienced artists and become a better painter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Context: The Trump administration's decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census divided Capitol Hill on Tuesday, with Democrats saying the addition could skew the results and alter millions in government funding, while some Republicans praised it as a \\"commonsense\\" move. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced late Monday the next effort to count every resident in the country will include a question about citizenship status. The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the survey every 10 years, with the next set for 2020. The deadline for finalizing the questions is Saturday. In a memo late Monday, Ross said he chose to include the query at the urging of the Department of Justice, which said it needed the citizenship data to better enforce a law protecting minority voting rights. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended the addition of the question, rejecting the notion that it might result in less federal aid to immigrant communities in the U.S. if immigrants are undercounted. Republicans on Capitol Hill welcomed the decision, which revives a practice that was abandoned in 1950, after being in place for more than 100 years, according to the Commerce Department. \\"It is imperative that the data gathered in the census is reliable, given the wide-ranging impacts it will have on U.S. policy. A question on citizenship is a reasonable, commonsense addition to the census,\\" Senator Ted Cruz said in a statement Tuesday. But Democrats said the question would have the opposite effect — discouraging undocumented immigrants and citizen family members from responding to the census, undermining the accuracy of the results. \\"We cannot accept an incomplete or unfair count in 2020 — too much is at stake,\\" Rep. Carolyn Maloney, co-chair of the Congressional Census Caucus, told VOA. \\"The census mandated by the [U.S.] Constitution affects the way that Federal and state funds are distributed and how district lines are drawn for both the city, state and Federal level.\\" Question: After the end of this story, Maloney is probably Answer: Answer:","output":"concerned about the potential negative impacts of the citizenship question on the accuracy and fairness of the 2020 census."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Select from: (i) yes; (ii) it is not possible to tell; (iii) no;","output":"(ii) it is not possible to tell Based on the given premise, it is not possible to conclusively determine whether cultural tourism indeed saw significant growth in recent years. While it is mentioned that a new breed of insta-museum has emerged that specializes in cultural tourism, this is not sufficient information to make a definitive statement on the overall growth in the field of cultural tourism. Cultural tourism encompasses various aspects such as visiting historical sites, partaking in traditional activities, learning about local customs, cuisine, and culture, and visiting museums and art galleries. Factors contributing to the growth of cultural tourism could include increased connectivity, greater global awareness, or a mix of economic and demographic shifts. Hence, to determine the growth of cultural tourism, we would need a more comprehensive assessment of these influencing factors. However, while the given premise does not provide a complete picture, it does highlight a valuable trend in the rise of insta-museums, which aims to showcase foreign masterpieces with a touch of glamour and allure. This trend could indeed be an indicator of cultural tourism’s growth as such insta-museums are built to cater to the demand for unique cultural experiences. Moreover, the emergence of insta-museums can be attributed to various reasons, including the ease of sharing art and cultural experiences through social media, the increasing emphasis on experiential learning and entertainment, and the desire to promote globalization and cultural exchange. These factors may very well contribute to the growth of cultural tourism, but they alone cannot confirm the hypothesis with certainty. In conclusion, based on the provided premise, it is not possible to tell whether cultural tourism saw significant growth in recent years. A more comprehensive evaluation of global trends, related factors, and relevant statistics would be required to accurately assess the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Turkey and Armenia have a long and complex history, which includes the Armenian Genocide that took place during the World War I.

Review: fifth beer-soaked film  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"The phrase \\"fifth beer-soaked film\\" appears to carry a negative connotation with regards to the movie review. Firstly, let's break down the sentence to understand the implications better. 1. \\"Fifth\\": The use of the term \\"fifth\\" suggests that this movie might be a part of a series or that the reviewer has seen multiple similar films before. This could potentially imply that the movie lacks originality or is just one among the many similar productions. It may also imply that the viewer has become fatigued by such films, leading to a negative perception. 2. \\"Beer-soaked\\": The phrase \\"beer-soaked\\" generally creates an image of something that is messy, dirty, or lacking refinement. In the context of a movie review, it could be interpreted that the film is crude, lowbrow, or has an abundance of vulgar content. \\"Beer-soaked\\" may also be an indication of the film targeting or appealing to a specific group of people with a certain taste, such as those who enjoy lighthearted, party-like, or heavy drinking-related themes. These traits are often seen as negative in the context of a film review, so this term also contributes to the overall negative tone of the sentence. 3. \\"Film\\": The simplest word in the sentence, \\"film\\" is neutral as it just refers to the movie being reviewed. Taking these aspects into consideration, it can be inferred that the movie review sentence contains a negative opinion. This stems from the suggestion that the film lacks originality or sophistication and has negative associations due to the \\"beer-soaked\\" adjective. Although people's preferences may vary, and some might appreciate this type of film, the overall tone of the sentence gives the impression that the reviewer does not consider it to be a positive or high-quality production."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Hammer-ons and pull-offs are two essential techniques to use if you're soloing on guitar. With a hammer-on, you basically tap the string with your finger on a higher fret to play another note without strumming. A pull-off is the reverse, when you remove a finger on a higher fret so that the string plays a lower note.  When done correctly, the 2 notes slur together, creating a smoother sound. And since you don't have to strum each note separately, you can play much faster. Combine the techniques and go back and forth between 2 notes for several beats to create a sort of trill in your solo. This works well at the end of phrases. It's commonly understood that lead guitarists play single notes rather than chords – but there's no rule that says you can never play a chord just because you're the lead guitarist. Use chords to add body to root notes in your solo or emphasize a particular phrase. For example, if you used whole notes to build the basic outline of the structure of your solo, you could play some or all of those notes as chords, then fill in with single notes in between. To bend a string, fret it with 2 fingers and pull it across the fingerboard. As the string gets tighter, the pitch will go up. Pull from your wrist to bend the string, using your fingers as levers. This puts less pressure on your fingers and wrist by distributing the effort.  Don't try to bend a string if it's not in tune. You could break the string. If you've never bent strings before, it's a technique that will take some practice to get right. Play the note you want to bend, then the note you want to bend the string to. That way you'll know when you've bent it far enough. Vibrato is a technique similar to string bending, except that you gently move the string up and down for a slight variation in pitch. Lock your fretting finger against the neck of your guitar to get a good pivot point, then wobble that finger up and down after strumming the note.  Vibrato is more difficult on the outside strings, since you don't want to pull the strings off the side of the neck. Experiment with your vibrato, doing it at different speeds and bending the string at different distances. A small, slow vibrato is typically more appropriate for ballads while bending the string further and faster works well with rock songs. Listen to guitarists you admire and watch their solo technique. If you see something you like, practice it and try to emulate it. The same goes for motifs or riffs that capture your attention. Simply copying others won't make you a great guitarist. Once you've learned how to emulate someone else's idea, play around with it and try to make it your own. All guitarists have influences, but the greatest have a signature style that builds on their influences rather than mimicking them.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Introduction Each somatic cell in the body generally contains the same DNA. A few exceptions include red blood cells, which contain no DNA in their mature state, and some immune system cells that rearrange their DNA while producing antibodies. In general, however, the genes that determine whether you have green eyes, brown hair, and how fast you metabolize food are the same in the cells in your eyes and your liver, even though these organs function quite differently. If each cell has the same DNA, how is it that cells or organs are different? Why do cells in the eye differ so dramatically from cells in the liver? Whereas each cell shares the same genome and DNA sequence, each cell does not turn on, or express, the same set of genes. Each cell type needs a different set of proteins to perform its function. Therefore, only a small subset of proteins is expressed in a cell. For the proteins to be expressed, the DNA must be transcribed into RNA and the RNA must be translated into protein. In a given cell type, not all genes encoded in the DNA are transcribed into RNA or translated into protein because specific cells in our body have specific functions. Specialized proteins that make up the eye (iris, lens, and cornea) are only expressed in the eye, whereas the specialized proteins in the heart (pacemaker cells, heart muscle, and valves) are only expressed in the heart. At any given time, only a subset of all of the genes encoded by our DNA are expressed and translated into proteins. The expression of specific genes is a highly regulated process with many levels and stages of control. This complexity ensures the proper expression in the proper cell at the proper time.   Q: Whereas each cell shares the same genome and dna sequence, each cell does not turn on, or express, the same set of what?

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate.

One after another, the young dancers impressed everyone present with their graceful moves, intricate choreography and exceptional stage presence. As the recital went on, whispers spread among the crowd about a late addition to the performance - a surprise dance number to be performed by the senior dance troupe. This last minute addition created a wave of excitement, but also caused the recital to stretch past its scheduled time. Despite the delay, the sense of anticipation remained high as the girls in the senior dance troupe waited in the wings with bated breath, dressed in their shimmering costumes and ethereal makeup. They had put together this surprise performance with the guidance of their dedicated and talented dance instructor, Ms. Leanne. This final, unanticipated performance was an ambitious fusion of ballet, contemporary, and jazz styles. At last, the surprise routine began with a haunting piano melody, filling the auditorium with an atmosphere of wonder and grace. The girls glided onto the stage, their movements fluid and mesmerizing. Each dancer exuded the passion for their art form, displaying the connection between their heart, body, and soul. The tempo of the music gradually increased, unfolding the true depth of the performance. Stomping their feet to the beat with determined precision, the dancers began incorporating acrobatics and lifts into their routine. The audience watched, transfixed, as the girls demonstrated the extent of their skills; a culmination of years of dedication, practice, and hard work. As the piece reached its climax, the piano melody transformed into an invigorating and dramatic chorus with a powerful crescendo. The girls moved in perfect unison, their bodies telling an emotional story of strength, resilience, and beauty. As the music began to fade, the girls slowed down, transitioning into a poignant finale. One by one, they struck their final poses before the piano delivered its last note. The audience, spellbound by the performance, remained silent for a moment before erupting into thunderous applause. Overwhelmed by the emotional journey they had been through, both the dancers and the audience were moved to tears. As the girls took their well-deserved bows, the parents in the audience couldn't help but swell with pride at what their children had accomplished. Although the recital had gone on longer than intended, it had created an unforgettable experience for everyone present.

A:","output":"A: The High Middle Ages institution that the Archbishop of Tyre, William of Tyre, attended for twenty years is the University of Bologna in Italy. William of Tyre was a prominent scholar, cleric, and diplomat who primarily served as the Archbishop of Tyre from 1175 to 1184. Born around 1130, he began his education at a young age, studying both religious and secular subjects. His pursuit of higher education eventually led him to the University of Bologna, one of the oldest universities in the world. Established in 1088, the University of Bologna is located in Bologna, Italy. It is renowned for its academics, particularly in the fields of law, theology, medicine, and the arts. During the High Middle Ages, it gained recognition as an influential institution, attracting scholars and students from various regions. It played a significant role in advancing knowledge, fostering intellectual exchange, and shaping European culture. During his twenty-year stay at the University of Bologna, William of Tyre studied various subjects, including theology, philosophy, and law. His education at this prestigious institution helped shape his breadth of knowledge and his aptitude for diplomacy, critical thinking, and communication. It was here he mastered Latin, which enabled him to record his magnum opus, 'Historia rerum in partibus transmarinis gestarum' (History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea), a vital historical document chronicling the events of the Crusades and providing significant insight into the political, religious, and cultural milieu of his time. Upon his return to the Holy Land, William of Tyre became a prominent figure in the Crusader States, serving as an advisor to kings and taking part in significant political and ecclesiastical events. His extensive education at the University of Bologna, accompanied by his keen observation and critical thinking skills, made him an essential contributor to historical records and intellectual life during the High Middle Ages."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Google argued Android was a \\"flexible\\" platform that had \\"expanded competition\\" rather than hurting it. The European Commission told the BBC it would carefully consider Google's response before making a decision. The Android operating system is open source, with a majority of the code available for device manufacturers to take, modify and use for free. Companies are free to take the code and develop it into their own operating system - shopping giant Amazon has done so with its Fire OS.

The search giant has not denied offering phone-makers incentives to exclusively pre-install Google apps, or that it offers Search, Chrome and the Play app store as a bundle. But it argued: \\"We do offer manufacturers a suite of apps so that when you buy a new phone, you can access a familiar set of basic services,\\" the company said in a blog. \\"Android's competitors - including Apple's iPhone and Microsoft's Windows phone - not only do the same, but they allow much less choice in the apps that come with their phones.\\" In April, Ms Vestager indicated that she believed Google had broken antitrust rules. \\"Based on our investigation thus far, we believe that Google's behaviour denies consumers a wider choice of mobile apps and services and stands in the way of innovation by other players,\\" she said.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Lieutenant general, lieutenant-general and similar (abbrev Lt Gen, LTG and similar) is a three-star military rank (NATO code OF-8) used in many countries. The rank traces its origins to the Middle Ages, where the title of lieutenant general was held by the second in command on the battlefield, who was normally subordinate to a captain general.  - Social work is an academic and practice-based professional discipline that seeks to facilitate the welfare of communities, individuals, families, and groups. It may promote social change, development, cohesion, and empowerment. Underpinned by theories of social sciences and guided by principles of social justice, human rights, collective responsibility, and respect for diversities, social work engages people and structures to address life challenges and enhance well-being.  - The German Empire (officially ') was the historical German nation state that existed from the unification of Germany in 1871 to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II in November 1918, when Germany became a federal republic (the Weimar Republic).  - Battle of Kaniv, or Battle of Kaniów took place during World War I on the night of 1011 May 1918, near Kaniv, Ukraine between Polish and German army troops. The fighting pitted the Polish II Corps in Russia (including Brigade II of the Polish Legions), under general Józef Haller von Hallenburg, against the German Imperial Army (including the 28th Landwehr Brigade), under general Zierhold. Ultimately the Germans were victorious with about half of the Polish forces surrendering and the rest retreating in disarray.  - The Central Powers , consisting of Germany, , the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria  hence also known as the Quadruple Alliance  was one of the two main factions during World War I (191418). It faced and was defeated by the Allied Powers that had formed around the Triple Entente, after which it was dissolved.  - The Triple Entente (from French \\"entente\\" \\"friendship, understanding, agreement\\") was the understanding linking the Russian Empire, the French Third Republic, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland after the signing of the Anglo-Russian Entente on 31 August 1907. The understanding between the three powers, supplemented by agreements with Japan and Portugal, constituted a powerful counterweight to the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Kingdom of Italy, though Italy did not side with Germany and Austria during World War I, and joined the Entente Powers instead, in the 1915 Treaty of London.  - The Order of Polonia Restituta is a Polish state order established 4 February 1921. It is conferred to both military and civilians as well as to foreigners for outstanding achievements in the fields of education, science, sport, culture, art, economics, national defense, social work, civil service, or for furthering good relations between countries.  - Austria-Hungary, often referred to as the Austro-Hungarian Empire in English-language sources, was a constitutional union of the Austrian Empire (the Kingdoms and lands represented in the Imperial Council, or \\"Cisleithania\\") and the Kingdom of Hungary (Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen or \\"Transleithania\\") that existed from 1867 to 1918, when it collapsed as a result of defeat in World War I. The union was a result of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and came into existence on 30 March 1867. Austria-Hungary consisted of two monarchies (Austria and Hungary), and one autonomous region: the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia under the Hungarian crown, which negotiated the CroatianHungarian Settlement (\\"Nagodba\\") in 1868. It was ruled by the House of Habsburg, and constituted the last phase in the constitutional evolution of the Habsburg Monarchy. Following the 1867 reforms, the Austrian and the Hungarian states were co-equal. Foreign affairs and the military came under joint oversight, but all other governmental faculties were divided between respective states.  - The Battle of Raracza was fought between Polish Legionnaires, and Austria-Hungary, from February 15 to 16, 1918, near Raracza in Bukovina, and ended with a Polish victory.  - Russia, also officially known as the Russian Empire, was a state that existed from 1721 until it was overthrown by the short-lived liberal February Revolution in 1917. One of the largest empires in world history, stretching over three continents, the Russian Empire was surpassed in landmass only by the British and Mongol empires. The rise of the Russian Empire happened in association with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, Persia and the Ottoman Empire. It played a major role in 181214 in defeating Napoleon's ambitions to control Europe, and expanded to the west and south.  - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.  - Second in Command is a 2006 American action film starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and directed by Simon Fellows.

It was composed of three parts: the joint army (\\", \\"Common Army\\", recruited from all parts of the country), the Imperial Austrian Landwehr (recruited from Cisleithania), and the Royal Hungarian Honved (recruited from Transleithania).  - Cisleithania (also \\"Zisleithanien\\", , , , , , , , , transliterated: \\"Tsysleitàniia\\") was a common yet unofficial denotation of the northern and western part of Austria-Hungary, the Dual Monarchy created in the Compromise of 1867as distinguished from \\"Transleithania\\", i.e. the Hungarian Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen east of (\\"beyond\\") the Leitha River.  - Dual monarchy occurs when two separate kingdoms are ruled by the same monarch, follow the same foreign policy, exist in a customs union with each other and have a combined military but are otherwise self-governing. The term is typically used to refer to AustriaHungary, a dual monarchy that existed from 1867 to 1918.  - A civil servant or public servant is a person in the public sector employed for a government department or agency. The extent of civil servants of a state as part of the \\"civil service\\" varies from country to country.

The Legions became \\"a founding myth for the creation of modern Poland\\" in spite of their considerably short existence; they were replaced by the Polish Auxiliary Corps formation on 20 September 1916, merged with Polish II Corps in Russia on 19 February 1918 for the Battle of Raracza against Austria-Hungary, and disbanded following the military defeat at the Battle of Kaniów in May 1918, against imperial Germany.

By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.

Pinching refers to the pinching off of the top of the stems of a plant to encourage bushy growth and blossoming. Pinching can be done alongside the removal of dead blooms in late spring to early summer, as doing it before winter can also cause the mum to be vulnerable to the cold weather. Pinching is not strictly necessary but is a good addition to your deadheading routine, as it can make your plant fuller and healthier while keeping the shape of the plant compact and bushy. Because pinching is best done on tall stalks that you want bushier and more fruitful, take a good look during the late spring and early summer for stalks that you want shorter. It’s best to pinch your mums once the new shoots that emerge in the spring are 3 to 4 inches (7.62- 10.16 cm) high. Also look for any tips that look dead or browned. Once you have identified some stalks that should be pinched, grasp the tip of a shoot right under the first set of leaves, about ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 cm) down the stem from the tip. Use your fingernails to pinch off this tip and discard the pinched off tip of the plant. Repeat the process of pinching on all unhealthy or overly-tall stems. Pinching not only shortens the height of a tall plant, it also allows encourages rapid growth of leaves and blooms right below the pinched off area. The optimal time to stop pinching for most mums is in mid July so that the plant has time to blossom and grow before blooming season. If your mum plant is an early cultivator then you should stop around mid-June, and if it is a late cultivator like a “Minnyellow” or a “Minngopher” mum, you can get away stopping pinching around early August. Look up your type of mum to see whether it is an early or a late cultivator.

The factory will produce a wide range of specialized semiconductors used in everything from the largest mainframe computers to cell phones and video-game consoles. The new plant is part of IBM's push to gain a strong lead in chip-making beyond the personal computer business, where Intel and East Asian chip producers hold the advantage. \\"The core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack the high-performance segments of the market,\\" said John Kelly, senior vice president in charge of IBM's technology group. An advantage to having the semiconductor fabricating factory here, Kelly explained, was that it was very close to its research laboratories in nearby Westchester County, N.Y. To stay ahead in advanced chip technology, he said, moving innovations out of the labs and into the factory as fast as possible is crucial. \\"What we call the lab-to-fab time should be as close to zero as possible,\\" Kelly said. \\"If our strategy were anything but to be on the leading edge, we'd have put the plant in Asia.\\" The new factory, which will begin normal production early next year, will employ about 1,000 people.

Pioneers in these fields often break boundaries, generate innovative ideas, and revolutionize their respective arenas. Higher mathematics, for example, is an essential aspect of complex problem-solving and helps facilitate major breakthroughs in technology, economics, and computer science. Renowned mathematicians, such as Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton, and Ada Lovelace, have changed the course of history with their groundbreaking theories and discoveries. Similarly, creative scientific fields, which include disciplines such as physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering, allow for boundless exploration and invention. By combining intellectual curiosity with innovative thinking, scientific trailblazers have fueled advancements in research, design, and technology. From Thomas Edison's invention of the light bulb to Rosalind Franklin's contribution to understanding DNA structure, these domain experts have revolutionized human life and enriched our understanding of the world.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered a thinly veiled criticism of China, even while insisting on closer relations with Beijing, during a speech Friday in Singapore.  Speaking at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue defense conference, Modi called for the Indo-Pacific region to embrace freedom of navigation, territorial integrity, and respect for all nations, regardless of their size.  \\"We will promote a democratic and rules-based international order in which all nations, small and large, count as equal and sovereign,\\" the Indian prime minister said. \\"We will work with others to keep our seas, space and airways free and open.\\"  While those comments did not specifically mention China, Modi's remarks are seen as a reference to Beijing's increasingly assertive behavior toward its smaller neighbors in disputed areas of the South China Sea. Modi also implicitly criticized the United States. He slammed growing protectionism, presumably a reference to recent tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. He also said nations should keep their commitments — a possible reference to Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.  India has grown close with the U.S., especially as China projects its growing military power beyond its shores.  The U.S.-India relationship, Modi said, \\"has resumed new significance in the changing world.\\" An important aspect of that partnership is \\"a shared vision of an open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific,\\" he added.  For decades, India has embraced a non-aligned status, which means it does not choose sides between world powers. In keeping with that position, Modi warned against a \\"return to great power rivalries.\\"  The Indian prime minister also insisted that \\"Asia and the world will have a better future when India and China work together in trust and confidence, sensitive to each other's interests.\\" India is the world's largest democracy. It has the world's seventh-largest economy. Within a decade, it is expected to pass China to become the world's most populous country. Question: What is probably true of India?

There was a dirt road through the tract, but further down, it crossed two huge concrete pipes. The dirt was washed out between them, and the deep gulch made it impossible to cross in a car. Sometimes, eight or ten of us would go looking for parked cars. If we found one or more, we would go move this incredibly heavy stump onto the road and lay a telephone pole across it. It took all of us and it was incredibly heavy. It was impossible to drive around it because of the ditches and there was no way two or three people could move it. We'd go back to the car and set off a big string of fire crackers or shake the cat and slap on it and run like crazy. We'd watch from the woods as they drove like heck and come to a screeching stop at our roadblock. The guy would get out and try to lift the pole. Never happen. Then the car would drive the other way. That wouldn't happen because of the pipes. We'd go home leaving them in there. This was before cell phones, and it was miles to a pay phone. We'd go back the next day and find the stump and pole moved. We thought it was real funny until one night we set it up and beat on the trunk of a car. A couple was inside, getting it on. We hadn't noticed a guy sitting on the hood with a bottle of booze and a pistol. As we ran, he was shooting and we could hear bullets going through the underbrush. No one was hit, thank goodness.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him?, using the article: Pod was released in the UK on May 29, 1990 by 4AD. Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' Bossanova two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums.  Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \\"never sold [anything]\\" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \\"pod\\" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer Vaughan Oliver and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver, in an attempt to seduce Deal, whom he believed would appreciate the humor, attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, which he intended as phallic symbols. He performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him using a long exposure to achieve the blurring and other visual effects., what would be the answer ?

Luckily I was not the target or victim of this road rage, but I was a first hand witness. Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one. Who told the other coworkers about the shooting? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. the police detective  B. The author's co-worker  C. not enough information  D.

Solve 53*s - 492 = -33*s - 67*s + 5475 for s.. What is the answer??","output":"To solve the equation, I will follow these steps: 1. Combine like terms. 2. Isolate the variable 's'. 3. Solve for 's'. The given equation is: 53*s - 492 = -33*s - 67*s + 5475 Step 1: Combine like terms. On the right side of the equation, we have two 's' terms, -33*s and -67*s. Let's combine these terms: -33*s - 67*s = (-33 - 67) * s = -100*s So, the equation becomes:  53*s - 492 = -100*s + 5475 Step 2: Isolate the variable 's'. To do this, let's add 100*s to both sides of the equation to move all 's' terms to the left side: 53*s + 100*s - 492 = -100*s + 100*s + 5475 This simplifies to: 153*s - 492 = 5475 Now, to completely isolate 's', we need to add 492 to both sides of the equation: 153*s - 492 + 492 = 5475 + 492 This simplifies to: 153*s = 5967 Step 3: Solve for 's'. Now, we just need to divide both sides of the equation by 153 to find the value of 's': s = 5967 / 153 s ≈ 39 So the answer is: s ≈ 39"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: That fall came and I went back to Michigan and the school year went by and summer came and I never really thought about it. I'm not even sure if I was officially asked, I just wound up heading back to New Jersey when school was out. I think my parents thought it was a good enough deal. They were already having some problems and without Nonna there anymore to take care of me I think my cousin's house on the coast seemed like as good a spot as any to stick me for the summer. It certainly wasn't because of any great love between me and my cousin. We weren't really very good friends at that point. I think she saw me as sort of foisted off on her and getting in the way of her summers. Which was a fair enough judgment. But she could have been nicer. It's pretty amazing that she wound up as my Maid of Honor. Time does strange things. Your lovable jack-ass of a father would mention something about magic in here. You know if you took a group of fifty strangers, had them chat with your father for half an hour then with me for half an hour, then told them that one of us was an English Professor and one of us was head of distribution in the northeast for a large soft drink manufacturing concern, I'm pretty sure all fifty would peg your father as the English Professor and me as the head of distribution. He's honestly so good at what he does that I can almost allow him to claim it's magic except that it'd be nice if he took credit for some of the things he's done with his life.

A:","output":"A: On the surface Ticks are a type of parasitic arachnid that rely on blood meals for their survival and reproduction. They are commonly found in wooded and grassy areas where they patiently await potential hosts, such as humans or animals, to pass by. Among the given answer choices, \\"on the surface\\" is the most accurate answer, as ticks attach themselves to the skin of their host. When they sense a potential host's body heat, scent, or carbon dioxide from their breath, they quickly climb on and use their mouthparts to pierce the skin. Once attached, they hold onto the host with their sharp barbs and secrete a cement-like substance, which ensures they remain in place while feeding. Although ticks may occasionally also be found in loose soil or on animals, it is ultimately the surface of an organism's body where they attach themselves and feed. It is important to note that ticks do not live directly within the blood, in an organism's mouth, or behind the teeth. They act as ectoparasites, which means that they live on the exterior of their hosts. Ticks are known carriers of several pathogens that can cause diseases in humans and animals, such as Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and tularemia.

The sisters rent a two-room-apartment in a once-grandiose hotel. Ester suffers in her room, self-medicating with vodka and cigarettes while trying to work.

Meanwhile, Anna ventures into the city and is openly advanced upon by a waiter in a cafe. Later, she watches a show in an uncrowded theatre, and is both repelled and fascinated when a young couple begin to have sex in a seat nearby. Anna returns to the cafe, brushes past the waiter, and returns to the hotel in time. Left with Johan while his mother is out, Ester attempts to form a more intimate bond with him, but Johan avoids her attempts to stroke his hair and face. On Anna's return, Ester is eager for an account of what her sister has done after seeing her soiled dress. Provoked, Anna spitefully fabricates a sexual encounter with the waiter to her sister. Anna also reveals her intention to meet him again that evening, which Ester, not wanting to be left alone, begs her not to do. Anna meets the man in their hotel, and Johan witnesses them kissing and entering a room down an adjacent hall.

These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.  and the situation: Two medical school students named Dan and Bob learned about the human immune system.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Who started calling himself Varg Vikernes? , can you please find it?   In the 1980s, a young guitarist called Euronymous forms a black metal band called Mayhem, the first of the genre in their country of Norway, with Necrobutcher on bass, and  Manheim on drums. Manhein leaves and is soon replaced by new drummer Hellhammer and they recruit a new vocalist from Sweden called Dead, who exhibits self-destructive behavior, which he portrays during their live shows by cutting himself and bleeding on the audience, and throwing pig heads at the \\"posers\\". At a show filmed by their friend Metalion, the band meets a fan named Kristian, whom Euronymous initially looks down on. While home alone, Dead uses his personal knife to cut his arms and throat, and then uses Euronymous' shotgun to shoot himself in the forehead, leaving behind a suicide note. Euronymous returns home and finds the body but instead of calling the police, he takes photos of the body and moves the knife and shotgun around. After Dead's body is taken away, Euronymous gives necklaces to the other band members which he claims are pieces of Dead's skull; this disgusts Necrobutcher, prompting him to leave the band. Soon after, Euronymous starts his own black metal record label and opens a record shop called Helvete, which becomes a social hub for black-metallers like Metalion, Fenriz of Darkthrone, Faust of Emperor, and Kristian (who is now calling himself Varg Vikernes) of Burzum. They become known as the \\"Black Circle\\". After being mocked by an ego-driven Euronymous, Varg uses his anti-Christian beliefs as motivation to burn down a local church. When approached by Varg concerning his status as the leader of the Black Circle, Euronymous burns down a church with Faust and Varg accompanying. Euronymous recruits Varg as bassist, a guitarist called Blackthorn and a Hungarian vocalist, Attila Csihar, to record Mayhem's first album, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. A power dispute between Varg and Euronymous arises. The answer to this question is:","output":"Kristian, who later started calling himself Varg Vikernes, is the person who adopted the name. He was a fan of the Norwegian black metal band Mayhem and eventually became a part of the \\"Black Circle,\\" a group of black metal musicians and enthusiasts.

Options: - pleasure - carpal tunnel syndrome - medical bill - eye strain - increased efficiency  Explain why a human would choose \\"carpal tunnel syndrome\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"carpal tunnel syndrome\\" as the answer to the question because if a person is paralyzed, they typically have limited or no control over their limbs. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a health condition that affects the hand and wrist, caused by the compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel. This condition is often the result of repetitive hand movements or long-term improper hand positioning, which might not be applicable to someone who is paralyzed.  In the context of the question, paralysis minimizes the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome while using a computer. The other options potentially can still happen even if someone is paralyzed. For example, a paralyzed person could still experience pleasure, medical bills, eye strain, and increased efficiency while using a computer with the help of accessible technology.

Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

Altrincham became a Free Borough, a self-governing township, when it was granted a charter in June 1290 by the Lord of the Manor, Hamon de Massey V. The charter allowed for the creation of a merchants' guild, run by the town's burgesses to tax people passing through the borough. Burgesses were free men who lived in the town. The borough was ruled by a Court Leet and elected a mayor since at least 1452. Amongst the court's responsibilities were keeping the public peace and regulating the markets and fairs.The borough was not one of those reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835, and continued to exist under the control of the Lord of the Manor and the Court Leet until its final abolition in 1886. The Public Health Act of 1848 led to the creation of Altrincham's Local Board of Health in 1851 to address the unsanitary conditions created by the town's growing population – the first such board in Trafford.The local board was reconstituted as an urban district council in the administrative county of Cheshire under the Local Government Act 1894. Altrincham Urban District was expanded in 1920 when parts of Carrington and Dunham Massey Civil Parishes were added. A further expansion took place in 1936; Timperley Civil Parish was abolished and most of its area incorporated into Altrincham UD. At the same time, there was a minor exchange of areas with Hale Urban District; a minor addition from Bowdon Urban District; and a further substantial portion of Dunham Massey Civil Parish was added. In 1937 the urban district was granted a charter of incorporation and became a municipal borough. The new borough was granted armorial bearings which featured heraldic references to the Masseys and Earls of Stamford. With the passage of the Local Government Act 1972, the administrative counties and municipal boroughs were abolished and Altrincham became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford in Greater Manchester on 1 April 1974.Trafford Council is responsible for the administration of local services, such as education,...

I had heard and read some buzz about this place and was excited to finally have the chance to give it a try, but unfortunately, my experience has left me feeling completely underwhelmed, and even more than a little frustrated. Allow me to detail the reasons why I have to give this place a negative review. First and foremost, the location is not particularly convenient. Navigating to the spot was frustrating, as the roads were convoluted, and space for parking was scarce. I had to park my car quite a distance from the place and walk a little under a mile just to get there. This was not the best way to start off my visit. Once I finally arrived, I found that the ambiance was not at all what I was expecting. The exterior was shabby and not well-maintained. As for the interior, it was dimly lit, and the overall decor was outdated and unappealing. It gave off the impression that the owners did not care about cultivating a welcoming atmosphere for their customers. The service, unfortunately, matched the poor ambiance. Our server was inattentive and seemed to be more interested in chatting with fellow employees than addressing the needs of the diners. Our order took absolutely ages to be taken down, and even after that, we had to wait an ungodly amount of time just to receive our food. The lack of attentiveness and overall disorganized service was highly frustrating, particularly as the place was not packed. As for the food itself, it fell extremely flat. To be blunt, the flavor palate was practically nonexistent. The dishes lacked creativity, and many ingredients tasted as if they were not fresh or had been poorly stored. The presentation of the plates was also atrocious—a clear indication that no thought had been given to making the dish look appealing. I had hoped that the food would be the saving grace of the visit, but alas, it only further compounded my disappointment. During our entire meal, we were subjected to overly loud and obnoxious music which only added to the disappointment and frustration of our experience. The noise made it nearly impossible to hold a conversation with my fellow diners, and my many attempts to ask the staff to lower the volume were disregarded. Regarding the pricing, this establishment was not at all worth the cost. The inflated prices surely did not correlate with the quality of the food, nor the level of service we received. It felt as if I were being ripped off for an utterly dismal dining experience. In conclusion, my visit to this place has been far from satisfactory, and I regret to say that I cannot in good faith give it a positive review. The poor location, lack of ambiance, terrible service, and incredibly subpar food have all contributed to an experience that left me feeling dissatisfied, frustrated, and wondering how this place has managed to stay in business at all. It is with great disappointment that I have to say: save your time and money and find somewhere else to dine."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It starts out well, but once the main hit is done, it devolves into a long subplot around a young girl which is not compelling, and some action scenes which are theatre of the absurd unrealistic. For example there is a prolonged shootout at the airport in which the lighting is all stroboscopic. No explanation for that. How credible is it that a airport storage area is going to have lights that flash on and off confusingly, and just enough to let Snipes do his incredible escape schtick?

Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to play the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.  - A try is a way of scoring points in rugby union and rugby league football. A try is scored by grounding the ball (the ball must be touching the player when coming into contact with the ground) in the opposition's in-goal area (on or behind the goal line).

Онег Шабат Translate to English English:","output":"Oneg Shabbat Oneg Shabbat, also spelled Oneg Shabbos or Oneg Shabbath, is a Hebrew term that translates to \\"Sabbath delight\\" or \\"joy of the Sabbath\\" in English. The concept of Oneg Shabbat is rooted in Jewish tradition and is dedicated to experiencing pleasure and enjoyment on the Sabbath (Shabbat), the day of rest prescribed in the Jewish faith. The Sabbath is observed from sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday. Oneg Shabbat is an important Jewish custom that involves engaging in pleasurable activities for the mind, body, and soul and spending joyous time with family and friends. It is typically characterized by festive meals and gatherings filled with food, drink, singing, learning, and discussing religious and spiritual topics. The purpose of these gatherings is to honor the Sabbath and reinforce the values and teachings of Judaism. Oneg Shabbat celebrations often take place at home, synagogues, or community centers. Some of the activities and customs associated with Oneg Shabbat include: 1. Lighting the Shabbat candles: This practice symbolizes the separation between the holiness of Shabbat and the everyday workweek. Women and girls typically light the candles just before the sun sets on Friday evening and recite a blessing. 2. Kiddush: At the beginning of the Friday night meal and the Saturday lunch, a special blessing called the Kiddush is recited over a cup of wine or grape juice. This ritual sanctifies the Sabbath and commemorates the creation of the world, as well as the Exodus from Egypt in Jewish history. 3. Challah: During the Sabbath meals, Jews partake of challah, a braided bread that is usually egg-enriched and baked in a round or oblong shape. Two loaves of challah are used to represent the double portion of manna, the miraculous food provided by God, that the Israelites received on Fridays during their 40-year journey in the desert. 4. Seudah Shlishit: It is customary to have three meals during the Sabbath, with the third meal called \\"Seudah Shlishit\\" typically taking place late on Saturday afternoon. Seudah Shlishit is often a lighter meal, consisting of leftovers from the previous meals, salads, fruits, or other light foods. 5. Zemirot: These are traditional Jewish songs or hymns sung during or after Sabbath meals. They feature themes such as gratitude, praise, and joy, further emphasizing the celebration and enjoyment of the Sabbath. 6. Havdalah: As the Sabbath comes to an end, a ceremony called Havdalah is performed to mark the separation between the holy day of rest and the beginning of the new workweek. This ritual involves the use of wine, fragrant spices, and a braided candle to symbolize the multiple aspects of joy experienced during the Sabbath. By partaking in the customs and practices of Oneg Shabbat, Jewish communities worldwide find spiritual rejuvenation, connect with their heritage and values, and take a temporary respite from the pressures and stresses of everyday life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person that calls Laurence to brag?  Fed up with her dead-end job with a Minneapolis car rental agency, Martha quits, cashes her final paycheck, and uses the money to purchase an airline ticket to the least expensive international destination she can find - London. At the airport, she meets Daniel, a successful music label executive, who covertly arranges for her to be upgraded to First Class and seated next to him on the flight. When she sells the ticket to another passenger and Daniel finds his seatmate is an obnoxiously loud woman instead of the girl of his dreams, he moves back to the Economy section and takes the vacant seat next to Martha. Before landing in London, he offers her the use of a deluxe suite in a luxury hotel at his company's expense in exchange for a lunch date the following day. Through a series of flashbacks and flashforwards, we learn Laurence, a former bridge champion who now teaches the game to wealthy women, went to the airport to pick up Daniel but missed him because the flight landed early. Instead, he literally runs into Martha, who hits him with a luggage cart while searching for the exit. She coerces him into taking her into the city and invites him to the suite for dinner. While she is in the bathroom, a bouquet of flowers from Daniel is delivered to the suite, and when Laurence sees the attached card, he departs without explanation. The following day, Martha meets struggling actor Frank, who has fled an audition in a panic and has gone to the park to console himself with a half-bottle of whiskey. Having heard about her from Daniel, he realizes who she is and calls Laurence to boast that he is about to make her his conquest. He takes her to a nearby art gallery. Martha slips away and heads for the exit, where she reunites with Laurence, who was looking for the pair. He invites her back to his flat and she accepts.

Deşi în Serbia este binecunoscut faptul că cea mai mare parte a presei locale din timpul regimului lui Milosevic făcea parte din maşina de război, Curtea de Onoare a Asociaţiei Jurnaliştilor din Serbia (UNS) a exclus opt redactori-şef din rândurile sale în 2000 din cauza comportamentului lor de la acea dată. Translate to English","output":"Although it is well-known in Serbia that most of the local press during Milosevic's regime was part of the war machine, in 2000, the Honor Court of the Association of Journalists of Serbia (UNS) expelled eight editors-in-chief from its ranks due to their behavior at that time. During the regime of Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia experienced a period of political turmoil and conflict that was marked by propaganda and media censorship. The local press was tightly controlled by the government and, as a result, most of it served as a tool for promoting its agendas. The press played a significant role in disseminating disinformation and inciting nationalist sentiments among the Serbian population. In the year 2000, following the fall of Milosevic's regime, the Association of Journalists of Serbia (UNS), a professional organization that represents journalists and aims to protect their rights and promote ethical journalism, took a bold step. They decided to investigate and hold accountable those individuals who had contributed to the spread of propaganda and the promotion of the regime's interests within the media. As a result, the Honor Court, an integral part of the association responsible for addressing cases of ethical misconduct, excluded eight editors-in-chief from its membership. This action was a response to their behavior during Milosevic's regime, where they acted as an essential part of the war machine. The expulsion of these individuals sent a message that journalists must adhere to ethical standards and prioritize the truth, especially during such pivotal moments in history. The actions taken by the Honor Court of the Association of Journalists of Serbia served as an attempt to restore the integrity and credibility of Serbian journalists in the aftermath of Milosevic's regime. It demonstrated a commitment to upholding journalistic principles and ensuring that those who engaged in manipulative tactics faced accountability - a vital step for the rebuilding and reformation of the media landscape in Serbia."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For example, European news vendors did not (and do not) shout headlines as they hawk their papers. Yet this strictly American custom is employed in the film. For example, the Nazis did not adopt the German eagle until after they had taken power but there it is on the lectern as Hitler delivers one of his stem winders. Indeed, most of this disappointing production consists of little more than Hitlerian oratory. The movie also perpetuates the myth that the beer hall putsch was hatched at the Munich Hoffbrauhaus.

Here is a detailed and step-by-step guide on how to successfully send the money order: 1. Determine the desired amount: Before visiting the USPS outlet, it is crucial to know the exact amount of money you wish to send through the money order. This will ensure a smooth transaction and help avoid any confusion later. 2. Visit the USPS outlet: Locate your nearest USPS outlet and go there to purchase the money order. Make sure you carry sufficient cash, a debit card, or traveler's checks to cover the value of the money order and any associated fees. Keep in mind that credit cards are not accepted for purchasing money orders at USPS locations. 3. Fill out the money order form: Once the money order has been obtained, it will have sections for you to fill out. These sections generally require the following information:    a. Payee's name: Write the full name of the person or organization to whom the money order is being sent. This helps ensure the money order is only cashed or deposited by the intended recipient.    b. Your name and address: Fill in your full name and address, which allows the recipient to know that the money order came from you and provides a record in case any issues arise later.    c. Additional information: Some money orders have a section for memo or additional information, where you can write the purpose of the payment (for instance, rent, loan repayment, etc.).    d. Sign the money order: Sign the 'purchaser' or 'sender' section, making it valid for the recipient. 4. Retain the receipt stub: A detachable receipt stub is typically provided with the money order. Keep it in a safe place, as it serves as proof of the transaction and may be needed if the money order is lost or you need to track its status. 5. Prepare the money order and accompanying documents for mailing: Place the completed money order in an envelope addressed to the recipient. It's a good idea to also include a note or letter explaining the purpose of the money order and any specific instructions. Seal the envelope securely. 6. Mail the envelope: Go to the post office to mail the envelope containing the money order. It is advisable to use a trackable mailing service such as Certified Mail, Priority Mail, or Registered Mail to ensure the safe and timely delivery of the money order to the intended recipient. Moreover, you can also purchase insurance for the mailing in case of potential loss or damage. 7. Track the mailing: After mailing the money order, track its progress through the USPS website (if you used a trackable mailing service) or by contacting USPS customer service. This will help you stay informed about the status of your money order and provide peace of mind. 8. Follow up with the recipient: Once the money order has been successfully delivered, confirm its receipt with the intended recipient. This is an essential step to ensure the intended person or organization obtained the money order and deposited or cashed it accordingly. If there are any issues, having this communication will make it easier to resolve them. In conclusion, the most logical next event after purchasing a money order is to send it to the intended recipient by following the detailed steps outlined above. This will ensure that the money order reaches the correct person or organization securely and serves its desired purpose."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Additionally, vertebrates have a well-developed head, bilateral symmetry, an endoskeleton, and a complex nervous system that includes a brain. Vertebrates can be further divided into five major groups: fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Since mammals are vertebrates, you've already mentioned the general category that mammals belong to. In contrast, jellyfish belong to the phylum Cnidaria.

Saint Paul, one of the early Christian leaders, was also depicted with a beard, which indicates that there might be some significance to having a beard in early Christianity. 2. Islam: Growing a beard is considered a sunnah, or practice, of the Prophet Muhammad. Many devout Muslim men grow beards as a sign of piety and religious adherence. 3. Judaism: In some sects of Judaism, beards are considered to be a symbol of wisdom and maturity. Torah scholars and rabbis often have beards, which signifies their knowledge of the sacred texts. Step 2: Summarize findings about religious symbolism of bearded men. In summary, bearded men in various religions and traditions symbolize wisdom, spiritual strength, religious devotion, or maturity. However, there may be variations within sects and denominations of each religion regarding the importance of having a beard. To address the second question about the attractiveness of men with beards, I will examine some studies and viewpoints on the subject. Step 1: Research about the perception of attractiveness for men with and without beards. Studies on attractiveness and beards have shown mixed results, with some suggesting that bearded men are considered to be more attractive, while others claim that clean-shaven men are perceived as more attractive. 1. A study conducted by Barnaby Dixson and Robert Brooks found that women rated men with heavy stubble and full beards as more attractive than clean-shaven men, but men with light stubble were rated as less attractive than both groups. 2. Another study by Neave and Shields found that women rated men with light stubble as more attractive than both clean-shaven and fully bearded men. These studies indicate that preferences for bearded vs. clean-shaven men may vary, and attractiveness might depend on factors such as facial hair length, grooming, and cultural preferences. Step 2: Summarize findings about the attractiveness of men with and without beards. In conclusion, the perception of attractiveness in men with beards varies, and it depends on various factors such as facial hair length, grooming, and cultural preferences. Some studies suggest that bearded men are considered more attractive, while others find clean-shaven men to be more appealing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the solution? Solve 69*m + 35*m = -30*m - 670 for m.","output":"Alright, let's break this down so that it is easy to understand. We have an equation: 69*m + 35*m = -30*m - 670 First, let's add the \\"m\\" terms (the numbers with \\"m\\" beside them) on the left side of the equation together. So, we have: (69 + 35) * m = 104*m Now our equation looks like this: 104*m = -30*m - 670 To solve for m, we need to get all the \\"m\\" terms on one side of the equation. Let's move the -30*m from the right side to the left side by adding 30*m to both sides of the equation. We have: 104*m + 30*m = -670 Now, let's add the \\"m\\" terms on the left side together. So, we have: (104 + 30) * m = 134*m Our equation is now: 134*m = -670 Now, to find the value of m, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 134: m = -670 / 134 When we divide -670 by 134, we get: m = -5 So, the value of m that solves the equation is -5."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Second question: I can see a contacts display picture on WhatsApp, but I can't see their status or last seen. Have I just been removed from her contact list, or has she blocked me? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First question: Is there any setting in WhatsApp where you can remove yourself from others' WhatsApp list? Answer: No, there isn't any specific setting in WhatsApp that allows you to remove yourself from others' WhatsApp contact list directly. However, you can take a couple of measures to decrease your visibility or make it difficult for others to add you in their contact list. 1. Change your privacy settings: You can change your privacy settings in WhatsApp to hide your profile photo, last seen, status, and live location. To do this, follow these steps:    a. Open WhatsApp and go to Settings.    b. Tap on Account, then Privacy.    c. Change the settings for Last Seen, Profile Photo, About, and Live Location to 'My Contacts' or 'Nobody' as per your preference. 2. Remove your phone number from unwanted contacts: If you want a specific person to not have your number in their contact list, you can ask them to remove your number. However, you have no direct control over this. Second question: I can see a contacts display picture on WhatsApp, but I can't see their status or last seen. Have I just been removed from her contact list, or has she blocked me? Answer: If you can see a contact's display picture but not their status or last seen, there are several possible explanations: 1. The person may have changed their privacy settings: It is possible that the person has updated their privacy settings to hide their last seen or status from anyone or just from you. If they have set it to 'My Contacts', and you're not saved as a contact in their phone, you won't be able to see these details. 2. They have removed you from their contact list: If the person has removed you from their contact list, and their last seen or status settings are set to 'My Contacts', you won't be able to view their status or last seen. 3. Network/server issues: Rarely, there might be a temporary glitch or issue with WhatsApp servers, causing delayed updates in the status or last seen information. This issue usually resolves by itself. If you can see their display picture, it is less likely that they have blocked you on WhatsApp, as when someone blocks you, their display picture, status, and last seen will all be hidden from your view. Are these two questions asking the same thing? Answer: No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question is about settings in WhatsApp that allow you to remove yourself from other people's contact lists, while the second question is about determining if you have been removed from a contact list or blocked based on the visibility of a contact's display picture, status, and last seen. While both questions involve understanding privacy features of WhatsApp and contact visibility, they focus on different aspects of the app's functionality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For example, you may write a novella about loss by having a main character who deals with loss in their life. To continue, the next steps in writing a novella would include: 1. Develop your characters: Create compelling and relatable characters that will resonate with readers. Give them distinct personalities, backgrounds, and motivations. These characters will help bring your theme to life and allow the reader to emotionally connect with the story. 2. Create a captivating setting: The setting of your novella should enhance the theme and contribute to the overall tone and atmosphere of the story. Consider whether the setting will be a real location or a fictional one, and strive for vivid descriptions to immerse the reader in the environment. 3. Construct a strong plot: Design a plot that revolves around your chosen theme and allows the characters to grow and change. The plot of a novella is typically more focused and streamlined than that of a novel, so ensure that every event serves a purpose and contributes to the progression of the story. 4. Use engaging writing style and voice: The way you tell your story is just as important as the story itself. Develop a unique voice and writing style that complements your theme and characters. Use descriptive language and varied sentence structures to maintain reader interest. 5. Edit and revise: Once you've finished writing your novella, take the time to carefully review and revise your work. Pay attention to the flow of the story, the pacing, and whether your theme is well-developed. Make sure your characters are consistent, and consider asking for feedback from beta readers to gain valuable insights. By focusing on these steps, you can create a powerful novella that explores your chosen theme and leaves a lasting impact on readers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the first quarter, the Bills struck first with WR/PR Roscoe Parrish returning a punt 74 yards for a touchdown.  Then, near the end of the period, the Broncos got on the board with kicker Jason Elam getting a 21-yard field goal.  Denver would go on to get the only score of the second quarter, as Elam kicked a 48-yard field goal. On the opening kickoff for the second half, a scary injury occurred to Bills TE Kevin Everett, as he suffered a cervical spine injury.  He would end up being carted off the field, and was rushed to Millard Fillmore Gates Hospital for an emergency surgery. It was due to the fastest application of cold ever applied to an injured spine that gave Everett a chance to walk again despite the initial grim prognosis. In the third quarter, Buffalo struck again as rookie RB Marshawn Lynch got a 23-yard TD run.  Afterwards, the Broncos pulled within two as QB Jay Cutler completed a 5-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Marshall (followed by a failed 2-Point Conversion).  Near the end of the fourth quarter, Cutler drove his team into field goal range and with no timeouts left, Denver's special teams came on and Elam kicked the game-winning 42-yard field goal with no time left on the clock.

Step 1: Understand the context The story appears to be about a massage session between two friends or individuals, Carrie and Betty.  Step 2: Maintain continuity Considering the available options, I see that Carrie is the one laying on the table, and Betty is applying lotion, so it would make more sense to choose the option where \\"Betty was giving a massage.\\"  Step 3: Use descriptive language It is essential to use descriptive and engaging language to keep the reader interested in the story. Step 4: Continue the story using chosen option Betty was giving a massage. The atmosphere in the room was tranquil, with the soothing scent of lavender essential oil wafting through the air. Soft music played in the background, setting the mood for relaxation. Step 5: Describe the characters' thoughts or actions Betty's hands were skilled and confident as she gently rubbed the lotion into Carrie's muscle tension areas, using her thumbs to alleviate the knots. She could sense Carrie's on-going stress and wanted to help her feel better. Carrie, on her end, began to experience the comforting sensation of the massage, allowing her mind to ease, entrusting her well-being to Betty's nurturing touch. She could feel the tension dissipating from her muscles, bringing a long-awaited sense of peace. Step 6: Introduce a turning point or development As the massage continued, Carrie started opening up about her worries, and the two friends began a heartfelt conversation, sharing their thoughts, fears, and life experiences. This conversation deepened their bond, and the massage became not only an act of physical healing, but also one of emotional support. Step 7: Conclude the story The time spent together allowed Carrie and Betty to understand the importance of slowing down, taking care of themselves, and cherishing the connections they'd made. They agreed to make receiving and giving massages a recurring activity, as a means of staying connected, caring for each other, and spreading love through touch. As Carrie left the massage table, they knew they had found a meaningful way to keep their friendship strong. The power of healing had just begun."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Cougar The cougar (Puma concolor), also commonly known as the mountain lion, puma, panther, or catamount, is a large felid of the subfamily Felinae native to the Americas. Its range, from the Canadian Yukon to the southern Andes of South America, is the greatest of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere. An adaptable, generalist species, the cougar is found in most American habitat types. It is the second-heaviest cat in the New World, after the jaguar. Secretive and largely solitary by nature, the cougar is properly considered both nocturnal and crepuscular, although there are daytime sightings. The cougar is more closely related to smaller felines, including the domestic cat (subfamily Felinae), than to any species of subfamily Pantherinae, of which only the jaguar is native to the Americas. OPTIONS: A. no. B. yes. Is this statement correct \\"are pumas cougars and mountain lions the same animal\\"?","output":"B. Yes. The statement \\"are pumas, cougars, and mountain lions the same animal\\" is correct. These three names all refer to the same species, Puma concolor, which is a large felid native to the Americas. This versatile and adaptable species thrives in a wide range of habitats, from the Canadian Yukon to the southern Andes of South America. Although the exact name assigned to the animal may vary based on geographical location or cultural preferences, pumas, cougars, and mountain lions all describe the same majestic predator. The cougar is known for its stealth, elusive nature, and solitary behavior. Often active during dawn, dusk, or nighttime, this crepuscular predator is even related to smaller felines like the domestic cat, placing it within the subfamily Felinae, rather than the Pantherinae subfamily that includes the jaguar. Overall, despite the numerous names assigned to the Puma concolor, it remains a fascinating and ecologically important species across the Western Hemisphere."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Write highlights for this article: Was it at 2.01pm on Saturday that Lewis Hamilton’s extraordinary miscalculation brought an end to his dreams of a second world title and his wider hopes of becoming an all-time great of his sport? It may yet unfold that this conjurer of the track, the phenomenal Lewis, will drive as brilliantly in the British Grand Prix on Sunday as he acted foolishly in qualifying here and restore himself in his title fight with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg. Nothing can ever be ruled out with Hamilton, this see-sawing driver, but on Saturday night the feeling was that a dramatic, defining, damning moment had left its imprint on the 2014 season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch on-board lap with Lewis Hamilton round the Silverstone circuit. Rattled: Lewis Hamilton (left) has allowed Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to get under his skin at times. The incident came in the final lap of qualifying, when Hamilton decided to abort his final flying lap for no compelling reason. Rosberg passed him, set the fastest lap and will start the race from pole. Hamilton, who trails Rosberg by 29 points, will start from sixth. Why? ‘I don’t know,’ said Hamilton, at his surly worst when asked for an explanation in front of the BBC cameras. ‘I don’t have much of an answer. I just decided not to do the lap.’ With that he walked off almost as ill-advisedly as he had turned off the track a few minutes earlier.Where was his respect for ‘the greatest fans in the world’, the British public he had buttered up a few days earlier with what now sounded like empty platitudes? Too slow: Rosberg passed Hamilton to set the fastest lap and will start Sunday's race from pole. But back to qualifying, which was beset by changing conditions: drizzle, rain, cloudy but dry, sunny. Hamilton had set the fastest time in his first lap of the final session before rain fell harder and all the cars came in. Niki Would the rain relent, allowing them to go out again? Niki Lauda, the Mercedes chairman, said: ‘The team wanted them to stay in, but the drivers said they wanted to get in another lap, so it was decided they would.’ In that final, supposed shootout, Hamilton made a small mistake, locking up, at the Arena - Turn Four - and, believing it to be too wet to beat his previous time, pulled out of the lap and let Rosberg through to capitalise on the markedly drier conditions at the end of track. Mercedes put out a statement a few minutes later to explain Hamilton’s side of the story. ‘I made a mistake today and pulled out of the lap when I should have kept going,’ he said. Mistake: Hamilton's miscalculation could end his dreams of a second world title. ‘It was a tough qualifying with the changing conditions and we got through most of it really well, until the most important part. ‘It was my decision, a bad call, and that decided my qualifying. ‘I’m so sorry to have disappointed the fans here today as their support has been fantastic and I’ll do what I can to have a great race for them on Sunday. I need to have a start like I had in Austria two weeks ago and then do my best to get back to the front. You never know what might happen. ‘It’s difficult when you're just out of the car to express your emotions and see the positive, but I’ll go back to the team and my family now and we'll build up for tomorrow from there.’ Pole: Rosberg (centre) Sebastian Vettel, and Jenson Button (left) will start from the front at Silverstone. Well, that was like the Gettysburg address compared to the muddle of excuses – amid some perfectly reasonable excuses – put forward by Hamilton when he came to his press conference later. His funniest claim was that, ‘I never give up’. So, what were you doing abandoning the lap, Lewis? He again accepted that it was his fault, yet, contradicting that, cited the failure of the team to tell him it was faster in the final part of the lap as some sort of mitigation for his decision. What makes Saturday’s antics most bizarre is that Hamilton, for all his ups and downs, has always been a racer, a fight-to-the-end warrior. But here at Silverstone, of all places, where conditions are famously different from one end of the track to another, did he decide to stop. Lead: Hamilton (right) rounds a corner ahead Rosberg during qualification on Saturday. He could have qualified second or third or fourth or fifth. In fact, he could have beaten Rosberg. There is a pattern emerging: he has made mistakes in the past most recent qualifying sessions, a part of his performance that is traditionally extremely strong. Rosberg, it seems, has rattled him. Sir Jackie Stewart, watching from the paddock, said: ‘His head certainly seems to have gone a bit.’ Finish: Button celebrates after taking third position in the qualifying session of the British Formula One Grand Prix. One question is whether Hamilton has the intellectual gifts to find the answers against the calculating, clever Rosberg. Another is whether he will resist thinking the team are against him. Ostensibly declining to wade into psychological warfare, the German did so stealthily, saying: ‘With regards to the championship, it’s good for me that Lewis is down in sixth.’ Hamilton finished the afternoon by, again, promising the fans more today. It all sounded a little hollow in the circumstances.","output":"Highlights: - Lewis Hamilton's miscalculation during the final lap of qualifying allowed Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg to pass him, set the fastest lap, and start the race from pole position. - Hamilton, currently 29 points behind Rosberg, will start the British Grand Prix from sixth position. - The decision to abort the final flying lap was solely Hamilton's, who later apologized to his fans for the mistake and vowed to perform better during the race. - Some speculate that Hamilton's recent series of mistakes during qualifying sessions may indicate that Rosberg has rattled him; others question if Hamilton has the intellectual abilities to outsmart the calculating Rosberg."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Amy mostly got C grades in their classes.","output":"In this sentence, we have two subjects, Rebecca and Amy, each with distinct behaviors when it comes to studying. Rebecca is described as being lax, meaning she's not very strict or focused on her studies, while Amy is described as diligent, meaning she's hardworking and devoted to her studies. Given the behaviors of the two individuals, the appropriate option for the sentence ending would be: a). Rebecca mostly got C grades in their classes. This option demonstrates the correlation between Rebecca's slack attitude towards studying and her average performance in her classes, as reflected by her C grades. C grades typically represent average performance, which is a likely outcome for someone who does not prioritize studying or invest significant effort into their schoolwork. Conversely, someone like Amy, who is diligent, would be expected to achieve higher grades due to her dedication and hard work. It is important to note that the option (b). Amy mostly got C grades in their classes, wouldn't be suitable to describe the outcome of Amy's diligence in studying. A diligent person would generally be associated with better grades, such as A's and B's, due to their commitment to doing well academically. In conclusion, the sentence would read: \\"Rebecca was very lax with their studying in school while Amy was very diligent. Rebecca mostly got C grades in their classes.\\" This sentence effectively illustrates the contrast between Rebecca's and Amy's approaches to studying, as well as the possible consequences of their respective attitudes towards academic performance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I attended a boarding school for badly behaved children and it had its fair share of bullies who had been expelled from mainstream schools. But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control. On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief. Last year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye. It seems he became a hopeless heroin addict at some point and had died in his flat on an overdose of prescription drugs and smack. I felt sad when I read it but I couldn’t work out why.

Dominica is a small island country located in the Caribbean region's Lesser Antilles archipelago. It is situated between the French territories of Guadeloupe to the north and Martinique to the south. The island is known for its lush rainforest, stunning waterfalls, and unique volcanic features. Roseau can be found on the island's southwestern coast, and it serves as the heart of Dominica's government, commerce, and cultural activities. The history of Roseau dates back to the early colonization of the Caribbean by European powers. The city was initially founded by the French during the late 1600s and named after the nearby Roseau River. Over the centuries, Roseau changed hands multiple times between France and Great Britain, with the British ultimately gaining permanent control in 1815. The island gained independence from Britain on November 3, 1978, and since then, Roseau has played an essential role in the development of an independent Dominica. Although Roseau is not a very large city, it does offer a variety of amenities and attractions for visitors. Some of the notable sites in Roseau include: 1. The Dominica Museum: located in the center of Roseau, this museum features exhibits on the history, culture, and natural environment of the island. 2. The Old Market of Roseau: a historic market square surrounded by 18th-century buildings, where visitors can find local crafts, fresh produce, and other items. 3. The Roseau Cathedral: a prominent Catholic church built in the Gothic and Romanesque styles, it is an important center for spiritual life on the island. 4. The Botanical Gardens: a large park offering a variety of flora and fauna native to Dominica, as well as a sanctuary for the country's national bird, the Imperial Amazon parrot. 5. Morne Bruce: a hill overlooking Roseau that provides incredible views of the city, harbor, and surrounding landscape. In addition to these attractions, Roseau is known for its lively colorful markets, local shops, and delicious Caribbean cuisine offered in various restaurants and street vendors. The city's port is also a popular destination for cruise ships, bringing a constant flow of tourists eager to explore the beautiful island of Dominica. As the gateway to Dominica's natural wonders, Roseau plays an essential role in the island's tourism industry. Visitors who come to explore Dominica's pristine rainforest, volcanic features, and unique attractions often begin their adventures in Roseau, making it an integral part of the island's vibrant history, culture, and economic development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As a result, he comes to believe that vampires never existed.Charley, along with his new girlfriend, Alex Young (Traci Lind), go to visit Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), who is again a burnt-out vampire killer on Fright Night much to the chagrin of the boy-who-cried-wolf Charley. It is while visiting Peter's apartment that Charley sees four coffins being taken into a car. On the way out from Peter's apartment, Charley sees four strange people walk past him, into an elevator.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"No effect. The question seems to have a typo or confusion - it appears to refer to a \\"heating element\\" which is unrelated to the owl hunting process described. Assuming the question intends to discuss some kind of heating source or external heat, it's worth noting that owls rely primarily on their sensitive hearing and keen vision to find and hunt prey at night. A heating element working properly would not have any significant impact on an owl's ability to sit still, locate prey through hearing, see prey in the dark, fly silently, or catch prey with its talons and beak.

Argument: \\"The fact is if you aren't military or a farmer, a gun is a toy and used in a recreational manner.\\" 1. The argument starts with the phrase \\"The fact is,\\" which implies that the following statement is a commonly accepted truth or a widely recognized fact. 2. The statement then provides two exceptions for owning a gun: being military personnel or a farmer. This acknowledges that there might be some legitimate, non-recreational reasons for owning a gun. 3. The argument continues with the claim that a gun is a \\"toy\\" when not used by military personnel or farmers. The use of the word \\"toy\\" here is likely intended to diminish the seriousness of owning a gun and suggest that non-professional uses of guns are more for entertainment than anything else. 4. Finally, the statement concludes that guns are \\"used in a recreational manner\\" when not owned by military personnel or farmers. This implies that the purpose of owning a gun outside of those professional contexts is mainly for fun and leisure activities. By examining the argument step by step, we can see that it presents a clear and interpretable claim on the topic of gun control, which is that guns serve a mainly recreational purpose for people who are not military personnel or farmers. This argument could be used in a broader discussion on gun control as a premise or conclusion. Therefore, we can determine that the argument is valid."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a question about the following article: After the rise of Young Turks to power through their 1908 revolution, they began imposing a more centralized system of rule across the Ottoman Empire. This meant to put an end to local particularism, which was seen first in the violent suppression of the Hauran Druze Rebellion in Syria in 1909. During the Syrian rebellion, the Ottomans succeeded in suppressing the Jabal Druze revolt after conquering the villages, forcibly registering villagers and disarming them, collecting taxes in cash or cattle, and conscripting 1000 men into the Ottoman army. Ottoman governor Sami Pasha al-Faruqi wanted to apply same measures in Transjordan: villages in Ajlun were encircled by 400 Ottoman soldiers who disarmed the villagers and took 85 conscripts. Governmental troops in Al-Salt and Madaba issued identity papers as a prelude to conscription. Sami Pasha sent a telegram on 6 November 1910 from Jabal Druze to the Al-Karak Mutasarrıf Muhemet Tahir Pasha, requesting that the residents of the town demonstrate their loyalty to the Empire by ceding their weapons and submitting to personal registration. This was seen differently by the local population; measures of disarmament and conscription. The Mutasarrıf conveyed the message to the residents, who responded by requesting that they be allowed to keep their weapons for protection against Bedouin raiders. Sami Pasha assured them that the state would only conduct registration of people and lands but sent a large number of troops into the area, undermining his credibility.","output":"What were the consequences of the centralized system of rule imposed by the Young Turks after their 1908 revolution on local particularism in the Ottoman Empire, particularly in the violent suppression of the Hauran Druze Rebellion in Syria in 1909 and the subsequent measures taken by Ottoman governor Sami Pasha al-Faruqi in Transjordan, including the encirclement of villages, disarmament and conscription of village residents, and the issuing of identity papers as a prelude to conscription, especially in the context of Sami Pasha's telegram requesting the residents of the town of Al-Karak to demonstrate loyalty to the Empire by ceding their weapons and submitting to personal registration, and how did these actions impact the local population's perception of the Ottoman Empire, particularly with regard to their requests to retain their weapons for protection against Bedouin raiders and the subsequent deployment of a large number of Ottoman troops into the area?"},{"instruction":"Question: The message was short.

Question: \\"When was an aircraft carrier sunk?\\"  Context: \\"The aircraft carrier dramatically changed naval combat in World War II, because air power was becoming a significant factor in warfare. The advent of aircraft as focal weapons was driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. They had higher range and precision than naval guns, making them highly effective. The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940 when HMS Illustrious launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at their base in Taranto, signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers. World War II in the Pacific Ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets. The 1941 Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of HMS Glorious by German battleships during the Norwegian campaign in 1940.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"An aircraft carrier was sunk during the Norwegian campaign in 1940, specifically HMS Glorious, which was sunk by German battleships.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A boy who aimed a laser pointer from a toy at the rearview mirror inside a public bus in Germany permanently damaged the retina of the bus driver's right eye, a new case report reveals.      The boy was playing with a laser pointer while sitting about 50 feet (15 meters) away from the driver, according to the case report. When the child pointed the laser at the rearview mirror inside the bus, a beam of red light emitted by the toy reflected off the mirror and into the eye of the 44-year-old bus driver, according to a report published online Oct. 5 in the journal BMJ Case Reports.      Laser pointers are handheld, penlike devices typically used in lectures and business presentations to emphasize information. They are also used by astronomy buffs to point out planets and stars in the sky, and the devices are present in some children's toys as well.      The boy's laser was part of a toy, and initially, the light caused blurred vision in the bus driver's right eye. After this blurriness had continued for six months, the driver sought help from an eye doctor.      After examining the driver, an ophthalmologist diagnosed a subtle but detectable injury to the macula, an area near the center of the retina that is responsible for central vision. However, the vision in the driver's left eye remained normal. [9 Odd Ways Your Tech Devices May Injure You]      The driver had looked into the rearview mirror about three or four times, to try to identify the passenger who was holding the laser, causing additional exposure that increased his chances for an eye injury, the report said.      This is the first reported case of retinal injury caused by the laser beam of a toy, the doctors wrote in the man's case report.      Laser dangers      The light from a laser beam, even if it is reflected off a mirror, can be absorbed by pigmented structures within the retina that can generate heat, and cause a tiny burn, said Dr. Vincent Patalano, chief of ophthalmology at Cambridge Health Alliance and an assistant professor of ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School in Boston, who was not involved in the case. That tiny burn can destroy a small area of the retina, which damages the central part of a person's visual field, he said.      Although lasers can be used to treat some vision problems, such as the damage to the retina that sometimes occurs in people with diabetes, patients are told to never stare directly at the light, and the laser is used for a very short time, Patalano told Live Science.      The light that lasers emit has several properties that can make it dangerous to unprotected eyes. Laser-produced light stays together in one narrow path, and it is focused on one small point, Patalano said. Laser light is also one color, and the eyes are more sensitive to certain colors of light than others, he said. In this case, though, the laser was red, which is not as harmful to the eyes as blue or green lasers, he said.      The intensity of laser light also makes a difference, Patalano said. Although the exact energy output of the boy's toy laser pointer was not known, it was likely a low-energy laser, the case report said.      There's not much that can be done to correct this type of vision damage, Patalano said. It's not clear why the laser affected the man's right eye only, but it could be that the beam reflected at a slightly different angle in each eye, Patalano suggested.      There have been other reported incidents of laser pointers being misused, causing eye problems or putting people at risk of injury. According to a report by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), fans have disrupted sporting events by aiming laser pointers at athletes, and people have shined laser pointers at airplanes or helicopters. This is a federal crime in the United States because the glare can temporarily blind pilots, making it difficult for them to safely fly and land an aircraft.      Pilots reported about 3,900 laser incidents to the FAA in 2014, and nearly 4,000 of them in 2013, according to the agency.      The case report authors conclude by recommending that because kids are unlikely to understand the possible risks of lasers, children should not be allowed to use the devices.

Here we present the first case of retinal injury caused by the laser beam of a toy laser pointer operated by a school boy and directed via the rear-view mirror of a bus into the eye of the driver. This case emphasises the great importance of cautious and appropriate use of low-energy laser pointers. Laser pointers of any class should not be made available to children because they are unlikely to understand the risks of such lasers when using them in play.      Previous Section Next Section Case presentation A 44-year-old public bus driver who was previously healthy with a full bilateral best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 1.0 (20/20) was exposed to the laser beam of a toy laser pointer handled by a school boy (figure 1B) from a distance of about 16.5 m (figure 1A). The beam was reflected in the inside rear-view mirror of the bus, and the driver stared into the laser light several times in order to locate the person holding the laser. Immediately after this exposure the driver complained of blurred vision in his right eye that had persisted for 6 months when the first complete ophthalmological examination was carried out.

(D) Maximum allowed exposure time to a laser with an optical power of 1 and 5 mW.11 The maximum permissible power density of laser beams versus exposure time for various wavelengths is shown in figure 1C, while the maximum allowed exposure time of a laser pointer with output powers of 1 and 5 mW is shown in figure 1D. Upon presentation, the driver's BCVA was 0.8 OD and 1.0 OS. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy revealed no abnormalities in the anterior segment of either eye. Intraocular pressure was normal. Dilated ophthalmoscopy revealed barely visible retinal pigment epithelium disturbances within the temporal macula of his right eye (figure 2A) and no pathological changes in his left eye (figure 2B). A paracentral scotoma extended at up to 25° of eccentricity in his right eye (figure 2H,J), with a normal visual field in his left eye (figure 2I,K). Optical coherence tomography revealed spot-like retinal pigment epithelium disturbances temporal to the fovea of the right eye (figure 2G), with no abnormalities in his left eye (not shown). Infrared and autofluorescence images of both eyes showed normal macula patterns (figure 2C–F). Visual evoked potentials were normal and identical in both eyes (figure 2L). However, multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) showed paracentral focal disturbances with altered sum peak in the right eye (figure 2M). The mfERG of his left eye was normal (figure 2N).

Previous Section Next Section Global health problem list The subjective complaints and objective ophthalmological findings of this patient were consistent and strongly suggested that the repetitive exposure of the eye to the reflected laser spot 6 months previously had caused subtle but detectable injury to the macula. Although the exact energy of the handheld laser pointer was not determined, the descriptions and reports of those involved suggested that it was a class II or class 3R laser device (1 or 5 mW). In addition, the bus driver had looked at least three or four times into the mirror in order to locate the laser source, implying that he had received a minimum of least 10 s of cumulative exposure to the laser beam. Most cases of laser-induced maculopathies are based on accidental exposure to high-energy class IV lasers with laboratory, medical, recreational,1–3 or civil and military applications.4 Lower-energy class IIIa lasers pose little risk of retinal damage5 when used properly, but there are case reports of retinal damage caused by direct exposure to class IIIa commercial laser pointers,6–9 and to higher-energy class IIIb laser pointers.8–10 The risk of damage to the retina varies with the energy of the laser device and the duration and number of exposures. Repeated exposure to a low-energy green laser pointer can result in maculopathy and delayed choroidal neovascularisation.4 Handheld laser pointers typically have output energies in the range of 1–5 mW; the output power of toy laser pointers is limited to 1 mW. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"A boy was playing with a laser pointer toy on a bus in Germany when he accidentally aimed the laser at the rearview mirror.

Possible answers: (i) no; (ii) yes;","output":"To determine if these two sentences convey the same information, let's analyze them step-by-step. 1. Compare the primary responsibilities mentioned in each sentence:    - Sentence 1 states that SWAs are responsible for urban water supply.    - Sentence 2 states that SWAs are responsible for rural water supply. 2. Compare the secondary responsibilities mentioned in each sentence:    - Sentence 1 states that in some countries, SWAs are also responsible for rural water supply.    - Sentence 2 states that in some states, SWAs are also responsible for urban water supply. 3. Analyze the differences and similarities between the sentences:    - The primary responsibility mentioned in Sentence 1 is different from that mentioned in Sentence 2.    - The secondary responsibilities mentioned in Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 are connected to their respective primary responsibilities (urban/rural water supply).    - Both sentences mention that SWAs can have additional responsibilities in some places (countries in Sentence 1; states in Sentence 2). From this analysis, we can conclude that the two sentences do not convey the same information, as they mention different primary responsibilities for SWAs.

A navy of 10,000 vessels, including Pecheneg allies, landed on the Bithynian coast and devastated the Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus. The attack was well-timed, perhaps due to intelligence, as the Byzantine fleet was occupied with the Arabs in the Mediterranean, and the bulk of its army was stationed in the east. The Rus’ burned towns, churches, and monasteries, butchering the people and amassing booty. The emperor arranged for a small group of retired ships to be outfitted with Greek fire throwers and sent them out to meet the Rus’, luring them into surrounding the contingent before unleashing the Greek fire. Liutprand of Cremona wrote that \\"the Rus', seeing the flames, jumped overboard, preferring water to fire. Some sank, weighed down by the weight of their breastplates and helmets; others caught fire.\\" Those captured were beheaded. The ploy dispelled the Rus’ fleet, but their attacks continued into the hinterland as far as Nicomedia, with many atrocities reported as victims were crucified and set up for use as targets. At last a Byzantine army arrived from the Balkans to drive the Rus' back, and a naval contingent reportedly destroyed much of the Rus' fleet on its return voyage (possibly an exaggeration since the Rus' soon mounted another attack). The outcome indicates increased military might by Byzantium since 911, suggesting a shift in the balance of power. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): What year was the Rus fleet defeated?","output":"The Rus' fleet was defeated in the year 941, when they led another major attack on Constantinople.

The Fox Wars were two conflicts between the French and the Fox  Indians that occurred in the Great Lakes region  from 1712 to 1733. These territories are known today as the states of Michigan and Wisconsin in the United States. The Wars exemplified colonial warfare in the transitional space of New France, occurring within the complex system of alliances and enmities with native peoples and colonial plans for expansion. The Fox controlled the Fox River system. This river was vital for the fur trade between French Canada and the North American interior, because it allowed river travel from Green Bay in Lake Michigan to the Mississippi River. The French wanted the rights to use the river system to gain access to both the Mississippi and trade contacts with tribes to the west. The wars claimed thousands of lives and initiated a slave trade whereby Fox Indians were captured by native allies of New France and then sold as slaves to the French colonial population.:54 Indeed, alliances between the French and other native groups  as well as those between the Fox and other native groups  were an important aspect of the Wars, influencing every stage of the conflicts, including the causes, the fighting and the conclusion.:54 The First Fox War  began with inter-alliance violence and ended with the surrender of a large group of Fox and the subsequent peace deal.:63:169 As was custom, peace offerings required the exchange of goods and of prisoners to account for those who died in the conflict, acknowledging the importance of this exchange for establishing peace.:64 The Second Fox War  was far more destructive than the first, and ended with the near annihilation of the Fox population.:169 Answer this question: How many years did the conflicts occur between the French and the Fox Indians in the Great Lakes?","output":"The conflicts between the French and the Fox Indians in the Great Lakes region, known as the Fox Wars, occurred over a period of approximately 21 years, from 1712 to 1733."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Evaluate the options – I will assess each option to see if it aligns with the situation described in the question. - meditate: While meditation can lead to a heightened sense of awareness, it typically focuses on mental clarity and does not involve seeing things that do not exist. - medicated: Being medicated suggests that someone is taking medication, which may alter their perception, but it is not necessarily connected to trances or seeing nonexistent things. - confusion: Confusion is a state of being uncertain or unclear, but it does not inherently involve seeing things that do not exist. - epilepsy: Epilepsy is a neurological disorder causing seizures, which may sometimes lead to altered perception, but it is not specifically about seeing things that do not exist during trances. - hallucination: A hallucination involves seeing, hearing, or feeling something that does not exist or is not present.

Please answer the following question: Of course, the most unforgettable classmate I had was also the most vicious bully. I attended a boarding school for badly behaved children and it had its fair share of bullies who had been expelled from mainstream schools. But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control. On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief. Last year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye. It seems he became a hopeless heroin addict at some point and had died in his flat on an overdose of prescription drugs and smack. I felt sad when I read it but I couldn’t work out why. Maybe it was because my brother died in the same manner? He was certainly a character, an absolute nutter and ruthless bully who had everyone fearing him. Most definitely the most unforgettable classmate. Why were the students happy to see the bully gone? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. Because the bully farts  B.

Possible answers: clumsy, stealthy, invincible The answer to this question is:","output":"Stealthy Based on the given context, it would be most appropriate to describe Casey as stealthy. When someone is able to rob a bank and remain at large without being seen, they have successfully demonstrated their ability to move and act covertly and skillfully to avoid detection. This effectively highlights Casey's stealth-like qualities. By definition, stealthy refers to someone who can move or act in a secretive, quiet, or unnoticeable manner, often to carry out a plan without attracting attention or being detected. In the context of a bank robbery, being stealthy would require a high level of skill, planning, and adaptability. It would involve careful consideration of how to bypass security systems, surveillance cameras, and even law enforcement, all while remaining undetected by eyewitnesses. To successfully carry out the robbery and remain unseen, Casey would have had to carefully plan each move before the heist took place. This may have involved getting access to detailed information about the bank's layout, security features, and employees' schedules. He likely had to conceal his identity and potentially use a variety of tools and disguises to avoid being recognized. Moreover, Casey might have employed advanced techniques to circumvent security measures, such as hacking into the bank's systems or using specialized devices to access secure areas. The fact that he remained unseen also suggests that he successfully evaded the police and managed to escape without leaving any traceable evidence behind. In contrast, a clumsy individual would have likely made mistakes during the robbery attempt, resulting in their swift apprehension or injury. Furthermore, the term invincible does not accurately describe Casey, as it implies an unbeatable or untouchable quality. In this situation, it is more about Casey's skill and precision, rather than being resistant to harm. In conclusion, the most accurate description for Casey based on the given context would be stealthy. His exceptional skills in evading detection and successfully robbing a bank without being seen signify a high level of expertise and secrecy necessary for achieving such a daring and complex endeavor."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But the \\" bootleg \\" ones got stuck at my calve . Why did n't both jeans fit ?","output":"The text implies that the jeans didn't fit because they have different cuts or styles: \\"flare\\" and \\"bootleg\\". From the information provided we can infer as follows: 1) The user ordered 2 pairs of jeans from OldNavy, one with a \\"flair\\" leg cut and the other with a \\"bootleg\\" cut. 2) Upon trying them on, they found that the jeans with a \\"flair\\" leg cut fit them properly. 3) However, the \\"bootleg\\" cut jeans did not fit as they got stuck at the user's calf. Given this, despite both jeans being size 18 regular, the \\"bootleg\\" jeans didn't fit because this style must be narrower or tighter around the calf area, compared to the \\"flair\\" style. This suggests the \\"bootleg\\" cut is not suitable for the user's body shape, particularly their calf size, even though the size 18 is correct in other aspects. So, the conclusion would be that the different cut of the jeans is causing the fit issue, not the waist size or overall size of the jeans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

During its formative period, the term madrasah referred to a higher education institution, whose curriculum initially included only the \\"religious sciences\\", whilst philosophy and the secular sciences were often excluded. The curriculum slowly began to diversify, with many later madaris teaching both the religious and the \\"secular sciences\\", such as logic, mathematics and philosophy. Some madaris further extended their curriculum to history, politics, ethics, music, metaphysics, medicine, astronomy and chemistry. The curriculum of a madrasah was usually set by its founder, but most generally taught both the religious sciences and the physical sciences. Madaris were established throughout the Islamic world, examples being the 9th century University of al-Qarawiyyin, the 10th century al-Azhar University (the most famous), the 11th century Niẓāmīyah, as well as 75 madaris in Cairo, 51 in Damascus and up to 44 in Aleppo between 1155 and 1260.

The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) has said the fish kill stretches over several kilometres. A department spokesman said the cause is \\"suspected to be silage effluent\\". Anglers reported dead fish in two separate locations on the river. One near Claudy village, the other much further downstream at Campsie, close to where the Faughan runs into the River Foyle. The Loughs Agency said it was investigating whether there were two separate pollution events, or both were part of the same one. Norman Henderson, from the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA), said it would take many months for the river to recover. \\"I've seen worse fish kills but this would be towards the top end,\\" he said. \\"It's a significant kill, there's no doubt about that. The latest figures we're getting from the Loughs Agency is several thousand dead fish,\\" said Mr Henderson. \\"We believe it is agricultural and we have narrowed it down to a particular part of the river and we are following a definite line of inquiry. \\"It would obviously have to be a fairly strong effluent, something like silage.\\" But there was no risk to public health, said Mr Henderson, who is a senior scientific officer with the NIEA. \\"The river is safe in the sense that it has affected the fish but there is no risk to drinking water,\\" he said. \\"The river will recover, its difficult to put an exact timescale on it but you're certainly talking many months or possibly longer before the river is back to normal. \\"Certainly the overall stocks in the river will still have taken a hit.\\" The River Faughan is an important waterway for breeding salmon. It also contains sea trout, trout, lamprey, eel and many other fish species. East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell has written to the Environment Minister Michelle McIlveen seeking answers. \\"This is a major pollution tragedy on the Faughan which is a well-known salmon and trout river in the North West for anglers,\\" he said. \\"The wider implications on this major fish kill for future generations of fish stock cannot be underestimated and it is imperative that the source of the pollution is found as soon as possible to minimise further losses.\\" Sinn FÃ©in MLA Caoimhe Archibald asked whether enough was being done to prevent such incidents. \\"This incident needs to be fully investigated, those responsible must be held accountable and brought before the courts,\\" she said. \\"The penalties imposed for incidents such as this should be as severe as the law allows. \\"At times the fines are not a sufficient deterrent and do not match the damage being done to the environment.\\" SDLP MLA for East Londonderry Gerry Mullan described the scene as like \\"something out of a horror movie.\\" \\"The news that in excess of 1,000 fish near Claudy have been killed is deeply disturbing, with eyewitness reports that this was like something out of a horror movie,\\" said Mr Mullan. \\"Causing water pollution is a criminal offence and whoever is behind this must be brought before the courts,\\" he said. \\"It is unclear how long it will take before the stretch of water recovers. I will be seeking a full report from the environment minister on this shocking situation.\\"","output":"A lot of fish in a river called the River Faughan got really sick and died because something bad, like pollution from a farm, got into the water. It hurt the fish, but it didn't harm the water we drink. It will take a long time for the river to get better and have lots of fish again. People who care about the river want to find out what caused the pollution and make sure it doesn't happen again."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article:Fletcher Shipping, of Portlethen, owned four ships for leasing, with support in the past three years from the Scottish government-funded Scottish Loan Fund. It had two other ships on order for nearly £17m, using a loan from Santander bank. But it ran into cash flow problems early this year as the oil price fell. Administrators at PwC said the daily spot price for hiring offshore vessels dropped from £18,000 to only £3,000. Prices reflected oil production firms cutting costs and exploration. The administrators transferred Fletcher Shipping assets to a new company, FS Shipping, in a so-called 'pre-pack' deal. This was financed with £18m, raised through Grovepoint Capital. The main assets of Fletcher Shipping, founded in 2007, were the FS Pegasus, FS Aquarius, FS Pisces and FS Taurus. The pre-pack deal means the operations continue uninterrupted, while shareholders lose out and creditors only recover some of their lending to the collapsed firm. According to administrators, the transaction had no employment impact, as the vessels crews were contract staff working for other firms. Keith Fletcher, founder of Fletcher Shipping, said: \\"It is testament to the strong reputation of the crews and personnel at Fletcher Shipping that we have secured the confidence of new investors who have helped us recapitalise our business. \\"We have worked hard to keep our fleet working throughout the recent downturn in the North Sea - a downturn which has affected the vessel market more harshly than I have witnessed in 30 years of business. The Scottish Loan Fund is part of the Scottish Investment Bank, which is the investing arm of Scottish Enterprise, the Scottish government's economic development agency. The loan fund is run by Maven Capital to meet gaps in the market for funding company growth. Fletcher Shipping had a £5m investment from public funds over 2012 and 2013, as part of a consortium with the Royal Bank of Scotland and Maven Capital client funds. At the time of announcing the funding package, the head of the Scottish Investment Bank, Kerry Sharp, said: \\"Fletcher Shipping is exactly the kind of company the Scottish Loan Fund was established to support. It has excellent potential.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"Fletcher Shipping, a Scottish shipping company that owned four ships for leasing and had support from the Scottish government-funded Scottish Loan Fund, faced cash flow problems due to a drop in oil prices.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -54*c - 24 = -83*c + 37*c for c.","output":"The equation given is -54c - 24 = -83c + 37c. We begin to solve for 'c' in a step-by-step way as follows: First, simplify the equation. On the right side of the equation, there are two 'c' terms that could be combined (-83c and 37c).  Doing this gives: -54c - 24 = (-83c + 37c) which simplifies to: -54c - 24 = -46c. The next step is to isolate 'c' (the variable we're solving for) on one side of the equation. By doing this, we can find what 'c' should equal.  We can do this by adding 46c to both sides of the equation to eliminate -46c from the right: -54c + 46c - 24 = -46c + 46c which simplifies to: -8c - 24 = 0. Again to isolate 'c', add 24 to both sides of the equation: -8c = 24. Finally, to get 'c' alone, we divide each side by -8: c = 24 / -8. And that will bring us to the final answer: c = -3.  So, the solution to the equation -54c - 24 = -83c + 37c is c = -3."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: What has happened to ice if it is not ice any more? Possible A: vaporate, cool off, form crystals, melt, keep things cold  Why is \\"melt\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Melt\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for the given question because when ice loses its solid form and is no longer considered ice, it typically undergoes a process called melting. Melting is a phase transition in which a substance, in this case ice, changes from its solid state to its liquid state, which is water. This process typically occurs due to an increase in temperature, resulting in the breaking of intermolecular bonds that hold the ice in its solid structure. Analyzing the other possible answers: - Vaporate: This term is incorrect and probably refers to \\"evaporate.\\" Evaporation is the process where a substance changes from its liquid state to its gaseous state (e.g., water turning into water vapor). Since the question refers to \\"ice,\\" which is a solid, evaporation is not the right answer in this context.   - Cool off: Cooling off means to decrease in temperature. For ice (solid-state of water) to not be ice anymore, it needs to gain temperature and change phase, not lose it. So, this is not the correct answer. - Form crystals: Ice itself is a crystalline solid where the water molecules are arranged in a regular pattern. Ice already has a crystal structure, so forming crystals doesn't explain why it's not ice anymore. Hence, this answer is not aligned with the common-sense understanding of the situation. - Keep things cold: This option refers to a property or function of ice, rather than a transformation of it. Keeping things cold does not explain what has happened to the ice itself. Thus, \\"melt\\" is the answer that aligns with human common sense because it directly reflects the phase transition process that happens when ice is no longer ice."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Abu Bakr as-Siddiq 'Abdallah bin Abi Quhafah (Arabic: 'bw bkr lSdyq \`bd llh bn 'by qHf@; c. 573 CE - 22 August 634 CE), popularly known as Abu Bakr ('bw bkr), was a senior companion (Sahabi) and--through his daughter Aisha--the father-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Abu Bakr became the first openly declared Muslim outside Muhammad's family. Abu Bakr served as a trusted advisor to Muhammad. Abu Bakr attended the event of Ghadir Khumm, which took place a few months before Muhammad passed away. According to both Shia and Sunni sources, he was among the many who pledged allegiance to Ali at the event.  In Medina, after the Farewell Pilgrimage and the event of Ghadir Khumm, Muhammad ordered an army under the command of Usama bin Zayd. He commanded all the companions, except for his family, to go with Usama to Syria to avenge the Muslims' defeat at the Battle of Mu'tah. Muhammad gave Usama the banner of Islam on the 18th day of the Islamic month of Safar in the year 11 A.H. Abu Bakr and Umar were among those that Muhammad commanded to join Usama's army.  However, Abu Bakr and Umar resisted going under the command of Usama because they thought that he, who was 18 or 20 at the time, was too young to lead an army, despite Muhammad's teachings that age and standing in society did not necessarily correspond to being a good general.  In response to these worries, the Prophet said: \\"O Arabs! You are miserable because I have appointed Usama as your general, and you are raising questions if he is qualified to lead you in war. I know you are the same people who had raised the same question about his father. By God, Usama is qualified to be your general just as his father was qualified to be a general. Now obey his orders and go.\\" Whenever Muhammad felt any relief from his fatal sickness, he would inquire as to whether Usama's army had left for Syria yet, and would continue urging his companions to leave for Syria. Muhammad even said, \\"Usama's army must leave at once. May Allah curse those men who do not go with him.\\" However, while a few companions were ready to join Usama's army, many other companions, including Abu Bakr and Umar, disobeyed Muhammad's orders. It is also noted that this was the only battle expedition where Muhammad urged his companions to go the battle no matter what; for other battles, if someone was unable to go to the fight, Muhammad would let them stay at home.

Article: Americans often plan social gatherings on short notice, so don't be surprised if you get invited to someone's home or to see a movie or baseball game without much warning. If the time is convenient   for you, surely accept their invitation. But if you're busy, don't be afraid to _ the invitation, perhaps suggesting a time that would be better. Your host won't be shamed. Invitations are usually sent in person or over the telephone. The main exception  is for some formal occasions, in which case a written invitation will be mailed. You would normally receive a written invitation to a wedding . For a casual dinner invitation, don't arrive more than 5 minutes early, because your host may still be preparing for your visit. Arriving more than 10 minutes late is considered rude if very few people were invited. If many people were invited, it's OK to arrive a little late, even as much as half an hour late. For example, it's OK to arrive late for a party, for a potluck   dinner or for a social gathering inviting a large group of people. If you're invited for dinner, it's proper to bring the host a bottle of wine, a gift basket of fruit, a box of candy  , or a bouquet of flowers. Don't bring roses, as men often give roses to women on a date  . If you wish to thank the host for his or her hospitality  , it's right to call or send a brief   written thank-you note the next day.

The title of the review, \\"Seriously, this movie was awful!\\" clearly states the reviewer's negative opinion. The reviewer further explains the reason for their disappointment by stating that the script was too short and that the movie mainly consisted of people staring, which may indicate that the movie did not engage the viewer. Additionally, the reviewer mentions that there is nothing noteworthy, memorable, or enjoyable about the movie. The reviewer also comments that there was not enough story or dialogue to properly assess the acting quality. This implies that the acting in the movie was likely also disappointing to the reviewer but there was not sufficient material for a fair evaluation. Moreover, the review suggests that the plot of the movie was barely recognizable, and the critic was left feeling unimpressed and confused by the narrative of the movie. The critic even goes as far as to say that the main character may have been mentally challenged, which can be considered a strong negative remark.

Please briefly summarize this news article: AP case reflects larger government assault on press and privacy The Justice Department’s secret seizure of Associated Press reporters’ private telephone records is a slap in the face to a free press — and a free people. But it’s part of both a larger assault on the traditional function of the media by the Obama administration, as well as a broader government intrusion into the privacy of U.S. citizens. Under Obama, the government has pursued six cases against individuals suspected of handing over classified information, more than under all previous presidents combined, as the Associated Press pointed out. Meanwhile, disturbing news about the government’s ability and willingness to use electronic surveillance on Americans has continued to mount. It adds up to a chilling effect on citizens, journalists and potential whistleblowers, who rightly now must think twice about offering information concerning government misdeeds or secrets. That comes at an incredibly high cost for society. Whatever you think of the modern press — and I’ve got plenty of problems with it myself — it serves a critical function in bringing government wrongdoing out into the open. It holds officials, police and the military accountable for their actions in a way that nothing else can. It’s in our national interest to protect the media’s use of confidential sources, because too often people can only be honest and open about such matters under the cloak of anonymity. The Justice Department hasn’t provided details about its investigation that ensnared the Associated Press, but it appears to be related to a story the news wire published in May 2012 revealing the Central Intelligence Agency successfully thwarted an al-Qaida plot to blow up a United States-bound airliner. The Justice Department seems to have obtained records of outgoing calls for the work, personal and cell phone numbers of a handful of Associated Press reporters, including the ones involved in that story. The records also included calls coming from the general AP office numbers in several cities. So far, it doesn’t seem the conversations themselves were monitored. The Justice Department’s own rules require that subpoenas for the telephone records of journalists be as narrowly drawn as possible, and sought only after all other possibilities for finding the information it’s seeking are exhausted. The first clearly didn’t happen; the details concerning the second part are still unclear. “There can be no possible justification for such an overbroad collection of the telephone communications of The Associated Press and its reporters,” wrote Associated Press Chief Executive Gary Pruitt in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder. “These records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the news gathering activities undertaken by the A.P. during a two-month period, provide a road map to A.P.’s news gathering operations, and disclose information about A.P.’s activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know.” Even if you’re not outraged by the government’s latest intrusion into the privacy of the press, consider its ongoing intrusions into your own. In the years since the terrorist attack of 9/11, the United States has edged ever closer to a surveillance state, as the National Security Agency engaged in warrantless wiretapping and eavesdropped in secret rooms at the switching centers of AT&T and others. Using open records requests, the ACLU last year found that police departments routinely track personal cell phones, often without warrants. A subsequent congressional inquiry found that cellular carriers responded to at least 1.3 million such requests for subscriber records last year, a notable increase based on carriers that provided figures from earlier years. Also in 2012, Wired reported that the NSA is building a massive, 2 billion data center in Utah to mine and analyze vast amounts of personal data and communications crisscrossing the Internet. “Flowing through its servers and routers and stored in near-bottomless databases will be all forms of communication, including the complete contents of private e-mails, cell phone calls, and Google searches, as well as all sorts of personal data trails — parking receipts, travel itineraries, bookstore purchases, and other digital ‘pocket litter,’ ” the magazine reported. “It is, in some measure, the realization of the ‘total information awareness’ program created during the first term of the Bush administration — an effort that was killed by Congress in 2003 after it caused an outcry over its potential for invading Americans’ privacy.” A former FBI counterterrorism agent divulged even more shocking information earlier this month. Tim Clemente was asked in a CNN interview whether the government could review earlier telephone conversations between the late Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his widow, Katherine Russell, to determine if she had any involvement in the crime. “There is a way,” he said. “We certainly have ways in national security investigations to find out exactly what was said in that conversation. It’s not necessarily something that the FBI is going to want to present in court, but it may help lead the investigation.” “All of that stuff,” he continued after the next question, “is being captured as we speak whether we know it or like it or not.” That seems to suggest that the government can record or access recordings all of our phone calls. It sounds far-fetched; it sounds downright Orwellian. But I, for one, would certainly like to know if it’s true. That strikes me as a far bigger crime — and something much more worthy of an aggressive investigation — than a phone call between a government staffer and a reporter.

Inspired by John Simon's production of Leonard Cohen's album Songs of Leonard Cohen, Boyd was keen that Drake's voice would be recorded in a similar close and intimate style, \\"with no shiny pop reverb\\". He sought to include a string arrangement similar to Simon's, \\"without overwhelming ... or sounding cheesy\\". To provide backing, Boyd enlisted various contacts from the London folk rock scene, including Fairport Convention guitarist Richard Thompson and Pentangle bassist Danny Thompson (no relation).

Initial recordings did not go well: the sessions were irregular and rushed, taking place during studio downtime borrowed from Fairport Convention's production of their Unhalfbricking album. Tension arose as to the direction of the album: Boyd was an advocate of George Martin's approach of \\"using the studio as an instrument\\", while Drake preferred a more organic sound. Dann has observed that Drake appears \\"tight and anxious\\" on bootleg recordings from the sessions, and notes a number of Boyd's unsuccessful attempts at instrumentation.

Uncommon Danger is the second novel by British thriller writer Eric Ambler, published in 1937. In his autobiography, \\"Here Lies\\", Ambler explains the original title was \\"Background To Danger\\", but his British publisher disliked the word 'background', so it was published in all English-speaking countries except the US as \\"Uncommon Danger\\". Can we infer the following? Uncommon Danger was a book written in the 1940's Options are: *Yes. *It's impossible to say. *No. The answer is:","output":"*No. The statement that \\"Uncommon Danger was a book written in the 1940s\\" is incorrect. As per your details, Uncommon Danger is a novel written by British thriller writer Eric Ambler, and it was published in 1937. Therefore, the book was not written in the 1940s, but in the late 1930s. It was initially titled \\"Background To Danger,\\" but the title was changed to \\"Uncommon Danger\\" by Ambler's British publisher. This indicates that the book was not only written but also published before the 1940s.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"Yes, the hypothesis is indeed entailed by the premise. Entailment in the context of natural language processing and linguistics refers to the relationship between two sentences where the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of the other, regardless of the specific context.  In this case, the premise \\"But he got no pleasure from it\\" has an implication that the individual being referred to found no satisfaction, enjoyment, or positive emotional value from an activity, event, or thing. The hypothesis \\"He didn't find any pleasure in it\\" is simply a rephrase of the same idea, indicating that the same person found the event, object, or situation to be devoid of pleasurable qualities.  Both sentences express the same idea using different syntactical structures. The premise entails the hypothesis because if it is true that he had no pleasure, then it follows that he didn't find any pleasure. In both cases, pleasure is lacking in the situation or object being referred to. In other words, if the premise is true, it would be impossible for the hypothesis to be false, which is the fundamental concept of entailment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has unveiled a far-reaching list of demands for any new nuclear deal with Iran, and threatened economy-crushing sanctions if Tehran does not change its behavior.  The 12-point list of demands came in a Monday speech at the conservative Heritage Foundation that laid out the Trump administration's strategy after pulling out of the Iran nuclear agreement earlier this month.  Under any new deal, Pompeo insisted, Iran must indefinitely abandon nuclear weapons work and provide United Nations inspectors access to sites anywhere in the country.He said Tehran must also end its proliferation of ballistic missiles and stop its \\"destabilizing activities\\" across the Middle East.  If Iran does not change course, the U.S. \\"will apply unprecedented financial pressure,\\" Pompeo warned.  \\"These will be the strongest sanctions in history by the time we are done,\\" said Pompeo. \\"The [Iranian] regime has been fighting all over the Middle East for years. After our sanctions come into full force, it will be battling to keep its economy alive.\\"  Iran's President Hassan Rouhani dismissed the threats.  \\"Who are you to decide for Iran and the world?\\" Rouhani said in a statement published by Iranian state media on Monday. \\"The world today does not accept that the United States decides for the world.

Dieter Bohlen, Germany's notorious composer and producer of slightly trashy pop hits like \\"You're my heart, you're my soul\\" felt the need to tell his story - and gracefully he decided to hire a ghost writer. The result was a funny book about his life. Well, more or less a fuzzy image of it. He didn't deny that he is a selfish asshole but the whole story was twisted to fit his image of himself. No word that he has probably beaten up his former wife and she ended up in hospital. However it was written in a funny style and a huge success after his appearance as jury member of the German version of \\"American Idol\\" - especially his unforgettable comments. This should be the end of the story - really. In the hype of the mentioned \\"Idol\\" TV show called \\"Deutschland sucht den Superstar\\" (abbreviated DSDS) somebody must have come up with the terrible idea to make a movie out of the book. The result is \\"Dieter - der Film\\" I have rarely seen a movie which tries so desperately to be funny and fails so completely. None of the gags really hits the point. Naddel's voice and style of talking was getting on my nerves right away although Verona's voice should have done that more. Obvious, childish, predictable and lengthy gags destroy any motivation to watch this movie to the end within a few minutes. The content of the movie is a sloppy film adaption written sloppily down by a ghost writer based on Bohlen's sloppy idealized memory. They could have used this freedom to do almost everything. It was supposed to be a satire, but they failed. The story is totally uninteresting and the fact that the background voice is Bohlen himself guarantees that the whole film has nothing satirical at all. It's no wonder that it was considered to bad for a cinema release. The probability that this thing would have rotten in some archive was quite high until recently when the current season of DSDS turned out to be a mediocre success. With the \\"friendly\\" help of Germany's biggest yellow press newspaper \\"BILD\\" and the desperate situation for the TV station RTL to have something in the program while the still unbeatable show \\"Wetten dass... ?\\" is running on Channel 2 the movie finally arrived in television - unfortunately.

Now, these authorities are stripped of justice,\\" a protester tells the BBC. A state of emergency could involve the use of the army, the BBC notes. Meanwhile, protests have extended into areas that had been bastions of support for President Viktor Yanukovich, the New York Times reports. The latest demonstrations follow the president's offer to make opposition leaders Arseniy Yatsenyuk and Vitali Klitschko prime minister and deputy PM; they turned down the positions, with the Times noting that they share few beliefs outside of their stance against Yanukovich. Yesterday, thousands gathered in cities like Odessa, Zaporizhzhya, and Dnipropetrovsk; arrests and injuries were reported amid clashes with police. Four protesters were killed last week, and their funerals drew thousands. Expand this summary.","output":"Ukraine protesters, who largely back away from occupying the Justice Ministry building, did so after Ukraine's Justice Minister, Olena Lukash, threatened to call a state of emergency if the occupation continued. This occupation included barricading the building using bags of snow as a resistance technique. Reportedly, about 30 protesters still lingered in the premises, despite the warning. An unnamed protester claims that the seizure of the Ministry of Justice symbolizes an act of uprising by the people and strips the current authorities of justice. The significance of declaring a state of emergency is the potential involvement of the nation's armed forces. The protests in Ukraine have extended beyond the usual areas into regions that have been strongholds of support for President Viktor Yanukovich, as reported by the New York Times. One of the reasons for the latest round of demonstrations is the rejection of the President's offer to make opposition leaders, Arseniy Yatsenyuk and Vitali Klitschko, the prime minister and the deputy prime minister respectively. Despite their shared opposition to Yanukovich, the two leaders reportedly hold very few common beliefs; hence, they turned down the positions offered. In light of the escalation and expansion of the Ukraine protests, numerous cities such as Odessa, Zaporizhzhya, and Dnipropetrovsk have become hotspots for thousands of demonstrators. These events have witnessed clashes with the police, resulting in arrests and injuries. Last week, the situation turned deadly when four protesters were killed. Their funerals drew large crowds, escalating the tensions between the demonstrators and the government. The ongoing protests in Ukraine signify the fundamental disagreements and dissatisfaction of large segments of the population with the current government, led by President Viktor Yanukovich.

Which of the following was his average speed for this 2 hr period?","output":"Okay, let's break it down step by step: 1. First, we need to find out how many 3-minute sections are in a 2-hour period. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we have 2 hours x 60 minutes = 120 minutes. 2. Now we divide the total minutes (120) by the 3-minute sections, which will give us 120 minutes ÷ 3 minutes = 40 sections. 3. We know that Tobias passes a 1 km marker in every 3-minute section, and he completed 40 sections. So, he covered 40 sections x 1 km = 40 km in total. 4. Finally, we need to find out his average speed. To do this, we will divide the total distance (40 km) by the total time (2 hours). So, 40 km ÷ 2 hours = 20 km per hour.

Joshua, whose next test is against American Kevin Johnson on January 31, insisted he wants a significant step up. And after watching Fury dominate Chisora last weekend, he echoed his promoter Eddie Hearn’s calls for a high-profile domestic dust-up next year. Scroll down to watch Anthony Joshua square off with Kevin Johnson. Anthony Joshua (right) squares up to Kevin Johnson ahead of their heavyweight clash on January 31. Joshua will face the toughest test of his career against Johnson when they meet at the O2 in the new year. ‘I went to see Fury beat Chisora but there wasn’t much to see,’ Joshua said. ‘You can’t write off either but from an entertainment point it was poor. ‘But it’s done me good because the guys who went will say, “who’s next on the agenda?”. ‘I’m confident in my own ability that I could cause an upset and beat those guys. ‘But if I was to line them all up, David Haye is the one I would like to fight. He’s the best and when you fight the best it brings the best out in you. I need to step up, which is what we’re doing. I think we’re going to take some risky fights and I’m sure I’ll overcome them.’ Before that, however, Joshua must navigate a way past Johnson, who has never been stopped in his 36-fight career. He unsuccessfully challenged Vitali Klitschko for the world title in 2009 and has taken both Chisora and Fury the 12-round distance. Johnson took Vitali Klitschko the distance in their world title fight in 2009 and have never been stopped. But Joshua said: ‘Just because he’s never been stopped does not mean he’s a winner, it just means he goes in to survive. It should be a tough sparring session. If I can stop him, I’ve ticked a box and I move on. I’m confident I can. ‘I’ll train over Christmas; if I want to beat him I have to make the sacrifice. I don’t think he’ll train over Christmas or New Year. If I get the stoppage it’ll be because I’ve done the extra bits, if I don’t you know I’ll have been out raving!’ On a visit to London on Wednesday, Johnson challenged his younger opponent to a wager. He said: ‘I want to make an agreement. If Anthony knocks me out I’ll donate 50 per cent of my purse to one of his charities. And if he gets knocked out, he gives 50 per cent to my charity. Joshua is confident he would beat both Tyson Fury (left) and Dereck Chisora next year. Joshua also wants to fight David Haye (right) who has been out of action since beating Chisora in 2012. ‘There’s going to be a knockout so let’s up the ante.’ But Joshua said: ‘I do my charity work but I’ve got a professional job to do. I’ve seen boxers throw cash about but I want to leave that to one side.’ Before he returns to his gym in London, however, Joshua will spend 10 days in Cuba. He said: ‘I’m taking my gumshield to see if I can get some sparring. What an experience that would be. ‘I’ll start ticking over for this fight, get some sun on my back and some runs on the beach. Then I’ll come back feeling refreshed.’","output":"1. Anthony Joshua expresses confidence in defeating Tyson Fury, Dereck Chisora, and former world champion David Haye. 2.

The original text provided is written using capital letters for the beginning of each noun. Transforming the passage into lowercase affects not only the beginning of the sentence, but also all the other capitalized words. By converting the passage into lowercase, it creates a sense of uniformity throughout the sentence, resulting in easier readability. The passage itself describes the fleeting nature of positions such as royalty and military leadership. By comparing these high-ranking figures to locusts and grasshoppers in a metaphorical sense, the text conveys the idea that although these individuals have significant influence, their power is temporary and often solely dependent on external factors.  In this case, the external factor is the climate in which they inhabit - with the cold day representing a period of stability where they remain safely in their positions. However, once the sun arises, it disrupts this sense of security, forcing the locusts and grasshoppers to abandon their territory. The phrase \\"and their place is not known where they are\\" emphasizes the uncertainty and instability faced by these leaders. In a broader context, this can signify the transient nature of power and control in society, reflecting the idea that even seemingly invincible figures may eventually lose their status or influence due to altering circumstances. This theme is highly relevant in various contexts, from historical events to contemporary politics, reminding readers of the fickleness of power and the inevitable shifts that occur within societies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room! The ER doctor was able to sew my head up, and sent me home with a diagnosis of “syncope, unknown origin”. After a few hours, I still felt spacey, but insisted on going on the date. I remember we went to a nice Italian place on Federal Hill! Here’s the Garden City location, where I worked. Question: What did the waitress have to eat on her date?

Title: The Painted Veil Movie plot: On a brief trip back to London, earnest, bookish bacteriologist Walter Fane (Edward Norton) is dazzled by Kitty Garstin (Naomi Watts), a vivacious and vain London socialite. He proposes; she accepts (\\"only to get as far away from [her] mother as possible\\"), and the couple honeymoon in Venice. They travel on to Walter's medical post in Shanghai, where he is stationed in a government lab studying infectious diseases. They find themselves ill-suited, with Kitty much more interested in parties and the social life of the British expatriates. Kitty meets Charles Townsend (Liev Schreiber), a married British vice consul, and the two engage in a clandestine affair. When Walter discovers his wife's infidelity, he seeks to punish her by threatening to divorce her on the grounds of adultery, if she doesn't accompany him to a small village in a remote area of China. He has volunteered to treat victims of an unchecked cholera epidemic sweeping through the area. Kitty begs to be allowed to divorce him quietly, but he refuses, stating \\"Why should I put myself through the smallest trouble for you?\\" She hopes Townsend will leave his wife Dorothy and marry her. When she proposes this possibility to Charles, he declines to accept, despite earlier claiming to love Kitty. She is compelled to travel to the mountainous inland region with her husband. They embark upon an arduous, two-week-long overland journey, which would be considerably faster and much easier if they traveled by river, but Walter is determined to make Kitty as unhappy and uncomfortable as possible. Upon their arrival in Mei-tan-fu, she is distressed to discover they will be living in near squalor, far removed from everyone except their cheerful neighbor Waddington, a British deputy commissioner living with a young Chinese woman in relative opulence. Walter and Kitty barely speak to each other and, except for a cook and a Chinese soldier assigned to guard her, she is alone for long hours.

Q:Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: He was morally upright and knew he was strong, so who should he protect? Possible A: batman, diluted, fragile, regular, weak  Why is \\"weak\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Weak\\" as an answer is aligned with human common sense because it directly relates to the context and the essence of the question. Human common sense is a set of basic understanding and reasoning skills that are intuitive and shared among humans. It allows people to make decisions and judgments based on their experiences, knowledge, and perceptions of the world. In the given question, we are presented with the case of a morally upright individual who is aware of their strength. The natural thought process, according to human common sense, would be that they should use their strength to benefit and protect those who are in need or may be vulnerable. The principle of protecting the weak follows the moral standards and principles empathized by a majority of societies and cultures around the world. Let's evaluate the other possible answers in relation to human common sense: 1. Batman: Choosing Batman doesn't align with human common sense because Batman is a fictional character and is known to be a skilled and powerful superhero who is dedicated to protecting others. A morally upright and strong individual would not need to protect someone who is already capable of protecting themselves and others. 2. Diluted: This answer doesn't make sense in the context of the question, as \\"diluted\\" usually refers to reducing the concentration of a substance or quality. It does not align with human common sense as it is not a relevant term to describe whom someone should protect. 3. Fragile: Although \\"fragile\\" could also be a plausible choice because it implies the consideration of protecting vulnerable individuals, it does not convey the same directness and breadth that \\"weak\\" does. Fragile more specifically refers to physical frailty or delicacy, while \\"weak\\" can encompass physical, emotional, or situational vulnerabilities. Thus, \\"weak\\" aligns more closely with human common sense in this context. 4. Regular: This answer doesn't align with human common sense, as \\"regular\\" implies that the person is neither particularly vulnerable nor particularly strong. A morally upright and strong individual would prioritize protecting those in greater need or more susceptible to harm, rather than someone who can manage on their own. In conclusion, the answer \\"weak\\" aligns with human common sense because it directly addresses the need for a morally upright and strong individual to protect those who are vulnerable or unable to protect themselves, which is a core moral principle shared by many societies. The other answer choices either do not correlate with the context of the question or do not follow the same intuitive reasoning based on the moral responsibility of a strong person to protect the vulnerable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Against the supposition that forest fires in Alaska, Canada and Siberia warm the climate, scientists have discovered that cooling may occur in areas where burnt trees allow more snow to mirror more sunlight into space. This finding suggests that taking steps to prevent northern forest fires to limit the release of greenhouse gases may warm the climate in northern regions. Usually large fires destroyed forests in these areas over the past decade. Scientists predict that with climate warming, fires may occur more frequently over the next several centuries as a result of a longer fire season. Sunlight taken in by the earth tends to cause warming, while heat mirrored back into space tends to cause cooling. This is the first study to analyze all aspects of how northern fires influence climate. Earlier studies by other scientists have suggested that fire in northern regions speed up climate warming because greenhouse gases from burning trees and plants are released into the atmosphere and thus trap heat. Scientists found that right after the fire, large amounts of greenhouse gases entered the atmosphere and caused warming. Ozone  levels increased, and ash from the fire fell on far-off sea ice, darkening the surface and causing more radiation from the sun to be taken in. The following spring, however, the land within the area of the fire was brighter than before the fire, because fewer trees covered the ground. Snow on the ground mirrored more sunlight back into space, leading to cooling. \\"We need to find out all possible ways to reduce the growth of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\\" Scientists tracked the change in the amount of radiation entering and leaving the climate system as a result of the fire, and found a measurement closely related to the global air temperature. Typically, fire in northern regions occurs in the same area every 80 to 150 years. Scientists, however, found that when fire occurs more frequently, more radiation is lost from the earth and cooling results. Specifically, they determined when...

While the statement \\"they have thick fur\\" is true for many mammals, it is not an accurate answer to the question. The term \\"thick fur\\" describes the density of hair on a mammal's body; it does not identify the unique fiber itself. Something that can be auburn – a reddish-brown color – can be associated with hair found on mammals, but this description still does not directly answer the question about the specific fiber unique to mammals. Auburn is just a color, and hair color itself is not unique to mammals. The unique fiber found only in mammals is keratin, which is the structural protein that makes up hair, fur, nails, claws, horns, hooves, and other parts of mammals' bodies. It is only present in mammals and distinguishes them from other animals. Keratin is responsible for the strength, toughness, and durability of these structures. In conclusion, \\"they have thick fur\\" and \\"something that can be auburn\\" are related to the presence of hair on mammals, but they do not directly address the question that asks for the unique fiber found only in mammals.

Which reaction, reaction A or reaction B, will occur at a faster rate?  Demetrious is conducting chemical reactions for his community college chemistry laboratory course. In his first reaction, reaction A, he uses sodium oxide as the reactant in the form of small particles. In his second reaction, reaction B, he uses sodium oxide as the reactant in the form of large chunks of material. Both reactions use the same total weight of sodium oxide.  Hint: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants. A:","output":"In order to determine which reaction will occur at a faster rate, we need to consider the surface area of the reactant, sodium oxide, in both reactions.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A clever child from a loving middle class home, William Cornick was the most unlikely perpetrator of a crime that would shock Britain. As the 16-year-old was sentenced to life in prison after becoming the first pupil to kill a teacher in a British classroom, friends said they were stunned by his senseless stabbing of his teacher Ann Maguire. To the teacher in charge of his year he was ‘a delightful pupil who always gave his best’. Fellow pupils at Corpus Christi Catholic College said he was a just a ‘typical lad’ who rarely misbehaved. Scroll down for video. Killer: William Cornick was 15 years old when he stabbed his teacher Ann Maguire, 61, to death, as she taught a class at Corpus Christi Catholic College, in Leeds, in April. ‘He was probably the most intelligent person I knew,’ said Tom Smith, a former student. ‘But he was really quiet and kept himself to himself. He had his friends, but he wasn’t with them all the time. ‘You can look at someone and say “I don’t think they could do anything like that”. I’m still shocked. I didn’t think that in a school like Corpus such a thing could happen.’ Another unnamed student said: ‘He was like any other lad my age; he wasn’t a naughty kid. He was a typical, nice lad. It seems surreal how it’s changed.’ Cornick was no youth from a sink estate left to his own devices by a dysfunctional family. His mother Michelle, 48, is a human resources manager, who was said to be devoted to the teenager and his 19-year-old brother Zack, who is in a rock band. Stable life: Far from being having an unhappy upbringing, Cornick, depicted in a court sketch, comes from a middleclass background and his parents have been described as loving and supportive. Their father Ian is a 50-year-old council executive who lives with his partner and their young child in an upmarket village near Leeds. Although his parents divorced a decade ago, Cornick seemed to enjoy a happy home life. The life sentence handed down to the schoolboy who murdered a teacher was today condemned as too harsh by youth justice campaigners. Former magistrate Penelope Gibbs, who chairs the Standing Committee for Youth Justice umbrella group of charities and campaign groups, said the sentence was too long. She told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: ‘We are out of line with the whole of western Europe. There are no other countries within Western Europe which give children - and this boy is seen as a child under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and is in the youth justice system - who would give children a life sentence.’ Ms Gibbs accepted that the sentence had to serve as a punishment, but said there was ‘no evidence’ for the 20-year minimum tariff. ‘Punishment is also incredibly important, particularly for the victims and families, but the fact is, how many years do we need for punishment? We have given him a sentence which is more than his own lifetime,’ she said. ‘He was 15 when he did this crime and we would say that you don't need that long to punish. What is crucial is that when he is released he is assessed as no longer being of danger to himself and others and thus we would all be safer. 'But there is no evidence that that takes 20 years and we've looked and we think that this is the longest sentence given to a child in at least 10 years. I'm not going to tell you exactly what the right sentence would have been, but 20 years and a life sentence is too long.’ Paul Greaney, prosecuting, said there was nothing to indicate to the boy’s parents or teachers that he was capable of homicidal violence. He added that Mr and Mrs Cornick are ‘decent and responsible parents’ who have co- operated fully with the police. Mr Justice Coulson said Mr and Mrs Cornick were ‘responsible and caring parents and his family life was marked by love and support’. Cornick had never been in any trouble with the police and was one of the brightest students at Corpus Christi, passing five GCSE exams a year early. He was regarded as ‘amicable, enthusiastic and conscientious’ at school, with a 100 per cent attendance record. In the four years before the killing, five incidents of misbehaviour were recorded – two minor. Significantly, the final three took place two months before the murder and concerned his hatred of Mrs Maguire and dislike of Spanish lessons. But closer inspection of Cornick’s internet use revealed a different side to his apparently respectable image. As one pupil said: ‘The Grim Reaper was the first thing you saw on his [Facebook] page. ‘That corrected everyone’s opinion. [I thought] what the hell has happened, something has definitely gone wrong.’ Friends had begun to regard him as a ‘loner and weirdo’ and ‘disturbing’ aspects of his personality became apparent. He spoke openly about murdering his teacher, messaging a friend on Facebook about brutally killing her and spending the rest of his life in jail. He had numerous images of knives on his mobile phone. He also had a keen interest in ultra-violent video games, including Dark Souls II, in which players hack zombies to pieces. Players devour the souls of their fallen enemies to the sound of cries of agony. Disturbing images include a character made up of hundreds of human corpses. It was voted one of the ten Most Violent Video Games of 2014. One pupil recalled Cornick saying disgusting things at a party. He said: ‘He was saying twisted stuff like “imagine jumping on a pregnant woman and seeing the baby come out”, and saying horrible stuff about cancer and stuff like that. Loss: Ann Maguire's family, husband Don  and daughters Emma  and Kerry, stand outside Leeds Crown Court as a statement is read after the sentencing. ‘He was just saying it in conversation. He thought it was normal but it’s not. He wasn’t normal in the head.’ But for a long time Cornick had been able to hide his ‘anger’ from others by maintaining an appearance of normality. From game to real life: Will Cornick's Facebook photograph shows him wearing a gamer tshirt. The teenager later confessed to a psychiatrist that the killing had been on his mind for three years, and one expert said he had engaged in a ‘considerable amount of fantasy’ about killing Mrs Maguire. Psychiatrists decided he suffered from a personality disorder with psychopathic tendencies. It was of course too late, but the danger this previously anonymous teenager poses has now been revealed to all. John Kent, a forensic psychiatrist, said Cornick ‘presents a risk of serious harm to the public and that this risk is present for the foreseeable future’. Mr Greaney told Leeds Crown Court: ‘One of the most disturbing aspects of an extremely disturbing case is that [Cornick] not only lacks remorse but is proud of what he did in killing Mrs Maguire.’ The QC said Cornick told a psychiatrist: ‘I wasn’t in shock, I was happy. I had a sense of pride. I still do.’ He added that Cornick’s parents were ‘at a loss’ to understand how their son could have committed such a crime. Absolved of any blame by both police and the judge, Mr and Mrs Cornick sat behind their son in the court room dock as details of his chilling lack of remorse were revealed. Gudrun Wroot, who worked with Mrs Cornick at a catalogue publisher, said: ‘It is awful for the family of the woman who has been killed but it is also traumatic for the family of the boy. Mothers blame themselves but she can’t … It is just terrible. But really she is a nice person and a very caring mother.’ Write highlights for this article.","output":"William Cornick, a 16-year-old boy, was sentenced to life in prison for killing his teacher, Ann Maguire, in a British classroom.

William's parents were described as responsible and caring, and they fully cooperated with the police during the investigation.

Family members say Nykea Aldridge, 32, had recently relocated to the area on the city's South Side, the AP reports. Chicago police say she was killed Friday when two males walked up and fired shots at a third man but hit Aldridge in the head and arm. She wasn't the intended target, police say. Family members are caring for the baby, who wasn't hurt. Police said Friday evening that they are questioning witnesses in the shooting but have no suspects in custody. Wade, a Chicago native who signed with the Chicago Bulls in July after 13 years with the Miami Heat, tweeted: \\"My cousin was killed today in Chicago. Another act of senseless gun violence. 4 kids lost their mom for NO REASON. Unreal. #EnoughIsEnough.\\" Just a day earlier, Wade had participated via satellite in a town hall meeting in Chicago on gun violence hosted by ESPN, along with his mother, pastor Jolinda Wade. Outside the emergency room where Aldridge was pronounced dead Friday, Jolinda Wade said she participated in the town hall meeting on gun violence Thursday, \\"never knowing that the next day we would be the ones that would actually be living and experiencing it.\\" (At the ESPY Awards last month, Wade and other NBA stars pleaded for an end to gun violence.) Expand this summary.","output":"Nykea Aldridge, a 32-year-old cousin of NBA star Dwyane Wade, was tragically shot and killed in Chicago on Friday, August 26, 2016. Aldridge, a mother of four, was pushing her baby in a stroller near a school in the South Side area of the city and planned to register her children there. She had only recently relocated to the neighborhood. The shocking incident occurred when two males approached and opened fire at a third individual, inadvertently striking Aldridge in the head and arm. According to the police, she was not the intended target of the gunmen. Her baby was fortunately unharmed during the shooting, and family members have since taken the child into their care. The police were actively questioning witnesses in the aftermath of the shooting, but no suspects had been apprehended at the time. Dwyane Wade, a Chicago native who had just signed with the Chicago Bulls in July after a 13-year-stint with the Miami Heat, expressed his heartbreak and outrage via Twitter: \\"My cousin was killed today in Chicago. Another act of senseless gun violence. 4 kids lost their mom for NO REASON. Unreal. #EnoughIsEnough.\\" The irony of the situation was that just one day before his cousin's tragic death, Dwyane Wade had participated via satellite in a town hall meeting on gun violence hosted by ESPN in Chicago, alongside his mother, Pastor Jolinda Wade. The startling coincidence was not lost on Jolinda, as she remarked, \\"never knowing that the next day we would be the ones that would actually be living and experiencing it.\\" It is important to note that Dwyane Wade, as well as other NBA stars, has been an advocate for putting an end to gun violence, as evidenced by their impassioned plea at the ESPY Awards that took place the previous month. The tragic death of Nykea Aldridge is indicative of the wave of senseless gun violence that has gripped the city of Chicago. Her story and the stories of countless others who have lost their lives to random, brutal acts of violence stand as a stark reminder of the urgent need to address this issue proactively. Gun control measures, community initiatives, and sustained efforts to promote peaceful resolution of conflicts are all vital components of a comprehensive strategy to curb gun violence in Chicago and other cities across the United States. The loss of Aldridge and countless others must ignite an unwavering commitment to end the scourge of gun violence that continues to devastate families and communities across the nation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Process:  - The human body takes a breath inward - Air is transported to the lungs - Air reaches the alveoli, the smallest air sacs in the lungs - In the alveoli, air passes into the blood within small capillaries - The gaseous oxygen in the air dissolves into the capillary blood - The dissolved oxygen is picked-up by red blood cells - The red blood cells bind the oxygen via a protein called heme - Red blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach the various tissues - Within small capillaries, the heme release the oxygen - The oxygen can then reach the cells within the tissue -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the lungs are working properly happens, how will it affect \\"LESS oxygen being brought to the bodys cells\\".  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation, which in this case is the proper functioning of the lungs, does directly affect the process of oxygen transport to the body's cells. If the lungs are working properly, they will efficiently take in air and transport it to the alveoli. From there, an effective exchange of oxygen to the blood capillaries occurs. This oxygen is then carried by red blood cells and distributed throughout the body. However, if the perturbation supposes \\"LESS oxygen being brought to the body's cells,\\" then one or more components of this process must be impaired. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as an issue with the heme protein not being able to bind effectively with the oxygen, the blood circulation being slow, or the body's cells not receiving or utilizing the oxygen efficiently.  It's worth noting that even though the lungs are properly functioning in this perturbation, the distribution and use of oxygen is a systemic process.

Based on the premise \\"i haven't been doing it so much now that it's calmed down\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"I've been doing it a lot still.\\" is true?","output":"Based on the premise \\"I haven't been doing it so much now that it's calmed down\\", we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"I've been doing it a lot still\\" is true. To understand why, we must examine the meaning and implications of both statements. The given premise suggests that the speaker has been engaged in a certain activity at a lesser frequency since conditions have become calmer or more settled. In this context, \\"it\\" refers to the activity in question, and \\"calmed down\\" implies that previously the situation was not calm – it might have been more intense, chaotic, or it required more engagement from the speaker. As a result, the speaker reduced their involvement in that activity due to the changed state of affairs. On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"I've been doing it a lot still\\" implies that the speaker is maintaining a high level of engagement in the activity, regardless of any changes in the external situation. It suggests continuity and persistent involvement, which directly contradicts the given premise. To analyze these statements from a logical perspective, let's assign some symbolic terms to each statement: 1. Premise: \\"I haven't been doing it so much now that it's calmed down.\\"   - Let A represent engaging in the activity   - Let B represent the calmed-down situation   - This premise can be symbolically expressed as: If B, then less A 2. Hypothesis: \\"I've been doing it a lot still.\\"   - Let C represent engaging in the activity a lot   - This hypothesis can be symbolically expressed as: C Based on the premise A (If B, then less A) and the hypothesis C, there is a clear inconsistency between the two statements. The premise proposes that when the situation is calmer, there is less engagement in the activity, while the hypothesis contends that the speaker is still highly involved in the activity. In conclusion, we cannot accept the hypothesis \\"I've been doing it a lot still\\" as true, based on the given premise. The two statements are contradictory, and the premise directly challenges the validity of the hypothesis. It would be better to investigate further or gather more information to understand the speaker's actual level of engagement in the activity during the calmer situation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To elaborate, engines, specifically internal combustion engines, are widely used in various applications such as automobiles, generators, and industrial equipment. These engines burn fossil fuels such as gasoline, diesel, and natural gas to generate mechanical power. During the combustion of these fuels, chemical reactions occur, which result in the conversion of the chemical energy stored in the fossil fuels into mechanical and heat energy. One of the byproducts of this energy conversion process is carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, meaning it contributes to the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is a natural process through which certain gases trap heat within the Earth's atmosphere, thereby maintaining the planet's temperature at a level suitable for sustaining life. However, when the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increases significantly, it can cause more heat to be retained, resulting in global warming, which is an increase in the Earth's surface temperature over time. As the question also mentioned other processes, such as living things producing waste, decomposition of waste, and evaporation of water, these all contribute to the overall greenhouse effect as well. For instance, waste produced by living organisms can take various forms, including fecal matter and dead organisms. Decomposition of this organic waste by microorganisms leads to the production of another potent greenhouse gas, methane (CH4). Similarly, the evaporation of water is a natural process that plays a crucial role in the Earth's water cycle. Water molecules absorb energy from sunlight or heat sources and transform from the liquid state to the gaseous state, resulting in water vapor. Water vapor is also a greenhouse gas since it can absorb and retain heat in the Earth's atmosphere. In conclusion, the first step of the process described is the production of carbon dioxide by engines through the combustion of fossil fuels. This process, along with the other natural processes mentioned (such as waste decomposition and water evaporation), contributes to the greenhouse effect and ultimately impacts the Earth's climate. Understanding the individual steps and interconnections among them is essential for managing and reducing the adverse effects of human activities on the climate and the environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Six years earlier, while on the mob's payroll, Denton attacked district attorney Phil Coakley, earning him the enmity of the police and the nickname \\"slash cop\\". After finding his ex-wife has left the city with their children, he moves in with his elderly parents. Denton researches his ex-wife on the internet, eventually digging up a phone number. After briefly talking to one of his daughters, his ex-wife takes the phone and threatens to press charges if he ever contacts them again. Denton passes a bar on his way back home. Although a recovering alcoholic, he enters and orders a drink.  His friend Scotty, the brother of Denton's slain partner, greets him and offers him any help he needs. A young woman asks Denton for a ride home. Denton is surprised when she reveals herself to be Coakley's daughter and intentionally bloodies herself. Cued by her cries for help, two men drag Denton from his car; Denton beats both men savagely. After Denton is questioned by the police, Coakley admits the evidence backs up his story and reluctantly asks if Denton wants to press charges. Denton declines, saying he wants to leave his history in the past, to the disgust of Coakley and Lieutenant Pleasant, who calls him a disgrace. Pleasant, revealed to also be corrupt, demands Denton kill mob boss Manny Vassey, who has found religion on his deathbed. Pleasant explains Vassey's guilty conscience may lead him to confess to Coakley. Pleasant promises to help Denton renegotiate the terms of the settlement with his ex-wife if he kills Vassey.  At his house, Vassey denies the rumors. As Vassey falls asleep, Denton begins to suffocate him, only to be interrupted by Charlotte Boyd, Vassey's hospice nurse. Denton smoothly thanks her for her work and leaves the house, where he encounters Vassey's sadistic son, Junior. Junior threatens to kill Denton, enraged that Vassey would see him while avoiding his own son.

Passage: McVeigh's original plan had been to detonate the bomb at 11:00 am, but at dawn on April 19, 1995, he decided instead to destroy the building at 9:00 am. As he drove toward the Murrah Federal Building in the Ryder truck, McVeigh carried with him an envelope containing pages from The Turner Diaries – a fictional account of white supremacists who ignite a revolution by blowing up the FBI headquarters at 9:15 one morning using a truck bomb. McVeigh wore a printed T-shirt with the motto of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Sic semper tyrannis (\\"Thus always to tyrants\\", according to legend what Brutus said as he assassinated Julius Caesar, also shouted by John Wilkes Booth immediately after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln) and \\"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants\\" (from Thomas Jefferson). He also carried an envelope full of revolutionary materials that included a bumper sticker with the Thomas Jefferson slogan, \\"When the government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.\\" Underneath, McVeigh had written, \\"Maybe now, there will be liberty!\\" with a hand-copied quote by John Locke asserting that a man has a right to kill someone who takes away his liberty.McVeigh entered Oklahoma City at 8:50 am.

Here is an article: The record-breaking polar air that has made the Midwestern U.S. shiver over the past few days spread to the East and South on Tuesday, setting record low temperatures from Boston and New York to Atlanta, Birmingham, Nashville and Little Rock — places where many people don't know the first thing about extreme cold. The morning weather map for the eastern half of the U.S. looked like an algebra worksheet: lots of small, negative numbers. In fact, the Midwest and the East were colder than much of Antarctica. The big chill started in the Midwest over the weekend, and by Tuesday, it covered about half of the country. In New York City, the high was expected to be -12 C; in Boston, around -8 C. The polar vortex refers to winds that whip around the polar ice cap, trapping Earth's coldest temperatures there. Its deterioration with global warming, however, can send arctic weather south into areas as far away as the southern U.S. and Europe, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists. \\"When the polar vortex … breaks down, this allows cold air to spill south, affecting the eastern United States and other regions,\\" says NOAA's Dr. James Overland. \\"This can result in a warmer-than-average arctic region and colder temperatures that may include severe winter weather events on the North American and European continents.\\" Across the South, records were shattered like icicles. Birmingham, Alabama, dipped to a low of -14 C), breaking the record of -11.7 C set in 1970. Atlanta saw a record low of -14.5 C. Nashville, Tennessee, got down to -16.7 C, and Little Rock, Arkansas, fell to -13 C. It was just -17 C at Washington Dulles International airport, eclipsing the 1988 mark of -13 C. The deep freeze dragged on in the Midwest as well, with the thermometer reaching -24 C overnight in the Chicago area and -25.5 C in suburban St. Louis. More than 500 Amtrak passengers were stranded overnight on three Chicago-bound trains that were stopped by blowing and drifting snow in Illinois. Food ran low, but the heat stayed on. The worst should be over in the next day or two. Warmer weather — at least, near or above freezing — is in the forecast for much of the stricken part of the country. On Tuesday, many schools and day care centres across the eastern half of the U.S. were closed so that youngsters wouldn't be exposed to the dangerous cold. Officials opened shelters for the homeless and anyone else who needed a warm place. With the bitter cold slowing baggage handling and aircraft refuelling, airlines cancelled more than 2,000 flights in the U.S., bringing the four-day total to more than 11,000. In New Orleans, which reported a low of -3 C, hardware stores ran out of pipe insulation. A pipe burst in an Atlanta suburb and a main road quickly froze over. In downtown Atlanta, a Ferris wheel near Centennial Olympic Park that opened over the summer to give riders a bird's eye view of the city closed because it was too cold. The Hurricanes have been shut down by a blizzard. The NHL has postponed the game scheduled for Tuesday night in Buffalo between the Sabres and Carolina because of a snowstorm in western New York. A makeup date has not been determined. The postponement comes with Buffalo dealing with a wintry blast of frigid temperatures, heavy winds and blinding snow that has forced the closure of most major roadways. Farther south in Pensacola, Florida, a Gulf Coast city better known for its white sand beaches than frost, streets normally filled with joggers, bikers and people walking dogs were deserted early Tuesday. A sign on a bank flashed 19 F (-7 Celsius). Patches of ice sparkled in parking lots where puddles froze overnight. The continental U.S., when averaged out, reached a low of -10 C overnight Monday, according to calculations by Ryan Maue of Weather Bell Analytics. An estimated 190 million people in the U.S. were subjected to the icy blast, caused by a kink in the \\"polar vortex,\\" the strong winds that surround the North Pole. In Chicago, it was too cold even for the polar bear at the Lincoln Park Zoo. While polar bears can handle below freezing cold in the wild, Anana was kept inside Monday because she doesn't have the thick layer of fat that bears typically get from feeding on seals and whale carcasses.

Despite their bitter rivalry, Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko and Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko were both in Brussels for an international conference with the European Commission, the World Bank and other key lenders. The EU gets 80% of its gas supplies from Russia via a network of more than 13,000km (8,060 miles) of Ukrainian pipelines, some of which are 40 years old. Hypothesis: Putin is 40 years old. Possible answers: [I] yes. [II] no. A:","output":"[II] no. The context talks about the age of some Ukrainian pipelines being 40 years old, not Putin's age. So, the hypothesis that Putin is 40 years old cannot be drawn from the context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Colonel Matt Brennan (Humphrey Bogart), discharged from the military, runs a civilian flying school, where he is reunited with an old US Army Air Force buddy, Major Hinkle (James Brown). Brennan is offered a job at the Willis Aircraft Company as chief test pilot for an experimental high speed jet fighter known as the JA-3, designed by Carl Troxell (Richard Whorf). Troxell is also a link to Brennan's past, having known him in the war when Brennan was a bomber pilot. A flashback to B-17 missions over Germany reveal Brennan to be a top-notch pilot.

Positive Movie Review: The Shape of Water (2017) The Shape of Water, a beautifully touching and captivating fantasy drama film, swept away audiences and critics alike upon its release in 2017. Directed by renowned filmmaker Guillermo del Toro, the movie draws the viewer into a world brimming with magic, love, and vivid imagination. Set during the height of the Cold War, the story follows Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins), a mute janitor working at a secret government facility. Hawkins' exceptional performance as Elisa helped to convey deep emotions, despite her character's lack of speech. Alongside her is Octavia Spencer, who plays the role of Elisa's loyal coworker and friend, Zelda, with a delightful energy that contributes to the on-screen chemistry. Michael Shannon's Colonel Richard Strickland is a chilling antagonist who embodies the fears and prejudices of the era. At the heart of the story is an amphibious man (Doug Jones), a fantastical creature feared and misunderstood by the facility's personnel. As Elisa establishes a connection with this alluring being, their growing attachment transcends species and social boundaries alike. The film explores themes of isolation, persecution, and the power of love as a way to overcome adversity. The Shape of Water is brought to life by Guillermo del Toro's masterful direction, which not only provides a mesmerizing visual spectacle but also creates a dreamlike ambiance that transcends the movie screen. The creature design, executed by Jones' notable performance, demonstrates del Toro's signature touch creating memorable and fascinating characters. The simple yet profound concept of communication without words is underlined through the emotional bond between the two lead characters. The film's breathtaking cinematography by Dan Laustsen shines through the movie's every frame. The lush visuals, set designs, and color palette are a feast for the eyes, transporting the viewer into a world beyond our own. The Academy Award-winning score by Alexandre Desplat perfectly complements the film's atmospheric qualities. Each musical note helps to evoke the ambiance and emotions that drive the characters, delicately blending whimsy with more somber moments. Furthermore, the screenplay by del Toro and Vanessa Taylor is well-crafted and poetic, encapsulating a wide range of emotions in ways that feel genuine and relatable. The characters are complex and multi-dimensional, leaving the audience fully invested in their struggles and triumphs. Ultimately, The Shape of Water is a stunning and enchanting experience, a testament to del Toro's unwavering passion for storytelling. It expertly combines elements of romance, fantasy, and suspense, all while tackling themes of love, acceptance, and what it truly means to be human. This unforgettable piece of modern cinema will undoubtedly continue to captivate audiences for generations to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Paragraph: The earliest signs of people on Jamaica are the remains of the Arawak, an AmerIndian society that originated on the north coast of South America. Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517.  Question: \\"On what island were Arawak pottery shards found?\\" Answer: \\"Nueva Sevilla\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"Yes, the answer is correct.

Summarize this article: On Sunday, Scott Van Duzer became the Obama campaignâ€™s favorite Republican bench-pressing pizza-parlor owner when he lifted President Obama off the floor during a surprise hug in his Florida restaurant. The image made the front pages of newspapers around the country and immediately whizzed around the Internet.      But on Monday, Mr. Van Duzer found that fame can be a complicated proposition. The Yelp profile page for his pizza place, which had only two reviews before Monday (â€śLove the Pizza, wings, subs and the best strombolie [sic] in townâ€ť) was suddenly inundated with hundreds of reviews, making it perhaps the most politically charged pizza review board around.      â€śPolitics aside. I hate this place is gonna get any kind of publicity. The pizza is terrible and greasy. NOTHING like NY,â€ť wrote Smith K. of Knoxville, Tenn.      But others quickly came to the defense of Mr. Van Duzer and his pizza. â€śAll in all, I recommend the ham and pineapple pizza to any pizza eater earning less than 500,000 per year who likes tax cuts, less war, an end to torture, and dead terrorist kingpins,â€ť wrote Dennis J. of Milton, Ontario.      By the end of the day, sentiment was running overwhelmingly in favor of Mr. Van Duzerâ€™s pizza and his politics, with many nevertheless saying the two should never mix. â€śPizza is Pizza and one should be judged on how good the crust is and not your political stance,â€ť wrote Rob S. of San Francisco. ||||| The owner of a Florida pizza shop says people are boycotting his business because he bear-hugged President Barack Obama on Sunday.      (PHOTOS: Obama and Romney stop for food)      Text Size -      +      reset Obama gets bear hug      “People are saying a lot of bad things and boycotting my restaurant,” Scott Van Duzer, 46, told POLITICO. “There’s no middle line anymore, and that’s exactly what’s wrong with our country right now.”      The owner of Big Apple Pizza & Pasta Restaurant in Fort Pierce, Fla., said that both Democrats and Republicans are welcome in his store. But he also said he thinks Mitt Romney’s running mate Rep. Paul Ryan — whose sculpted abs are thanks to intense P90X training sessions — would lose to the president in a workout battle.      (PHOTOS: President Obama off the bench)      “I think Obama could take him,” Van Duzer said, laughing. “Obama looked pretty fast and pretty quick on his feet.”      So is Van Duzer. For a guy who biked 1,148 miles in 31 days from Florida to Washington D.C., lifting Obama was a piece of cake — err, a slice of pizza. And Van Duzer says he wasn’t even warmed up.      “I don’t work out that much, man. Usually, it’s about two days per week. The bike ride was my big thing,” Van Duzer said. “I’m starting to go back to the gym right now. I need to start maintaining.”      Van Duzer’s June bike-trek was part of his Van Duzer Foundation, and helped raise awareness for blood donation shortages. Founded in 2008 to support a local firefighter whose house burned down, the foundation has since raised more than 600,000, Van Duzer said. Van Duzer said he rode with a few kids from the Boys and Girls Club and met with U.S. Surgeon General Regina M. Benjamin to discuss blood shortages.      Obama told The New York Times that Van Duzer’s effort in promoting blood donations was part of the reason the campaign decided to visit his pizza shop.      “One of the reasons that we wanted to stop by is that Scott has been doing unbelievable work out of this pizza shop in promoting the importance of donating blood,” Obama told the Times. “And so he has set some records here in Florida. He has received commendations from the White House, the surgeon general, he has galvanized and mobilized the local community and he’s educating kids and folks all across the country on this issue.”      Inside the shop Sunday, Obama wanted to know how to look like Van Duzer.      “Everybody look at these guns,” Obama said. “If I eat your pizza, will I look like that?”      (Also on POLITICO: Fit for office: 2012 candidates in the best shape ever)      Van Duzer told POLITICO that he packs on protein with his homemade pepperoni pizza. And the 6-foot-3-inch, 260-pound Van Duzer says he bench presses 350 pounds at six reps, usually twice a week — nearly double the estimated 176 pounds that Obama weighs.      “When I was in peak condition, I lifted five times a week,” he said. “But that was before my injury.”      He tore his Achilles tendon during an “intense” charity dodgeball game. Mainly, he says his active, energetic lifestyle keeps him fit.      “I move around a lot,” he said. ||||| Summary:","output":"Florida pizza shop owner Scott Van Duzer became nationally famous after images of him lifting President Obama in a surprise bear hug circulated the internet. Following this event in his restaurant, his previously quiet Yelp profile page exploded with polarised reviews and became an unexpected political discussion panel. Reactions ranged from people criticizing the quality of his pizza and his positive interaction with the Democratic President, to people supporting Van Duzer and his stance. Van Duzer states that his business felt the backlash from his impromptu, friendly gesture to the President as he began experiencing a wave of negative comments and customers boycotting his restaurant, demonstrating the divide in the American political landscape. Despite the political attention his business received, Van Duzer stands by the fact that people of all political affiliations are welcome in his pizza place. The pizza shop owner is also known for his June bike-trek from Florida to Washington D.C., a journey amounting to 1,148 miles over 31 days. This was conducted as part of his Van Duzer Foundation, aimed at raising awareness for blood donation shortages. As such, not only was the Obama campaign's stop by the pizza outside the traditional path, but it also recognized the good work Van Duzer did in promoting blood donations. In a final note, Van Duzer asserted that he thinks President Obama, due to his quickness and agility, could win in a workout battle against Mitt Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan. He attributes his own physical stamina to his active lifestyle and his regular workout regime, though he admits to working out less frequently after sustaining an injury."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Question: \\"Muhammad describing revelations was like what that the ringing of a bell caused?\\"  Context: \\"Sahih al-Bukhari narrates Muhammad describing the revelations as, \\"Sometimes it is (revealed) like the ringing of a bell\\" and Aisha reported, \\"I saw the Prophet being inspired Divinely on a very cold day and noticed the sweat dropping from his forehead (as the Inspiration was over).\\" Muhammad's first revelation, according to the Quran, was accompanied with a vision.

According to Welch, these seizures would have been seen by those around him as convincing evidence for the superhuman origin of Muhammad's inspirations. However, Muhammad's critics accused him of being a possessed man, a soothsayer or a magician since his experiences were similar to those claimed by such figures well known in ancient Arabia. Welch additionally states that it remains uncertain whether these experiences occurred before or after Muhammad's initial claim of prophethood.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Muhammad describing the revelations as being like the ringing of a bell refers to the manner in which he experienced the divine messages from Allah. These revelations were transmitted to him by the Angel Jibril (Gabriel) and formed the basis of the Quran. According to the Sahih al-Bukhari, a highly regarded collection of hadith, Muhammad described the revelations sometimes occurring as sudden and powerful, akin to the sound of a ringing bell. Muhammad's wife, Aisha, also reported witnessing the Prophet receiving divine inspiration on a cold day, with sweat visibly dripping from his forehead as the process completed. This highlights the intense and awe-inspiring nature of these revelations and the impact they had on Muhammad both physically and psychologically. The process of receiving these revelations was often accompanied by visions or other intense experiences. For instance, as per the Quran, the first revelation sent to Muhammad came with a vision where he saw the \\"one mighty in power\\", presumably referring to the angel Jibril, who initially seemed far away but then quickly approached the Prophet. Islamic studies scholar, Welch, suggests that the graphic descriptions of Muhammad's experiences during these moments of revelation may be considered authentic as they portray the deep disturbance he went through. The severity of these experiences would have provided convincing evidence to those around him of the superhuman origin of the messages he received. However, some of Muhammad's critics in ancient Arabia accused him of being possessed, a soothsayer, or a magician since his experiences were similar to those claimed by such individuals of that time. It remains uncertain whether these unique experiences took place before or after he began to proclaim his prophethood. Regardless, these revelations played a crucial role in shaping the foundation of Islam as a religion and provided guidance to millions of Muslims across generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You can directly copy and paste a span from the story or the question while answering the given question. Problem:Background Paragraph: According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements:.  Story: John is an amateur astronomer. Last week he was observing the sky with his telescope. First he pointed his telescope at planet Mars. He noted it as case A. Then he pointed his telescope to planet Jupiter, which is farther form the Sun than Mars is. He noted it as case C. Finally, he pointed the telescope to a faraway planet called WASP-17b. He noted that as case B.  Question: Which case would have longer year, case A or case C? Solution:","output":"Case C"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A few suggested questions for McCain and Obama Tuesday, October 14th 2008, 11:52 AM The questions that John McCain and Barack Obama really need to answer won't be asked Wednesday night. With the final presidential debate scheduled forÂ Wednesday and the previous two having revealed nothing about the candidates, I have taken it upon myself to suggest some questions for CBS' Bob Schieffer, who will do the moderating chores. I assure you that the candidates have not seen the questions in advance nor, when the time comes, will they want to answer them. Sen. Obama goes first. Sen. Obama, you are sooooooooo cool. Can you tell us, please, the last time you lost your temper and what about? Sen. McCain, I'd like to ask you why you've attacked Sen. Obama for associating with theformer domestic terrorist, Bill Ayers, even though you have befriended G. Gordon Liddy, who was jailed for what amounts to subversion of the Constitution. Liddy also once told his radio listeners to deal with ATF agents by shooting them - \\"a head shot,\\" he recommended. What's the difference between Liddy and Ayers? Sen. Obama, did you ever tell Bill Ayers to his face that what he did was wrong? Sen. McCain, I have a question regarding Sarah Palin: How could you? Sen. Obama, in 2007, your former church and its then-minister honored the Rev. Louis Farrakhan, an anti-Semite. Why didn't you say something in protest? Have you ever heard the Latin dictum \\"Qui tacet consentire videtur,\\" silence is consent? Sen. McCain, what lessons should we have learned from the Iraq war? Should we have stuck to Afghanistan? What are our limits as a great power? Sen. Obama, if your plan for troop withdrawal in Iraq had been adopted, the U.S. troops would now be almost out of the country. That being the case, what do you think we'd have there now? Civil war? A peaceful country? Sen. McCain, do you ever wake up in the middle of the night and wonder if history will forgive you for Sarah Palin? Sen. Obama, do you ever wake up in the middle of night for anything? Sen. McCain, with the situation in Afghanistan worsening, why don't we switch our troops right away from Iraq, which didn't attack us, to the country from where Osama Bin Laden and his Taliban supporters did? Sen. Obama, given the problems facing our country - a worldwide financial crisis, the prospect of nukes in Iran and North Korea, and Pakistan, which already has nukes, coming apart - isn't it reckless of you to think that, with your limited experience, you can manage it all? Sen. McCain, virtually the same question to you. But in your case, given your age, isn't this all too much for you? Sen. Obama, have you ever been in therapy? If so, how did it make you feel? Sen. McCain, in May, you allowed a restricted number of reporters to review your medical records for a limited amount of time. Some people think you're hiding something. Are you? Why not make all the records public? Sen. Obama, we all know that lobbyists are not the problem in Washington; it's the incessant need of politicians to raise campaign funds. Yet you broke your pledge to accept public financing for your campaign. Didn't you contribute to the problem? Sen. McCain, you are 72 and have had skin cancer several times. Given that - not to mention the usual exigencies of life - how could you pick a running mate who is so dismally qualified for the presidency? Please, for the sake of your own reputation, don't say anything about the Alaska National Guard. Sen. Obama and Sen. McCain, you both favor NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which person didn't make a fire that burned for a longer time?  Hint: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants.

Write a title: AP - Iran and Saudi Arabia called Monday for the United Nations to intervene in Iraq to stop the fighting between U.S. forces and Shhite militants hiding in the holy city of Najaf.","output":"Title: \\"Urgent United Nations Intervention Sought by Iran and Saudi Arabia to Halt the US-Shiite Conflict in Najaf, Iraq\\" The escalating conflict between the United States military forces and the Shiite militants entrenched in the revered city of Najaf in Iraq has prompted Iran and Saudi Arabia to issue a joint call for the direct intervention of the United Nations. As the crisis deepens, the increasing violence and human suffering in the region have emerged as key concerns for both nations, and their request reflects the urgency of the situation as well as the shared desire to preserve the sanctity of Najaf, a city of immense religious and historical significance for the Islamic world. As neighboring countries with deep-rooted connections to the region's religious and political landscape, both Iran and Saudi Arabia have high stakes in the stability of Iraq. Between Iran's majority Shiite population and Saudi Arabia's influence as the guardian of the world's holiest Islamic sites, both countries possess a vested interest in preventing bloodshed and destruction in the Iraqi holy city of Najaf. The current conflict in Najaf presents a grim reality that highlights the delicate balance of power in the region and the perpetual struggle for control among various factions. Amidst the chaos and uncertainty, the entire region's peace, stability, and safety are under threat as sectarian divisions and historical grievances are exacerbated by mounting aggression from both the US forces and Shiite militants. In their call for decisive United Nations action, Iran and Saudi Arabia have underscored the importance of protecting civilian lives and preserving the sanctity of Najaf's holy sites. Furthermore, the two nations have emphasized the dire need for humanitarian assistance to support the local population, especially where access to basic necessities - such as food, water, and medical care - has been severely disrupted by the ongoing conflict. The joint plea by Iran and Saudi Arabia calls on the international community to recognize the urgency and gravity of the situation. It specifically appeals to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) members to utilize their influence by crafting a legally binding resolution aimed at putting a stop to the escalating violence, ensuring the protection of civilians, and facilitating political dialogue between the conflicting parties. The proposed response involves the United Nations deploying a neutral peacekeeping force in Najaf to manage the safe evacuation of civilians caught in the conflict, as well as overseeing the withdrawal of both US troops and Shiite militants from the city. Simultaneously, a diplomatic process - facilitated by the UN - should be instigated, focusing on creating a framework for long-term national reconciliation, rebuilding the shattered infrastructure, and establishing durable peace in Iraq. Ultimately, the joint call from Iran and Saudi Arabia for the United Nations intervention in Iraq serves as not only a desperate plea to halt the bloodshed and protect the cultural heritage of the region but also an opportunity for the international community to come together and work towards securing peace and stability in the Middle East. Should the United Nations respond positively and effectively to this appeal, it has the potential to set the stage for lasting peace and positive change across the region, altering the trajectory of multiple ongoing conflicts and easing tensions between various religious and political groups."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer?","output":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin is set on the Greek island of Kefalonia.  Kefalonia, also spelled Cephalonia, is the largest of the Ionian Islands in western Greece. The novel, written by British author Louis de Bernières and published in 1994, takes place during the Italian and German occupation of the island during World War II. The plot revolves around the lives of the island's inhabitants and several key events that occurred during this period, such as the Italian occupation, the massacre of the Italian Acqui Division by the Germans, and the fierce battles that ensued as the Axis powers sought to maintain control over the island. The story primarily revolves around the characters of Dr. Iannis, a local Greek physician, his daughter Pelagia, and Antonio Corelli, the captain of an Italian regiment stationed on the island. As Captain Corelli's Mandolin progresses, it charts the development of a romantic relationship between Pelagia and Corelli. This relationship is complicated by the harsh realities of war, conflicting loyalties, and the broader historical context in which the novel is set.  Besides its exploration of romantic love, the novel delves into themes such as loyalty, patriotism, and the human capacity for both cruelty and compassion in times of war. As an Englishman writing about a foreign culture and history, de Bernières drew from extensive research to recreate the atmosphere, everyday life, and historical events of wartime Kefalonia. The novel, with its rich description of the island's landscapes and natural beauty, fueled a surge in tourism to Kefalonia after the book's publication. In 2001, Captain Corelli's Mandolin was adapted into a feature film directed by John Madden and starring Nicolas Cage as Captain Corelli and Penélope Cruz as Pelagia. The film, while commercially successful, faced mixed reviews, with many arguing that it failed to fully capture the depth and complexity of the original novel. Nonetheless, the film further popularized Kefalonia as a travel destination and contributed to the ongoing interest in the island and its history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1514, Sultan Selim I, nicknamed \\"the Grim\\" because of his cruelty, ordered the massacre of 40,000 Anatolian Alevis (Qizilbash), whom he considered heretics, reportedly proclaiming that \\"the killing of one Alevi had as much otherworldly reward as killing 70 Christians.\\"[page needed] Selim was also responsible for an unprecedented and rapid expansion of the Ottoman Empire into the Middle East, especially through his conquest of the entire Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt, which included much of the region. With these conquests, Selim further solidified the Ottoman claim for being an Islamic caliphate, although Ottoman sultans had been claiming the title of caliph since the 14th century starting with Murad I (reigned 1362 to 1389). The caliphate would remain held by Ottoman sultans for the rest of the office's duration, which ended with its abolition on 3 March 1924 by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and the exile of the last caliph, Abdülmecid II, to France.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Sultan Selim I, also known as \\"the Grim,\\" accomplished a significant feat against the Mamluk Sultanate by successfully conquering it. This endeavor led to the rapid expansion of the Ottoman Empire into the Middle East. The Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt was a powerful state that comprised a substantial portion of the Middle Eastern region. Selim's conquest allowed the Ottoman Empire to absorb the vast territories of the Mamluk Sultanate, including Egypt, the Levant, and Hejaz. By defeating the Mamluk Sultanate, Selim I not only expanded the Ottoman Empire's territories but also strengthened its claim to be an Islamic caliphate. Although Ottoman sultans had been claiming the title of caliph since the 14th century, beginning with Murad I, Selim's conquests in the Middle East further solidified this claim. The caliphate would continue to be held by Ottoman sultans until its eventual abolition in 1924 by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and the subsequent exile of the last caliph, Abdülmecid II, to France.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who was committed for trial? ?  On 1 March 1849, Brown was charged with the murder of \\"unknown aboriginal natives\\". In late March or early April he appeared before a local magistrate in the district, Captain G. V. Butler, who committed him for trial. In May, Butler wrote a letter to Charles Hervey Bagot, a member of the South Australian Legislative Council, in which he listed the victims as one \\"old man blind and infirm\\", three female adults, two teenage girls (aged 15 and 12 years), and three female children (aged two years, 18 months, and a baby). Butler added that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\".Brown's trial came before the Supreme Court in Adelaide on 11 June 1849. The presiding judge considered that the evidence presented was insufficient, and gave the prosecution another week to investigate. The weakness of the case was directly related to the provisions of the Aboriginal Witnesses Act of 1848 regarding testimony given by Aboriginal witnesses. It was generally believed that Aboriginal people could not understand the oath, but the Act allowed unsworn testimony to be offered by Aboriginal witnesses, with two significant limitations. The court could determine the weight and credibility to be given to Aboriginal testimony, but even more telling was the restriction that when the punishment for a crime was death or transportation, the evidence of an \\"uncivilised person or persons\\" was considered insufficient unless corroborated by other evidence. A week later, the judge remained unconvinced about the strength of the prosecution, but given \\"great suspicion rested on the case\\", he gave the prosecution a further extension of time, and released Brown on bail of ₤500.In July 1849, the South Australian Advocate General produced a summary of the investigation to date. Several difficulties were detailed, including the fact that Parker denied any knowledge of the crime, as did others who were believed to have heard the incident, discussed in Brown's presence.

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: By 1964, it was possible for a major studio to make a film touching upon the Spanish Civil War without having to answer to some senate investigating committee or other. Based on Emeric Pressburger's novel A Mouse on Sunday, Behold a Pale Horse stars Gregory Peck as a Republican war veteran Manuel Artiguez who continues waging a one-man offensive 20 years after hostilities have officially ceased. Pressburger's novel was loosely based on the last raid of real-life anarchist guerrilla Antonio Sabate who was killed in an ambush in 1959.When the young son of an old comrade in arms comes to the French border village where Artiguez is exiled, he asks the old warrior to avenge the death of his father at the hands of vengeful Nationalist police captain Vinolas played by Anthony Quinn. At first Manuel refuses, but when Manuel learns that his aged mother Pilar (Mildred Dunnock) is dying he's determined to return to Spain to bid farewell to her. Pilar dies before Manuel can embark on his journey, but with the aid of traitorous smuggler Carlos (Raymond Pelligrin) Captain Vinolas keeps up the pretence that she still lives so that he can lure Manuel back to Spain and ambush him. Although a sympathetic priest (Omar Sharif) advises Manuel that he's being tricked, Manuel determines to return at all costs. Aware of the trap that's been set for him, Manuel engages the police in a fire fight, wounding Vinolas, killing Carlos and dying himself in the process.In 1966, Behold a Pale Horse was scheduled to be telecast on a major American network, but was cancelled at the last minute, reportedly at the behest of the Spanish government.

Answer: Men who had been free people of color before the war comprised 26% of those elected to state and federal office in South Carolina from 1868 to 1876.  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Answer: Between 1868 and 1876, the percentage of elected officials who were Freemen varies depending on the region and state. However, in South Carolina, 26% of those elected to state and federal office during this period were Freemen, or men who were previously free people of color before the Civil War. This period falls under the era of Reconstruction in the United States (1865-1877), which was a time of great social and political change following the Civil War. The Reconstruction Era aimed to rebuild and reunite the nation, particularly Southern states, after the long and bloody conflict, while addressing issues of civil rights and equality for the newly emancipated African Americans. One significant change during the Reconstruction period was the passage of the 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, which granted African Americans citizenship and voting rights. These constitutional amendments opened doors for many former slaves and Freemen to run for and be elected for public office, including positions within local and state governments and in the U.S. Congress. Freemen, or men who had been free people of color before the Civil War, were often more educated and better positioned to gain political power as they were more likely to have had access to opportunities denied to those who had been enslaved. Some of the most notable Freemen who were elected during the Reconstruction Era include Hiram Revels and Blanche K. Bruce, both of whom served as Senators from Mississippi, and Robert Smalls, who represented South Carolina in the U.S House of Representatives. While these elections marked significant progress in inclusive representation and the participation of African Americans in politics, the percentage of those who were actually Freemen remains a small proportion of the total number of elected officials. This is partly due to the continued presence of racial discrimination and barriers that hindered voting for African Americans, especially in the Southern states. In addition, following the end of Reconstruction, the progress made in racial equality and civil rights during those years did not persist, with the advent of policies like the Jim Crow laws enforcing racial segregation and further marginalizing African Americans. In conclusion, although the percentage of Freemen among elected officials in this period was relatively small, their achievements were a significant step towards political participation and representation of African Americans in the United States. However, it is important to remember that the gains made during the Reconstruction Era faced significant backlash and challenges in subsequent years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Born in Nelson County, Virginia, Allen was the son of Loretta M. and Earl Raymond Allen, who was recorded in the 1920 and 1930 U.S. census records for Wayne County, Michigan as working as a chauffeur to a private family. He earned varsity letters in football, track and basketball at Lake Shore High School in St. Clair Shores, Michigan; having graduated in 1940. Allen went to Alma College in Michigan and later at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he was sent as an officer trainee in the U. S. Navy's World War II V-12 program. He graduated with a B.S. in education from Michigan State Normal College (now Eastern Michigan University) in Ypsilanti, and then attended the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he earned his master's degree in physical education in 1947. After rejecting a 1 million, four-year contract offer throughout the 1977 season, Allen was dismissed by the Redskins in mid-January. He was replaced by one of his favorite players, Jack Pardee, by then the promising young head coach of the Bears, who had gained the wild card playoff berth ahead of the Redskins; both had finished at 9-5.  Rams owner Carroll Rosenbloom was searching for a new coach after parting ways with Chuck Knox, and decided to bring Allen back. Allen's hiring was announced on February 1, and he returned to Los Angeles in 1978 with much media fanfare. His second stint as the Rams' head coach was an unfortunate experience for all concerned. Unlike his first stint, Allen did not have full authority over personnel. He thus worked with general manager Don Klosterman to oversee a talented roster that had made the team a perennial playoff challenger.  Allen brought with him his scrupulous discipline and attention to detail, which extended to practice-field protocol and dining-hall decorum. However, his coaching style did not play well with the new generation of NFL players, and a group of Ram players chafed at the regulations almost immediately. Some made their grievances public; a few, including standout linebacker Isiah Robertson, briefly left camp. As newspaper reports were quoting players expressing confidence that differences would be resolved, the Rams played listlessly and lost the first two games of the 1978 exhibition schedule. Rosenbloom decided that for the season to be salvaged a change must be made, and the announcement of Allen's abrupt dismissal was made on August 13. Many of Allen's own players were surprised by the decision. Defensive coordinator Ray Malavasi, well-respected and liked by players (and the only holdover from Chuck Knox' staff), replaced him; the Rams ultimately advanced to that year's NFC Championship Game and the following year to the Super Bowl. Rosenbloom died in April 1979.  Allen soon joined CBS Sports as an analyst for NFL network telecasts, and worked in the broadcast booth from 1978 to 1983. With former Cleveland Browns great running back Jim Brown and play-by-play announcer Vin Scully, they were the network's only three-man announcing team.

On 17 June, as they prepared to leave again, Nansen thought he heard a dog bark and went to investigate. He then heard voices, and a few minutes later encountered a human being. It was Frederick Jackson, who had organised his own expedition to Franz Josef Land after being rejected by Nansen, and had based his headquarters at Cape Flora on Northbrook Island, the southernmost island of the archipelago. Jackson's own account records that his first reaction to this sudden meeting was to assume the figure to be a shipwrecked sailor, perhaps from the expedition's supply ship Windward which was due to call that summer. As he approached, Jackson saw \\"a tall man, wearing a soft felt hat, loosely made, voluminous clothes and long shaggy hair and beard, all reeking with black grease\\". After a moment's awkward hesitation, Jackson recognised his visitor: \\"You are Nansen, aren't you?\\", and received the reply \\"Yes, I am Nansen.\\"Johansen was rescued, and the pair taken to the base at Cape Flora, where they posed for photographs (in one instance re-enacting the Jackson–Nansen meeting) before taking baths and haircuts. Both men seemed in good health, despite their ordeal; Nansen had put on 21 pounds (9.5 kg) in weight since the start of the expedition, and Johansen 13 pounds (5.9 kg). In honour of his rescuer, Nansen named the island where he had wintered \\"Frederick Jackson Island\\". For the next six weeks Nansen had little to do but await the arrival of Windward, worrying that he might have to spend the winter at Cape Flora, and sometimes regretting that he and Johansen had not pressed on to Spitsbergen. Johansen noted in his journal that Nansen had changed from the overbearing personality of the Fram days, and was now subdued and polite, adamant that he would never undertake such a journey again.

Write highlights for this article: My Kitchen Rules contestant Adam Anderson has been called a 'deadbeat dad' by his ex-wife in an explosive interview which also revealed the former tennis pro  is friends with show judge Pete Evans. Cindy Anderson, Adam's former wife of almost 20 years, told A Current Affair on Monday night that her ex owes her tens of thousands of dollars in child support for their five children, aged between eight and 15 years of age. Adam's ex said she feels no bitterness that he has moved on and re-married to Carol Molloy - his partner on the Channel 7 reality show - but she claims that's when her issues with child support payments began. Cindy also claimed that Adam used to coach My Kitchen Rules judge Pete on the tennis court and that the pair worked together at his Kings Cross restaurant Hugo's, in Sydney, after she split with him. 'He has known Pete Evans, he knows him through tennis, through coaching him,' Cindy told reporter Brady Halls. Scroll down for video. Owing child support? My Kitchen Rules contestant Adam Anderson's ex-wife, Cindy, told A Current Affair on Monday night that he owes their five children approximately twelve months worth of child support, amassing tens of thousands of dollars. 'Deadbeat dad'? The former tennis professional is alleged to be providing his children with 'no financial support at all' according to his former wife. 'We get no financial support at all,' she also told Brady. Cindy claims her concern is  that the large sum owning to her has amassed over the past year, which she says 'worries me considerably in that my youngest is only 8 - he has many more years where he needs support from his father.' 'The children also have no emotional support from him. He does not ring them, nor come and see them,' she said, adding 'they do not receive a card [for birthdays] in the mail, not even a phone call.' 'He's never played an active, massive role in their lives anyway...but basically his role now is non-existent, he's pretty much wiped his hands clean of the children,' Cindy said. Happier times: The couple were married for almost 20 years and had five children together. Ranging in age: Their kids are aged between eight years and 15 years of age. Adam's ex also claimed that the lack of funds has reached a point where it's 'significantly impacting on the children', with the blonde single mother saying she's speaking on A Current Affair instead of dealing with the matter privately because 'He has blocked my number and both his childrens' numbers - the older two girls have phones'. Cindy not only took aim at Adam during the interview but also at the Child Support Agency and producers of My Kitchen Rules. 'It seems there is little they [child support agency] can do, irrespective of him being in the print that he's working at three private schools doing tennis, irrespective of his face being on My Kitchen Rules. 'They consistently say there is no source of collection, there is no avenue for us to collect revenue,' she said. Upset: The blonde single mother says she went on the show for the tell all after Adam's allegedly blocked her calls and the numbers of their two eldest daughters. Making money? Cindy said she was most upset because her ex speaks of coaching at private schools but is allegedly unable to pay monies to his children. Spokesman and General Manager for the Department of Human services, who over-sees the Child Support Agency, Hank Jongen told Brady: 'I can't talk about individual cases but let me assure you, that we go to great lengths in order to enforce child support obligations.' 'We will do whatever it takes to recover that money,' he added. While Cindy claims she wrote to producers of the show to find out if he was being paid for his appearances to garnish money from his wages, she was left without a response. A Channel Seven spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia in response to Cindy's claims: 'This is a private matter between the parties involved.' Channel Seven also refuted the claim, that Adam and Pete are friends: 'They [Adam and Pete] met for the first time on the program'. On TV: Cindy says there is no bitterness that Adam has moved on and  re-married recently, to his MKR partner Carol Molloy (pictured) Friends in high place? Adam's ex-wife also claims the former tennis pro used to coach judge Pete Evans, a claim Channel Seven refute.

These new buildings included 5,900 new schools; 9,300 new auditoriums, gyms, and recreational buildings; 1,000 new libraries; 7,000 new dormitories; and 900 new armories. In addition, infrastructure projects included 2,302 stadiums, grandstands, and bleachers; 52 fairgrounds and rodeo grounds; 1,686 parks covering 75,152 acres; 3,185 playgrounds; 3,026 athletic fields; 805 swimming pools; 1,817 handball courts; 10,070 tennis courts; 2,261 horseshoe pits; 1,101 ice-skating areas; 138 outdoor theatres; 254 golf courses; and 65 ski jumps. Total expenditures on WPA projects through June 1941 totaled approximately 11.4 billion—the equivalent of }} today. Over 4 billion was spent on highway, road, and street projects; more than 1 billion on public buildings, including the iconic Dock Street Theatre in Charleston, the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, and Timberline Lodge in Oregons Mount Hood National Forest.
