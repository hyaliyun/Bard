Build a movie plot around this: What do Jimmy and his fellow patrol officers find in the abandoned cab? the dead cab driver A:","output":"Title: The Mystery of Yellow Cab 13 Step 1: Introduce the protagonist group and their daily lives We start by introducing the protagonist, Jimmy, a dedicated and smart police officer, and his colleagues in their police station. A close-knit group of officers, they are shown patrolling their beats and engaging in casual banter to showcase their camaraderie. The city is known for its mysterious events and unsolved cases, but things have been quiet lately – almost too quiet. Step 2: Discovery of the abandoned cab While on a nightly patrol, Jimmy and his fellow officers notice a yellow cab parked in an abandoned lot – a strange sight in their neck of the woods. The cab itself, Yellow Cab 13, is notorious in the city for its history of unexplained incidents. Curious, the officers decide to investigate and to their horror, they find the dead body of the cab driver inside. Step 3: Initiate the investigation It soon becomes clear that something sinister is at play. The cab is searched for clues and its dashboard camera reveals a cryptic message, \\"The End Begins.\\" The officers consider all possibilities, from gang violence to supernatural forces. Jimmy, the most determined of them all, decides to dig deeper into the history of Yellow Cab 13 and its dead driver, believing it could help solve the case. Step 4: Uncover the secret organization As Jimmy investigates further, he uncovers a secret organization that has been operating in the shadows for decades. They call themselves \\"The Keepers,\\" and have been using Yellow Cab 13 as a method to transport their high-level targets: criminals, whistleblowers, or those who pose a threat to them. The cab driver was a member of this organization, responsible for handling their dirty work. Step 5: Expose corruption and face danger While grappling with the idea of a secret organization being involved, Jimmy and his fellow officers find proof that incriminates several high-ranking members within the police department. These corrupt officials have been collaborating with The Keepers for years. Feeling the pressure, these officials now target the investigators to protect their secret alliance. Step 6: Climactic confrontation Jimmy and his fellow patrol officers, now marked for death, must use their wits and resourcefulness to outsmart The Keepers and the corrupt officials. A thrilling high-stakes game of cat and mouse ensues, leading to a final confrontation where Jimmy manages to record a confession from one of the corrupt officials and capture the leader of The Keepers. Step 7: Resolution and justice With evidence in hand and The Keepers dismantled, Jimmy brings the corrupt officials to justice, restoring the integrity of the police department. The film ends with the officers receiving recognition for their bravery and commitment to truth. They resume their duties, forever changed by the experience, and continue to protect the city from all threats, no matter how hidden they may be."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Review: I reflect back to the days when I held my boyfriends hat to smell him into existence in my time alone when I was 16. The little moments of this film are so accurate and right on pace with what is going on in the minds and hearts of young girls during those coming of age teenage years. Now at my age I want to preach to them about their decisions and how life during those times are not as important as it all seems in those moments. That if they can be patient in their youth and wait to experience the hardships of life both external and internal that life would be so much sweeter. But then again young people today are faced with some variables that I never had to deal with a youth. The three main characters well played by all three actors (Kerry Wahington - Lanisha, Anna Simpson - Joycelyn and Melissa Martinez- Maria) give us the very believable depiction of a piece of reality for young girls living in impoverished situations. They have impoverished family lives all being raised by single mothers with expectation of Lanisha whose father is present but not actively supporting her day to day. The have impoverished educational systems and lack direct contact with achieving role models. These situations powerfully affect them and is their reality but all this is of no great depressive concern to these young women in their day to day. They except their plight and focus on the same things young girls all over the world are concerned with. Finding true love in a male, having good friends that you can depend on, gaining some respect/love and responsibility from parents and enjoying life. This is were this film cross the race, age and gender gap imposed upon it by its characters and the setting in which it is stamped. The Director and writer McKay explains on the DVD how each of scenes got into his head, by just observing young people of that age that lived in those types of neighborhoods. Plus you add three up and coming actresses who are not so far removed from that time in their own lives that you get a real good synergy of reality and acting at its best. The one thing I know about (African Americans and Hispanics) is that there is always a spiritual family member or neighbor that is in the foreground or near ground believing in a better day and better life and future in spite of the present situation and is role modeling that to some extent. This was never touched in the movie in order not to preach and I understand that but it also narrows the culture to having no hope in anything other than themselves. The HOPE FACTOR: I now think about my future and where I have come from and say as Lanisha did \` Today is a good day.' Yes poverty still exists, racism, sexism, and any other ism that we can added. Yes some of each of these young girls actions perpetuate the isms and are self-destructive, everything around them is impoverished but NONE of those actions past or neither present nor their environment leaves them without hope for a bright future. I was left with saddened hope of each of the characters and a deeper desire to be a role model in the life of some young girl on the edge of making a destructive decision. I suppose that is the value of film it should not only entertain but cause each of us to think, reflect and then act in some positive way to make this world a better place.

A:","output":"Yes I used the definition of positive sentiment, considering whether the reviewer expressed a favorable opinion, enjoyed the movie, or praised its aspects.

Milestone 1, Build 7850, was leaked on April 12, 2011. It was the first build where the text of a window was written centered instead of aligned to the left. It was also probably the first appearance of the Metro-style font, and its wallpaper had the text shhh... let's not leak our hard work. However, its detailed build number reveals that the build was created on September 22, 2010. The leaked copy edition was Enterprise edition. The OS still reads as \\"Windows 7\\".

Alongside these changes, a new wallpaper with the text \\"shhh... let's not leak our hard work\\" was featured, hinting at Microsoft's desire to keep their work-in-progress under wraps. In addition to the previously mentioned changes in Build 7850, subsequent leaked builds of Windows 8 brought other alterations.

The family of a surfer who had his hand and part of his arm torn off in a shark attack have launched an appeal to help fund his long road to recovery. Sean Pollard is now in a stable condition at the Royal Perth hospital after he was mauled by a shark at Wylie Bay, east of Esperance on Western Australia's south coast on Thursday. A Facebook page has been set up thanking everyone for their support, encouraging people to donate to aid in Sean's recovery and rehabilitation. Scroll down for video. Sean Pollard's family have launched an appeal for his long road to recovery. Department of Fisheries examinations have revealed that the bite marks on Sean Pollard's surfboard would indicate a Great White shark was responsible for the attack. A facebook page has been set up thanking everyone for their support, encouraging people to donate to aid in Sean Pollard's recovery and rehabilitation after he was mauled by a shark at Wylie Bay on WA's south coast on Thursday. It read, 'Upon the attack he(Sean Pollard) was airlifted to RPH in Perth by the Royal Flying Doctors for further medical treatment.' 'The time ahead will be one of many challenges and he will be needing plenty of support & assistance. To assist Sean & his family, donations either small or large will be greatly appreciated.' The appeal comes as WA fisheries have revealed bite marks on the 23 year old's surfboard, indicate a Great White shark was responsible for his injuries. The two white sharks that were killed by fisheries officers following the incident were taken to Perth for examination by the department's experts. Department of Fisheries' principal shark scientist Dr. Rory McAuley said those examinations were unable to confirm whether either shark was involved in the incident. He said while results were inconclusive, it was not uncommon for sharks to disgorge their stomach contents when they were caught. 'We have also examined the surfboard used by the man involved in the incident on Thursday and indications are that a white shark was responsible for the injuries he received,' he said. Surfer Sean Pollard lost parts of both arms in the attack near Esperance, Western Australia on Thursday. Sean Pollard was flown to Perth by the Royal Flying Doctor Service within hours of the attack on Thursday which is believed to have been caused by a Great White shark. Examinations by Fisheries scientists have revealed that the bite on Sean's surfboard was caused by a Great White shark. 'Jaw measurements will also help with future bite investigations. The first white shark caught is 3.46 metres long; the second white shark is 2.68 metres in length.' An online appeal to help in Sean's recovery has also been launched and has already raised over 5000. 'Our team has since collected samples from both sharks including sections of vertebrae, which will assist us with our research work.' 'Now that our investigation is complete, material will be made available to other research institutions,' said Dr. McAuley. WA Premier Colin Barnett said it was necessary to kill the two white pointers because they posed an imminent threat to public safety. 'The threat is there and sadly (Thursday) just demonstrated how likely a shark attack can happen,' Mr Barnett said. 'Perth beaches are probably as safe as we can reasonably make them (but) the south west and the southern coastline is a different matter.' It was the first time white pointers - a protected species - had been killed by WA officials. Fisheries shark response unit manager Lisa Clack defended the move amid reports Mr Pollard might have been mauled by two bronze whalers, saying it was 'more likely' a white pointer was responsible. Beaches in the Wylie Bay area have now been reopened and no new shark sightings or reports in the area have been made since the incident. Caution signs at key access points will remain in place, while department vessels which have been on the water will remain on patrol. Incident: The attack occurred in scenic Wylie Bay, on Western Australia's south coast. A separate online appeal has also been launched on Indiegogo Fundraiser, encouraging everyone to give generously towards Sean's recovery. Set up by Natalie Banks, founder of the No WA sharks culls campaign, it said,'Sean's medical assistance would not have been cheap at all! Let's show how much we really do care about people!' 'Every effort is being taken to get a hold of Sean's family in terms of this fundraiser, including calling Bunbury Police, South Bunbury Football Club and certain members of the media.' 'I got involved because it's a tragic incident and because of my connections with family and those who have had shark attacks before, they need all the support they can get,' said Ms Banks. So far the appeal has raised well over its 1000 goal and is at more than 5000 with more than 100 people donating. 'Blown away by the support of the community.' 'So we've been speaking to Paul De Gelder (shark attack survivor) in Sydney to see if he'll speak to Sean, depends if Sean is willing,' she said. 'Assist (fundraising money) Paul to go from Sydney to Perth, the rest will go all to medical expenses involved in surgery he has had and the treatment he's going to need, including counselling for family.' The campaign will close on October 14. The sharks campaigner says the system has let Sean down and more needs to be done to educate people in what's happening at their popular beaches. 'In Cape Town South Africa, there's a shark spotters program, flags and alerts, to alert people of shark activity.' 'We're not doing enough of this in WA. There needs to be a national view on this, I think, how can educating people harm the public,' said Ms Banks. 'Think government needs to do more for surfers and beach goers to have greater access to devices that are proven to work..., surf smart (electronic devices on surfboards), wet suits which deter sharks, these things should be available to the public at subsidised costs.' 'Why are these products not more accessible when our premier is talking public safety issues.'

The police also accused Smith of physical assault and using offensive language. Race relations had been growing more tense over the year as Newark Mayor Hugh Addonizio announced a series of decisions that had angered the African-American community.

Others may regard the starting day of their work as the most meaningful. They think it's the first big step in their life and they can depend on themselves.

Process:  - Ice forms inside a cloud - Ice inside the cloud bumps around and causes electrostatic charges - The cloud becomes a thundercloud - Electrostatic energy builds and forms a strong negative charge - Positive energy is attracted to the negative energy in the cloud - This positive energy gathers on the ground - The positive energy connects with the negative energy and forms lightning.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are more clouds that build up happens, how will it affect MORE or MORE POWERFUL lightning.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"To analyze the perturbation hypothesis, we will examine the effect of an increase in cloud buildup on the formation and power of lightning. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the hypothesis: 1. Ice forms inside a cloud: If there are more clouds, this means there are more opportunities for ice to form inside these clouds. 2. Ice inside the cloud bumps around and causes electrostatic charges: With more clouds and more ice, there will be greater interactions between ice particles, leading to more electrostatic charges being generated. 3. The cloud becomes a thundercloud: As more electrostatic charges build up in these clouds, the likelihood of these clouds turning into thunderclouds increases. 4. Electrostatic energy builds and forms a strong negative charge: With more thunderclouds, the buildup of electrostatic energy will be more significant, leading to stronger negative charges forming in these clouds. 5. Positive energy is attracted to the negative energy in the cloud: With stronger negative charges in the cloud, a greater amount of positive energy will likely be attracted from the surrounding environment. 6. This positive energy gathers on the ground: With stronger negative charges in the clouds, more positive energy is attracted to the ground, accumulating a larger overall charge. 7. The positive energy connects with the negative energy and forms lightning: As the charges between the ground and the cloud increase, the likelihood of lightning forming will also increase due to the stronger attraction between the positive and negative charges. In conclusion, if more clouds are introduced within the given scenario, it will most likely lead to more frequent lightning occurrences and, potentially, more powerful lightning. This is because the increase in cloud buildup creates more opportunities for ice formation and subsequent interactions, leading to increased electrostatic charges and an enhanced attraction between positive and negative charges. Thus, the perturbation hypothesis suggests a direct effect on the process of lightning formation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Americans get some of their news and entertainment from public television and radio. These public media receive money to operate from private citizens, organizations and government. Many of their programs are educational. But most of the American media are run by businesses for profit. These privately owned media have changed greatly in recent years. Newspapers, magazines and traditional broadcast television organizations have lost some of their popularity. At the same time, online, cable and satellite media have increased in numbers and strength. So have media that serve racial groups and those communicating in foreign languages. In general, more media than ever now provide Americans with news and entertainment. At the same time, fewer owners control them. Huge companies have many holdings . In some areas, one company controls much of the media. One dramatic change in American media is the increased success of cable television. It comes into most homes over wires. It does not use the public airwaves to present programs, as broadcast television does. Like broadcast television, most cable television programs perform advertisements. This is true although people must pay to see cable television in their homes. Thirty years ago, few people had cable. Today, about sixty-eight percent of American homes have cable television. Television by satellite also is gaining popularity. Over the years, traditional broadcast organizations have tried to appeal to as many watchers as possible. Many cable companies, however, present programs for one special group of viewers. For example, there are cable stations for people who like books, cooking, travel, golf or comedy.

Information:  - The term suspension of disbelief or willing suspension of disbelief has been defined as a willingness to suspend one's critical faculties and believe the unbelievable; sacrifice of realism and logic for the sake of enjoyment. The term was coined in 1817 by the poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who suggested that if a writer could infuse a \\"human interest and a semblance of truth\\" into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgement concerning the implausibility of the narrative. Suspension of disbelief often applies to fictional works of the action, comedy, fantasy, and horror genres. Cognitive estrangement in fiction involves using a person's ignorance to promote suspension of disbelief.  - Professional wrestling is a dramatized athletic performance inspired by competitive combat sports. Taking the form of live events held by touring promotions, it is a unique style of combat based on a combination of adopted styles, which include classical wrestling, catch wrestling and various forms of martial arts, as well as an innovative style based on grappling (holds/throws), striking, and aerialism. Various forms of weaponry are sometimes used. The content  including match outcomes  is choreographed and the combative actions and reactions are performed to appear violent without injuring the wrestlers. Before the 1980s, these facts were kept highly secret, after which they were openly declared. By and large, the true nature of the content is ignored by the performing promotion in official media in order to sustain and promote the willing suspension of disbelief for the audience by maintaining an aura of verisimilitude. Fan communications by individual wrestlers and promotions through outside media (i.e., interviews) will often directly acknowledge the fictional nature of the spectacle, making the predetermined nature of the sport something of an open secret. The presentation of scripted events as legitimate is known as \\"kayfabe\\".  - Jerry W. Jarrett Sr. (born September 4, 1942 in Nashville, Tennessee) is an American promoter and former professional wrestler, and the father of wrestler Jeff Jarrett. He is the co-founder and former part-owner of Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. Like World Wrestling Entertainment Chairman Vince McMahon, Jarrett was initially a promoter and became a wrestler later in life.  - The American Wrestling Association (AWA) was an American professional wrestling promotion based in Minneapolis, Minnesota that ran from 1960 to 1991. It was owned and founded by Verne Gagne and Wally Karbo. The territory was originally part of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), becoming an independent territory in the late 1950s.  - In general, spectacle refers to an event that is memorable for the appearance it creates. Derived in Middle English from c. 1340 as \\"specially prepared or arranged display\\" it was borrowed from Old French \\"spectacle\\", itself a reflection of the Latin \\"spectaculum\\" \\"a show\\" from \\"spectare\\" \\"to view, watch\\" frequentative form of \\"specere\\" \\"to look at.\\" The word \\"spectacle\\" has also been a term of art in theater dating from the 17th century in English drama.  - Lord Humongous is a professional wrestling character also known as a \`\` gimmick '' that was originally introduced in Memphis ' Continental Wrestling Association ( CWA ) in 1984 . The character was based on a gang leader called \`\` the Humungus '' or at times \`\` Lord Humungus '' from the 1981 movie Mad Max 2 : The Road Warrior . The original Lord Humongous was portrayed by Mike Stark , who was tall and physically impressive like the character in the movie . Since Lord Humongous always wears a Hockey mask it allowed promoters to replace the man under the mask without having to publicly acknowledge that it was someone else playing the part . The character became a recurring gimmick on the CWA but was also used in other promotions after the CWA closed . The character has been played by a number of wrestlers including Jeff Van Kamp , Sid Vicious and Barry Buchanan and Sid 's son Gunnar Eudy .  - A ring name is a stage name used by a professional wrestler, martial artist, or a boxer. While some ring names may have a fictitious first name and surname, others may simply be a nickname from the moves that they do or their talents in the ring.  - The United States Wrestling Association or USWA was a professional wrestling promotion based in Memphis, Tennessee. The company was founded when the Memphis-based Continental Wrestling Association merged with the Dallas-based World Class Wrestling Association.  - The National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) is a professional wrestling governing body which has historically been the largest league of independent wrestling promotions in the world. The organization sanctions various NWA championship bouts within its member promotions. The NWA has been in operation since 1948. Prior to the 1960s, it acted as the sole governing body for most of professional wrestling, operating as a talent and brand name franchiser for the inter-regional \\"territory\\" system.  - Continental Wrestling Association (later on Championship Wrestling Association) was a wrestling promotion managed by Jerry Jarrett. The CWA was the name of the \\"governing body\\" for the Championship Wrestling, Inc. promotion which was usually referred to as Mid-Southern Wrestling or the Memphis territory. This promotion was a chief NWA territory during the 1970s and early 1980s while operating out of Tennessee and Kentucky. The CWA was a member of the National Wrestling Alliance until 1986 and affiliated with the American Wrestling Association until 1989. In 1989, the CWA merged with the World Class Wrestling Association to form the United States Wrestling Association thus ceasing to exist as a separate entity.  - In professional wrestling, kayfabe is the portrayal of staged events within the industry as \\"real\\" or \\"true,\\" specifically the portrayal of competition, rivalries, and relationships between participants as being genuine and not of a staged or pre-determined nature of any kind. Kayfabe has also evolved to become a code word of sorts for maintaining this \\"reality\\" within the direct or indirect presence of the general public. Though the staged nature of professional wrestling had been a frequent topic of conversation among the media and public since at least the latter years of the early 20th century, the professional wrestling industry did not formally acknowledge this until changes in the business during the 1980s professional wrestling boom prompted attitudes within the business to change. In 1989, World Wrestling Federation owner Vince McMahon testified before the New Jersey state senate that wrestling was staged. Long sanctioned by New Jersey and other states as an athletic exhibition for regulation and taxation purposes, McMahon sought to eliminate oversight, and hence taxation, on the WWF's house shows and pay-per-view events held within the state.  - Jeff VanCamp, Sr. is an American retired professional wrestler, who wrestled under the ring names Jeff Van Kamp/Jeff Van Camp as well as working as Lord Humongous in 1984 and 1985. He is a former NWA Alabama Heavyweight Champion and NWA Southeast Continental Heavyweight Champion.  - Catch wrestling is a classical hybrid grappling style that was developed in Britain circa 1870 by J. G. Chambers, then later refined and popularised by the wrestlers of travelling funfairs who developed their own submission holds, or \\"hooks\\", into their wrestling to increase their effectiveness against their opponents. Catch wrestling derives from a number of different styles, the English styles of Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling, Cornwall and Devon wrestling, Lancashire wrestling, Irish collar-and-elbow wrestling, Greco-Roman wrestling, styles of the Indian subcontinent such as Pehlwani, Jujutsu and Iranian styles such as Varzesh-e Pahlavani. The training of some modern submission wrestlers, professional wrestlers and mixed martial artists is founded in catch wrestling.  - A combat sport, or fighting sport, is a competitive contact sport with one-on-one combat. Determining the winner depends on the particular contest's rules. In many fighting sports, a contestant wins by scoring more points than the opponent or by disabling the opponent. Boxing, wrestling, Muay Thai, Tae Kwon Do, Judo, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, Sambo, and Mixed Martial Arts are examples of combat sports.  - Martial arts are codified systems and traditions of combat practices, which are practiced for a number of reasons: as self-defense, military and law enforcement applications, mental and spiritual development; as well as entertainment and the preservation of a nation's intangible cultural heritage.    What is the relationship between 'lord humongous' and 'professional wrestler'? Answer:","output":"Lord Humongous is a professional wrestling character or \\"gimmick\\". It was originally introduced in Memphis' Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) in 1984. The character was based on a gang leader from the 1981 movie Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior.

On September 19, having buried their non-essential possessions in a mound marked by a tent pole, they set out in search of settlements. Progress was hampered by the poor physical condition of the men, in particular Eriksen, who was badly affected by frostbite. On September 21 they halted at two empty huts, probably part of a hunting camp, where Alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks. De Long allowed his exhausted party several days' rest before resuming the march.On September 28 the party found a large hut, with signs of recent occupation–edible food in the store, and moccasin tracks in the snow. When searches in the locality brought no sign of people, De Long decided to move on.

I found the following answer on Google: The princess cut is a relatively new diamond cut, having been created in the 1960s. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"Yes, the answer you found is correct. Square diamonds are commonly known as \\"princess cut\\" diamonds. The princess cut is a modern and popular diamond cut which was indeed created in the 1960s. It is characterized by its square or rectangular shape, and offers a brilliant and eye-catching appearance due to its unique facet arrangement. The princess cut is the second most popular diamond cut after the round brilliant cut, and it is highly sought after for engagement rings and other jewelry items. The cut showcases the incredible sparkle and fire of a diamond while maintaining a geometric and contemporary look. This cut is particularly popular among those who appreciate a balance of brilliance and individuality; it offers a distinctive alternative to the more traditional round shape. The princess cut diamond's stunning appearance is attributed to the way it is cut, combining the classic step-cut approach with the more modern brilliant-cut technique. This combination maximizes the stone's fire, brilliance, and scintillation, creating a captivating visual effect. In addition to the princess cut, other square-shaped diamond cuts exist as well, such as the cushion cut (which has rounded corners and resembles a pillow) and the asscher cut (a square emerald cut with a high crown and deep pavilion).

Paragraph: The factory is highly automated and designed to shift flexibly to produce many different kinds of chips to suit demand. \\"The diversity is the big difference with this plant,\\" said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a research firm. \\"It gives IBM the capability to make so many different kinds of custom chips, and the world is going to custom chips.\\" The 140,000-square-foot plant is a testament to advanced manufacturing technology. The 300-millimeter silicon wafers -- about the size of a standard pizza -- are shuttled around the facility in enclosed plastic pods, which ride on overhead tracks. They drop down from wires automatically into machines, sheathed in stainless steel and glass, for each stage of processing and fabrication. Throughout the 500 processing steps, which typically last 20 days, the wafers are not touched by human hands. The circuits etched into the chips are less than one thousandth the width of a human hair. Human operators are there to monitor the systems, catch errors and fine-tune the production process for maximum efficiency. Because each of the hundreds of processing machines is self-enclosed, and essentially airtight, the uniforms operators wear are less constricting than in the previous generation of chip plants, which looked like space suits.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer:  twelve years old  for the following movie plot:  A security guard is running through a subway station, he eventually enters a room he cannot escape from and starts begging his reflection in a mirror for his life. Suddenly, his reflection cuts its throat with a mirror shard, killing the \\"real\\" security guard. Ben Carson (Kiefer Sutherland), a suspended police detective, begins his first day as a night security guard at the Mayflower, a luxury department store that was gutted by a fire and shuttered five years prior. The building still contains numerous mirrors from the store. On Ben's first night of patrol he finds a mirror that appears to be covered with handprints, but only on the reflected side of the glass. He sees an open door in the reflection while it is actually closed. Over time, Ben begins to see more intense visions, which he initially shrugs off as hallucinations. He soon finds the wallet of Gary Lewis, the previous night guard (who died at the beginning of the film). Inside is a note that says \\"Esseker\\". After viewing Garyâs crime photos Ben is convinced that the mirrors make people do things to themselves that they are not actually doing. Meanwhile, Ben's sister, Angie (Amy Smart) is killed by her reflection as it grips its jaw and slowly pull its mouth apart, causing her to bleed profusely. Ben is distraught when he finds her body. In anger, he attempts to destroy the mirrors at the Mayflower, but they are impervious to damage. He demands to know what the mirrors want, and cracks appear on one of the mirrors, spelling out the word \\"ESSEKER\\". Ben enters the flooded basement of the Mayflower and finds a small sign stating \\"Psychiatric Studies\\" and \\"St. Matthew's Hospital\\" underneath. He moves to the site of the leak and begins pulling at the tiles and brick of the wall and finds a room with a chair surrounded by mirrors beyond it, a Psychomanteum. Realizing that the Mayflower was built on the site of an earlier hospital, Ben asks his police friend Larry (Jason Flemyng) to help him locate the patient-employee manifest for the hospital. Larry...

American Airlines Flight 11: FAA Awareness. Although the Boston Center air traffic controller realized at an early stage that there was something wrong with American 11, he did not immediately interpret the plane's failure to respond as a sign that it had been hijacked. At 8:14, when the flight failed to heed his instruction to climb to 35,000 feet, the controller repeatedly tried to raise the flight. He reached out to the pilot on the emergency frequency. Though there was no response, he kept trying to contact the aircraft. At 8:21, American 11 turned off its transponder, immediately degrading the information available about the aircraft. The controller told his supervisor that he thought something was seriously wrong with the plane, although neither suspected a hijacking. The supervisor instructed the controller to follow standard procedures for handling a \\"no radio\\" aircraft. The controller checked to see if American Airlines could establish communication with American 11. He became even more concerned as its route changed, moving into another sector's airspace. Controllers immediately began to move aircraft out of its path, and asked other aircraft in the vicinity to look for American 11. At 8:24:38, the following transmission came from American 11: American 11: We have some planes. Just stay quiet, and you'll be okay. We are returning to the airport. The controller only heard something unintelligible; he did not hear the specific words \\"we have some planes.\\" The next transmission came seconds later: American 11: Nobody move. Everything will be okay. If you try to make any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane.  Question: \\"What did Controllers do after Flight 11 changed route?\\" Response: \\"Move other planes out of Flight 11s path\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question.

Q:Given the following context:  Poulenc made his début as a composer in 1917 with his Rapsodie nègre, a ten-minute, five-movement piece for baritone and chamber group; it was dedicated to Satie and premiered at one of a series of concerts of new music run by the singer Jane Bathori. There was a fashion for African arts in Paris at the time, and Poulenc was delighted to run across some published verses purportedly Liberian, but full of Parisian boulevard slang. He used one of the poems in two sections of the rhapsody. The baritone engaged for the first performance lost his nerve on the platform, and the composer, though no singer, jumped in. This jeu d'esprit was the first of many examples of what Anglophone critics came to call \\"leg-Poulenc\\". Ravel was amused by the piece and commented on Poulenc's ability to invent his own folklore. Stravinsky was impressed enough to use his influence to secure Poulenc a contract with a publisher, a kindness that Poulenc never forgot. In completely arbitrary fashion Collet chose the names of six composers, Auric, Durey, Honegger, Poulenc, Tailleferre and myself, for no other reason than that we knew each other, that we were friends and were represented in the same programmes, but without the slightest concern for our different attitudes and our different natures. Auric and Poulenc followed the ideas of Cocteau, Honegger was a product of German Romanticism and my leanings were towards a Mediterranean lyrical art ... Collet's article made such a wide impression that the Groupe des Six had come into being. Cocteau, though similar in age to Les Six, was something of a father-figure to the group. His literary style, \\"paradoxical and lapidary\\" in Hell's phrase, was anti-romantic, concise and irreverent. It greatly appealed to Poulenc, who made his first setting of Cocteau's words in 1919 and his last in 1961. When members of Les Six collaborated with each other, they contributed their own individual sections to the joint work. Their 1920 piano suite L'Album des Six consists of six separate and unrelated pieces....  answer the following question:  What is the name of the person whose literary style was anti-romantic, concise and irreverent?

Plot title: Stalag 17 Movie plot: Captured Americans coping with life in a German POW camp in World War II are puzzled by the simplicity with which the Germans are able to stave off escape attempts, shooting those who try. Sefton (William Holden) is a POW who has profitably wagered with his fellow American prisoners that these escapes would fail.The POWs fear there may be an informer in their midst, but who is it? As it becomes clearer and clearer to his fellow inmates that Sefton has considerable contact with his German captors, his fellow POWs mistakenly conclude that he is the informer and they turn on him, including physically beating him and helping themselves to some of his belongings.Sefton understands in full that to clear his name, he must determine the identity of the real informer, and he is, eventually, able to work out that Price (Peter Graves), whose English is impeccable, is a German informant masquerading as an American POW. Written messages, Sefton discovers, are being smuggled by Price to the Germans through a hollow chess piece on the chessboard in the barracks, wth phony air raid drills staged to enable the Germans to retrieve these messages undetected.Now realizing that Price has figured prominently in the death of the Americans that have attempted escape, Sefton plots revenge, and, after exposing Price's true identity to his fellow POWs, he maneuvers to force Price to make an unauthorized exit from the barracks. To the guards manning the tower, Price's exit looks like an American escape attempt, and they shoot him, much to the dismay of Stalag Commandant Von Scherbach (Otto Preminger).The diversion created by the shooting incident gives Sefton a chance to escape, and he takes with him a brave lieutenant (Don Taylor) who has recently been captured. Because of the measures of success against the Germans he had gained prior to his capture, the lieutenant is a marked man, but he and Sefton are successful in their escape attempt.The elimination of the German informer and the first successful escape by American POWs lift the...

Michael was replacing a fuel rod in the nuclear reactor when a small explosion happened, causing Michael to be exposed to high doses of radiation in a short period of time.  Robert was in the adjacent room when the explosion happened, and as a result he only suffered low doses of radiation.  Who is more likely to die after this event?  Hint: Ionizing radiation has many practical uses in medicine, research and construction, but presents a health hazard if used improperly. Exposure to radiation causes damage to living tissue; high doses result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), with skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure and death, while any dose may result in an increased chance of cancer and genetic damage; a particular form of cancer, thyroid cancer, often occurs when nuclear weapons and reactors are the radiation source because of the biological proclivities of the radioactive iodine fission product, iodine-131. However, calculating the exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by ionizing radiation is still not well understood and currently estimates are loosely determined by population based data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and from follow-up of reactor accidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster. The International Commission on Radiological Protection states that \\"The Commission is aware of uncertainties and lack of precision of the models and parameter values\\", \\"Collective effective dose is not intended as a tool for epidemiological risk assessment, and it is inappropriate to use it in risk projections\\" and \\"in particular, the calculation of the number of cancer deaths based on collective effective doses from trivial individual doses should be avoided.\\" A:","output":"Michael is more likely to die after this event, as he was exposed to high doses of radiation in a short period of time, which can result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS).

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: On April 12 what island did Shackleton decide to travel to? , can you please find it?   The end of Patience Camp was signalled on the evening of 8 April, when the floe suddenly split. The camp now found itself on a small triangular raft of ice; a break-up of this would mean disaster, so Shackleton readied the lifeboats for the party's enforced departure. He had now decided they would try, if possible, to reach the distant Deception Island because a small wooden church had been reportedly erected for the benefit of whalers. This could provide a source of timber that might enable them to construct a seaworthy boat.At 1 p.m. on 9 April, the Dudley Docker was launched, and an hour later all three boats were away. Shackleton himself commanded the James Caird, Worsley the Dudley Docker, and navigating officer Hubert Hudson was nominally in charge of the Stancomb Wills, though because of his precarious mental state the effective commander was Tom Crean.The boats were surrounded by ice, dependent upon leads of water opening up, and progress was perilous and erratic. Frequently the boats were tied to floes, or dragged up onto them, while the men camped and waited for conditions to improve. Shackleton was wavering again between several potential destinations, and on 12 April, rejected the various island options and decided on Hope Bay, at the very tip of Graham Land. However, conditions in the boats, in temperatures sometimes as low as −20 °F (−29 °C), with little food and regular soakings in icy seawater, were wearing the men down, physically and mentally. Shackleton therefore decided that Elephant Island, the nearest of the possible refuges, was now the most practical option.On 14 April, the boats lay off the south-east coast of Elephant Island, but could not land as the shore consisted of perpendicular cliffs and glaciers. Next day the James Caird rounded the eastern point of the island, to reach the northern lee shore, and discovered a narrow shingle beach. Soon afterwards, the three boats, which had been separated during the previous night, were reunited at this landing place. It was apparent from...

The Alaska Permanent Fund is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues, established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil, largely in anticipation of the recently constructed Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. The fund was originally proposed by Governor Keith Miller on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale, out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale (which amounted to 900 million) at once. It was later championed by Governor Jay Hammond and Kenai state representative Hugh Malone. It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since, diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Why did Governor Keith Miller propose the Alaska Permanent Fund before the Prudhoe Bay sale?","output":"Governor Keith Miller proposed the Alaska Permanent Fund before the Prudhoe Bay sale for a combination of reasons, primarily rooted in fiscal responsibility and ensuring a sustainable economic outlook for the state. Here are some of the key factors that contributed to his decision: 1. Anticipation of substantial oil revenues: In 1969, Alaska was on the verge of experiencing a significant windfall from the Prudhoe Bay lease sale. The sale was expected to bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Gov. Miller believed that it was important to protect and manage these funds in an organized way for the long-term benefit of Alaskans. 2. Preventing reckless spending: Gov. Miller was concerned that if the entire proceeds from the Prudhoe Bay lease sale were made immediately available to the legislature, there was a potential risk that the funds would be rapidly spent without due consideration for the future. By proposing the establishment of the Alaska Permanent Fund, he intended to create a mechanism that would encourage responsible allocation and deployment of the petroleum wealth. 3. Economic stability: Miller sought to ensure that the revenue generated from the oil industry would not just be a one-time boost to the state's economy but would also be a steady source of funds for future generations. Establishing the Permanent Fund was a way to create a savings account for Alaska that could generate income for the state, contributing to economic stability even after the oil reserves had diminished.  4. Diversification of the state's revenue: One of the goals behind the Permanent Fund was to create a diversified source of revenue, instead of being heavily reliant on the oil industry. By investing a portion of oil royalties into this fund, the state could grow its financial assets through various investments, providing a more stable and diversified flow of income. 5. Equitable distribution of wealth: Gov. Miller, along with subsequent advocates of the Permanent Fund, wanted to make sure that all Alaskans benefitted from the state's vast oil resources. This philosophy was later materialized through the annual Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend, which distributes a share of the fund's earnings directly to the state's residents. In summary, Governor Keith Miller proposed the Alaska Permanent Fund before the Prudhoe Bay sale to ensure responsible management of the state's oil revenues, prevent reckless spending, create a lasting savings account, diversify the state's sources of income, and provide equitable distribution of wealth among Alaskans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Phoenix Sky Harbor ranks as the WORST airport of all time. Upon my flight arrival, exiting the tarmac ramp at the Frontier Airlines gate, I saw no electronic billboards, no tv screens and no information for connecting flights. No airport assistants or volunteers either! A TSA employee directed me to another security screening area. It turned out he gave me  the wrong directions. By the time I reached that wrong TSA check point a second TSA agent directed me to a MAZE of directions. Sheinformed me that I needed to go past the baggage pickup, out the door and far away. By that time, I had just minutes to make it to my flight back to Hawaii (home). I finally found an \\"assistance\\" desk on my way past the luggage pickup. He told me to exit the building, go outside, walk 30 feet and wait for a bus that would take me to my gate(US Airways Terminal).  He also tells me I am going to miss my flight. As I'm running like crazy, I see another man getting directions from a TSA agent! Meanwhile, I'm standing OUTSIDE thinking \\"what the heck!\\" Finally the bus came and it dropped me off at the US Air terminal. Then I ran up an escalator, across a path and finally to TSA security where I had to go through security once again. As if they couldn't see I was out of breath. I know they looked at my ticket and saw my flight time! The TSA agent held up my screening because I took my laptop out of it's case and laid it \\"on top\\" of the thin, neoprene case. \\"I have to run this through again. You need to put the case in another bin and just leave the laptop in the bin all by itself.\\" Wow! I haven't heard that one in ALL my travels!

As a result, fewer seeds were available for finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could crack open and eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks could crack and eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. Birds with bigger beaks survived and reproduced (see Figure below ). Within 2 years, the average beak size in the finch population increased. Evolution by natural selection had occurred.  I am facing a new situation today: The explorers visited Galapagos 1 and Galapagos 2, both islands part of the same archipelago. Island 1 had experienced a drought in recent years. Both islands had populations of birds living there.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which island had more big-beaked birds survive? A:","output":"Using the knowledge from the background article, we can answer the question step-by-step: Step 1: Understand the information from the background article - Drought occurred on the Galápagos - Fewer seeds were available - Birds with smaller beaks could only eat smaller seeds - Birds with bigger beaks could eat seeds of all sizes - Small-beaked birds died in the drought - Big-beaked birds survived and reproduced - Average beak size in the finch population increased - Evolution by natural selection had occurred Step 2: Analyze the new situation - Explorers visited two islands (Galapagos 1 & 2), part of the same archipelago - Island 1 experienced a drought - Both islands had bird populations Step 3: Apply the information from the background article to the new situation Given the drought that occurred on Island 1, we can infer that the same sequence of events took place as in the background article. This means that birds with bigger beaks on Island 1 would have had a higher chance of survival due to their ability to eat seeds of all sizes, leading to a higher population of big-beaked birds on that island. Therefore, answering the question:  Island 1, which experienced a drought, would have more big-beaked birds survive due to the increased need for larger beaks to access limited food sources, ultimately leading to natural selection favoring birds with larger beaks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Background: Like water in the ocean, air in the atmosphere exerts pressure that increases with depth. Most gas molecules in the atmosphere are pulled close to Earth’s surface by gravity. As a result, air pressure decreases quickly at lower altitudes and then more slowly at higher altitudes. This is illustrated in Figure below . Air pressure is greatest at sea level, where the depth of the atmosphere is greatest. At higher altitudes, the pressure is less because the depth of the atmosphere is less. For example, on top of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth, air pressure is only about one-third of the pressure at sea level. At such high altitudes, low air pressure makes it hard to breathe and is dangerous to human health.  Paragraph: Molly has just moved to a new city for a job she was just hired for. She used to live in a city up in the mountains named Midgar. She liked living there due to the hikes she could go on and seeing the beautiful nature of the hills and mountains. The town she lives in now, Treno, is closer to sea level and is mostly flat plains and farm land. It's a change of scenery, and she hopes she starts to enjoy it more.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which city has an atmosphere with less depth? A:","output":"Midgar Step 1: Identify the relevant information from the background. From the background information, it is noted that \\"air pressure decreases quickly at lower altitudes and then more slowly at higher altitudes\\" and \\"air pressure is greatest at sea level, where the depth of the atmosphere is greatest.\\" Step 2: Identify the relevant information from the paragraph. From the paragraph, we know that Molly used to live in Midgar, which is up in the mountains and has now moved to the city Treno, which is closer to sea level and mostly consists of flat plains and farm land. Step 3: Compare the locations using the relevant information. Since Midgar is located in the mountains, it has a higher altitude than Treno. According to the background information, at higher altitudes, the depth of the atmosphere is less. Therefore, Midgar has an atmosphere with less depth compared to Treno."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This will give you an idea of if your caffeine intake is at an unhealthy level.  400 milligrams (the amount in four cups of coffee) of caffeine per day is usually considered safe for most adults. However, some people are more sensitive to it and should not even consume this much. If you consume caffeine and you have insomnia, restlessness, anxiety problems, fast heartbeat, headaches, muscle tremors, or extreme fidgeting you may be extra sensitive to caffeine and should cut back to little or no caffeine at all. This will allow you to avoid withdrawals or headaches. Caffeine is a drug that creates adrenaline surges, which your body gets used to. It could take a month to wean yourself from caffeine. If you are consuming a very high amount of caffeine, cut back slowly. Quitting quickly will cause withdrawal symptoms, like headaches. Too much refined sugar and foods with added processed sugar (candies, pop, cakes and cookies, some cereals) creates energy bursts and troughs, leaving you craving more. During the brief energy bursts, you are likely to fidget. Keep a log in a notebook, similar to your caffeine recordings, of how much refined sugar (candy, pop, cookies, etc.) you consume in a week. Fruit has some natural sugar, and this will help to slowly lower your intake of refined or artificial sugar because if you eat plenty of fruit you will crave other sugars less. Fruit is part of a healthy diet, and you should try to consume 4 servings (a serving is one piece of raw fruit the size of a baseball, or one cup of smaller fruits or 100% fruit juice) of fruit per day. If you are lacking in energy and turning to caffeine or refined sugar snacks to give you a boost, it may be because your diet is generally unhealthy. Be sure that you are consuming the right amount of a variety of vegetables, fruits, grains, and lean proteins each day. You should try to eat 4 servings of vegetables (one cup of raw or cooked veggies or vegetable juice, or 2 cups of leafy greens is one serving), 4 servings of fruit, 6-8 servings of whole grains (depending on age, gender, and activity level), 2-6 servings of lean protein (depending on age, gender, and activity level), and 2-3 servings (one cup) of dairy or dairy equivalents daily.","output":"To determine if your caffeine intake is at an unhealthy level, keep a log for a week, documenting your daily consumption of coffee, tea, soda, and chocolate. A daily intake of 400 milligrams of caffeine (equivalent to four cups of coffee) is generally considered safe for most adults. However, some individuals may be more sensitive to caffeine and should limit their intake, especially if they experience insomnia, restlessness, anxiety, fast heartbeat, headaches, muscle tremors, or excessive fidgeting. Gradually reducing caffeine consumption over a month can help prevent withdrawal symptoms, such as headaches. In addition to monitoring caffeine intake, keep track of your consumption of refined sugar, such as candies, soda, cookies, and other processed foods. Refined sugar can cause energy peaks and troughs, leading to cravings and increased fidgeting. Consuming fruit, which contains natural sugar, can help curb cravings for refined sugar, and promote a healthier diet overall. Aim to incorporate four servings of fruit daily as part of a balanced diet. A serving is equal to one piece of raw fruit (the size of a baseball), one cup of smaller fruits or 100% fruit juice. To maintain a healthy diet, consume the following servings daily: 4 servings of vegetables (1 cup of raw or cooked vegetables, vegetable juice, or 2 cups of leafy greens), 4 servings of fruit, 6-8 servings of whole grains (depending on age, gender, and activity level), 2-6 servings of lean protein (depending on age, gender, and activity level), and 2-3 servings (1 cup) of dairy or dairy equivalents. If you find yourself reliant on caffeine or refined sugar to boost your energy, it may be an indication of an unhealthy diet. Ensuring proper consumption of various vegetables, fruits, grains, and lean proteins will help regulate your energy levels and reduce the need for unhealthy stimulants like caffeine.

In this example, it is reasonable to assume that both statements are referring to the same action based on the context – that a girl is going down a slide.

Possible A: drowsiness, sleeping in, insomnia, exercise, pregnancy  Why is \\"pregnancy\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"Pregnancy is an answer aligned with human common sense for the question about weight gain and going to bed early due to multiple factors associated with the physiological, emotional, and lifestyle changes that occur during pregnancy.  1. Hormonal Changes: During pregnancy, a woman's body experiences significant hormonal changes that can lead to weight gain. The increase in hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) promotes fat storage and plays a crucial role in fetal development. Additionally, hormones like relaxin, which help to relax the joints and ligaments in preparation for childbirth, can also result in weight gain as the body retains fluid. 2. Fetal Development: As the fetus grows inside a pregnant woman's body, its weight contributes to the overall weight gain of the woman, adding to the gradual increase in body weight throughout pregnancy. 3. Increased Appetite: Pregnant women often experience increased appetite, which is the body's natural response to support the development of the fetus and provide adequate nourishment. Consequently, this can lead to weight gain due to increased caloric intake. 4. Reduced Physical Activity: Due to the physical discomfort and fatigue associated with pregnancy, many women consciously or unconsciously cut down on their physical activity levels. This reduction in physical activity, along with the increased caloric intake, can contribute to weight gain. 5. Fatigue and Sleep Pattern Changes: During pregnancy, it is common for women to feel more fatigued and tired, which may cause them to go to bed earlier than usual. This is due to the increased demands on the woman's body and the need for additional rest. The feeling of fatigue can be amplified by hormonal changes, particularly in the first trimester when the body is adjusting to the pregnancy. 6. Emotional Changes: Emotional changes caused by hormonal fluctuations, stress, and anxiety related to pregnancy may also lead to weight gain. Some women may find comfort in eating during this period or decrease their regular physical activities due to emotional distress, leading to weight gain. In summary, pregnancy is an answer aligned with human common sense as it involves significant physiological, emotional, and lifestyle changes that can cause weight gain and result in pregnant women going to bed early. These factors include hormonal changes, fetal development, increased appetite, reduced physical activity, fatigue, and emotional changes that can contribute to the overall weight gain and altered sleep patterns during pregnancy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He made his debut in 1993 with the single \\"What's It to You\\", which reached Number One on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart, as did its follow-up, 1994's \\"Live Until I Die\\". Both singles were included on his self-titled debut album, released in 1993 via Giant Records. He stayed with the label until its 2001 closure, later recording for Warner Bros. Records and RCA Records before joining his current label, Asylum-Curb Records, in 2007. Context: Walker released his twenty-third single, \\"Say No More\\", for Giant in early 2001. It was the first single release from his sixth studio album of the same name, peaking at number 33 on the country chart; the only other single, the Jerry Kilgore co-write \\"If You Ever Feel Like Lovin' Me Again\\", reached number 27. The latter song was promoted by Giant's parent company, Warner Bros. Records Nashville, as Giant had closed in late 2001. Walker co-produced the album with veteran producers Byron Gallimore and Blake Mevis, and session guitarist Brent Mason. The album also included a song that Walker wrote in high school, and a cover of Ritchie Valens's \\"La Bamba.\\" Maria Konicki Dinoia of Allmusic rated it three stars, with her review saying that \\"the sensitivity on this album is so expressive that it makes you want to run right out and hug the one you love.\\" Country Standard Time critic Mike Clark considered it a transition to a more country pop-oriented sound, describing the album as being \\"full of bad lyrics and overwrought production cliches.\\"  In 2002, Walker wrote and recorded a song for the National Football League's expansion team, the Houston Texans. Titled \\"Football Time in Houston,\\" the song was used as the team's official fight song during its inaugural season. In an interview with CMT, he said that he donated the song to the city of Houston, and that he sings \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" at the team's opening game every season.  Although he had left Warner Bros. for RCA Records' Nashville division in May 2002, Warner Bros. released a Christmas music album entitled Christmas in September of the same year.

The premise given is: \\"I am Jon, said the man, turning back to the polished metal.\\" This statement provides information about a man, presumably named Jon, interacting with a polished metal object. However, the specific nature of the interaction or the exact object is not detailed. The 'polished metal' can be any sort of object, not necessarily a gun. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states: \\"Jon was holding a metal gun.\\" Although it indeed refers to the same person in the premise (Jon), and introduces the concept of 'metal' which is consistent with the premise, it introduces a new, specific item - a gun. The hypothesis explicitly describes Jon as holding a gun made out of metal. The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis isn't deductively logical, meaning the truth of the premise doesn't guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. The hypothesis could be true, but we don't have enough information in the premise to be sure. In other words, the hypothesis is making a very specific claim that isn't directly supported by the evidence provided in the premise. Additional information, or e.g. multiple premises, would be needed to logically deduce the claim made in the hypothesis from the premise(s). The assumption here, that Jon interacts with a metal object and therefore it must be a gun, is a leap in logic absent of other specific details or direct information.  For instance, the polished metal could refer to numerous items like a metal table, a car, a mirror frame or any other object that can be made out of metal and polished. The premise would need to provide more specific information to imply that the polished metal is indeed a gun, to logically validate the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest      The virus, which usually causes mild symptoms including fever, rash and fatigue, has already been associated with a rare birth defect in Brazil called microcephaly. The defect is characterized by an abnormally small head and brain.      Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty Images      Officials have also been concerned that the virus could cross the placenta, an organ that develops in a woman's uterus during pregnancy and provides oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. This development could potentially lead to miscarriages.      CDC officials confirmed to ABC News that the women who miscarried were being monitored by their doctors after they were diagnosed with the Zika virus. In total, at least three women in the U.S. have been infected with Zika after returning from abroad with the virus.      One woman in Hawaii gave birth to a child with microcephaly in January. That woman is believed to have been exposed to the Zika virus in Brazil last year. In all three cases the Zika virus was found in the placenta.      Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical School, said the possibility of the virus being associated with miscarriages has been an ongoing concern for health officials.      \\"There has been a concern that is it possible that this virus...could also create sufficient inflammation in the placenta such that miscarriages can occur,\\" said Schaffner, explaining that the link was not yet definitive. \\"Two cases don't make the whole story but it certainly would be biologically consistent with the [fact.]\\"      Schaffner said researchers would likely look to see if there is more physical evidence of the virus being linked to miscarriages in countries where virus transmission is active. ||||| Everything you ever wanted to know about the Zika virus and its spread across North and South America. (Daron Taylor,Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post)      Two U.S. women who contracted the Zika virus while traveling out of the country miscarried after returning home, and the virus was found in their placentas, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday.      Federal health officials have not previously reported miscarriages in American travelers infected with the mosquito-borne virus while abroad. But there have been miscarriages reported in Brazil, the epicenter of a Zika epidemic that now spans nearly three dozen countries. Researchers in Salvador, Brazil's third largest city, are investigating some miscarriages and still births at three maternity hospitals for possible links to Zika.      The STAT website first reported the U.S. miscarriages, based on information from the CDC's chief pathologist. The pathologist told STAT the women miscarried early in their pregnancies but provided no additional details.      [Zika and sex: Seven key things you need to know about the case in Dallas]      Last month, officials said a baby born in a Hawaii hospital was the first in the country with a birth defect linked to Zika. Hawaii officials said the baby's mother likely contracted the virus while living in Brazil last year and passed it on while her child was in the womb. Babies born with this rare condition, known as microcephaly, have abnormally small heads and brain abnormalities.      In cases when women have one or two miscarriages, the cause is usually severe chromosomal problems, experts say. \\"It's absolutely possible for an infection, whether it be viral or bacterial, to result in a miscarriage,\\" said Zev Williams, an obstetrician-gynecologist who specializes in pregnancy loss at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Montefiore Medical Center in New York. \\"Whether it was caused by Zika remains to be determined,\\" he said, but urged individuals to take precautions to avoid contracting or transmitting the virus.      Some virus infections in pregnancy, like Rubella or German measles infections especially early in pregnancy, can spread from the mother and infect the cells of the fetus and cause direct injury to it, said Jesse Goodman, an infectious diseases doctor at Georgetown University.      Here's a look at the pandemics that made it to our shores. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post)      In testimony before Congress Wednesday, CDC Director Tom Frieden reiterated that the agency is learning more about Zika every day, including how it can be transmitted from mother to fetus. Increasing evidence in Brazil also is linking Zika to microcephaly and other suspected neurological complications.      More than four dozen Zika cases have been confirmed in 14 states and the District of Columbia -- six involving pregnant women -- with at least another 21 cases in U.S. territories, the CDC said last Friday. Frieden also said that one U.S. case of Guillain-Barré syndrome may be linked to Zika.      [Zika linked to serious eye defects in babies with microcephaly, study finds]      It was unclear whether the two miscarriages were counted among the six cases involving pregnant women. Global health officials are closely monitoring the spread of the virus and the incidence of suspected neurological complications. Frieden has said the link between Zika and Guillain-Barré, which can lead to paralysis in adults, is growing stronger. Several South American countries have identified cases of the syndrome.      The World Health Organization, which has designated the outbreak a \\"global public health emergency,\\" issued guidance Wednesday on how women should protect themselves against possible sexual transmission of Zika. It said that until more is known, \\"all men and women living in or returning from an area where Zika is present -- especially pregnant women and their partners -- should be counseled on the potential risks of sexual transmission and ensure safe sexual practices.\\"      [NIH officials accelerate timeline for human trials of Zika vaccine, saying they will now begin in the summer]      Those include the correct and consistent use of condoms, the WHO said.

It may consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil, and trees, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as monuments, fountains or playground structures. In North America, many parks have fields for playing sports such as soccer, baseball and football, and paved areas for games such as basketball. Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities. Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area. Often, the smallest parks are in urban areas, where a park may take up only a city block or less. Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills. Parks have differing rules regarding whether dogs can be brought into the park: some parks prohibit dogs; some parks allow them with restrictions (e.g., use of a leash); and some parks, which may be called \\"dog parks\\", permit dogs to run off-leash.  - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity.  - Malakoff Diggins State Historic Park is a state park unit preserving the largest hydraulic mining site in California , United States . The mine pit and several Gold Rush - era buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Malakoff Diggins - North Bloomfield Historic District .

In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions. Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides).  - State or provincial parks are parks or other protected areas managed at the sub-national level within those nations which use \\"state\\" or \\"province\\" as a political subdivision. State parks are typically established by a state to preserve a location on account of its natural beauty, historic interest, or recreational potential. There are state parks under the administration of the government of each U.S. state, and of some the Mexican states. The term is also used in the Australian state of Victoria. The Canadian equivalent term is provincial park. Similar systems of local government maintained parks exist in other countries, but the terminology varies.  - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County.  - Local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions.  - Nevada City (originally, Ustumah, a Nisenan Maidu village; later, Nevada, Deer Creek Dry Diggins, and Caldwell's Upper Store) is the county seat of Nevada County, California, United States, located northeast of Sacramento and 28 miles north of Auburn. In 1900, 3,250 people lived in Nevada City; in 1910, 2,689 lived there; at the 2000 census, the population was 3,001, and at the 2010 census it was 3,068.  - A sluice (from the Dutch \\"sluis\\") is a water channel controlled at its head by a gate.

The terms sluice, sluice gate, knife gate, and slide gate are used interchangeably in the water and wastewater control industry.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock usually occurring in rock strata in layers or veins called coal beds or coal seams. The harder forms, such as anthracite coal, can be regarded as metamorphic rock because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressure. Coal is composed primarily of carbon, along with variable quantities of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. A fossil fuel, coal forms when dead plant matter is converted into peat, which in turn is converted into lignite, then sub-bituminous coal, after that bituminous coal, and lastly anthracite. This involves biological and geological processes that take place over time.  - Sediment is a naturally occurring material that is broken down by processes of weathering and erosion, and is subsequently transported by the action of wind, water, or ice, and/or by the force of gravity acting on the particles. For example, sand and silt can be carried in suspension in river water and on reaching the sea be deposited by sedimentation and if buried this may eventually become sandstone and siltstone, (sedimentary rocks).  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.  - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County. Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over .  - A tax incentive is an aspect of a country's tax code designed to incentivize, or encourage a particular economic activity.  - Mining is extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the earth usually from an orebody, lode, vein, seam, reef or placer deposits. These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner.  - Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (for ) and atomic number 50, is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air.  - Protected areas or conservation areas are locations which receive protection because of their recognized natural, ecological and/or cultural values. There are several kinds of protected areas, which vary by level of protection depending on the enabling laws of each country or the regulations of the international organisations involved. The term \\"protected area\\" also includes Marine Protected Areas, the boundaries of which will include some area of ocean, and Transboundary Protected Areas that overlap multiple countries which remove the borders inside the area for conservation and economic purposes. There are over 161,000 protected areas in the world (as of October 2010) with more added daily, representing between 10 and 15 percent of the world's land surface area. By contrast, only 1.17% of the world's oceans is included in the world's ~6,800 Marine Protected Areas.  - The National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) is the United States federal government's official list of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects deemed worthy of preservation. A property listed in the National Register, or located within a National Register Historic District, may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred preserving the property.  - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish. The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function.

Q:Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Where do plants get the essential elements for photosynthesis? Context: Plants uptake essential elements from the soil through their roots and from the air (consisting of mainly nitrogen and oxygen) through their leaves. Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of photosynthesis. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by cation exchange, wherein root hairs pump hydrogen ions (H+) into the soil through proton pumps. These hydrogen ions displace cations attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, stomata open to take in carbon dioxide and expel oxygen. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis.

Let your adult child make their own mistakes and then figure out how to fix them. This will improve their resilience and give them a sense of agency. This does not mean that you cannot be there to offer advice and help. It just means that they will have to do the work themselves and that you will not solve your adult child’s problems for them. Talk with your child about saving money, living frugally, and avoiding debt. Start doing this as early as possible. It is best to begin talking to your child about these things when they are still young. However, if you did not do this with your adult child, then you can do things to help them now. Help them come up with a weekly or monthly  budget so they’ll be prepared to manage their money when they move out. Charging your child a reasonable amount of rent is a good way to prepare them for paying bills later. Offer to look over your child’s resume, do mock interviews with them, or help them pick out professional clothes. If you know people who might be able to help with networking, give your child their names and phone numbers. Avoid doing any of the actual work of job hunting. For instance, don’t call your professional contacts yourself – let your child do it. If your adult child is working hard to become less dependent on you, cheer them on. Poor self-esteem often contributes to low achievement in young adults, but genuine support and encouragement can help give your child the confidence they need to make it on their own. You might say something like, “I’m so proud of you for getting this big job interview. Even if you don’t get the job, it’s still a great start!” Failure to launch syndrome is often caused by underlying problems like mental illness or substance abuse.

Craig asked Joel to help him clean his Airpods case, but","output":"Joel wasn't quite sure how to go about it. He had never cleaned an Airpods case before, but he was always up for helping a friend out. Both of them decided to look up some safe and effective ways to clean the Airpods case to avoid causing any damage. Here's the step-by-step method they came up with after researching and trying out different options: 1. Gather materials: They quickly realized that they would need some essential supplies such as a microfiber cloth, cotton swabs, isopropyl alcohol, and a soft-bristled brush or toothbrush. 2. Prepare the cleaning solution: Since the Airpods case is an electronic device, they knew it was essential to avoid using water. They decided to mix a small amount of isopropyl alcohol with an equal amount of water to create a cleaning solution that could safely clean the case without causing any damage. 3. Power off the Airpods case: To ensure safety while cleaning, they turned off the Airpods case and removed the Airpods from it. This way, they could avoid any potential electrical hazards. 4. Wipe down the exterior: They dampened the microfiber cloth with the cleaning solution and began to gently wipe down the outside of the Airpods case. The microfiber cloth helped to remove any dust and grime that had accumulated on the case's surface. 5. Clean the charging port: To clean the charging port, Joel carefully used a dry cotton swab to remove any dust and debris that had collected inside. It was essential to be gentle and not push too hard to avoid damaging the delicate components. 6. Scrub the interior: They dipped the soft-bristled brush in the cleaning solution and carefully cleaned the interior of the Airpods case, focusing on the areas where the Airpods sit. This step was crucial for removing any buildup that could affect the charging and overall functionality of the Airpods. 7. Clean the Airpods: While the case was drying, Craig and Joel took the opportunity to clean the Airpods themselves. They used a clean cotton swab dampened with the cleaning solution to clean the speaker mesh gently. For the rest of the Airpod, they used another corner of the microfiber cloth that had been dampened with the cleaning solution. 8. Dry and reassemble: Once the case and Airpods had been thoroughly cleaned, they let everything air dry for a few minutes to ensure no moisture was left. Then, they carefully placed the Airpods back in the case and turned it on to make sure everything was working correctly. In the end, their joint effort resulted in a clean and functional Airpods case. Both Joel and Craig were happy with the outcome and felt satisfied knowing they had successfully tackled a new challenge. Fueled by their sense of accomplishment, they agreed to help each other with cleaning and maintaining their electronic devices in the future as well. They shared some laughs and bonded over their newfound skills, turning a simple task into a fun and rewarding experience. This simple act not only improved the longevity of Craig's Airpods but also strengthened their friendship."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, it does not directly entail or confirm the hypothesis \\"You're right that I left out the part where Bush rigged the election in Ohio.\\" To analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, we need to consider three aspects: the context, the scope of simplification, and the logical connection. 1. Context: Without a specific context in which this conversation is taking place, it is challenging to establish a clear connection between the premise and the hypothesis. The mention of \\"Bush\\" and \\"Ohio\\" could refer to various events or situations related to George W. Bush and the state of Ohio, like presidential campaigns, public speeches, or policy-related events. However, the ambiguity of the context and lack of direct mention of the election or its alleged rigging makes it difficult to conclude that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. 2. Scope of simplification: The premise states that the speaker oversimplified the exchange with Bush in Ohio. This suggests that the speaker's description of the event was lacking in-depth analysis or missed essential details. However, without knowing the extent of this simplification and the specific details omitted, it is impossible to determine whether the hypothesis falls within the scope of the omitted information. 3. Logical connection: Entailment suggests that the truth of one statement necessarily leads to the truth of another statement. In this case, admitting to oversimplifying an exchange does not necessarily lead to the hypothesis that the speaker left out the part where Bush rigged the election in Ohio. The hypothesis introduces new information - the alleged rigging of the election - which is not directly or logically connected to the premise of oversimplification. In summary, while the premise acknowledges an oversimplification of an exchange with Bush in Ohio, it does not directly entail the hypothesis that the speaker left out the part about Bush rigging the election in Ohio. Without a specific context, the scope of simplification, and a logical connection between the two statements, it is difficult to establish a clear relationship between the premise and the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

David maintained that the scars Jamal had presented as bullet wounds were in fact scars from a tendon-repair operation David had performed in the early 90s. When David repeated his allegations in an interview with a \\"Daniel Vavinsky,\\" published in 2008 in Actualité Juive in Paris, Jamal filed a complaint with the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris for defamation and breach of doctor-patient confidentiality.The court established that \\"Daniel Vavinsky\\" was a pseudonym for Clément Weill-Raynal, a deputy editor at France 3. In 2011 it ruled that David and Actualité Juive had defamed Jamal. David, Weill-Raynal and Serge Benattar, the managing editor of Actualité Juive, were fined €5,000 each, and Actualité Juive was ordered to print a retraction. The Israeli government said it would fund David's appeal. The appeal was upheld in 2012; David was acquitted of defamation and breach of confidentiality. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli's prime minister, telephoned David to congratulate him. Jamal Al-Durrah said he would appeal the court's decision.In 2012 Rafi Walden, deputy director of the Tel Hashomer hospital and board member of Physicians for Human Rights, wrote in Haaretz that he had examined Jamal's 50-page medical file, and that the injuries from the 2000 shooting were \\"completely different wounds\\" from the 1994 injuries.

The revolution they had long sought was launched on 22 July and was declared a success the next day. The Free Officers seized control of all government buildings, radio stations, and police stations, as well as army headquarters in Cairo.

In a move to stave off foreign intervention two days before the revolution, Nasser had notified the American and British governments of his intentions, and both had agreed not to aid Farouk.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  People have used resources on and around the Mono–Inyo Craters for centuries. Mono Paiutes gathered obsidian from the Mono–Inyo Craters to make sharp tools and arrow points. Unworked obsidian was carried by the Mono Paiutes over passes in the Sierra Nevada to trade with other Native American groups. Chips of Mono–Inyo obsidian can still be found at many ancient mountain campsites. Gold rush–related boomtowns sprang up near Mono Basin in the 19th century to exploit bonanzas. The largest of these, Bodie (north of Mono Lake), was founded in the late 1870s and grew large enough to need a tree mill, which was located at Mono Mills, immediately northeast of Mono Domes. Trees directly around the domes and on their slopes were felled to provide timber for the mill. As part of the California Water Wars, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power purchased large tracts of land in the 1930s within Mono Basin and Owens Valley in order to control water rights. Excavation of an 11.5-mile (18.5 km) water tunnel under the southern part of the Mono Craters dome complex started in 1934 and was completed in 1941. Tunnel workers had to deal with loose and often water-charged gravels, pockets of carbon dioxide gas and flooding. About one man was lost for each mile excavated. Water diverted from its natural outlet in Mono Lake passes through the tunnel on its way to the Los Angeles Aqueduct system. The United States Pumice Company, based in Chatsworth, California, has mined the area for pumice since 1941. The company markets the pumice in slabs for use in commercial scouring and in large irregular chunks sold as yard decoration.Apollo 16's John Young and Charlie Duke did some of their geologic training here in June 1971.  William R. Muehlberger was one of the geology instructors.Exploratory drilling for geothermal power occurred near the Mono Craters on the south shore of Mono Lake in 1971. The wells did not show promising results, so the effort was abandoned.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What was the name of the person who met Busoni in Leipzig? is inside the article: While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate.

Please answer the following question: Process: - A sperm and egg meet inside a woman&#x27;s fallopian tube - The fertilized egg, now a zygote, travels to the uterus - The zygote implants in the uterus - The zygote becomes an embryo - The embryo becomes a fetus - The fetus grows for approximately 9 months - The woman gives birth to a baby - The baby grows into a child - The child becomes an adult - The adult mates with another adult -   Question: suppose the woman is older and her uterus may not be as healthy happens, how will it affect LESS babies.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"In the scenario where a woman's uterus may not be as healthy due to her age, this can potentially lead to having fewer babies. As the uterus is a significant part of the reproductive process, any alteration to its health can affect fertility and the overall success of pregnancies.  Firstly, a less healthy uterus may adversely affect the implantation of the zygote. If the uterus lining is compromised or unable to support the zygote's attachment adequately, this could result in a failed implantation and ultimately a miscarriage or inability to carry a pregnancy. Consequently, it has a direct negative impact on the chances of conceiving and carrying a healthy fetus to term, which means there would be fewer babies born. Additionally, an older woman with a potentially less healthy uterus may experience less optimal hormonal and physiological conditions for child-bearing. For instance, the hormonal changes that accompany aging can disrupt the reproductive process, and the uterus may experience decreased blood flow or changes to its structure and receptivity. These factors can further complicate conception and pregnancy, leading to a decrease in fertility. Furthermore, the perturbation in this scenario could have a more significant influence on the second effect mentioned, which refers to the zygote traveling to the uterus. If the fallopian tubes or the overall environment is not healthy or supportive enough, the chances of the zygote successfully traversing them and reaching the uterus may decrease. This can contribute to making it less likely for a woman to successfully conceive and bear a child and, therefore, have less offspring. In conclusion, the uterine health of an older woman can be expected to have a considerable effect on the possibility of having fewer babies. A less healthy uterus can negatively impact the zygote's implantation and the overall reproductive conditions needed for conception and pregnancy. The perturbation in this case influences the second effect mentioned (zygote traveling to the uterus) by making the process more challenging and leading to fewer successful conceptions and pregnancies. Overall, the effect of a less healthy uterus on having fewer babies can be described as more significant."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The Spanish American wars of independence were the numerous wars against Spanish rule in Spanish America that took place during the early 19th century, from 1808 until 1829, directly related to the Napoleonic French invasion of Spain. The conflict started with short-lived governing juntas established in Chuquisaca and Quito opposing the composition of the Supreme Central Junta of Seville.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"Napoleon did NOT invade the Americas.  In the given context, it is mentioned that the Spanish American wars of independence took place during the early 19th century, from 1808 until 1829, and they were directly related to the Napoleonic French invasion of Spain. This means Napoleon invaded Spain, which triggered conflicts in Spanish America. However, there is no mention of Napoleon or his forces invading the Americas, which refers to North, Central, and South America plus the Caribbean. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that Napoleon did not invade the Americas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given those answer options, answer the question: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"fires with good air circulation will what?\\" is \\"kill\\", given that  fires need to be in contact with the air to burn? A:","output":"The answer to the question \\"fires with good air circulation will what?\\" is not \\"kill.\\" Rather, the answer should relate directly to the properties and conditions that affect fire behavior, given that fires are indeed in need of air (specifically, oxygen) to burn. Good air circulation tends to have several impacts on fires such as: 1. Intensify: A fire with proper air circulation will likely intensify. Oxygen is a critical factor that fuels combustion in fires. The more oxygen that a flame has access to, the more the flame is going to burn. Therefore, if a fire is in a location with ample air circulation, it can potentially burn more intensely. 2. Spread: Good air circulation can also promote the spread of fire. Since fire utilizes oxygen to sustain and drive its combustion, a steady supply of oxygen could facilitate the further spread of fire. Should wind be factored into this circulation, the potential for fire spread could be increased exponentially, as wind can carry firebrands (burning pieces of vegetative debris) several kilometers ahead of an established fire front in wildfires. 3. Burn More Efficiently: When there is proper air circulation, a fire utilizes oxygen more efficiently. With proper amounts of oxygen, a fire will typically reduce the amount of soot and other incomplete combustion products that it produces. 4. Longer Duration: When a fire has a consistent source of oxygen through good air circulation, it can potentially last longer than a fire with limited access to air. In conclusion, the right answer to the question \\"fires with good air circulation will what?\\" would be one of the following: \\"intensify,\\" \\"spread faster,\\" \\"burn more efficiently\\" or \\"last longer\\", rather than \\"kill.\\" Always remember the role of oxygen in combustion when dealing with fires."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The container you use should have a lid or other type of secure closure to keep air from getting in. When exposed to air, the moisture in cooked pasta can become a breeding ground for bacteria and mold.  A). The container should be resealed before use, so that all the extra moisture is removed before storage. Use rubber gaskets on the top, folded edges, or the bottom of the container to keep air from escaping.; B). Make sure there is a funnel to catch the excess salt. Plastic containers are not usually the best option.; C). Place the pasta in the airtight container in which it's stored so that little of the excess moisture comes out. This method will take anywhere from one month to two months.; D). Make sure the container is fully sealed before putting the pasta away. If you're storing your pasta in a ziploc bag, squeeze as much air out of the bag as you can before sealing and stashing it.; The answer is:","output":"D). Make sure the container is fully sealed before putting the pasta away. If you're storing your pasta in a ziploc bag, squeeze as much air out of the bag as you can before sealing and stashing it. Explanation: Option A is wrong because we don't need to remove all the extra moisture before storage, as a little bit of moisture will help in reheating the pasta later. Option B is wrong because it's not about catching excess salt, and plastic containers can be used as long as they are airtight. Option C is wrong because it doesn't make sense to store pasta for one to two months, as the quality would degrade over time. It's better to consume it within a few days."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Answer a question about this article: Other legal factors that have been implemented to end and reduce child labour includes the global response that came into force in 1979 by the declaration of the International Year of the Child. Along with the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations, these two declarations worked on many levels to eliminate child labour. Although many actions have been taken to end this epidemic, child labour in Africa is still an issue today due to the unclear definition of adolescence and how much time is needed for children to engage in activities that are crucial for their development. Another issue that often comes into play is the link between what constitutes as child labour within the household due to the cultural acceptance of children helping run the family business. In the end, there is a consistent challenge for the national government to strengthen its grip politically on child labour, and to increase education and awareness on the issue of children working below the legal age limit.

You may find that a Saison is surprisingly crisp and refreshing when sipped alongside a platter of broiled seafood, or that a dark, bitter stout makes the perfect companion for a juicy cheeseburger. When mingled with the flavors of a meal, a beer’s body can transform and take on new complexity.  Like wine, different beers are typically recommended for pairing with different foods.  With time, you’ll develop a sense of which flavor combinations you find appetizing together. Atmosphere can also play a big part in how much enjoyment you get from beer. You probably won’t get the same satisfaction from splitting a pitcher in a crowded, deafening dive bar as you would sharing with a tall one with your best friends from the comfort of your own home. If you’re not big on your surroundings, that distaste may rub off on you when it comes time to drain a pint.  Stay away from places with strong smells or other unwanted distractions that might detract from your experience. Set up a tasting at your home with a friend who’s a connoisseur. They’ll be able to make recommendations and give you cues on how to savor your beer. You’re never going to appreciate beer if you convince yourself that you don’t like it. Make an effort to stop thinking of all beers in black and white terms. Once you soften your stance, you’ll be able to start judging each unique form of the beverage on its own merits.

So let’s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces…. Although the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different – MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil – this is the first lip pencil that I’ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I’m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it’s not sticky. The colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a ‘soft plum with pearl’. It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it’s quick and easy, and as it’s very light and sheer it’s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What does the narrator most likely think that MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil should do with the plum color she bought? Options:  A. Make it more pigmented and less shiny  B.

Rosetta may help answer the question      After a 10-year chase taking it billions of miles across the solar system, the Rosetta spacecraft is homing in on its close encounter with a comet.      Pictures of the oddly-shaped rock have already been returned but on Wednesday scientists at the European Space Agency, which is leading the project, say they hope to see images from within about 75 miles as the probe carries out the last of its braking maneuvers.      If successful, the mission will notch up a series of firsts. Rosetta will be the first spacecraft to orbit a comet on its journey around the sun, and in November mission controllers aim to place the robotic lander Philae on the surface -- something that has never been done before.      Previous missions have performed comet fly-bys but Rosetta is different. This probe will follow the comet for more than a year, mapping and measuring how it changes as it is blasted by the sun's energy.      36 photos: Rosetta: The comet chaser 36 photos: Rosetta: The comet chaser ESA: A short-lived outburst from Comet 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko was captured by Rosetta's OSIRIS narrow-angle camera on 29 July 2015.

Interactive: See how Rosetta chases the comet across the solar system      Scientists hope to learn more about the composition of comets and perhaps whether they brought water to the Earth or even the chemicals that make up the building blocks of life.      \\"It really is such a step forward to anything that has come before,\\" project scientist Matt Taylor told CNN.      Rosetta will soon begin mapping the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and find out more about its gravitational pull. This will help to find a suitable landing site for Philae and allow engineers to keep Rosetta in the right orbit.      As comets approach the sun, any ice melts and is turned into an ionized gas tail. The dust produces a separate, curving tail. It's these processes that Rosetta scientists hope to be able to study from close proximity.      Taylor explained that the survey will show the team what the comet nucleus looks like now and when it gets closer to the sun.      \\"We'll be able to make a comparison to now, when its relatively inert, to when it's highly active ... making this measurement over a year when we're riding alongside at walking pace and observing how a comet works and interacts with the sun,\\" he said.      \\"We are there for over a year to see this compete development to the extent that you may even be able to measure the decrease in the volume of the nucleus ... see how much material has left the comet.\\"      Rosetta's target comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is known as a short-period comet. It reappears every six years as its orbit brings it close to the sun. Halley's comet has a period of about 76 years and is not due to return close enough to Earth to be visible until 2061. Others only return after thousands of years.      Matt Taylor says it is unlikely that you will be able to see comet 67P with the naked eye but you can follow the progress of the mission on Rosetta's blog and find out more with CNN's interactive coverage. ||||| Image copyright ESA/Rosetta/MPS Image caption Rosetta has caught up with 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko      Europe's Rosetta probe has arrived at a comet after a 10-year chase.      In a first for space exploration, the satellite was manoeuvred alongside a speeding body to begin mapping its surface in detail.      The spacecraft fired its thrusters for six and a half minutes to finally catch up with comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.      \\"We're at the comet!\\" said Sylvain Lodiot from the European Space Agency (Esa) operations centre in Germany.      \\"After 10 years, five months and four days travelling towards our destination, looping around the Sun five times and clocking up 6.4 billion km, we are delighted to announce finally 'we are here',\\" said Jean-Jacques Dordain, director general of Esa.      Deep slumber      Launched on board an Ariane rocket in March 2004, Rosetta has taken a long route around our Solar System to catch up with comet 67P.      In a series of fly-pasts, the probe used the gravity of the Earth and Mars to increase its speed during the six billion km chase.      Analysis by David Shukman, BBC Science Editor      You could almost feel the sense of relief in the corridors that, after managing a 10-year trek through space with extraordinary accuracy, and after investing more than one billion euros, all has gone so well.      The signal took nearly 23 minutes to reach us and, when it came, it was a dip in a line on a graph.      But this showed that the final burn to reach the comet had finished and this key moment was the trigger for a wave of pride rather than jubilation.      Getting a spacecraft to match the speed of a comet and effectively ride alongside it is a landmark in space exploration.      But the hard work starts now.      Read more from David here      To save energy, controllers at Esa's centre in Darmstadt, Germany, put Rosetta into hibernation for 31 months.      In January they successfully woke the craft from its slumber as it began the final leg of the daring encounter.      For the past two months, Rosetta has been carrying out a series of manoeuvres to slow the probe down relative to its quarry.      The comet is travelling at 55,000km per hour (34,2000mph). The spacecraft's speed has been adjusted so that, in relative terms, it will be flying beside the comet at a slow walking pace of 1m/sec (2.2mph, 3.6kph).      At a distance of 400 million km from the Earth, messages are taking over 22 minutes to get to Rosetta.      The distances involved are so great that the complex final command sequence for Wednesday's crucial thruster burn had to be issued on Monday night.      \\"This arrival phase in fact is the most complex and exotic trajectory that we have ever seen,\\" said Jean-Yves Le Gall, president of the French Space Agency Cnes.      Rosetta will have to continue to fire its thrusters every few days to maintain a hyberbolic orbit at 100km above the rotating \\"ice mountain\\".      The craft will then travel alongside the comet for the next 15 months, studying it with a range of instruments.      Rosetta has been taking increasingly detailed photographs of 67P as it gets closer. The mysterious comet has been dubbed the \\"rubber duck\\", as some images seem to show the familiar shape as it twirls in space.      Rosetta key facts Total cost of the mission is said to be 1.3bn euros      The probe weighed in at 3,000kg at liftoff back in 2004, with over half of that made up of propellant      It has two 14m long solar panels to provide electrical power      The orbiter carries 11 experiments      The lander, Philae, carries nine experiments including a drill to sample beneath the surface      Project scientist, Dr Matt Taylor, said: \\"For me this is the sexiest, most fantastic mission there's ever been. It's ticking a number of boxes in terms of fascination, exploration, technology and science - predominantly science.\\"      Harpooning a comet      As it moves towards the Sun, 67P will warm up and its trailing halo of gas and dust - known as the coma - will increase, offering the orbiter the chance to do some detailed scientific work.      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption This image sequence was acquired by Rosetta's science cameras on Sunday      \\"We've seen evidence of the out-gassing of the coma, the outer atmosphere of the comet. This is made of dust and gas,\\" said Dr Taylor.      \\"We have instruments on board that will start sniffing for this gas and taste it. We will also be collecting some of this dust and touching the coma itself. Hopefully, that will occur sometime this week.\\"      The mission gets even more ambitious in November when, after moving Rosetta closer to 67P, mission controllers will attempt to put the Philae lander on the surface.      The lander will use harpoons to anchor itself and will carry out a series of experiments, including drilling into the material that makes up the comet.      The mission aims to add to knowledge of comets and their role in possibly ferrying the building blocks of life around the early Solar System. ||||| Wednesday marks a big moment for space exploration: After a few thruster rockets fire for a little over six minutes, a spacecraft called Rosetta will be in position to make the first-ever rendezvous with a comet.

Please write a short summary for the following article: 10 Super Mario fan theories that will make your mustache curl One rule about pop culture: If it exists, there's probably a fan theory about it. Super Mario Bros. is celebrating its 30th anniversary on Sept. 13, and not only have gamers been celebrating for the last three decades with serious gameplay, they've also been having some serious conversations about their favorite mustachioed plumber. While some of these ideas might be a little off the wall, others are just so weird, they make absolute sense. Here are just a few of the intense conspiracy theories on the Internet that fans have been tossing around their heads. Prepare to have your minds blown, Mario fans. 1. Mario and his friends are merely actors in a stage play.One of the most enduring fan theories online is that this entire video game world is a stage and Mario, Luigi and all their pals (and enemies) are merely players. Here are some pieces of evidence to support it: Recently, Super Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto confirmed that this theory actually has some truth to it — so theory has become fact. 2. Princess Peach is Bowser Jr.'s mother.Little Bowser Jr.'s maternity seems to be a mystery among the online gamer forums — at least among those who don't immediate point to Princess Peach, who seems to be the most likely candidate. According to the Super Mario wiki, Junior is told by his father that Peach is his mother, but she is then kidnapped by \\"evil\\" Mario during Super Mario Sunshine. 3. Luigi is always with Mario because Mario keeps his strength in check.Poor Luigi. He's often brushed off as the weak, loser brother of the popular and strong Mario — but what if the guy in green was actually a a killing machine ready to rage at any moment? One fan theory on Reddit explains that Luigi may be stronger than we think, and staying close to Mario keeps him from Hulking out. The user explains: Luigi's only fear is that he may go too far one day and hurt people on accident due to his powers running rampant. A common trait we see is his extreme fear of ghosts. The reason behind that is because ghosts have been known to have the ability to possess living beings...By staying close to his brother, he doesn't have to worry about hurting people because he knows that Mario is the most skilled fighter in existence and the only person who can stop him. Mario is the polar opposite of Luigi: a mortal man without any notable powers. Despite that, Mario is capable of fighting against villains capable of destroying dimensions, and even defeating Luigi himself several times (Super Paper Mario) using nothing but his sheer battle skill. By staying next to his brother, Luigi can make sure that if one of his many odd powers goes out of control, or he turns evil, Mario will be close enough to stop him and limit the damage. More on this particular fan theory can be found here. 4. The whole series is just Princess Peach's propaganda.Mario and his friends are just puppets and Princess Peach is the puppet master. According to one Reddit user: However, have you ever asked yourself why we're being shown a Princess Peach Point of View of our favorite game? We always believed that Peach was telling the truth, and that she was the victim and Bowser was the villain...What if Princess Peach is really just using the Mario Games (which are plays) as [propaganda] to lead you to believe that Bowser is the villain, when in reality Peach is an evil dictator who wants to oppress the people of the Mushroom Kingdom. The post explains that gamers are never shown Bowser's point of view in the games and therefore are never given a complete picture of the politics of the Mushroom Kingdom. For all we know, Princess Peach could be manipulating Mario into thinking she is kidnapped to feed into her master plan. Pretty dark. 5. Super Mario Bros. is the only time Bowser truly kidnapped Princess Peach.Working under the assumption that Super Mario Bros. is real and not a play, the original game is the only actual time Bowser kidnapped Peach \\"in real life.\\" A user on Reddit explains that Super Mario Bros. 2 is actually a dream sequence, and therefore has \\"no bearing in the 'real' world.\\" And Super Mario Bros. 3 was a \\"play retelling (with embellishments) the events of Super Mario Bros. 1.\\" The user also goes into other games in the franchise: 6. Mario only went to the Mushroom Kingdom once — the rest is just him reliving his glory.Similar to the theory that Bowser only kidnapped Princess Peach once (in Super Mario Bros.), the same goes for Mario's trip to the Mushroom Kingdom. Since the original game was the only one to exist in \\"reality,\\" all of Mario's other adventures to to rescue the Princess from Bowser are simply the fevered dreams of a poor plumber reliving his glory days. The theorist on Reddit goes so far as to say Mario creates reality TV spin offs and grander marketing schemes on his whirlwind adventure, spinning greater tales and milking his fame for all it's worth. More of the user's theory can be found here. 7. Donkey Kong killed Mario and Luigi's father.One fan theory is so full of tragedy and family intrigue it would make Shakespeare blush. The Reddit user who poses this theory goes into extreme detail, but it boils down to the identity of the character, Jumpman, who looks suspiciously like Mario, in the Donkey Kong games. Here's how it works: Mario loves Princess Peach (at least at first) and lives in the Mushroom Kingdom, while Jumpman loves his wife Pauline and lives in New York City. While some have assumed Mario and Jumpman to be the same person, Mario would have had to have a major mid-life crisis to go from a New York City plumber to the savior of a magical kingdom — but what is to explain their resemblance? Jumpman is Mario and Luigi's dad. Honestly, they had to come from somewhere. Unfortunately, at the end of Donkey Kong Junior, Jumpman is the antagonist of Donkey Kong and dies at the end, killed by Donkey. In all these decades of gameplay, Mario has yet to seek revenge. The Reddit user goes into more depth on this theory here. 8. Dr. Mario is the third Mario brother.Mario has had plenty of odd jobs over the years, but something seems a little bit off about Doctor Mario from the Super Smash Bros. game. The Reddit user who introduced this theory wrote, \\"He has a similar moveset to Mario and Luigi, and while Luigi is a lighter and floatier comparison to Mario, DM is a heavier, harder hitting alternative. Doctor Mario's hair is also lighter than Mario's, taking an almost blonder or more auburn tint to the plumber's dark brown hair. Mario also seems to be more athletic than DM as he is faster and can wall jump, whereas the doctor can not.\\" It seems easy to believe that perhaps there are several Mario brothers, in several sizes, floating out there. More on this theory can be found on Reddit. 9. The coins are souls.Get ready for the most existential gameplay you've ever experienced. It turns out, every time you hit, smash, burn or generally destroy and object or enemy and you get a coin in return, what you're actually getting is that thing's soul. A user on Reddit wrote: The instruction manual for [Super Mario Bros. 1] states the the inhabitants of [Mushroom Kingdom] were turned into bricks (yes, the exact same ones that [Mario] smashed on his journey). If the bricks are [Mushroom Kingdom] residents, then how are there coins inside them. What if Mario was actually harvesting the souls of innocent toads? The theory goes into great detail on the many different and twisted ways Mario can harvest the souls of the dead for his profit. 10. Wario is a crazed Mario fan.Wario isn't such a bad guy. He just doesn't know how to process all these feelings of respect and admiration. Some evidence of Wario's devotion to Mario include: Wario's outfit is the a superfan equivalent of Mario's: overalls, white gloves, mustache and a cap with an upside down \\"M\\" (or \\"W,\\" however you want to spin it). In Super Mario Land 2, Wario lives in a castle with a statue of Mario in front. Of course, it's revealed that this place used to be Mario's own castle, but still, Wario doesn't seem to mind keeping it in tact. If that isn't love, we don't know what is. More details about Wario's deep obsession with Mario can be found here. So what's real and what's just a toad's fantasy? You decide. Video: Jake Fertig and David Sidorov Summary:","output":"This article lists ten popular Super Mario fan theories that contribute to the mystery and appeal of the game. Some examples include the idea that Mario and his friends are merely actors in a stage play, Princess Peach is Bowser Jr.'s mother, Luigi stays close to Mario to keep his strength in check, and the coins collected in the game are actually the souls of defeated characters. These theories provide different interpretations of the game's characters and storylines and showcase the creativity of the players who have formed these ideas over the years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He popped the question only two months later and the pair tied the knot at a private ranch in Northern California on July 30, 2004. Their bizarrely named son was born on October 2, 2005.

Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3]  and the situation: Deep lake presents geothermal activity, while Shallow lake has mixing of saline water with fresh water. Deep lake had more instances of divers having problems because of thermoclines.  Answer the following question: Which lake has warmer water the bottom? A:","output":"A: The Deep lake has warmer water at the bottom. This lake is exposed to geothermal activity, which means that heat from the Earth's interior warms the deeper water. As a result, the bottom of the Deep lake is warmer than the surface water. This temperature difference causes convection currents to occur, further contributing to the warming of the deeper waters. In contrast, the Shallow lake has a temperature inversion caused by the mixing of saline and fresh water, making the temperature rise as a diver descends but not necessarily causing the deeper water to be warmer than the surface. Due to the geothermal activity in the Deep lake, its bottom water consistently has a warmer temperature compared to the Shallow lake."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We were seated immediately by 9:50 and given menus.  The waitress took 15 minutes to even make eye contact with our table (and it was NOT busy in this place, she was in the back room.)  When we went around the table and began to order, she informed us that it is now 10:05 and that they were no longer making the food on the menu she had offered us, and that we could only order from one of the three pages we were given.    WTF!  We complained vociferiously that it was not our fault she was taking a snooze in the back and wasn't on her game, and that they should honour us paying customers who arrived before their cut off time and who were provided with dinner menus-not the late night menus.

We look forward to success to show us our value or to be the top of the group wherever we are. How many times in our schooling did we hope for a high mark? We want it and then feel like a failure when we don't achieve what we want. Even when we succeed we still pass that and go onto the next success and then the next. We are not often taught how to face failures. For me, failure taught me more than success did. Success is of the moment and temporary but failure means we have ever done. It makes me stop and think. It opened my eyes and brain to different possibilities. Failure is just a choice in redoing not in giving up. Experiencing failure,I looked deeper and further.

Q: Ben Carson came on CNN this morning to refute the network's reporting on his childhood, specifically the suggestion that the violent acts he described in his memoir never happened. The 30-minute phone interview turned contentious fast, with Carson and New Day host Alisyn Camerota sparring throughout over his past and newly uncovered statements he made in 2014 about 'stupid' people and Fox News. 'This is a bunch of lies,' he said of CNN's reporting on his formative years. 'Attempting to say that I'm lying about my history, I think it's pathetic.' The GOP presidential candidate who has been called 'low-energy' by Donald Trump derided the media at large for trying to dig up skeletons in his closet and implied during the interview that Camerota may be one of the 'stupid' people in America.'Attempting to say that I'm lying about my history, I think it's pathetic,' he told New Day host Alisyn CamerotaTension stemmed from a bombshell report CNN dropped yesterday calling into question Carson's purported tendency toward violence as a childCarson said in his 1990 memoir that he stabbed a friend named Bob during a dispute over the radio station they were listening toHe now says Bob was a relative not a friend - and all the names in the book are fake to protect the identities of the people he wrote aboutSeparately, in a 2014 speech, he said 'many' Americans are stupid and the U.S. would be Cuba if it weren't for Fox NewsAfter Camerota pressed him to define the 'stupid' people he was referring to and asked him about the Fox claim, he implied she might be stupid, tooFor more of the latest on Ben Carson visit www.dailymail.co.uk/gopprimary   Question:Immediately after, however, she brought up _'s 2014 comments about 'stupid' people, jump-starting a new argument with him.

On mornings when Samantha had class, Meagan would watch her 2-year-old daughter, Hannah. Also part of the household was Meagan's pet, Willie, a parrot -- a particularly intelligent and chatty breed. He picked up quite a healthy vocabulary (\\"Silly Willie\\"was a favorite saying) and became a great mimic  -- of cats, dogs, chickens and humans. One day with Samantha at school, Hannah sat in front of morning cartoons while Meagan cooked Pop-Tarts in the kitchen. When the toaster spat out the food, Meagan placed it at the center of the kitchen table to cool.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Evelle Jansen Younger (June 19, 1918  May 4, 1989) was California Attorney General from 1971 to 1979. Described as an exponent of steadfast moderation, he was nonetheless instrumental in enlarging the scope and power of the state's environmental protection law. Political friends included Richard M. Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Gerald R. Ford. Running against incumbent Jerry Brown, who was then at the height of his popularity, Younger was the unsuccessful Republican Party nominee for Governor of California in 1978. His wife, Mildred, had a promising political career as a centrist Republican in the 1950s until she lost her voice by injuries suffered in a car crash. The Youngers' only child, Eric E. Younger, became a Superior Court Judge.  - Ronald Wilson Reagan (February 6, 1911  June 5, 2004) was an American politician and actor who was the 40th President of the United States, from 1981 to 1989. Before his presidency, he was the 33rd Governor of California, from 1967 to 1975, after a career as a Hollywood actor and union leader.  - The Governor of California is the chief executive of the California state government, commander-in-chief of the California National Guard and the California State Military Reserve, whose responsibilities also include making annual State of the State addresses to the California State Legislature, submitting the budget, and ensuring that state laws are enforced. The position was created in 1849, the year before California became a state. The current governor is Jerry Brown, a Democrat who was inaugurated January 3, 2011, and who had previously served as governor from 1975 to 1983. In October 2013, Jerry Brown surpassed Earl Warren for the longest cumulative period of time served as governor.  - Edmund Gerald \\"Jerry\\" Brown Jr. (born April 7, 1938) is an American politician and lawyer who has served as the 39th Governor of California since 2011. A member of the Democratic Party, Brown previously served as the 34th governor from 1975 to 1983, and is the longest-serving governor in California history.

The Democratic incumbent , Jerry Brown , defeated the Republican nominee , Attorney General Evelle J. Younger , in a landslide .    'california gubernatorial election' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'office contested'?  Choices: - governor  - head of state  - president Answer:","output":"The 'California gubernatorial election' is related to the object entity 'governor' through the relation of 'office contested'.

On which river is Niagara Falls?","output":"Niagara Falls is located on the Niagara River and serves as a natural boundary between the United States and Canada. The Niagara River is about 36 miles (58 kilometers) long, and it connects two of the Great Lakes, Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. The Niagara River originates at the outflow of Lake Erie and flows northward, with the Niagara Falls about halfway along its length. There are actually three distinct waterfalls within Niagara Falls: the largest and most famous one, the Horseshoe Falls (also called Canadian Falls), the smaller American Falls, and the adjacent relatively small Bridal Veil Falls. The Horseshoe Falls are predominantly on the Canadian side of the border, in the province of Ontario. The American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls are located on the United States side, in the state of New York. The cities that surround the falls are Niagara Falls, Ontario in Canada, and Niagara Falls, New York in the United States. Niagara Falls is a popular tourist attraction owing to its immense beauty, power, and prominence, with millions of tourists visiting every year. Besides its scenic beauty, the falls play a significant role in producing hydroelectric power, with both Canada and the United States having power stations on their respective sides. The Sir Adam Beck Power Station on the Canadian side and the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant on the US side harness the energy of the falling water to generate power for their respective regions. In essence, the Niagara Falls on the Niagara River serves not only as an iconic international landmark and tourist attraction, but also as an important source of hydroelectric power for both the United States and Canada."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood.

Here is a goal: television tray Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of acquiring a television tray, there are two main approaches: purchasing a ready-made television tray or building one yourself. Both options have their own advantages and disadvantages, which I will discuss below. The most suitable method for you will depend on your specific needs, preferences, and available resources. Option 1: Purchasing a Ready-Made Television Tray Advantages: 1. Convenience: Purchasing a ready-made television tray is undoubtedly the most convenient and hassle-free option. You won't need to worry about gathering materials, cutting wood, or assembling the tray. There are plenty of stores, both online and physical, where you can find a wide variety of television trays. 2. Quality and design: You can easily find a high-quality television tray with a suitable design based on your preferences. Many companies invest in creating useful, attractive, and durable trays, ensuring they are suited for various styles and functions. 3. Time-saving: Since you won't be building a television tray from scratch, you will save time that can be allocated to other tasks or leisure activities. You can simply order or pick up the tray, unbox it, and start using it right away. 4. Warranty and customer service: Many ready-made television trays come with a warranty, which provides a level of protection and assurance for your purchase. Additionally, if you face any issues or have questions about your tray, you can reach out to the company's customer service for assistance. Disadvantages: 1. Cost: Purchasing a high-quality television tray can be more expensive than building one yourself, particularly if you're considering a high-end option or a custom design. 2. Lack of customization: While there are many designs available for purchase, you might not find one that perfectly suits your needs or taste. In this case, building your own television tray might be more appealing. 3. Environmental impact: Prefabricated items can have a larger environmental impact due to transportation and packaging. If you prefer making sustainable choices, constructing your television tray may be the better choice. Option 2: Building Your Own Television Tray Advantages: 1. Customization: Building your own television tray allows you to personalize it completely. You can choose the material, size, design, and color according to your preferences and the specific requirements of your space. 2. Cost-effective: If you have access to the necessary tools and materials, building a television tray can be a more cost-effective option, especially if you already possess some woodworking skills. 3. Sense of accomplishment: Crafting your own item provides a sense of accomplishment and pride, knowing that you were able to create something unique and functional. Disadvantages: 1. Time and effort: Building a television tray from scratch requires a significant investment of time and effort. The process might be challenging and frustrating, particularly if you're inexperienced or if the project encounters unexpected problems. 2. Skillset: Constructing a television tray requires some level of woodworking skill, as well as access to certain tools and materials. If you lack the necessary skills, tools, or resources, this option may be less feasible. 3. Limited warranty and customer support: When you build something yourself, you generally won't have access to a warranty or customer support. This means that if something goes wrong, you may need to fix the problem yourself or seek outside assistance. In conclusion, the best option for you depends on several factors, such as your budget, preferences, available time, and skill level. If you prioritize convenience and are willing to spend some extra money, purchasing a ready-made television tray would make more sense. On the other hand, if you want a customized design, are budget-conscious, and enjoy the fulfillment of DIY projects, constructing your own television tray may be the better choice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

CUNY Union Endorses de Blasio Four years ago, the union representing 25,000 faculty members and other employees at the City University of New York endorsed William C. Thompson Jr. in his underdog bid to unseat Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. This time, Mr. Thompson, a former city comptroller, was barely considered. Instead, the union, the Professional Staff Congress, announced Friday that it was backing Bill de Blasio, the New York City public advocate, in the Democratic primary. Union delegates voted for him so overwhelmingly with a show of hands, in fact, that no official tally was necessary to document his margin of victory over the apparent runner-up, John C. Liu, who is the cityâs comptroller. While the Professional Staff Congress is not as big or as organized as many labor groups, its highly educated membership is considered one of the more vociferously liberal and best informed in Democratic circles. The endorsement is also prized because the unionâs members have a track record of actually voting on Election Day. In an interview, Barbara Bowen, president of the Professional Staff Congress, cited Mr. de Blasioâs proposal to assess a tax on wealthier New Yorkers to pay for more prekindergarten and other programs, and his suggestion that 150 million worth of corporate tax breaks be ended and the money invested instead in CUNY. âWe decided that de Blasio offered a real plan for overturning the austerity politics of the city and offered a cogent strategy for increasing funding and restoring funding at all levels,â she said. As for Mr. Thompson, Ms. Bowen said some delegates felt troubled by his moderate stance on the policeâs stop-and-frisk tactic, since three-quarters of the student body are members of minorities. They also voiced skepticism about Mr. Thompsonâs pledge to not raise taxes. âI think some of our delegates felt that he has taken different positions and is a little bit of a different candidate this time,â she added. When asked about the unionâs decision, Mr. Thompson said in a statement, âI respect the members of the organization immensely and their decision wonât deter me from supporting teachers and educators in the CUNY system.â The unionâs endorsement put a bit of a damper on what had been shaping up as a banner week for Mr. Thompson in the education world. He collected endorsements from the union representing public school principals (the Council of School Supervisors and Administrators) on Tuesday and the one for teachers (the United Federation of Teachers) on Thursday. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"1. The Professional Staff Congress (PSC), the union representing 25,000 faculty members and other employees at the City University of New York, endorsed Bill de Blasio in the Democratic primary. 2. Bill de Blasio's proposal to assess a tax on wealthier New Yorkers to pay for more prekindergarten and other programs and his suggestion to end 150 million worth of corporate tax breaks and invest the money in CUNY were cited as reasons for the endorsement. 3. Union delegates expressed concerns about William C. Thompson Jr.'s moderate stance on the police's stop-and-frisk tactic and his pledge not to raise taxes. 4. The PSC endorsement is considered valuable because its highly educated membership is regarded as liberal and well-informed, and its members have a track record of actively voting on Election Day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Scuba provides the diver with the advantages of mobility and horizontal range far beyond the reach of an umbilical hose attached to surface-supplied diving equipment (SSDE). Scuba divers engaged in armed forces covert operations may be referred to as frogmen, combat divers or attack swimmers.  - Technical diving (also referred to as tec diving or tech diving) is scuba diving that exceeds the agency-specified limits of recreational diving for non-professional purposes. Technical diving may expose the diver to hazards beyond those normally associated with recreational diving, and to greater risk of serious injury or death. The risk may be reduced by appropriate skills, knowledge and experience, and by using suitable equipment and procedures. The skills may be developed through appropriate specialised training and experience. The equipment often involves breathing gases other than air or standard nitrox mixtures, and multiple gas sources.  - Nitrox is used to a lesser extent in surface-supplied diving, as these advantages are reduced by the more complex logistical requirements for nitrox compared to the use of simple low-pressure compressors for breathing gas supply. Nitrox can also be used in hyperbaric treatment of decompression illness, usually at pressures where pure oxygen would be hazardous. Nitrox is not a safer gas than compressed air in all respects; although its use can reduce the risk of decompression sickness, it increases the risk of oxygen toxicity and fire.  - Recreational diving or sport diving is a type of diving that uses SCUBA equipment for the purpose of leisure and enjoyment . In some diving circles , the term \`\` recreational diving '' is used in contradistinction to \`\` technical diving '' , a riskier and more demanding application of the sport which requires greater levels of training , experience and equipment .  - A breathing gas is a mixture of gaseous chemical elements and compounds used for respiration. Air is the most common, and only natural, breathing gas - but a range of pure gases or mixtures of gases are used in breathing equipment and enclosed habitats such as scuba equipment, surface supplied diving equipment, recompression chambers, submarines, space suits, spacecraft, medical life support and first aid equipment, high-altitude mountaineering and anaesthetic machines.

Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Available options: A). no B). yes","output":"A). No The two questions are different as they relate to distinct aspects of the Pepsi company. 1. Objective of the Pepsi company: The main objective of PepsiCo, the multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation that owns the Pepsi brand, is to be a global leader in the food and beverage industry. PepsiCo focuses on providing consumers with a wide range of enjoyable and wholesome products, while also maintaining sustainable growth. To achieve this, the company relies on six pillars: a) Innovation: PepsiCo continually invests in new products, marketing strategies, and packaging designs to keep their products fresh and appealing to consumers. b) Brand Building: The company focuses on strengthening its brands through successful marketing and advertising campaigns, ensuring that they remain top-of-mind for consumers. c) Market execution: PepsiCo strives to optimize its supply chain and retail partnerships to make products available everywhere and anytime consumers want them. d) Geographic expansion: The company actively seeks opportunities in new and emerging markets, enabling it to serve a more extensive consumer base. e) Profitable growth: PepsiCo focuses on maintaining a balance between volume growth, pricing, and cost management to ensure sustained profitability. f) Sustainability and Responsibility: As a global company, PepsiCo recognizes the importance of addressing social, environmental, and economic issues and aims to minimize its ecological footprint while positively impacting society. 2. Why is Pepsi Max so addictive? Pepsi Max is considered addictive due to several factors: a) Taste: Pepsi Max is formulated to provide a satisfying taste experience for consumers who prefer a zero-calorie, sugar-free beverage. A combination of artificial sweeteners, like aspartame and acesulfame potassium, is used to mimic the original taste of traditional Pepsi, but without the added sugar. This appealing taste can make the product addictive for some consumers. b) Caffeine: Pepsi Max contains a higher concentration of caffeine compared to the traditional Pepsi. Caffeine is known to be a stimulant that can lead to addiction in some people. It stimulates the central nervous system, providing temporary alertness and a boost in energy, making it attractive to those who need to stay focused or energized. c) Carbonation: The effervescence and fizz from carbonation can make beverages like Pepsi Max more appealing on the palate, which can contribute to an addictive sensation. d) Branding and Marketing: PepsiCo invests heavily in promoting and advertising its products. This marketing often includes the use of celebrities, catchy slogans, and appealing visuals, which can make Pepsi Max more enticing to consumers. In conclusion, the questions are not the same, as one focuses on the overall objectives of the Pepsi company, while the other looks at the perceived addictiveness of one specific product, Pepsi Max."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is another sentence: My father considered the commercialization of Christmas to be a sacrilege. Does the term commercialization mean the same thing in both these sentences?","output":"The term \\"commercialization\\" does indeed appear in both sentences, but its meaning slightly differs depending on the context in which it is used. In the first sentence, \\"Both companies will retain control over the commercialization of their own products,\\" commercialization refers to the process of introducing, marketing, and managing a product or service in order to make it available and profitable in the market. This could involve tasks such as developing a marketing strategy, pricing, promotion, distribution, and customer support. The emphasis in this case is on a conscious effort made by the companies to bring their products to market and generate revenue from them. In the second sentence, \\"My father considered the commercialization of Christmas to be a sacrilege,\\" commercialization takes on a somewhat different meaning. Here, the term is used to describe the transformation of a cultural event or tradition into a profit-driven, market-oriented activity that potentially alters the original nature or spirit of that event or tradition. In this case, the father perceives the commercial aspects of Christmas—such as excessive advertising, extensive purchasing of material goods, and greater emphasis on shopping rather than the religious or familial aspects—as a desecration of the true meaning of the holiday. While the core concept of commercialization is present in both sentences as involving market-related or profit-driven activities, the contexts underscore different aspects of the term. In the first sentence, commercialization is depicted as a business strategy, whereas in the second sentence, it represents the possibility of an undesirable influence on cultural or traditional values. This difference in application is what differentiates the meaning of the term \\"commercialization\\" in the two sentences provided."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: How are people not likely to find those always holding  a remote? Possible A: attached, lovable, companionable, close, likely  Why is \\"companionable\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Companionable\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in this context because it reflects a certain degree of social aptitude and connection, which is not typically expected from individuals known for constantly holding a remote. To better understand this perspective, we must analyze the context and implications associated with these words. 1. Context of the question: The question implies that there is a person who is habitually holding a remote, which often suggests that they are engaging in watching TV, playing video games, or other activities involving media consumption. This gives us an understanding of the individual's potential lifestyle and behavior patterns. 2. Analyzing the possible answers: a) Attached - This answer does not seem fitting, as someone constantly holding a remote may not necessarily be attached to others, and the context of attachment is ambiguous at best. b) Lovable - This trait is subjective and unrelated to whether a person holds a remote or not. c) Companionable - This is an apt answer as it describes a person who is friendly, sociable, and enjoys spending time with others. People who spend a significant amount of time holding a remote might not be perceived as engaging or focused on interpersonal relationships, as they may be perceived by others as preoccupied with their activities. d) Close - Like \\"attached,\\" this answer is ambiguous in the context of the question. It seems unrelated to whether a person is holding a remote. e) Likely - The term \\"likely\\" does not provide any information about the person's traits or characteristics; it is not relevant in the context of the given question. In conclusion, the term \\"companionable\\" aligns with human common sense in answering the question because it addresses the potential social implications of someone habitually holding a remote. People who spend a considerable amount of time engaging with media devices may be perceived as less involved in social interactions and interpersonal relationships. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that they are less likely to be described as companionable in comparison to someone who demonstrates a greater focus on social engagement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the eighth studio album by English rock band the Beatles. Released on 26 May 1967 in the United Kingdom and 2 June 1967 in the United States, it was an immediate commercial and critical success, spending 27 weeks at the top of the UK albums chart and 15 weeks at number one in the US. On release, the album was lauded by the vast majority of critics for its innovations in music production, songwriting and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between popular music and high art, and for providing a musical representation of its generation and the contemporary counterculture. After finishing Sgt. Pepper, but prior to the album's commercial release, the Beatles took an acetate disc of the album to the American singer Cass Elliot's flat off King's Road in Chelsea, where at six in the morning they played it at full volume with speakers set in open window frames. The group's friend and former press agent, Derek Taylor, remembered that residents of the neighbourhood opened their windows and listened without complaint to what they understood to be unreleased Beatles music. On 26 May 1967, Sgt. Pepper was given a rushed release in the UK, where it was originally scheduled for 1 June. The US release followed on 2 June. It was the first Beatles album where the track listings were exactly the same for the UK and US versions. The band's eighth LP, it debuted in the UK at number one - where it stayed for 22 consecutive weeks - selling 250,000 copies during the first seven days. On 4 June, the Jimi Hendrix Experience opened a show at the Saville Theatre in London with their rendition of the title track. Epstein owned the Saville at the time, and Harrison and McCartney attended the performance. McCartney described the moment: \\"The curtains flew back and [Hendrix] came walking forward playing 'Sgt. Pepper'. It's a pretty major compliment in anyone's book. I put that down as one of the great honours of my career.\\" Rolling Stone magazine's Langdon Winner recalls:  The closest Western Civilization has come to unity since the Congress of Vienna in 1815 was the week the Sgt. Pepper album was released. In every city in Europe and America the radio stations played [it] ... and everyone listened ... it was the most amazing thing I've ever heard. For a brief while the irreparable fragmented consciousness of the West was unified, at least in the minds of the young.  Sgt. Pepper was widely perceived by listeners as the soundtrack to the \\"Summer of Love\\". In Riley's opinion, the album \\"drew people together through the common experience of pop on a larger scale than ever before\\". American radio stations interrupted their regular scheduling, playing the album virtually non-stop - often from start to finish. It occupied the number one position of the Billboard Top LPs in the US for 15 weeks, from 1 July to 13 October 1967. With 2.5 million copies sold within three months of its release, Sgt. Pepper's initial commercial success exceeded that of all previous Beatles albums. None of its songs were issued as singles at the time. Ask a question about this article.","output":"Sure, imagine you own a very special music box. This music box has a magical album inside it called 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'.

Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"There is a negative tone to this product review. The title \\"tiresome reading\\" itself suggests that the reviewer did not have a pleasant experience with the book. Additionally, several elements within the review further substantiate the negative tone. Firstly, the reviewer states that the book was \\"very tedious\\" to read, which is a clear indication that they did not enjoy the experience. The use of the word \\"tedious\\" communicates that the book was monotonous and required considerable effort to complete. Secondly, the reviewer expresses their frustration with the \\"constant interruptions to the action\\" in the book. This reveals that they found the interruptions to be detrimental to the overall flow and pace of the story, negatively impacting their engagement with the book. Next, the reviewer discusses counting the “95 mentions of other mystery authors by page 200,” indicating that they found these references to be \\"way too intrusive.\\" This further emphasizes the negative tone, as the reviewer was bothered enough by these interruptions to actually count the number of times they occurred. Another point to consider is that the reviewer identified some positive aspects of the book, specifically mentioning that \\"when the action was on Max (instead of Annie) the action moved better.\\" However, this isolated positive comment does not outweigh the overall negative tone of the review, as it was only briefly mentioned and was not elaborated upon. Finally, the reviewer explicitly states that \\"this is the last of this series I plan to read,\\" which definitively demonstrates their dissatisfaction with the book. By choosing not to continue reading the series, the reviewer conveys a strong negative sentiment toward the book they reviewed. In conclusion, this product review has a predominantly negative tone, owing to the reviewer's description of the book as tedious, their frustration with the interruptions in the story, the intrusive mentions of other authors, and their decision to discontinue reading the series. The brief positive mention of the action focusing on Max does not negate the overall negative tone, as it was not expanded upon and was overshadowed by the cited negative aspects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Push the extension rod into the object for a depth measurement. Look at the digital reading.","output":"Title: How to Use Digital Calipers: A Simple Guide for Kids Hello little friends! Today, we are going to learn about a super cool tool called digital calipers. These are used to measure things very accurately. They can help us find the size of different objects, like your favorite toys or even the thickness of a yummy cookie. Let's learn how to use them with some easy steps! Step 1: Make the Calipers Ready Before we start measuring, we need to make sure our digital calipers are set to zero. This is like starting a race from the same spot, so everyone gets a fair chance. To do this, press the \\"zero\\" or \\"on/off\\" button on your digital calipers, and make sure the screen shows \\"0.00\\". Step 2: Measure the Outside of an Object To find out how big something is on the outside, we need to use the calipers like a little hug. Open the jaws of the calipers (the two arms) and put them around the object you want to measure, like a toy car. Then, gently close the jaws until they touch both sides of the object. Be careful not to squeeze too hard, or you might scratch it. Step 3: Measure the Inside of an Object Sometimes, we might need to measure the inside of an object, like a tube or a ring. For this, open the jaws of the calipers and place the smaller, pointy ends inside the object. Make them touch the inner walls while being super gentle. This will help you find the inside space of the object. Step 4: Measure the Depth of an Object Digital calipers also have a superpower to measure how deep something is, like a little hole. For this, you will need to use a special part of the calipers called the extension rod (it looks like a tiny sword). Push it into the hole or space you want to measure until it can't go any further. Step 5: Read the Measurement Now that we've measured our object, let's find out what the size is. Look at the screen on the calipers, and you'll see some numbers – that's the measurement! The numbers could be in different units like inches, millimeters, or centimeters. Be sure to note down the numbers so you don’t forget. Wow, now you know how to use digital calipers! Remember these five simple steps and you'll be able to measure all sorts of fun objects. Just make sure to always be careful with your calipers and your objects, so nothing gets damaged. Have fun measuring!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

News article: Summary: The operational disclosure is notable, as mega-huge high-tech companies from Microsoft to HP to IBM vie to becoming leaders in the cloud computing movement.      Finally, the world's biggest Internet services operator has disclosed just how much power it takes to run all those servers -- a number that it has been loathe to disclose previously, despite its otherwise impressive green-tech credentials.      The disclosure marks an important turning point for the high-tech industry: as many companies aspire to win out in the cloud services movement -- Cisco, IBM, Dell, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard are just a few of the companies drooling after Google's marketshare -- the ability to manage electricity consumption and energy-efficiency will be a critical operational measure.      The number: Google reports that in 2010 year, it used 2.6 million 260 megawatt-hours of electricity. Most of that amount went to run its massive data center footprint, which it figures uses less than 1 percent of the world's electricity generation (according to an independent report). The company generated approximately 1.46 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions during that year.      Even Google has been mum publicly about its consumption, it has been doing something about it for years (Psssst. Google's data center efficiency secrets. Pass them on.) For example, its investments in renewable energy technologies probably are creating about 1.7 gigawatts of renewable power capacity. Between those investments and its carbon offset purchases, Google figures its impact is carbon-neutral.      A post on the Google blog details how the company is opening the kimono on its electricity consumption. The blog notes:      \\"We started the process of getting to zero by making sure our operations use as little energy as possible. For the past decade, energy use has been an obsession. We've designed and built some of them most efficient servers and data centers in the world -- using half the electricity of a typical data center.\\"      Energy-efficiency measures of this sort will be important not just from the point of view of the green-minded among us, but because as more infrastructure technology becomes consumed as a service, the ability of a cloud service provider to be the most energy-efficient in its class will become a margin and cost advantage. So least you think this is all about environmental bleeding hearts, think again. Your procurement team will be looking at this stuff.      Facebook, in face of criticism from environmental activist group Greenpeace, is also hard at work on its data center energy-efficiency through something called the Open Compute Project (Want to be as energy-efficient as Facebook? There's a spec for that).      According to a ranking published earlier this year by Greenpeace, Google isn't quite the greenest cloud provider, at least from a coal-intensity point of view. According to that ranking, Yahoo!, Amazon and Microsoft perform better than Google on that measure.      Frankly, I don't care whether Google or Facebook is greener, fundamentally speaking. But I do care that that this issue is finally getting the attention it requires.      Related posts: ||||| Google disclosed Thursday that it continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes, but it says that in doing so, it also makes the planet greener.      Every time a person runs a Google search, watches a YouTube video or sends a message through Gmail, the company’s data centers full of computers use electricity. Those data centers around the world continuously draw almost 260 million watts — about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant.      Up to now, the company has kept statistics about its energy use secret. Industry analysts speculate it was because the information was embarrassing and would also give competitors a clue to how Google runs its operations.      While the electricity figures may seem large, the company asserts that the world is a greener place because people use less energy as a result of the billions of operations carried out in Google data centers. Google says people should consider things like the amount of gasoline saved when someone conducts a Google search rather than, say, drives to the library. “They look big in the small context,” Urs Hoelzle, Google’s senior vice president for technical infrastructure, said in an interview.      Google says that people conduct over a billion searches a day and numerous other downloads and queries. But when it calculates that average energy consumption on the level of a typical user the amount is small, about 180 watt-hours a month, or the equivalent of running a 60-watt light bulb for three hours. The overall electricity figure includes all Google operations worldwide, like the energy required to run its campuses and office parks, Mr. Hoelzle added. Data centers, however, account for most of it.      For years, Google maintained a wall of silence worthy of a government security agency on how much electricity the company used — a silence that experts speculated was used to cloak how quickly it was outstripping the competition in the scale and efficiency of its data centers.      The electricity figures are no longer seen as a key to decoding the company’s operations, Mr. Hoelzle said.      Unlike many data-driven companies, Google designs and builds most of its data centers from scratch, down to the servers using energy-saving chips and software.      Noah Horowitz, senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council in San Francisco, applauded Google for releasing the figures but cautioned that despite the advent of increasingly powerful and energy-efficient computing tools, electricity use at data centers was still rising because every major corporation now relied on them. He said the figures did not include the electricity drawn by the personal computers, tablets and iPhones that use information from Google.      “When we hit the Google search button,” Mr. Horowitz said, “it’s not for free.”      Google also estimated that its total carbon emissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, with most of that attributable to carbon fuels that provide electricity for the data centers. In part because of special arrangements the company has made to buy electricity from wind farms, Google says that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels in 2010, and estimates that figure will reach 30 percent in 2011.      Google also released an estimate that an average search uses 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, a figure that may be difficult to understand intuitively. But when multiplied by Google’s estimate of more than a billion searches a day, the figure yields a somewhat surprising result: about 12.5 million watts of Google’s 260-million-watt total can be accounted for by searches, the company’s bread-and-butter service.      The rest is used by Google’s other services, including YouTube, whose power consumption the company also depicted as very small.      The announcement is likely to spur further competition in an industry where every company is already striving to appear “greener” than the next, said Dennis Symanski, a senior data center project manager at the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit organization. At professional conferences on the topic, Mr. Symanski said, “they’re all clamoring to get on the podium to claim that they have the most efficient data center.” ||||| For the first time, Google (GOOG) has revealed its global electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, part of a concerted effort to become more transparent about its energy use as it opens new data centers, purchases additional buildings, hires more employees and encourages consumers to use its cloud-based services like Gmail.      The Mountain View-based Internet search giant revealed Thursday that the company consumed 2.26 billion kilowatt hours of electricity in 2010. In comparison, the U.S. Energy Information Administration says that the average U.S home uses about 11,000 kilowatt hours a year -- which means Google's electricity consumption is roughly equivalent to 200,000 homes.      Google has 29,000 employees worldwide, owns millions of square feet of office space around the world and is about to open its latest data center in Finland.      Google says it emitted 1.46 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2010 -- equivalent to the yearly emissions of 70,000 Americans. Google purchases carbon offsets for its emissions and has been \\"carbon neutral\\" since 2007. It says 25 percent of its electricity came from renewable sources in 2010, a figure expected to rise to 30 percent in 2011 and 35 percent in 2012.      \\"For the last decade, energy use has been an obsession,\\" Urs Hoelzle, Google's senior vice president for technical infrastructure, wrote in a blog post. \\"We've designed and built some of the most efficient servers and data centers in the world -- using half the electricity of a typical data center.\\"      Advertisement      Tech companies in Silicon Valley and elsewhere are under enormous pressure to reduce the environmental impact of their data centers and operations as more computing services -- from email to video streaming -- move to remote servers in \\"the cloud\\" and as consumers increasingly rely on mobile phones and tablets.      Google is believed to be the first major tech company to publicly reveal its electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.      \\"We applaud Google for fully disclosing the energy use and resultant carbon emissions from their operations,\\" said Noah Horowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \\"We hope their leadership results in similar disclosures on an ongoing basis from the other owners/operators of massive data centers like Microsoft, Amazon.com, IBM and the U.S. government.\\"      Earlier this week, Google announced that switching to Gmail for email can be about 80 times more energy-efficient than most in-house email, thanks to Google's data centers.      It also said consumers can conserve energy by watching videos on YouTube, which Google owns, rather than on DVDs.      \\"You'd have to watch YouTube for three straight days for our servers to consume the amount of energy required to manufacture, package and ship a single DVD,\\" the company said in a blog post.      Calculating carbon emissions is a complex exercise that can be done in a variety of ways. Google looked at both direct and indirect emissions, including the emissions from company-owned vehicles like Street View cars and shuttle buses. It also calculated its purchased electricity, employee commuting habits, business travel, server manufacturing and data center construction.      Once Google gathered and crunched all the data, it was handed over to Cameron-Cole, a third-party verifier. \\"I was shocked at how hard the process is,\\" said Jolanka Nickerman, Google's director of carbon offsets. \\"No one buys carbon dioxide -- you don't have receipts for it.\\"      Google's emissions are growing because the company is continuing to grow as it launches new products and hires additional employees. The company tries to mitigate that with a three-pronged strategy of reducing energy consumption, investing in and using renewable energy and purchasing carbon offsets.      \\"I don't know of any other company that's done a full accounting,\\" said Jonathan Koomey, a consulting professor at Stanford who has published several studies on data centers and energy use. \\"This is clearly something Google has worked on for a long time.\\"      Horowitz of the NRDC stressed that while Google has calculated the energy used to deliver its various products, consumers also use energy when they conduct Internet searches or download videos. While companies are becoming more energy-efficient, consumers also need to step up efforts to reduce their energy consumption, he said.      \\"When you are shopping for a new computer, make sure it is an Energy Star-labeled product,\\" said Horowitz. \\"And make sure your computer goes into its low power sleep or standby mode when it's not in use. \\"      Contact Dana Hull at 408-920-2706.

News article: Intel Ending Development of Wireless Charging For Laptops As chip giant Intel continues to slash away at some of its less successful efforts, the company has decided to end its wireless charging work. The effort to create a way to charge laptops with power beamed through the air instead over a power cord has been ongoing for years but with little to show for the investments. Last year, Intel demonstrated a limited, desk-bound system that sent power over a few inches of distance, promising it would hit the market this year but currently there is no sign it will be available for sale. Last week, four Intel intc executives resigned from positions with the AirFuel Alliance, one of several industry initiatives pushing wireless charging standards, Forbes reported on Monday. The former Intel members cited their company’s realigning of strategic priorities in emails to the alliance, according to Forbes. Intel said it would continue to work with laptop makers to “validate” their wireless charging solutions and work closely with WiTriCity, a charging startup backed by the company’s venture capital unit. “We will also support the ecosystem through continued participation in the AirFuel Alliance, but effective immediately, we will no longer pursue our own wireless charging development,” a spokeswoman said. The demise of the wireless charging effort comes after Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced a massive overhaul of the company, along with 12,000 employee layoffs, in April. New president Murthy Renduchintala, an outsider hired from Qualcomm qcom to shake things up, was conducting a review of Intel’s entire line of products, Krzanich revealed, adding that he expected to slash at least “a few” lines after hearing Renduchintala’s report. As PC sales continue to shrink at an accelerating rate, Krzanich has been shifting resources to focus on faster growing areas, such as chips for data centers and “smart” devices.

At least 2.3 million people took some kind of online courses, according to a recent survey by The Sloan Consortium, an online education group, and two-thirds of colleges offering \\"face-to-face\\" courses also offer online ones. But what were once two different types of classes are looking more and more alike and often falling into the same pool of students.

In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\\" West said. \\"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred.  Question: \\"What solution is West offering and how is it different for a plaintiff from what is already being practiced?\\" Answer: \\"That a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA instead of 30 days which places an undue burden on the plaintiff\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"Yes, sweetie, the answer is correct. Ms. Valerie West suggests that a custody order should last as long as the Protection From Abuse order—up to 18 months. Right now, a custody order must be set up within 30 days after a Protection From Abuse order. She thinks this change would make things easier for the person bringing the case, or the \\"plaintiff\\", by reducing costs, making it easier to find a lawyer, and removing the need to face the person who hurt them so soon after the incident.

However, I regret to say that my recent trip to Sunbaked Shores, a highly-recommended waterfront retreat, turned out to be a major disappointment in several troubling ways. Upon arrival at the resort, my first impression was tainted by the lackluster check-in process. The front-desk staff seemed indifferent and disorganized, with little concern for providing a welcoming atmosphere for weary travelers. They took an excruciatingly long time to process our reservation, and despite requesting weeks in advance for an ocean-view room, we were met with perplexed looks when inquiring about room availability. Ultimately, we were assigned a room with a partial view of the parking lot and noisy construction site next door. The rooms themselves left much to be desired. The outdated decor, combined with the unmistakable musty odor of damp fabrics, suggested a lack of attention to detail and housekeeping. Moreover, the walls were thin enough that even the mildest of conversations from the adjacent rooms quickly became unbearable interruptions. Sadly, even basic amenities like Wi-Fi and air conditioning were faulty and unpredictable, making a comfortable stay virtually impossible. Sunbaked Shores allegedly prides itself on being a renowned culinary destination, yet my taste buds were anything but inspired. The food was bland, overpriced, and reminiscent of generic, mass-produced meals found at budget chain restaurants. The on-site dining options also had very limited hours, leaving us with few alternatives other than venturing out of the resort for sustenance. The resort grounds, once the envy of surrounding vacation spots for their lush, well-manicured landscaping, have fallen into disrepair. The once vibrant flower beds now harbored wilted, unattended vegetation, and the grassy areas were a minefield of unruly weeds. The swimming pool appeared just as uninviting, with murky water and multiple broken lounge chairs scattered around the perimeter. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of our vacation, however, was the lack of activities and entertainment that Sunbaked Shores had promised to provide. The advertised water sports center was virtually non-existent, and the nightly performances were uninspired and amateurish at best. The absence of engaging distractions made the entirety of our stay feel like an eternal stretch of monotony. In conclusion, my expectations for Sunbaked Shores Resort were vastly let down by the subpar accommodations, lackluster service, and dismal surroundings. The overwhelming dissatisfaction with my experience has left me adamant to not only avoid returning, but also caution others in search of a vacation haven to steer clear of this disappointing destination. There are certainly far better alternatives to consider for those in search of the perfect waterfront retreat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Movie title: Sleeping Beauty Context: A childless Queen (Morgan Fairchild) and her King (David Holliday), are given a magical potion by a kindly elf (Kenny Baker). When the beautiful Princess Rosebud is born, all the fairies in the land are invited to a christening to bestow their gifts upon the child. However, the evil Red Fairy (Sylvia Miles) is left off the guest list because there are only eight golden dinner plates and nine fairies in the kingdom. Enraged, she crashes the christening ceremony and curses the Princess to prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. The wise White Fairy (Jane Wiedlin), who was tardy and therefore unable to bestow her gift, changes the curse into a spell in which the Princess will fall into a deep sleep for one hundred years and be awakened by the kiss of true love. Meanwhile, the King orders that all the spinning wheels in the kingdom to be destroyed, except for one which is hidden and seemingly forgotten, to try to save his daughter from the fearsome curse. In the passing years, with all the clothes in the kingdom dissolved to rags because of the absence of spindles and sewing needles, the King and Queen travel to the far reaches and bring back reams of fabrics. During their absence, the Red Fairy lures a teenage Princess Rosebud (26-year-old Tahnee Welch) into a secluded old tower room and tricks her into pricking her finger. The evil curse is complete, and Rosebud falls into an enchanted slumber. The White Fairy uses her magic to put everyone in the castle to sleep and cover the castle in thick vines. One hundred years pass, and a handsome Prince comes to the castle and wakes Rosebud with a kiss. Princess Rosebud and her Prince are married and they live happily ever after.

Answer based on context: Trying to snap a two-game skid, the Dolphins flew to The Meadowlands for Week 3 in an AFC East duel against the New York Jets (who were also 0-2 heading into the game).  In the first quarter, the Jets flew out first with QB Chad Pennington completing a 3-yard TD pass to WR Laveranues Coles for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, Miami took the lead with RB Ronnie Brown's 1-yard TD run.  However, it was short lived as on the ensuing kickoff, RB Leon Washington returned the kick 98 yards for a touchdown.  The Dolphins drew closer with kicker Jay Feely's 31-yard and 39-yard field goal.  However, New York responded with Pennington completing a 4-yard TD pass to TE Chris Baker. In the third quarter, the Jets increased their lead with kicker Mike Nugent's 21-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, New York settled with Pennington getting a 2-yard TD run.  Miami nearly had a comeback as Brown got a 2-yard TD run, a 2-point conversion run, and a 22-yard TD pass from QB Trent Green.  However, the Jets managed to hold on to win the game. How many yards longer was Jay Feely's first field goal over Mike Nugent's?","output":"Alright, think of this like a little story about two teams, the Dolphins and the Jets, playing a game. The players, Jay Feely and Mike Nugent, are kicking balls to score points.  Now, Jay Feely scored twice with kicks that went 31 yards and 39 yards. Mike Nugent scored with a kick that went 21 yards. To find out how much longer Jay Feely's first kick was than Mike Nugent's, we need to compare their kicks. So, let's look at the numbers: - Jay Feely's first kick: 31 yards - Mike Nugent's kick: 21 yards Now, imagine you have 31 toy blocks for Jay Feely's first kick and 21 toy blocks for Mike Nugent's kick. To see the difference, let's take away the 21 blocks of Mike Nugent's kick from the 31 blocks of Jay Feely's first kick.  So, 31 - 21 = 10 That means Jay Feely's first field-goal kick was 10 yards longer than Mike Nugent's kick."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The spy hid in the bushes instead of in the flowers because the","output":"bushes offered better concealment and a more strategic vantage point. Unlike the flowers, which were beautiful but easy to spot due to their vibrant colors and relatively short height, the bushes were dense and tall enough to obscure the spy's presence while allowing them to maintain a clear line of sight on their surroundings. Choosing the right hiding place is crucial for a spy as it could make the difference between completing a mission successfully or being discovered and captured. The bushes provided a natural cover, blending well with the environment and making it more difficult for any passerby or security personnel to notice that someone was hiding there. The thick foliage consisting of leaves and branches not only disguised the spy but also muted any sounds that might give away their position, allowing them to remain hidden and undetected. Additionally, the bushes gave the spy a wider field of vision compared to the flowers. From their position amongst the bushes, they could monitor the area comprehensively, paying particular attention to any key points of interest, entrances, or exits. This would enable them to track the movements of their target more effectively, or to observe any suspicious activities or persons who might pose a threat to their mission. Furthermore, the bushes also provided some level of physical protection. In the event of an unexpected confrontation or altercation, the spy could use the sturdy branches and vegetation as a barrier, buying them some time to either escape or defend themselves more effectively. This is something the flowers could not offer since they lack the same level of resilience and structural support. Should the need arise for a quick exit or evasion, the bushes granted the spy more options for escape routes. Concealed within the dense foliage, they could easily and swiftly move from one bush to another, staying out of sight while putting a safe distance between themselves and any pursuers. This level of maneuverability is more challenging in a field of flowers, as they stand out against the landscape and offer significantly less cover during an escape. Moreover, the bushes allowed the spy to conceal any necessary equipment, such as communication devices, weapons, or other tools needed for their mission. This versatility and adaptability make bushes a far more advantageous hiding place than the flowers in a situation where remaining undetected is crucial to the success of the mission. In conclusion, the spy opted to hide in the bushes instead of the flowers due to the numerous benefits the former offered, including better concealment, an improved vantage point for observation, enhanced cover for sudden escapes, and added physical protection. This tactical decision to hide amongst the bushes significantly increased their chances of remaining undetected and successfully completing their mission."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Background: Most chemical reactions within organisms would be impossible under the normal conditions within cell. For example, the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life processes. Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide. Therefore, the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions. In organisms, catalysts are called enzymes .  Paragraph: Mike is a biochemist, working for a science lab. Today, he has two organisms to investigate, organism A and organism B. He notices that organism A has enzymes, but organism B lacks enzymes.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would organism A see speedier or slower chemical reactions than organism B?

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the highest temperature ever recorded in °C of the country with a predominantly temperate climate? ?  The climate of Japan is predominantly temperate, but varies greatly from north to south. Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaido, Sea of Japan, Central Highland, Seto Inland Sea, Pacific Ocean, and Ryukyu Islands. The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.The Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu Islands and Nanpō Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.The average winter temperature in Japan is 5.1 °C (41.2 °F) and the average summer temperature is 25.2 °C (77.4 °F). The highest temperature ever measured in Japan 41.1 °C (106.0 °F) was recorded on July 23, 2018. The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north until reaching Hokkaido in late July. In most of Honshu, the rainy season begins before the middle of June and lasts about six weeks. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain.

Article: Listening to music can help me focus better. Since I discovered it two years ago,I've used music to get through boring work or to focus creatively. I've found that it can make even the dullest jobs enjoyable and help clear mental blocks to creativity. I first noticed the good effects of music while playing video games. It was a few days before Christmas in 2005 and I was playing online video games. My parents had just given me a new MP3,so I decided to listen to music through the headphones while I played. After a few minutes I noticed a great change in my style of play. I was playing more naturally. The music relaxed me,and,to a certain extent,distracted me from the game,allowing my subconscious talent to come through. The music also helped me block out the outside world. With those headphones on I was like a machine,moving from one task to the next without unnecessary thoughts or actions. Music can also have a great effect on mood. If I'm in a bad mood at work,I'll listen to some of Bob Marley's and get down to business. It always takes my mind off what I'm doing and makes me a happier person. The same is true for classic rock. One summer,I did a boring job collecting bottle openers by hand. Without a radio playing classic rock in the background,I would have hated life. Listening to music with relaxing rhythms and a positive message helps you forget your work and think happy thoughts. But the results you see will depend heavily on your personal tastes. Experiment with the types of music you listen to during certain tasks. By trial and error you'll finally discover your best choice. I'm always looking for new concentration aids,so I'd love to know what type of music works best for me.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation.  I am facing a new situation today: Jason recently learned that he has cancer. After hearing this news, he convinced his wife, Charlotte, to get checked out. After running several tests, the doctors determined Charlotte has no cancer, but she does have high blood pressure. Relieved at this news, Jason was now focused on battling his cancer and fighting as hard as he could to survive.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who has more abnormal cells in their body? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the situation. In the situation, Jason was diagnosed with cancer, which means he has abnormal cells dividing uncontrollably in his body. Charlotte, on the other hand, does not have cancer but has been diagnosed with high blood pressure. Step 2: Recall information from the background article. The background article states that cancer is caused by abnormal cells dividing uncontrollably. This often leads to the formation of tumors, which are masses of abnormal tissue. Step 3: Compare the two individuals in the situation. Jason has cancer, which involves the presence of abnormal cells in his body. Meanwhile, Charlotte does not have cancer and therefore has no indication of abnormal cells associated with cancer. Her condition, high blood pressure, is not directly linked to the presence of abnormal cells. Step 4: Determine the answer to the question. Based on the comparison of the two individuals and the information from the background article, we can conclude that Jason has more abnormal cells in his body due to his cancer diagnosis.

Getting to know the people living next door can create a sense of community and foster genuine connections. As human beings, we have a natural inclination to seek companionship and support from those around us. Forming bonds with our neighbors can lead to a more enjoyable living experience as well as a network of support in the various aspects of daily life. In addition to forming new friendships, meeting new neighbors can lead to a range of new experiences. People often have diverse interests, hobbies, or activities that may be unknown to us. By engaging with our new neighbors and learning about their ways of life, we can expand our own knowledge and gain insight into novel perspectives. These experiences may also include invitations to cultural events, community gatherings, or other social activities that can enrich our lives and enhance our understanding of the world. Encountering new neighbors also prompts us to look around and be more observant of our surroundings. As individuals, we sometimes become so involved in our own lives and routines that we may not pay attention to changes in our environment. The presence of new neighbors serves as a reminder to be attentive to the dynamics of our community and maintain a more active engagement with the world beyond our private lives. A change of surroundings, another option mentioned, is also a significant aspect of welcoming new residents to the neighborhood. The process may bring alterations to the aesthetics of the neighborhood, as newcomers personalize their homes, gardens, and outdoor spaces. These changes can be exciting, as they introduce elements of novelty and variety into a previously familiar environment. This fresh perspective on our surroundings encourages us to appreciate and adapt to the continuous transformation that occurs within our communities. In conclusion, witnessing new people move in next door can be considered interesting, as it allows for the potential development of meaningful relationships, exposure to new experiences, increased attentiveness to our surroundings, and the opportunity to embrace change within our communities.

And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

One of the main protagonists, Dean (Justin Long), has been a waiter at a restaurant called Shenaniganz for four years since graduating from high school, and has not earned a degree during his four years at a community college. When Dean learns from his mother that a former high school classmate, Chett (Travis Resor), now has a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, he begins to rethink his direction-less life. Dean's friend and co-worker, Monty (Ryan Reynolds), is in exactly the same situation, but has accepted that his future lies with the restaurant. Monty is put in charge of training Mitch (John Francis Daley), a newly hired waiter who is constantly interrupted throughout most of the film before he can speak, usually by Monty. Also working with Dean is Calvin (Robert Patrick Benedict), a hopeless romantic who cannot urinate in public, and Dan (David Koechner), the uptight manager who is grooming Dean as his protÃ©gÃ©. Rounding out the staff are 17-year-old hostess Natasha (Vanessa Lengies), abrasive waitress Naomi (Alanna Ubach), waitress (and Monty's ex-girlfriend) Serena (Anna Faris), Dean's girlfriend and fellow waitress Amy (Kaitlin Doubleday), stoner busboys T-Dog and Nick (Max Kasch and Andy Milonakis), head chef Raddamus (Luis Guzman), the insane, unsanitary chef Floyd (Dane Cook), lesbian bartender Tyla (Emmanuelle Chriqui), and the pensive and philosophical dishwasher Bishop (Chi McBride). The waiters preoccupy themselves with endless gossip, complaining about the customers, seeking covert revenge on particularly rude or annoying patrons, and playing a special kind of game which involves flashing genitalia at a fellow worker (the \\"Penis Showing Game\\"). Each employee has his or her own problems and stories, which are interwoven with the ebb and flow of business. A common phrase used throughout the film, which is referred to in the Shenaniganz training video is \\"The only thing different between extraordinary and ordinary, is that little bit of extra!\\"...

Write a title for this article: There will be no baggies of pot awaiting patients next week, when Minnesota joins 21 other states in offering medical marijuana. No glass pipes, no plants to tend at home. Instead, the nation’s latest medical marijuana programme is a world of pill bottles and vials of marijuana-infused oil. For the qualifying patients seeking relief from pain, medical marijuana advocates and some lawmakers, Wednesday isn’t the finish line, but the first step. The state’s restrictive approach, unseen in the industry, is likely to mean high costs, long drives and reluctant doctors. “The door is opening,” said Bob Cappechi of the Marijuana Policy Project, a national outfit that pushes to loosen marijuana laws. “This will start helping people out. That’s really what this is all about.” Minnesota’s medical marijuana advocates snatched an unlikely victory from the legislature last year after years of failed efforts, but there was little celebration. What emerged to assuage skeptical law enforcement lobbyists and a wary governor was one of the strictest programs in the nation. Smoking the plant is forbidden. Pills, oils and vapors are only available to patients suffering from severe conditions, such as cancer, epilepsy, HIV and Aids. And the medicine can only be sold in eight locations, hundreds of miles away from some in Minnesota’s rural expanses. The two companies growing, cultivating and selling marijuana for the state say Minnesota stands out for its medical approach to a nearly 20-year-old industry that uses terms like “budtender” (salesmen) and “California Kush” (a strain of marijuana). “The industry doesn’t do it this way,” Dr. Kyle Kingsley said just days before opening Minnesota Medical Solutions’ first dispensing clinic in Minneapolis. “It’s all new.” Kathy Schroeder’s difficult path shows how the medical polishes on Minnesota’s program look more like hurdles to some patients. On paper, her multiple sclerosis and glaucoma – two of the nine conditions that qualify – made her a perfect fit. But like many residents, the 63-year-old struggled to get a doctor’s signature to sign up for the program. Prodding a second doctor paid off for her, but Schroeder isn’t sure whether she can even afford a month’s worth of medicine, which Kinglsey said may sell for up to 600. Still, she’ll make the 180-mile round trip Wednesday from her home near Rochester to MinnMed’s Minneapolis facility. “I knew it was going to be bad, I had no idea it was going to be this bad,” her daughter, Maren Schroeder, said. State representative Carly Melin sympathizes. The Democrat faced criticism for watering down her medical marijuana bill to get police and Governor Mark Dayton on board. “We weren’t going to get anything done if we didn’t pass this law,” Melin said. Kinglsey said he’s confident doctors and hospital systems will eventually approve, but it’s made for a slow start to a program that’s supposed to sign up 5,000 people. As of Friday morning, just 65 patients were completely registered and another 74 were being processed. Cappechi and other advocates already have ideas for how to improve it: allow more than eight dispensaries, add more manufacturers and patients who suffer from chronic pain, and perhaps lift the ban on smoking the drug. But before expanding, Dr Andrew Bachman, co-founder of the state’s other medical marijuana manufacturer, LeafLine Labs, said they need time to show lawmakers and doctors alike that the new industry works. That starts Wednesday, he said. “Ideology does not change overnight. It’s important to start somewhere,” he said.","output":"\\"Minnesota's Strict Medical Marijuana Program Begins: Patients Face High Costs and Limited Access\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Poor physical fitness of cancer survivors increases recurrence risk Many cancer survivors fail to get adequate exercise and nutrition following their diagnosis, putting them at risk of health problems and their cancer returning, finds a new study. \\"Even small changes can make a difference for patients, such as including a moderate amount of exercise and healthy eating in their treatment and recovery period, if and when they can,\\" said Dr. Kerry Courneya, professor and Canada Research Chair at the University of Alberta, in a release. Researchers at theÂ university looked at self-reported data gleaned from a 2005 Community Health Survey that showed that of the 114,000 adults studied, only 21 per cent of cancer survivors are physically active. In general, 25 per cent of Canadians are physically fit. Eighteen per cent of cancer survivors are obese â versus 15 per cent of Canadians in general. Male cancer survivors (62 per cent) were more likely to be overweight or obese than female cancer survivors (47 per cent). Middle-aged survivors â those aged 40 to 66 â were less likely to be active than those under 40. Colorectal cancer, breast cancer and female melanoma survivors were the least likely to participate in physical activity while the highest levels of activity â and lowest levels of obesity â were reported by prostate cancer survivors and skin cancer survivors. Physical activity is defined as walking for one hour a day, according to the study. Obese refers to a body mass index of 30 or more. \\"We know that physical inactivity and obesity are risk factors for developing cancer,\\" said Courneya. The study recommends that community-based programs be introduced to encourage cancer survivors to develop more active lifestyles.

That he is able to reproduce murder and mayhem so realistically is an achievement that deserves one star. The rest of the film, with its hookers, pimps, and contrived direction is really not worth mentioning. A perfect example of intense violence mistaken for great artistic expression. \\"Taxi Driver\\" is, quite simply, not nearly as good as \\"enlightened\\" cinephiles make it out to be. Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","output":"The review in question can be identified as negative in nature. A detailed analysis of the review can provide various reasons that point towards this conclusion. 1. The author of the review only assigns one star for Scorsese's ability to reproduce violence realistically, which implies dissatisfaction with this aspect of the film. The use of the word \\"only\\" suggests that the reviewer is not highly impressed with Scorsese's representation of violence and limits the recognition of his talent in this area. 2. The negative language used throughout the review highlights the reviewer's overall disapproval. Phrases like \\"not worth mentioning\\" and \\"contrived direction\\" bring attention to the author's low opinion of \\"Taxi Driver.\\" By describing the film's various elements in terms like \\"hookers\\" and \\"pimps,\\" the reviewer underscores their distaste for the thematic content of the movie as well. 3. The reviewer further criticizes the film for being \\"a perfect example of intense violence mistaken for great artistic expression.\\" This statement suggests that the author believes the film is overrated and fails to offer any profound or meaningful message beyond its violent imagery. 4. Moreover, the reviewer compares \\"Taxi Driver\\" to the experiences enjoyed by \\"enlightened\\" cinephiles and implies that the film falls short of living up to such a high standard. By placing \\"enlightened\\" within quotation marks, the reviewer seems to express sarcasm and takes a jab at those who insist that the film is exceptional or noteworthy. The phrase \\"not nearly as good\\" also indicates that the reviewer does not consider \\"Taxi Driver\\" to be a high-quality, superior film. In summary, this review offers a negative perspective on Martin Scorsese's \\"Taxi Driver.\\" The author is critical of the film's use of violence and harsh themes, challenges the artistic value behind the movie, and questions its status as an esteemed film among the cinematic community. These points, along with the predominantly negative language and the low star rating mentioned, leave little doubt that the review is negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Henry Marshall Ashby was a Confederate States Army colonel who served under what former United States Secretary of War? A:","output":"Henry Marshall Ashby was a Confederate States Army colonel who served under the former United States Secretary of War John Buchanan Floyd. Floyd, who held the position of Secretary of War from 1857 to 1860 under President James Buchanan, resigned from his post as tensions rose between the North and the South leading up to the American Civil War. Subsequently, he accepted a commission as a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army. John Buchanan Floyd had a diverse background, having served as the 31st governor of Virginia from 1849 to 1852 before becoming the Secretary of War. During his tenure as Secretary of War, Floyd was involved in various controversies, including the loss of federal funds and weapons that ended up in the hands of the Confederates. His actions prompted a congressional investigation, ultimately leading to his resignation. Henry Marshall Ashby, on the other hand, was a prominent figure in the Confederate forces, particularly in the Western Theater of the American Civil War. Born in 1828 in Kentucky, Ashby was a planter and lawyer by profession. Upon the outbreak of the war, he enlisted in the Confederate Army and was commissioned as a colonel in the 6th Kentucky Infantry. He was later given command of the 26th Tennessee Infantry Regiment. Under the command of General Floyd, Ashby served in several crucial engagements, such as: 1. Battle of Fort Donelson (1862): Floyd, along with Generals Gideon Pillow and Simon Bolivar Buckner, attempted to defend this strategically important fort near the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. However, the Confederate forces were compelled to surrender after a series of prolonged engagements with Union forces led by General Ulysses S. Grant.     2. The Battle of Chickamauga (1863): Despite General Floyd's removal from active duty after the Fort Donelson debacle, Ashby continued his service in the Confederate Army as part of the Army of Tennessee. He saw action at the Battle of Chickamauga in September 1863, one of the most significant and bloodiest battles of the Civil War, where his unit was heavily engaged in the fighting. Henry Marshall Ashby proved to be a dedicated and competent military leader during his service in the Confederate Army, and he provided valuable contributions to the Confederacy's war efforts. Although he served under a controversial figure like John Buchanan Floyd, Ashby's actions and reputation established him as a respected figure within the Confederate forces."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They designed the test after a major study into the genetic makeup of centenarians highlighted a host of DNA variants that boost a person's chances of reaching a ripe old age.      Many of the genetic markers the scientists found stave off common, and often lethal, age-related diseases, such as heart disease, dementia and high blood pressure.      The US researchers investigated the genetic secrets of a longer life after studies showed that living beyond 100 often runs in families.      \\"These families might share healthy lifestyles, but it also suggests there is a strong genetic background to exceptional longevity,\\" said Professor Paola Sebastiani, a biostatistician at Boston University school for public health.      Lifespan is governed by a complex interplay of genes, lifestyle and environment, with factors like smoking, diet, exercise and pollution all having a role, but many scientists believe that living beyond the mid-90s is largely down to having good genes.      Sebastiani and colleagues scanned the genomes of 1,055 centenarians and compared them with scans from 1,267 normal, healthy people. They found 150 DNA variants that were more common in the old-aged group and seemed to make their bodies healthier and more resilient.      The centenarians could be divided into 19 groups based on their genetic makeup. One of these groups was particularly resistant to age-related diseases and contained nearly half of all the centenarians that lived to 110 years or more.      \\"There are particular combinations of these genetic variants that allow people to live not only a longer life, but also a healthier life. In centenarians, disability and disease tend to be delayed until the very end of their lives,\\" Sebastiani said.      The study, published in the US journal Science, will help researchers unravel why and how the body ages and potentially lead to drugs that can slow down the ageing process.      \\"If we can pinpoint genetic variants that delay the onset of diseases, it could have very important medical implications for the population in general,\\" said Sebastiani.      One intriguing finding in the study was that gene variants that raise a person's risk of disease may matter less than genes that protect against disease. The scientists found that centenarians had roughly the same number of high-risk genes as the rest of the population, but had more protective genes to cancel them out. The finding is important, because commercial genetic tests look only for genes that raise a person's disease risk, rather than reduce it.      The study looked only at Caucasians, but Sebastiani said scientists should now look for DNA markers of longevity in other populations, such as Africans and Asians.      Jeffrey Barrett, an expert on disease genetics at the Wellcome Trust's Sanger Institute near Cambridge, said the test might turn out to be less accurate when it is independently verified.      \\"Some of the genetic variants in this study are claimed to have much, much stronger effects on longevity than we've seen in similar studies of diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. For instance, the strongest single effect makes someone 10 times more likely than average to be extremely long-lived, compared to other complex diseases where typical variants only make someone, say, one and a half times as likely to be diabetic,\\" he said.      \\"Subtle biases in their work could contribute to these surprisingly large effects, which would make the test seem more accurate than it really is. Evaluation of the test by an independent laboratory will be the ultimate test of its accuracy,\\" he added. ||||| By Carolyn Y. Johnson      Globe Staff            LEOMINSTER -- Five months shy of his 100th birthday, Louis Charpentier still rises every day at 9 a.m. to spend hours in his basement shop, carving delicate wooden figurines. Years after most people's bodies and minds have failed, Charpentier climbs stairs with ease and recalls everything from the latest episode of \\"Dr. Phil\\" to the first train he ever saw, carrying soldiers who fought in World War I.      For years, scientists have been fascinated by people like Charpentier, who have not only a rich trove of experience, but are also biological outliers that scientists are studying to begin to unlock the secrets of longevity.      Now, using cutting-edge genomics techniques on a group of 1,055 people born near the turn of the last century, a team of scientists from Boston University has identified a genetic signature of longevity. In work published online today by the journal Science, researchers reported that 150 spots in the genome are associated with extremely long life, and can be used to predict with 77 percent accuracy whether someone is likely to live to be exceptionally old.      \\"Exceptional longevity is not this vacuous entity that no one can figure out. I think we’ve made quite some inroads here in terms of demonstrating a pretty important genetic component to this wonderful trait,\\" said Dr. Thomas Perls, the senior author of the paper and the director of the New England Centenarian Study at Boston Medical Center.      The goal is to use the data to investigate what genes play a role in longevity, and to understand how it is that centenarians live so long and stay free of disease or disability. Researchers hope that lessons learned from extremely long-lived people could point to new ways to help everyone else age healthier. Perls was quick to add that the present study examines the genetic basis of healthy aging, and that it would be premature for people to buy a genetic test to predict their longevity.      Companies that offer genetic tests directly to consumers already tell people if they carry genetic variations that hold risk for diseases or traits ranging from Parkinson's disease to lactose intolerance have already drawn criticism from some scientists and doctors, and the US Food and Drug Administration recently wrote letters to several companies that already offer such tests, requiring them to seek regulatory approval.      \\"You could conceivably produce a chip that would help predict people’s genetic predisposition to exceptional longevity. But I and all the authors of the paper want to instill a great deal of caution,\\" Perls said. \\"I start worrying a bit bout what insurance companies and others might do with that information -- I, for one, think it’s not ready from a social point of view.\\"      In order to uncover genetic markers associated with extremely long life, researchers used statistical tools to analyze genetic samples from 801 people, aged 95 to 119. Led by Paola Sebastiani of the Boston University School of Public Health, the team looked at 300,000 spots in the genome of the centenarians and compared them with others to find variations that were associated with longevity.      They found 150 areas in the genome that were associated with longevity, and then tested their tool on a separate group of 254 centenarians and 341 people who were born later. They found that they could predict with 77 percent accuracy whether or not the people were exceptionally long-lived.      Researchers not involved in the research said the new work provides an interesting glimpse of exceptional longevity, but no fast and easy fountain of youth.      \\"I would say you could either see this as the glass being half-empty or half-full,\\" said Leonard Guarente, a biology professor at MIT who does aging research. The half-full scenario is there are now many new genetic spots to investigate that have something to do with exceptional longevity, he said. \\"The glass half-empty would say the analysis of these people is already bewilderingly complex and we're never going to make any headway with this approach.\\"      The results will also have to be replicated in other groups of people to see if they hold up. The ideal analysis would have looked for genetic differences between people who lived to be 100, compared with people born at the same time and died younger, but those people have long since died.      Dr. David Altshuler, a core member of the Broad Institute, a Cambridge genetics research center, said in an e-mail that the results were somewhat surprising, because when researchers have looked for the genetic underpinnings of common diseases, they do not usually find such a strong signal.      \\"I would have guessed that longevity would be even more complex,\\" Altshuler wrote.      It's clear that lifestyle and environment play a large part in a person's longevity. In studies of twins, researchers have found that 20 to 30 percent of a person's longevity is influenced by genes. But when it comes to extremely long life, genetics seems to play a critical role.      The spry, neatly-dressed Charpentier doesn't know how to explain his longevity. His parents lived to be 72 and 85, and he lives healthily. He doesn't drink, he watches what he eats, and he quit smoking cigars 40 years ago. He wasn't involved in the genetic study published yesterday, but -- about to join the rare ranks of the one in 6,000 people who live to 100 -- is one of the subjects being studied by scientists.      Things aren't perfect -- he's a little less steady on his feet than he used to be, and can't lift weights like he did when he was young. But he still works in his shop, lives on his own, and remembers in detail the thoughts and experiences he had as a little boy.      \\"I feel I'm almost the same as when I was younger,\\" Charpentier said. \\"If it keeps on like I am now, I don't mind if I live to be 110.\\"      E-mail Carolyn Y.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Most players choose to use either a one-handed or two-handed backhand very early in their training. Some find that using two hands on their backhand leads to a more accurate and powerful shot. Start from the ready position with your feet pointing towards the net and your knees bent. You should be holding the racket with both hands while facing the net. Make a split step from the ready position to help you to get into position for the two-handed backhand. The split step is a small hop about an inch (2.5 cm) off the tennis court to load up in your legs. Your weight should be evenly divided over both your legs and they should feel like springs so that you can push off explosively to whichever direction you need. Your split step should occur right before your opponent makes contact with the ball. This enables you to be ready to chase down the ball as soon as you know where it is going to hit. This is the first step of the two-handed backhand and is essential for perfecting your shot. From the split step take one step forward with your right foot, pivoting on your left foot and putting all your weight on your left. As you step forward your body and shoulders will begin turning sideways.  All your weight should now be on your back foot. This will help generate power and pace when you take the shot. By turning your body sideways you can move in a sideways and upward direction with your legs while taking your shot. Your arms should not be turning back during this step. They should stay directly in front of your chest. It is very important that your arms are not used during this step. The two-handed backhand grip uses a Continental grip for your dominant (right for right-handers) hand and a Semi-Western forehand grip with your non-dominant (left for left-handers) hand. The non-dominant hand will be just above your dominant hand. Ideally this should happen at the same time as you pivot and turn your shoulders.  To achieve the Continental grip use your left hand to hold your racket in front of you. Point the grip to the right and orient the string area perpendicular to the ground, facing you. Hold your right hand out as if you are shaking hands with the racket. Place the base knuckle of your index finger on the small, sloped side of the grip to the right of the flat side top, and close your hand around it squarely. The sloped side should go diagonally across your palm to point toward the heel of your palm below your pinkie. To achieve the Semi-Western forehand grip you will place the bottom knuckle of your non-dominant hand on the bottom left slanted facet of the grip and close your hand around the grip. The same slanted face should point diagonally across your palm to point toward the heel of your palm beneath your pinkie. The pivot and shoulder turn begins to take the racket back but you must continue to rotate your shoulders and move your arms until the tennis racket is all the way back and your shoulders are all the way sideways.  You should be looking over your shoulders at the ball at this point. These three things should all occur at once. Let your racket drop down as you push off with your back foot, lifting your heel off the ground. At the same time your upper body should rotate towards the net; lifting your heel will help you to rotate your upper body.  This step is the transition from the preparation to the swing. You have the option of taking a small step forward with your front foot at the same time but this is optional. For beginners it is a good idea to take this small step forward at the same time. Make sure your eyes stay on the ball so that you can anticipate the ball’s location and height. Swing your arm and the racket to the contact point with the tennis ball. Your racket will follow a C shaped path as it travels towards the point of contact. You should make contact in front of your body. Your upper body will rotate back towards the net as you make your swing. Your eyes should be totally focused on the ball as you make contact. Make sure contact is made in front of your body and at waist height to enable you to maximize power and topspin. Your strings should be flat on the back of the ball and so directly facing the net. After the contact point you should extend the racket in the direction you are hitting and then rotate your upper body. Continue rotating your shoulders all the way through the shot, until you bend your elbows and bring the racket up over your shoulder.  You want your follow through to be one easy motion so that the deceleration of the racket is smooth. Your shoulders should be facing the net by the end of your follow through. Your racket should end up over your right shoulder when you are finished following through. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about how to hit a two-handed backhand in tennis. It explains the steps to get ready, the correct grip for your hands, how to turn your body, and how to swing and follow through with your shot to make a powerful and accurate backhand.

Frank Victor Swift (26 December 1913 - 6 February 1958) was an English footballer, who played as a goalkeeper for Manchester City and England. After starting his career with local clubs near his home town of Blackpool, in 1932 he was signed by First Division Manchester City, with whom he played his entire professional career. Swift broke into the Manchester City first team in 1933, taking part in the club's run to the 1934 FA Cup Final, where the club triumphed 2-1 against Portsmouth. Three years later Swift won a League Championship medal, after playing in every match of Manchester City's championship-winning season. During the Second World War, Swift continued to play regularly for City, making 134 wartime league appearances. He also joined the British Army, and was one several professional footballers to enlist at the Army School of Physical Training as part of a scheme devised by the FA. The school was based near Aldershot F.C. leading Swift to become one of several notable players to guest for the club. Others included Matt Busby, Jimmy Hagan, Joe Mercer, Stan Cullis, Cliff Britton and Tommy Lawton. He also guested for several other clubs during the war including Liverpool. He also played for several representative sides. On 30 October 1943 at Ninian Park, Swift played for a Western Command XI against a Cardiff City XI which featured Lawton and Mercer as guests. The game was a fundraiser for Royal Artillery prisoners of war. In April 1944 in Edinburgh he played for a British Army XI that included Jack Rowley, Leslie Compton, Cullis, Mercer, Hagan and Lawton and against a Royal Air Force XI that included Peter Doherty, Stanley Matthews and Ted Drake. The Army won 4-0. On 9 September 1944 at Windsor Park he played for a Combined Services XI in an 8-4 win against Ireland. This team was in effect a Great Britain XI and featured, among others, Busby, Matthews, Lawton, Mullen, Raich Carter and Stan Mortensen. In the same year he also represented an FA Services XI in games against France and Belgium. In May 1945 Swift also travelled with a British Army XI on a European tour.  In the first season after the Second World War, Manchester City won the Second Division championship to secure their return to the top flight. In the process Swift kept a club record 17 clean sheets in 35 appearances, a mark which was not surpassed until nearly 40 years later, when Alex Williams broke the record by keeping 20 clean sheets in 1985.  By 1949 Swift was 35 years old, but was still performing well enough to maintain his place in the England team. However, he decided that he wanted to retire while still capable of playing at the top level, rather than fading away. To this end he announced that he would retire at the end of the 1948-49 season. He made what he intended to be his last Manchester City appearance against Huddersfield Town on 7 May, which was followed by a parade in his honour organised by the Supporters' Club. However, just before the next season started, Swift's replacement Alec Thurlow fell ill with tuberculosis, and Swift agreed to step in until City found a new goalkeeper. Four further appearances took his career total to 338. Aware of attempts by other clubs to tempt Swift out of retirement, most notably by Manchester United, the Manchester City board continued to hold Swift's playing registration for several years.

Demons have infested Edo, taking possession of earthly forms and bending them to their unholy will. On top of that, the rebirth of Ashura, Queen of the demons, is nigh. The only thing that stands against this grave threat are the Demon Wardens, a fearsome group of warriors, who might just be as bad as the demons themselves. Izumo is a retired Demon Warden, who five years ago, took up theater instead of Demon Slaying after accidentally killing a innocent child (In a battle that's strangely reminiscent of the bar scene from Dusk till Dawn). One night by a chance encounter he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman named Tsubaki. Their fortunes intertwine (literally) and they are bound by fate to be lovers and enemies. If you think this sounds like your typical Japanese Fantasy/Swordplay epic, you'd be wrong. In fact, there's nothing typical about Ashura. It is a hodge-podge of many different genre's of film. Those just mentioned, as well as a comedy, drama, and romance. Director Yojiro Takita (Onmyoji) juggles the genre's fairly respectfully (Although, the comedy seems forced in some scenes) and the end result is a ridiculous, but really fun popcorn movie. To be sure, there are flaws in the film. Some of the humor seems contrived, and out of place. And the acting isn't the greatest. But seriously, do you watch Fantasy/Swordplay/Comedy films for the great acting performances?? No, we watch them for the action and the crazy CG visuals, all of which Ashura has in Spades. Not to be misleading, the film is not all action, but it is spaced out generously enough with lots of swordplay and buckets of green blood to keep the average viewer happy. Bottom line; the films has it's faults and is not a martial arts epic, but it doesn't try to be and it features interesting visuals and good swordplay action. The reason the film worked for me is that it never takes itself too seriously and if the viewer does the same, their sure to be delighted by this fun and silly swordplay fantasy action flick.

Firstly, the paragraph mentions that Albert Levitt was a judge of the United States District Court for the Virgin Islands. This position entails that he must have spent a significant amount of time in courtrooms, as his role involved hearing and deciding cases. Furthermore, his decision ordering that women voters must be registered is a clear example of his presence and influence in the courtroom. Secondly, Levitt was a law professor and a memorable teacher at Washington and Lee University. This implies that he spent time in classrooms, where he would have engaged in teaching and interacting with students. As a law professor, his job would have involved not only preparing and delivering lectures but also participating in class discussions, mentoring students, and evaluating their work. In addition to these professional roles, the paragraph also mentions that Albert Levitt was an attorney and a candidate for political office. These roles further support the notion that he was an active participant in legal and public spheres, rather than being a passive observer. In conclusion, based on the provided information, we can confidently assert that Albert Levitt was an experienced professional who was actively involved in both courtroom and classroom settings.

Velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of motion, so a change in velocity may reflect a change in speed, a change in direction, or both. Both velocity and acceleration are vectors. A vector is any measurement that has both size and direction. People commonly think of acceleration as in increase in speed, but a decrease in speed is also acceleration. In this case, acceleration is negative and called deceleration. A change in direction without a change in speed is acceleration as well.  Paragraph: Jacob is an avid street car racer who is driving in his sleek black Mustang.

Options are: -- no. -- yes.","output":"No, the two questions do not have the exact same meaning, although they are closely related. The first question specifically asks why girls cannot stand and pee, while the second question explores the level of difficulty women encounter when attempting to pee standing up. To address the first question, girls cannot stand and pee primarily due to their anatomical differences from males. Female urinary anatomy consists of a shorter urethra and a more internal urethral opening. The urethra, which is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body, is directed downward and forward in females, making it more challenging to aim the urine stream away from the body. Moreover, the female urethra has a wider opening and is closer to the vagina, which adds to the difficulty of controlling the flow and direction of the urine stream. Now, let's discuss the second question. It is difficult, but not impossible, for women to pee standing up. To do so, they would need to utilize specific techniques and sometimes even special equipment. A woman must spread her legs wide, use her fingers to separate the labia, and adjust her body position to achieve the desired angle for the urine to flow away from her body. For most women, this method does not come naturally and may require practice to achieve the desired outcome without causing mess or discomfort. There are devices known as female urination devices (FUDs) or \\"pee funnels\\" available that enable women to urinate while standing. These devices are designed to fit over the female genital area and channel the urine stream away from the body. When used correctly, FUDs can be a convenient and hygienic solution for women who prefer or need to urinate while standing up. Some women opt to use them for outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, or in situations where cleanliness of public restrooms is a concern. These devices could make it easier for women to pee standing up, although using them may still require practice and some level of dexterity. In summary, the two questions presented - the inability of girls to stand and pee and the challenges faced by women in doing so – are closely related but not exactly the same. While anatomical differences make it inherently more difficult for women to urinate standing up, it is not impossible for them to do so, especially if they utilize specific techniques or opt for female urination devices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere. Now my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a ‘customer is always right’ the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite ‘fuck off'. All I say is ‘Good’ and move on to the next customer. Hitler-lite phones my corporation to voice a complaint, so a suit comes out and asks the team who did it, I fess up so I can save the time and not have a reason to hate one of my co-workers. I get a lecture and a warning, the end. Question: What is most likely her job?

Six of the seven living species occur in the Old World , but the maguari stork has a South American range . In addition , fossils suggest that Ciconia storks were somewhat more common in the tropical Americas in prehistoric times . These are large storks , typically 100 cm tall , with a 180 cm wingspan and a long thick bill . Members of this genus are more variable in plumage than other storks , but several species have black upper bodies and wings , and white belly and undertail . Juveniles are a duller , browner version of the adult . Ciconia storks are gregarious and colonial breeders , and pairs stay together for life . They typically build large stick nests in trees , although the maguari stork will nest on the ground and at least three species will construct their nests on human habitations . One of these , the white stork , is probably the best known of all storks , with a wealth of legend and folklore associated with this familiar visitor to Europe . These storks feed on frogs , insects , young birds , lizards and rodents . They fly with the neck outstretched , like most other storks , but unlike herons which retract their neck in flight . The migratory species like the white stork and the black stork soar on broad wings and rely on thermals of hot air for sustained long distance flight . Since thermals only form over land , these storks , like large raptors , must cross the Mediterranean at the narrowest points , and many of these birds can be seen going through the Straits of Gibraltar and the Bosphorus on migration .  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Storks are large, long-legged, long-necked wading birds with long, stout bills. They belong to the family Ciconiidae. They are the only family in the order Ciconiiformes, which was once much larger and held a number of families.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'parent taxon' with 'ciconiidae'.

However, referee Don Robertson took no action against either player. \\"The referees have got to be brave,\\" Foran said. \\"It's quite blatant, it's there for everyone to see.\\" Celtic went 2-1 up shortly after the incident but Caley Thistle drew level again late on through Alex Fisher.

Celtic - who beat Rangers 5-1 last week and then lost 7-0 to Barcelona in the Champions League on Tuesday - dominated the second half but could not get a third goal and eventually dropped league points for the first time this season. \\"We should win that game fairly comfortably,\\" said Rodgers. \\"It was on the back of a tough week, coming to a tough place.

Fisher came off the bench to head in Greg Tansey's cross and secure the point that took Inverness off the bottom of the table. \\"I told the boys at half-time we will get one more chance, believe it, we will get one more chance and we did,\\" added Foran. \\"The desire is there, the hunger is there, and there's still more to come from us, still more quality.

Twitter activists think they know A small group of activists pushed the burning of black churches in the American south onto the news agenda, although it's unclear whether the incidents are linked or what the motivation is behind them. It's a mystery - or rather, mysteries - spread across a huge region. At least seven African-American churches have been burnt in the southern US over the last two weeks. Arson has been implicated in at least three of the blazes, but officials say there's not yet any evidence that the fires are linked. But coming as they did after a mass shooting in Charleston in South Carolina, and a resulting backlash against the Confederate flag, activists behind the protests in Ferguson, Baltimore and elsewhere had no doubt that the fires were retaliation attacks against historically black places of worship, and they took to social media to vent their anger. A co-ordinated effort on Twitter earlier in the week turned the hashtag \\"Who is burning black churches?\\" into a worldwide trend, and it's since been mentioned more than 300,000 times. The phrase, however, is slightly misleading - instead of trying to get to the bottom of who might have been behind the fires, most of the messages Tweeted under the hashtag criticised mainstream US media outlets, claiming that they were ignoring or downplaying the story. \\"I live in knoxville [in Tennessee] and had to hear about a black church being burned IN MY CITY from twitter thanks local news,\\" one man tweeted. The campaign was the brainchild of a relatively small group of activists, many of whom identify themselves on their Twitter profiles as supporters of Black Lives Matter, a movement that originally sprung up to protest alleged police brutality and the shootings of African-Americans. It became a political force last year during protests and riots in Ferguson, Missouri, after 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot dead by a police officer. One of the activists who rose to prominence after live streaming events in Ferguson, Palestinian-American and St Louis native Bassem Masri, was also one of the main Twitter users behind the \\"Who is burning black churches?\\" hashtag. \\"We circulated the idea through [direct messages] so that at a specific time, everyone would to go hard on the hashtag, and encouraged everyone to keep at it,\\" he told BBC Trending. The church burnings were by no means completely absent from the news prior to the Twitter storm - many news outlets, including Buzzfeed, the New York Times, and the BBC reported on the story before the action. But Masri says the real target of the campaign was American domestic television networks, and in particular, 24-hour news. \\"We're talking about CNN and Fox,\\" he says, \\"because not everyone's on social media.\\" Throughout American history, church burnings have been used by white supremacists to intimidate black communities. The tactic was common during the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s, and the BBC's Nick Bryant reports that it remained prevelent in the 1990s, so much so that President Clinton established a task force to investigate church fires. A common theme of the Twitter activists is that the burnings are acts of terror, although the FBI has not yet identified a motive for the alleged arsons, nor have they been labelled hate crimes by the authorities. \\"Media loves to report terrorism commited by brown ppl but not about domestic terrorism committed against brown ppl,\\" read one typical comment. \\"America is so worried about ISIS and terrorism,\\" Masri says, \\"but when domestic terrorism is going on throughout the US, the mainstream media turns a blind eye to it. What we did is force them to talk about it.\\" A Google News search about the fires returned more than 1,400 stories, up from just over 300 on Tuesday. Although news of a seventh church fire broke later Tuesday, and could explain the increase, Masri claimed that the Twitter action worked. \\"We do have a power base where we are able to relay stories to the world and force them to talk about stuff,\\" he says.

In New York City, a middle-aged black insurance salesman named Doyle Gipson is a recovering alcoholic who is attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings to stay sober. On the same morning that Gipson drives to a hearing to try to regain custody of his children, a successful, white, young Wall Street attorney, Gavin Banek, is distracted while driving and collides his new Mercedes CLK320 with Gipson's older Toyota Corolla. Banek was in a rush to get to court to file a power of appointment document, which will prove a dead man signed his foundation over to Banek's law firm. Gipson was also in a rush to get to a hearing to argue for joint custody of his sons with his estranged wife. Banek tries to brush Gipson off with a blank check, rather than exchanging insurance information, thereby disobeying the law. Gipson refuses to accept the check and voices his desire to \\"do this right\\", but Banek, whose car is still drivable, insists upon leaving immediately.  He leaves Gipson stranded, telling him, \\"better luck next time\\". After arriving to the court late, Gipson learns that the judge ruled against him in his absence, giving sole custody of the boys to Gipson's wife and allowing her to proceed with a plan to move to Oregon, never knowing that Gipson was about to buy a house locally and give it to his wife and children as part of his effort to make joint custody workable for everyone.

If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness.

Authorities say Lewis fell to his death after... (Associated Press)      The Los Angeles County coroner's office on Thursday identified the bodies as those of Lewis, 28, and Catherine Davis, 81.      Coroner's Watch Cmdr. Larry Deitz said he could not identify Lewis as being the actor. But the name and date of birth match, and both victims lived at the same address.      The causes of their deaths were unknown pending autopsies.      Neighbors called police Wednesday morning to report a woman screaming and three men fighting.      Officers went to a home in the Los Feliz area near Hollywood and found the body of a woman in the driveway, Sgt. Frank Preciado told the Los Angeles Times ( http://lat.ms/Or6s0E). Investigators believe she was struck or beaten.      The body of the suspected killer, who may have rented a room from the woman, was found about six feet from a wall, Preciado said.      The man climbed a wall and fought with a housepainter at a neighboring home, returned to the woman's home and climbed the wall again to fight with the painter and the owner of the second house, Preciado said.

Not at all, No, Maybe, Yes, or Definitely? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided review, it is challenging to give a definite recommendation for the app \\"Dine\\" to a friend. The review is brief and does not offer any specific insights into the app's functionality, user experience, or overall quality. To provide a more comprehensive answer, I will explore various factors that could contribute to the app recommendation, ranging from Not at all to Definitely. 1. Not at all: In this scenario, the app would have significant functional issues, a poor user interface, or extremely negative reviews from other users. The brief review does not provide enough details to determine if these issues are present, so we cannot confidently choose this option. 2. No: The app might have minor issues or be lacking some essential features that would make it difficult or unenjoyable to use. Again, we do not have enough information from the single-word review to rule this out as a possibility. 3. Maybe: If the app has mixed reviews, average features, or focuses on a niche market, a \\"Maybe\\" recommendation would be appropriate. This means that the app might not be perfect for everyone, but it could still be useful or enjoyable for some users. Based on the limited information available, the \\"Maybe\\" option seems reasonable, as we cannot definitively determine the app's quality from the one-word review. 4. Yes: To recommend the app with a \\"Yes,\\" the app should have mostly positive reviews, a well-designed user interface, and useful or entertaining features. Unfortunately, the given review does not provide enough information to support a \\"Yes\\" recommendation confidently. 5. Definitely: A \\"Definitely\\" recommendation suggests that the app has exceptional quality, outstanding features, or a superb user experience. Such a recommendation would come from a thorough evaluation of the app or a collection of overwhelmingly positive reviews. As the given review does not provide any specifics, it is not sufficient to support a \\"Definitely\\" recommendation. In conclusion, based on the limited information of the review \\"Dine,\\" it is challenging to confidently recommend or advise against the app. Considering the lack of details, a \\"Maybe\\" recommendation seems the most appropriate, as it neither thoroughly endorses nor condemns the app. However, it is suggested to seek out additional reviews and information about the app before making a final recommendation to a friend."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Province of Posen was a province of Prussia from 1848 and as such part of the German Empire from 1871 until 1918. The area, roughly corresponding to the historic region of Greater Poland annexed during the 18th century Polish partitions, was about . For more than a century, it was part of the Prussian Partition, with a brief exception during the Napoleonic Wars.  - A grand duchy is a country or territory whose official head of state or ruler is a monarch bearing the title of grand duke or grand duchess. Relatively rare until the abolition of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the term was often used in the official name of countries smaller than most continental kingdoms of modern Europe (e.g., Denmark, Spain, United Kingdom) yet larger than most of the sovereign duchies in the Holy Roman Empire, Italy or Scandinavia (e.g. Anhalt, Lorraine, Modena, Schleswig-Holstein). During the 19th century there were as many as 14 grand duchies in Europe at once (a few of which were first created as exclaves of the Napoleonic empire but later re-created, usually with different borders, under another dynasty). Some of these were sovereign and nominally independent (Baden, Hesse and by Rhine, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Oldenburg, Saxe-Weimar and Tuscany), some sovereign but held in personal union with larger realms by a monarch whose grand-dukedom was borne as a subsidiary title (Finland, Luxembourg, Transylvania), some of which were client states of a more powerful realm (Cleves and Berg), and some whose territorial boundaries were nominal and the position purely titular (Frankfurt).  - The Congress of Vienna (German: \\"Wiener Kongress\\") was a conference of ambassadors of European states chaired by Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich, and held in Vienna from November 1814 to June 1815, though the delegates had arrived and were already negotiating by late September 1814. The objective of the Congress was to provide a long-term peace plan for Europe by settling critical issues arising from the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. The goal was not simply to restore old boundaries but to resize the main powers so they could balance each other off and remain at peace. The leaders were conservatives with little use for republicanism or revolution, both of which threatened to upset the status quo in Europe. France lost all its recent conquests, while Prussia, Austria and Russia made major territorial gains. Prussia added smaller German states in the west, Swedish Pomerania and 60% of the Kingdom of Saxony; Austria gained Venice and much of northern Italy. Russia gained parts of Poland. The new Kingdom of the Netherlands had been created just months before, and included formerly Austrian territory that in 1830 became Belgium. The immediate background was Napoleonic France's defeat and surrender in May 1814, which brought an end to twenty-five years of nearly continuous war. Negotiations continued despite the outbreak of fighting triggered by Napoleon's dramatic return from exile and resumption of power in France during the Hundred Days of MarchJuly 1815. The Congress's \\"Final Act\\" was signed nine days before his final defeat at Waterloo on 18 June 1815.  - The Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) were a series of major conflicts pitting the French Empire and its allies, led by Napoleon I, against a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions, primarily led and financed by the United Kingdom. The wars resulted from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and the Revolutionary Wars, which had raged on for years before concluding with the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. The resumption of hostilities the following year paved the way for more than a decade of constant warfare often categorized into five conflicts: the War of the Third Coalition (1805), the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806-7), the War of the Fifth Coalition (1809), the War of the Sixth Coalition (1813), and the War of the Seventh Coalition (1815). The Napoleonic Wars had profound consequences for global and European history, leading to the spread of nationalism and liberalism, the rise of the British Empire as the world's premier power, the independence movements in Latin America and the collapse of the Spanish Empire, the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the establishment of radically new methods in warfare.   - Eduard Heinrich Flottwell ( 23 July 1786 -- 28 May 1865 ; after 1861 von Flottwell ) was a Prussian Staatsminister . He served as Oberpräsident ( governor ) of the Grand Duchy of Posen ( from 1830 ) and of the Saxony ( from 1841 ) , Westphalia ( from 1846 ) and Brandenburg ( from 1850 ) Provinces . He was also Prussian Minister of Finance ( 1844 - 1846 ) and Minister of Interior ( 1858 - 1859 ) . Flottwell was born in Insterburg in the Province of East Prussia ( present - day Chernyakhovsk in Russian Kaliningrad Oblast ) , studied law at the University of Königsberg and entered the civil service at the Insterburg court in 1805 , from 1812 at the East Prussian Regierungspräsidium of Gumbinnen . After the Napoleonic Wars he together with Oberpräsident Theodor von Schön re-organised the administration of the West Prussian province at Danzig . In 1825 he was appointed Regierungspräsident of Marienwerder . When in 1830 the Polish November Uprising led by Micha Gedeon Radziwi broke out at Warsaw in Russian Congress Poland , his brother Antoni Radziwi was dismissed as Duke - Governor of the Prussian Grand Duchy of Posen by King Frederick William III and the sole rule passed to Flottwell as the new Oberpräsident . He was a strong supporter of Germanisation and standardised schooling policies , which by some was seen as directed against ethnic Polish Prussians in the region . In 1843 in \`\` Anerkennung der Hilfe nach dem großen Hamburger Brand '' ( acknowledgment after the great Hamburg fire ) , he was named an honorary citizen of Hamburg .  - The Kingdom of Prussia was a German kingdom that constituted the state of Prussia between 1701 and 1918 and included parts of present-day Germany, Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Denmark, Belgium and the Czech Republic. It was the driving force behind the unification of Germany in 1871 and was the leading state of the German Empire until its dissolution in 1918. Although it took its name from the region called Prussia, it was based in the Margraviate of Brandenburg, where its capital was Berlin.  - The Partitions of Poland were three partitions of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth that took place towards the end of the 18th century and ended the existence of the state, resulting in the elimination of the sovereign Poland for 123 years. The partitions were conducted by the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia and Habsburg Austria, which divided up the Commonwealth lands among themselves progressively in the process of territorial seizures.  - The Grand Duchy of Posen was part of the Kingdom of Prussia, created from territories annexed by Prussia after the Partitions of Poland, and formally established following the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. Per agreements derived at the Congress of Vienna it was to have some autonomy. However in reality it was subordinated to Prussia and the proclaimed rights for Polish subjects were not fully implemented. The name was unofficially used afterward for denoting the territory, especially by Poles, and today is used by modern historians to refer to different political entities until 1918. Its capital was Posen. The Grand Duchy was formally replaced by the Province of Posen in the Prussian constitution of December 5, 1848.

Please answer this question: In Australian cricket what are 'extras' known as?","output":"In Australian cricket, 'extras' are commonly known as 'sundries.' Extras, or sundries, refer to the runs scored by the batting side which are not attributed to the individual batsman's score. The term 'sundries' is more prevalent in Australian cricket, whereas 'extras' is the term used more commonly in other cricketing nations. There are different types of extras or sundries in cricket: 1. Wides: A wide is a delivery that is deemed by the umpire to be too far from the striker for them to hit it with a normal cricket shot. A wide ball results in an extra run being added to the batting side's score, as well as an additional ball in the over. 2. No balls: A no-ball occurs when the bowler's foot is over the popping crease at the time of delivery, the bowler throws the ball with an illegitimate delivery action, or when the ball bounces more than once before reaching the batsman. A no-ball results in one additional run to the batting side, and also allows the batsman an opportunity to score runs off that particular delivery without the risk of being dismissed, except for being run out. 3. Byes: Byes are extra runs obtained when the ball passes the batsman without making contact with the bat or the batsman's body (protective gear included), and the batsmen are able to take a run or runs. Byes are awarded if the wicketkeeper fails to cleanly take the ball and the batsmen manage to run between the wickets. 4. Leg byes: Leg byes occur when the ball makes contact with the batsman's body (excluding the hands), but not the bat, and the batsmen are able to take a run or runs. Leg byes are awarded if the umpire believes that the batsman made a genuine attempt to play the delivery with their bat. 5. Penalty runs: In some rare instances, penalty runs can be awarded to the batting side for various reasons, such as the fielding team deliberately obstructing the ball, the ball hitting a fielder's helmet left on the ground, or the bowler persistently running on the protected area of the pitch. These penalty runs contribute to the total but not to the individual batsman's score. Sundries or extras are essential components of the game as they can sometimes prove crucial in determining the outcome of a cricket match. The fielding side tries to minimize the number of extras conceded in order to restrict the batting side's overall score, while the batting side sees extras as additional opportunities to add runs to their tally without compromising their wickets."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Ulla Kloster. PUBLISHED:. 07:40 EST, 12 July 2013. |. UPDATED:. 12:11 EST, 12 July 2013. Darren Feldman was given £20,000 compensation after a tribunal agreed his position at HCA International had become intolerable. A Jewish surveyor received £20,000 in compensation today after a tribunal found that his bullying boss repeatedly taunted him and said he wanted to lock up and gas 'Yids' like Apprentice star Lord Sugar’s son. Darren Feldman’s manager Chris Oates also repeatedly invited him to JuJu, an exclusive champagne bar on London’s King’s Road and mocked Jewish Tottenham football fans. Mr Oates also said he wanted to run past the club’s White Hart Lane stadium wearing an Arsenal top with ‘IVOR 4 SKIN’ printed on the back. Referring to Lord Sugar’s son Daniel, with whom he was negotiating a deal, Mr Oates said: 'Quite frankly they’re all a bunch of Yids. I’d like to lock them in the building and gas them all.' A panel at Central London employment tribunal ruled that Mr Feldman, 33, was hounded out of his £47,500-a-year job with private hospital group HCA International. It found the firm and Mr Oates guilty of race and religious discrimination and harassment, ruling that Mr Feldman was constructively dismissed. Mr Feldman, of Teddington, south-west London, was awarded £15,000 for injury to feelings and £5,000 for lost earnings. Speaking after the tribunal, Mr Feldman said: 'I am very relieved by this outcome. I was so disturbed by my treatment at HCA and it is a shame the company fought this to the end. 'I hope HCA takes action to make sure this never happens again.' HCA’s London hospitals also include. the Portland, Princess Grace, Wellington, Lister, London Bridge, Harley Street Clinic, and Harley Street at University College Hospital. Mr. Feldman’s solicitor Shilpen Savani of law firm DWFM Beckman, said:. 'This is an extreme instance of an employer failing to safeguard an. employee. 'Mr Feldman should never have been subjected to such abuse.' Giving evidence, qualified surveyor Mr Feldman told how he joined HCA as a construction project manager in April last year. Colleagues soon learned that he was Jewish when he showed them a tattoo in Hebrew on his ankle. He told how director of estates and projects Mr Oates, who is in his 40s and not Jewish, called him into his office. Mr Feldman (pictured above) alleged that on his boss's birthday,. the pair discussed doing a potential business deal with Daniel Sugar,. son of Apprentice star Lord Sugar, when Mr Oates made the remarks. Mr. Feldman said: 'Chris asked me what I thought of the idea of his to run. down White Hart Lane wearing an Arsenal football top with the writing. ‘IVOR 4 SKIN’ on the back. He wrote it out on a piece of scrap paper. 'This was a derogatory and offensive. reference to the fact that Tottenham Hotspur Football Club is known to. have a large contingent of Jewish supporters. 'I did not know how to answer that question as I was shocked and offended.' Mr Feldman said that his tormentor then looked up bar JuJu on an iPad and showed him the search results. 'Chris. then asked if I wanted to go to a club after work which is located. along King's Road called JuJu. He pointed his finger at me saying \\"want. to go to JuJu, Juju?\\" repeating it several times in an intimidating. manner.' 'Chris was not only a bully in the way that he treated me but he was also seriously abusive towards me because I was Jewish.' In. his evidence, Mr Feldman said that on his boss's birthday the pair. discussed doing a potential business deal with Daniel Sugar, son of. Apprentice star and former Tottenham chairman Lord Sugar. Spanish electrician Juan Ignacio, who sued HCA International in 2009 after being nicknamed 'Manuel' after the Fawlty Towers waiter at London Bridge Hospital. Mr. Oates is alleged to have said: 'I'm just messing them around. Quite. frankly they're all a bunch of Yids. I'd like to lock them in the. building and gas them all'. It. will be the second payout by American firm HCA, the world’s largest. private hospital group, in recent years after a race discrimination. claim. HCA and Mr Oates strenuously denied Mr Feldman's allegations. A. string of HCA witnesses including Mr Oates, who remains at the firm,. had also denied Mr Feldman’s allegations of racism but the tribunal. rejected their evidence. HCA said that it is 'deeply disappointed' by the judgment and considering an appeal. A. spokesperson said: 'HCA has a clear code of conduct around acceptable,. professional and ethical behaviour and offers an inclusive, open and. supportive working environment for all our staff.' In 2009, Spanish. electrician Juan Ignacio alleged that he was nicknamed ‘Manuel’ after. the Fawlty Towers waiter by workmates at HCA’s London Bridge Hospital. He. complained he was taunted with the famous ‘I know nothing’ and ‘Que?’ catchphrases used by Andrew Sachs’s iconic sitcom character. He. claimed that bullying bosses mocked his accent and jibed ‘He’s from. Barcelona’ in front of others - the standard excuse made for Manuel by. John Cleese’s Basil. Mr Ignacio sued HCA for race and sexual orientation discrimination, harassment and constructive dismissal. On. the first day of his planned five-day hearing HCA agreed to pay him an. undisclosed sum in an out-of-court settlement without admitting any. liability. Highlights:","output":"1.

While spectators are abuzz about McIlroy's quest for a career Grand Slam, the Northern Irish golfer has decided to focus on the task at hand rather than on his personal milestone. With two major champions in the fray, the stage is set for an unforgettable showdown. (Justification: Choose an engaging title and introduction that piques the reader's interest and sets up the main story.) Body: McIlroy, in search of a legendary career Grand Slam – an accolade achieved by only five golfers in history – is ready to put in his all for a victory at Augusta. However, when speaking to the media, he made it clear that his eyes are on the prize, not on the potential title. McIlroy stated, \\"I will try to forget about the Grand Slam and just focus on playing my best golf.\\"  (Justification: Expand on McIlroy's attitude towards the personal milestone and the upcoming game.)

This combination of admiration and competitive spirit promises a thrilling encounter, one that could potentially become an iconic moment in the Masters. (Justification: Describe Spieth's perspective on the matchup to convey a mutual respect between the two competitors and build excitement for the game.) Furthermore, the stakes are high for McIlroy, who is on the cusp of making history as the sixth golfer ever to snag a career Grand Slam.

Write an article based on this summary: A pupil at a state boarding school was beaten when he refused to eat food he had just regurgitated, a court heard. Article:","output":"Title: State Boarding School Pupil Endures Beating for Refusing to Eat Regurgitated Food  Introduction In a recent court hearing, disturbing accounts emerged of a pupil at a state boarding school who was subjected to physical abuse when he refused to eat food he had just regurgitated. The case shines a light on the often hidden and unacknowledged problem of violence and abuse within the educational system, raising concerns about the welfare of vulnerable students residing in boarding schools. As the investigation continues, it is crucial for all involved parties to address the systematic failings that allowed such an appalling incident to occur. Incident Details According to court records, the unidentified student fell victim to a brutal attack after he was unable to keep down the food served during a mealtime at the school. The pupil, who was suffering from an illness, involuntarily regurgitated the food and was subsequently beaten as punishment. When the young student attempted to seek help from the staff, his concerns were dismissed, and he was forced to endure this traumatic episode. The horrifying nature of the event has left many questioning the general safety and wellbeing of those attending state-aided boarding schools. While some argue that this is an isolated case, others contend that such incidents of violence are far from uncommon. Hidden Violence in Educational Institutions The case at hand is a horrifying reminder that violence can thrive in places where we least expect it to, like educational institutions designed to nurture and protect young minds. Despite the strict policies and regulations established to ensure a safe and secure environment, incidents of cruelty, abuse, and negligence continue to persist in those institutions that are entrusted with the care of vulnerable children. The problem of hidden violence in boarding schools and other educational institutions is no longer a secret whispers among students and staff members. Now that it has come to public attention, it is essential for the government to take substantive measures to implement strict regulations and devise strategies for addressing the root causes of violence, such as stress, fear, and a lack of empathy. Need for Systematic Change For the state boarding school pupil who suffered the devastating consequences of violence, the road to recovery may be a long and arduous one. But his story serves as an urgent call for immediate and far-reaching systemic change, especially in reforming policy and adopting measures to alleviate the toxic and violent cultures permeating many of our educational institutions. Without the necessary interventions, abuse and negligence will persist, depriving countless students of safe and secure environments where they can thrive, grow and ultimately achieve their potential. Conclusion As the case of the state boarding school pupil unfolds in court, it is vital for all stakeholders – the government, educational institutions, teachers, and parents – to join forces in eradicating the scourge of violence that has invaded our schools. By making necessary policy changes, enhancing regulatory enforcement, and fostering a culture of empathy and care, we can ensure that schools are prioritized as safe havens for students to excel academically, socially, and emotionally. And, most importantly, we must vigilantly safeguard the wellbeing of every pupil, so that no child ever has to face a harrowing ordeal like the one that this victim endured."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Convicted rapist Ched Evans will be offered a day job by his fiancee's millionaire father if his return to football is blocked, it emerged today. Last week the 25-year-old was offered the chance to train with his former club Sheffield United after he was released from jail last month, having served half his five-year rape sentence. But the decision sparked a huge backlash from a series of high-profile supporters, including Jessica Ennis-Hill and presenter Charlie Webster, who quit as club patron. Evans was expected to start playing football again  last Tuesday, but is yet to turn up. Scroll down for video. Support: The father of Natasha Massey,left,  Ched Evans' fiancee, will offer him a job if his football comeback fails, it has emerged. Out and about: Evans took the rubbish out at home before going for a run as he again failed to go training with Sheffield United today. It has since been reported that the club may not offer the Welsh international a new contract because he is considered 'toxic'. The millionaire father of Evans' fiancee Natasha Massey will offer him a role at his empire, which includes high-end jewellers and a staff rewards ­business, if his football comeback fails, the Mirror said. A source told the paper that Karl Massey said there would always be a job for Evans at one of his firms. They added: 'He believes 100 per cent in Ched's ­innocence, otherwise he wouldn't ­sanction him still dating his daughter or have given them his blessing to marry.' It has been reported that Mr Massey, 50, has paid for a PR campaign which protests Evans' innocence. He is also said to have hired lawyers to present new evidence to the Criminal Cases Review ­Commission in a bid to overturn his conviction. Meanwhile Sheffield United have admitted they are 'appalled' by the abuse being aimed at people who have criticised the club's decision to allow convicted rapist Evans back to training. Twitter abuse was aimed at Olympic heptathlon champion and local hero Jessica Ennis-Hill, who said that to allow Evans back into the Blades squad would 'completely contradict' her beliefs of being a role model to young people. She asked for her name to removed from a stand at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane ground if the club takes back Evans. 'I believe being a role model to young people is a huge honour and those in positions of influence in communities should respect the role they play in young people's lives and set a good example,' she said. 'If Evans was to be re-signed by the club, it would completely contradict these beliefs.' Jessica Ennis-Hill, 27, has received rape threats on Twitter after she said she wanted her name removed from a stand at Sheffield United if Ched Evans is re-signed by the club. Last week the 25-year-old returned to training with his former club Sheffield United after he was released from jail last month, having served half his five-year rape sentence. Within hours she was taunted with several sick tweets including one saying: 'I hope he (Evans) rapes her.' The League One club have pledged to work with South Yorkshire Police who are investigating the abuse. People who send this kind of abuse on social media or when chanting at grounds should not feel safe to make these personal attacks, the club said. Ennis-Hill, a United fan, had a stand at Bramall Lane named in her honour after she won gold at the London 2012 Olympics. Campaigners against sexual violence have criticised the club's decision to allow Evans, 25, to train with the team. TV presenter Charlie Webster, Sixties pop star Dave Berry and Sheffield businesswoman Lindsay Graham have all resigned as patrons of the club since Evans returned to training. Wales international Evans was jailed in April 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, North Wales. The striker denied raping the woman, saying the sex was consensual, but he was found guilty by a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court. TV presenter Charlie Webster, left , has resigned from her role as Sheffield United patron, followed by Lindsay Graham, right, after the club decided to allow convicted rapist Ched Evans to train. Backlash: There has been huge support for a campaign to stop Evans returning to his former club, and other believe as he has only served half his five-year sentence a ban should last for at least that period. He was released from prison last month after serving half of the five-year sentence. An appeal against his conviction was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in 2012. His case is due to be looked at by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. After his release, Evans put a video on his website protesting his innocence and vowing to clear his name. South Yorkshire Police said on Friday: 'South Yorkshire Police can confirm they are investigating reports of abusive tweets. Officers are making efforts to contact the individual concerned, but have launched an investigation into the posts.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"1.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Americans and Briton Who Thwarted Train Attack Receive Top French Honor Three Americans and a Briton received the Legion of Honor for disarming an attacker aboard a high-speed train headed to France. PARIS — President François Hollande of France on Monday awarded the Legion of Honor, France’s highest award, to three Americans and a Briton for their role in stopping a gunman on a high-speed train traveling to Paris from Amsterdam on Friday. The three Americans — Airman First Class Spencer Stone, 23; Alek Skarlatos, 22, a specialist in the Oregon National Guard; and their friend Anthony Sadler, 23 — received the honor in the gilded halls of the Élysée Palace, where they were joined by Chris Norman, 62, a British consultant. “One need only know that Ayoub El Khazzani was in possession of 300 rounds of ammunition and firearms to understand what we narrowly avoided, a tragedy, a massacre,” Mr. Hollande said at the ceremony, referring to the suspect in the attack, a Moroccan who is in police custody and denies that he had planned to stage a terrorist attack. “Your heroism must be an example for many and a source of inspiration,” Mr. Hollande added. “Faced with the evil of terrorism, there is a good, that of humanity. You are the incarnation of that.” After his speech, Mr. Hollande pinned the Legion of Honor medal on the three Americans, who wore khaki slacks and polo shirts, bringing a casual touch to the ornate ceremony. Airman Stone, whose thumb was severely cut by the gunman, still had his left arm in a sling as well as a bruised eye. The three friends were on a tour of Europe that included stops in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. They had intended to spend Friday night in Amsterdam but changed their minds and boarded a high-speed Thalys train to Paris. Shortly after the train crossed the Belgian border into France, they heard a shot, saw a gunman with an AK-47 and rushed to stop him. A French citizen who was the first to tackle Mr. Khazzani but who has declined to be identified will receive the honor at a later date, as will Mark Moogalian, 51, a passenger with dual French and American citizenship who struggled with the attacker and is recovering from a bullet wound. The courageous responses to the presence of a gunman drew attention and praise from around the world, especially in France, where many quickly encouraged Mr. Hollande to award the men the Legion of Honor, which was created by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802 to reward “outstanding merit.” Several senior officials, including Prime Minister Manuel Valls and the head of the French rail company, attended the ceremony on Monday. Mr. Norman, speaking in French to reporters after the ceremony, said he felt honored by the distinction. “I did what I had to do,” he said. “It wasn’t heroism, it was what needed to be done in a situation of survival.” The three Americans did not speak publicly on Monday, but at a news conference on Sunday at the American ambassador’s residence, they brushed aside suggestions that they were heroes and framed their actions as having come from survival instincts. On Monday, the three grinned as they posed for photographs with Mr. Hollande and the American ambassador, Jane D. Hartley, on the steps of the Élysée Palace. After the ceremony, the three men and their families were expected to meet staff members at the United States Embassy, near the presidential palace. The upbeat mood will do little, however, to dispel growing unease in Europe about how to deal with new threats to targets like trains and how to monitor thousands of potential suspects, especially radical Islamist militants returning from Syria. “Faced with terrorism, our societies are not weak,” Mr. Hollande said at the ceremony. “And they will never be weak as long as they stay united, and as long as there are brave women and men ready to risk their lives.” While only French citizens can be members of the Order of the Legion of Honor, foreigners can receive the medal, which has also been awarded to the novelist Toni Morrison and the actor Clint Eastwood. Airman Stone, Mr. Skarlatos, Mr. Sadler and Mr. Norman were made knights of the order, the lowest of five ranks. Mr. Sadler was expected to return to the United States this week to begin his senior year at California State University, Sacramento. Airman Stone said on Sunday that he and Mr. Skarlatos would travel to Germany with their families and would receive further medical care there. An earlier version of this article misstated the number of ranks in the Order of the Legion of Honor. There are five, not four. Lilia Blaise and Elian Peltier contributed reporting. Summary:","output":"On Monday, French President François Hollande awarded the Legion of Honor, France's highest award, to three Americans and a Briton for their role in stopping a gunman on a high-speed train traveling to Paris from Amsterdam last week. The three Americans, Airman First Class Spencer Stone, Alek Skarlatos, a specialist in the Oregon National Guard, and their friend Anthony Sadler were joined by Chris Norman, a British consultant, to receive the honor in the Élysée Palace.

Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie (see options below)? pick from the following. --negative. --positive....I think the answer is","output":"negative. Based on the provided review, it can be inferred that the reviewer has a very negative perception of the movie. There are several aspects that make it quite clear: 1. The opening statement, \\"I have never seen such terrible performances in all my life,\\" is a strong introduction to the negative opinion of the review. It sets the tone for the rest of the comment by emphasizing the reviewer's disappointment with the performances by the cast. 2. The phrase \\"everyone in the entire film was absolute rubbish\\" is a strong indication that the reviewer did not appreciate any of the performances in the movie. Using the word \\"rubbish\\" signifies that they believe the actors and actresses were of poor quality or below standard. 3. The reviewer mentions, \\"not one decent actor/actress in the whole film, it was a joke.\\" This statement highlights the reviewer's disbelief and dissatisfaction with the quality of the acting in the movie. The word \\"joke\\" suggests that the situation was so terrible that it could be considered laughable or absurd. 4. The comparison to \\"drama at school\\" hints at an unfavourable view of the movie's acting quality. Typically, school drama performances are considered amateurish or not as polished as professional productions. By making this comparison, the reviewer implies that the movie's acting was subpar or, at best, amateur. Altogether, these points converge to portray a highly negative impression of the movie in question. The reviewer uses strong language and comparisons to emphasize their disappointment and disapproval of the performances, ultimately giving off a negative perception of the film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At 53°27′46″N 2°25′54″W (53.4629, -2.4316), Chat Moss lies at the southern edge of the Lancashire Plain, an area of Bunter sandstones overlaid with marls laid down during the Late Triassic period. Those rocks are themselves overlaid by a layer of boulder clay deposited during the last ice age, about 10,000 years ago. The combination of the flat topography and the underlying clay resulted in extensive peat bogs developing along the Mersey Valley, and overflowing beyond the valley. The bogs in the area between the River Glaze in the west, and Worsley and Eccles in the east, to the north of what was the River Irwell – now the Manchester Ship Canal – are known collectively as Chat Moss. Chat Moss is a lowland raised bog. In areas where drainage is poor, water-logging can slow down plant decomposition, producing peat, which over the years can raise the level of the bog above that of the surrounding land. The moss occupies an area of about 10.6 square miles (27.5 km2), and is about 5 miles (8 km) long, about 2.5 miles (4.0 km) across at its widest point, lying 75 feet (23 m) above sea level. Chat Moss lies mainly in Salford, but extends into Wigan. By the 1990s, an estimated 72 per cent of the bog had been reclaimed, most of it for agriculture. About 230 acres (93 ha) of degraded bog remain, with 766 acres (310 ha) of undamaged peat deposits in four former peat extraction sites. The peat varies in depth between 24 feet (7 m) and 30 feet (9 m).The main bog mosses found in the peat of Chat Moss are Sphagnum cuspidatum, S. imbricatum, and S. acutifolia. The peat up to about 7 feet (2 m) from the surface is mainly humidified S. acutifolia, with fresher S. imbricatum peat nearer the surface.A 228-acre (92 ha) area of Chat Moss, to the north of the Liverpool–Manchester railway line, notified as Astley & Bedford Mosses, was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1989.

Movie plot title: Where the Heart Is Movie plot: Stewart McBain (Coleman) is a successful self-made demolitions expert who blows up buildings for a living. In the midst of one such project, a group of protesters stops the last building on a lot, the Dutch House, from being demolished. When McBain appears on TV to dismiss the protests, he is made to look foolish. Returning home, his three college-aged children - Daphne (Thurman), Chloe (Amis), and Jimmy (Hewlett) - ridicule him for appearing on camera. Feeling his children are spoiled and soft, McBain kicks them out of the house. Giving them each 750, he drops them off at the Dutch House to live. The house is dilapidated and on the verge of collapse. In order to finance their new lives, the children take on housemates. These include a fashion designer (Glover) named Lionel; a homeless magician, Shitty (Plummer); a stockbroker, Tom (Walsh); and Sheryl, an amateur occultist (Kelley). Chloe is commissioned to finish a calendar for an insurance company. Lionel has to complete his designs for a fashion show. Chloe uses her roommates in the calendar and Lionel ends up using some of them to model for his show. The story is told against the backdrop of a stockmarket crash which brings McBain to ruin. He desperately attempts to stave off a hostile takeover of his demolition company and fails. He loses his home and becomes destitute.

His memoir reads like a stream-of-conscious odyssey of a bright guy struggling to master his relationship to external desires for food, alcohol, drugs, and women. In the end, he discovers that his goal of mastery may have been misguided, and that his compulsivity may be more about his need for emotional calm than external pleasure. Leith's book is funny, intelligent, and, in the end, optimistic.

Des jumeaux « identiques» s’enrôlent dans l’Armée et suivent leur formation ensemble À Nom du récipiendaire Courriel du récipiendaire * Translate this to English?","output":"The sentence in French says, \\"Des jumeaux « identiques» s’enrôlent dans l’Armée et suivent leur formation ensemble À Nom du récipiendaire Courriel du récipiendaire *\\". After translating it into English, the sentence reads as follows: \\"Identical twins enlist in the Army and undergo their training together. Recipient's name, recipient's email.\\" Now, let's break down and explain this translation in detail: 1. \\"Des jumeaux « identiques»\\": The term \\"des jumeaux\\" refers to twins and the word \\"identiques\\" means identical. So, this part of the sentence means \\"identical twins.\\" 2. \\"s’enrôlent dans l’Armée\\": The verb \\"s'enrôler\\" implies enlisting or joining, and \\"l'Armée\\" is the French word for the Army. This part of the sentence means, \\"enlist in the Army.\\" 3. \\"et suivent leur formation ensemble\\": Here, \\"et\\" signifies \\"and,\\" \\"suivent\\" means \\"undergo\\" or \\"follow,\\" \\"leur formation\\" stands for \\"their training,\\" and \\"ensemble\\" translates to \\"together.\\" So, this part means, \\"and undergo their training together.\\" 4. \\"À Nom du récipiendaire\\": \\"À\\" means \\"to\\" or \\"at,\\" \\"Nom\\" is the French word for \\"name,\\" and \\"récipiendaire\\" translates to \\"recipient.\\" Thus, this part signifies \\"recipient's name.\\" 5. \\"Courriel du récipiendaire\\": Finally, \\"courriel\\" means \\"email\\" in French, so \\"courriel du récipiendaire\\" is the \\"recipient's email.\\" In conclusion, the sentence discusses identical twins who join the Army and go through their training together.

They actually describe two different scenarios with distinct outcomes. Let's examine each sentence closely to understand the difference between them. Sentence 1: \\"Herschel is shot and killed by Walsh if he can not produce the diamonds.\\" In this sentence, the subject is Herschel, and the outcome is that he is shot and killed by Walsh. The condition for this outcome is that Herschel cannot produce the diamonds. Sentence 2: \\"When he can not produce the diamonds, Walsh is shot and killed by Herschel.\\" In this sentence, the subject is now Walsh, and the outcome is that he is shot and killed by Herschel. The condition for this outcome remains the same: the inability to produce the diamonds.  Both sentences present opposite consequences and involve different individuals as the subject and object of action. In the first sentence, Walsh kills Herschel if the latter cannot produce the diamonds, whereas, in the second sentence, Herschel kills Walsh under the same condition. Paraphrases are sentences that convey the same meaning or communicate the same idea using different words and structures.

The two worlds of the chemist are the macroscopic world and the microscopic world. Macroscopic refers to substances and objects that can be seen, touched, and measured directly. Microscopic refers to the small particles that make up all matter. Chemists must observe matter and do experiments macroscopically and then make generalizations and propose explanations that are microscopic in nature. For example, anyone can observe the physical change in appearance that occurs as an iron object such as a tractor that is left out in the elements gradually turns to rust. However, a chemist looks at the rusting tractor and thinks about what is going on with the individual atoms that make up the iron and how they are changing as a result of exposure to oxygen in the air and water from rain. Throughout your study of chemistry, you will often switch back and forth between the macroscopic and microscopic worlds.  I am facing a new situation today: Two cousins went to college to get a B.S.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the first names of the three individuals who, in the original line-up, contributed to the band's lyrics? ?  Slayer is an American thrash metal band from Huntington Park, California. The band was formed in 1981 by vocalist and bassist Tom Araya and guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman. Slayer's fast and aggressive musical style made them one of the founding \\"big four\\" bands of thrash metal, alongside Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax. Slayer's current lineup comprises King, Araya, drummer Paul Bostaph and guitarist Gary Holt. Hanneman and drummers Dave Lombardo and Jon Dette are former members of the band. In the original line-up, King, Hanneman and Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and all of the band's music was written by King and  Hanneman. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as murder, serial killers, necrophilia, torture, genocide, human experimentation, Satanism, hate crimes, terrorism, religion, antireligion, Nazism and war, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups and factions of the general public. However, its music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically; the band's third album, Reign in Blood (1986), was described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums. Slayer has released twelve studio albums, two live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. Four of the band's studio albums have received gold certification in the United States. The band has received five Grammy Award nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song \\"Eyes of the Insane\\" and one in 2008 for the song \\"Final Six\\", both of which were from the album Christ Illusion (2006). Between 1991 and 2013, the band sold five million albums in the United States. After 37 years of recording and performing, Slayer announced in January 2018 that they would embark on their final world tour, which began that May and is estimated to wrap up in 2019 or 2020.

Are the following two questions the same? What is an example of a symbol of respect? What does the symbol of a skull with a beret mean? What are examples of its usage?","output":"No, the two questions are not the same. They are related to different concepts and require different explanations. Let me provide both in a detailed manner. Question 1: What is an example of a symbol of respect? A symbol of respect is any object, gesture, or representation that conveys admiration, reverence, or esteem for someone or something. These symbols can vary significantly across different cultures, religions, and communities. One example of a symbol of respect is a 'bow,' which is a traditional gesture practiced in various regions, including Japan, Korea, and China. In these Asian cultures, people bow to greet, express appreciation, or show respect for others, depending on the depth and duration of the bow. Another example would be the military salute. In armed forces worldwide, soldiers offer their salute as a mark of respect to their superiors, the flag, or during important events and ceremonies. The physical gesture of a salute typically involves raising the right hand, with the palm down, to the forehead or temple. There are also symbols of respect in religion. For instance, in Christianity, the Holy Cross represents Christ's sacrifice, and believers may genuflect or cross themselves in its presence to show their devotion and respect. These are just a few examples of respected symbols, but there are numerous others, varying from culture to culture or from one belief system to another. Question 2: What does the symbol of a skull with a beret mean? What are examples of its usage? The symbol of a skull wearing a beret is often associated with military or specialized units, particularly within the context of elite combat units or forces. The skull represents toughness and fearlessness in the face of danger, while the beret signifies the specialized, expert, or unconventional nature of the unit or group represented. Although the skull's usage with a beret may vary, depictions often highlight the group's exceptional skills, dedication, and determination. Here are two examples of its usage in military iconography: 1. The Green Berets: The United States Army Special Forces, also known as the Green Berets, have been often represented by a skull wearing a green beret. The Green Berets are an elite group of soldiers responsible for unconventional warfare and counter-insurgency operations worldwide. The skull in their symbol denotes their determination and courage, while the green beret points to their unique training and expertise. 2. Skull & Beret emblem in Airborne and Parachute units: Some parachute units and airborne forces worldwide employ the emblem of a skull with a beret, such as the Brazilian Army Paratroopers or Portuguese Army Commandos. The airborne units are specialized in air assault and infiltration operations and use the skull and beret symbol to signify their dedication and unique combat abilities. In non-military contexts, the symbol of a skull wearing a beret can also be found in some fraternity groups, biker clubs, or other organizations as a symbolic representation of camaraderie, inner strength, or resilience. In summary, these two questions are distinct and require separate answers. The first question asks for examples of symbols of respect, which include culturally-rooted gestures such as bows and salutes, or religious icons like the Holy Cross. The second question pertains to the meaning and usage of the skull and beret symbol, which is mostly associated with specialized and elite military units."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Justification: 1. Bees go out during the day and gather food - This step is necessary for the survival of the colony as they need food to sustain themselves and the larvae. 2. While gathering food, bees make wax - Bees need a place to store food and raise their young, and wax is the fundamental material for building and expanding their hive. 3. Bees make food called honey - Honey is made by bees as a stored food source for their colony. It serves as nourishment especially during periods when nectar- and pollen-rich flowers are not available. 4. They use a sticky, glue-like substance called propolis as a binding to hold their hives together - Propolis is essential for the structural integrity and maintenance of the hive. It provides stability and protection from external threats such as weather and potential predators.

At their memorial, Grampa Simpson foresees the destruction of the town, but only Marge takes this seriously. Later that day, Homer dares his son Bart to skate naked to the Krusty Burger restaurant and Bart is arrested by Chief Wiggum. Bart considers their neighbor Ned Flanders a better father figure after Homer refuses to take responsibility for the incident. Lisa and a new Irish friend named Colin convince the entire town to clean their lake. Meanwhile, Homer adopts a pig from Krusty Burger and names it \\"Spider Pig\\" (later \\"Harry Plopper\\", and simply \\"Plopper\\"), and stores the pig's feces (and some of his own) in a silo, until Marge tells him to safely dispose of the waste. Homer intends to take his silo to the waste management plant, but after Lenny calls to tell him that Lard Lad Donuts has been shut down and is giving away free donuts, Homer impatiently dumps the silo straight into the lake, polluting it worse than before. Moments later, a squirrel jumps into the lake and becomes severely mutated; Flanders and Bart (who bond after Homer humiliates Bart) discover the creature before the EPA captures it. Russ Cargill, head of the EPA, presents five \\"unthinkable\\" options to U.S. President Arnold Schwarzenegger to keep the town's pollution contained; the slow-witted president, doesn't bother reading number 3 before picking it; enclosing Springfield in a large glass dome. When the police discover Homer's silo in the lake, and his responsibility for sealing Springfield in the dome, an angry mob advances on the Simpsons' home to kill Homer, but the family escapes the town through a sinkhole, which then destroys their house. With the EPA on their trail, the Simpsons flee to Alaska. On the way, Homer tries to make some money at a carnival by riding a motorcycle around the inside of a metal...

Answer the following question: Information:  - Herman Dooyeweerd (7 October 1894, Amsterdam  12 February 1977, Amsterdam) was a Dutch juridical scholar by training, who by vocation was a philosopher and a co-founder of the \\"Philosophy of the Cosmonomic Idea\\" with Dirk Vollenhoven. Dooyeweerd made several contributions to philosophy and other theoretical thought, including concerning: the nature of diversity and coherence in everyday experience, the transcendental conditions for theoretical thought, the relationship between religion and philosophy, and a different view of meaning, being, time and self. Dooyeweerd is most famous for his suite of fifteen aspects (or 'law-spheres'), which are distinct ways in which reality can be meaningful and good, and can exist and occur. This suite of aspects is finding application in practical analysis, research and teaching in such diverse fields as built environment, sustainability, agriculture, business, information systems and development.

House and rave clubs such as Lakota and Cream emerged across Britain, hosting house and dance scene events. The 'chilling out' concept developed in Britain with ambient house albums such as The KLF's Chill Out and Analogue Bubblebath by Aphex Twin. The Godskitchen superclub brand also began in the midst of the early 90's rave scene. After initially hosting small nights in Cambridge and Northampton, the associated events scaled up in Milton Keynes, Birmingham and Leeds. A new indie dance scene also emerged in the 90's. In New York, bands such as Deee-Lite furthered house's international influence. Two distinctive tracks from this era were the Orb's \\"Little Fluffy Clouds\\" (with a distinctive vocal sample from Rickie Lee Jones) and the Happy Mondays' \\"Wrote for Luck\\" (\\"WFL\\") which was transformed into a dance hit by Vince Clarke. The late Robert Miles also produced house tracks such as \\"One and One\\" with Maria Nayler, \\"Fable\\" and his biggest hit, \\"Children\\". In England, one of the few licensed venues was The Eclipse, which attracted people from up and down the country as it was open until the early hours.

U.S. President Donald Trump filed his annual financial disclosure form this week with the Office of Government Ethics, the U.S. government's ethics watchdog. Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. Why did Trump file an annual financial disclosure form with the Office of Government Ethics?

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"Hi there! Those are two different questions, and I'll explain them to you.  1. Why do I still have acne despite being relatively healthy?  Acne can happen for many reasons other than just health. Sometimes, it's because of hormone changes, which can happen even if you're healthy. It can also be because of the way your skin makes oil, or if your skin doesn't get rid of dead cells well. But don't worry, sometimes, it just takes time for acne to go away. 2. Does dandruff cause acne? Dandruff is when you have little flakes in your hair because your scalp is dry or oily. It is not the main cause of acne, but sometimes, if the dandruff touches your face or if you scratch your head and touch your face, it might cause your skin to be a little more oily and increase the chances of getting acne. So, those questions are not the same, but they are both about things that can affect your skin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

People won't know what you're saying if you don't get the pronunciation right.  The correct pronunciation is \\"Nah-koo-PEND-ah.\\" The correct pronunciation of the less colloquial version of \\"I love you\\" is \\"Nee-nah-koo-PEND-ah.\\" There are just five vowels in the Swahili language: a, e, i, o, and u. The vowels are pronounced the same way they are pronounced in Japanese, Italian, and Spanish. This is important to understand if you are using another term of endearment.  For example, \\"Ninakupenda pia\\" is pronounced \\"Nee-nah-koo-PEND-ah pee-ah.\\" A is pronounced \\"ah\\" (like \\"father\\") E is pronounced \\"eh\\" (like \\"egg\\") I is pronounced \\"ee\\" (like \\"tree\\") O is pronounced \\"oh\\" (like \\"oval\\") U is pronounced \\"oo\\" (like \\"room\\") There are no silent vowels in Swahili. You must pronounce each vowel in a sentence. There are many consonants in Swahili that are pronounced the same way as they are pronounced in the English language.  The letters \\"n\\" and \\"m\\" are pronounced the same way they are pronounced in English. The difference is that, in Swahili, sometimes another consonant will follow the \\"n,\\" and it also must be pronounced. For example, \\"Ndugu\\" is a word that means relative. Consonants pronounced the same way they are pronounced in English include the letters p, s, t, v, w, y, and z. Understand how to pronounce consonant pairings. For example, \\"ch\\" is pronounced like the \\"ch\\" in \\"chair.\\" And \\"sh\\" is pronounced like the \\"sh\\" in \\"shut.\\" \\"Gh\\" can be pronounced with a hard \\"g\\" as in the English word \\"garden.\\"","output":"This article discusses the importance of correct pronunciation in the Swahili language, particularly for expressing affectionate phrases.

Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: Going grey<br>Lisa saw herself in the mirror. She couldn't believe it. She was going grey. Lisa thought she was far too young. She immediately shaved it off. Sentence: The reflection has grey hair.","output":"Upon analyzing the provided text, it can be reasonably determined that the sentence, \\"The reflection has grey hair,\\" is true. Here is a more detailed answer explaining this determination: In the text, Lisa is looking at herself in the mirror. A mirror, by definition, forms an image of an object by reflecting light coming from the object. Therefore, when Lisa sees her reflection in the mirror, she is seeing an image of herself, composed of the light reflected off her. This mirrored image is presumably accurate, as there is no mention of any distortion or deceit in the text. As Lisa observes, \\"She was going grey.\\" This suggests that the actual Lisa, whose image is being reflected in the mirror, has grey hair. Consequently, since the mirror is accurately reflecting Lisa's appearance, her reflection should also contain the grey hair. Furthermore, Lisa's strong reaction to her changing hair color reinforces the conclusion that the reflection is accurately representing her current physical appearance. Lisa thinks she is \\"far too young\\" to have grey hair, which implies that seeing grey hair in her reflection is extremely surprising and possibly distressing for her. Consequently, it can be inferred that the presence and the visibility of grey hair in the reflection is what triggers her immediate decision to shave her hair off. In conclusion, since the text describes Lisa viewing her reflection in the mirror and reacting to the sight of her grey hair, it can be ascertained that the sentence, \\"The reflection has grey hair,\\" is indeed true. The reflection accurately portrays Lisa's current physical appearance, which includes her newfound grey hair, and supports her subsequent actions as a response to the realization of her changing appearance."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

After the American Revolutionary War, King's College briefly became a state entity, and was renamed Columbia College in 1784. A 1787 charter placed the institution under a private board of trustees before it was renamed Columbia University in 1896 when the campus was moved from Madison Avenue to its current location in Morningside Heights occupying of land. Columbia is one of the fourteen founding members of the Association of American Universities, and was the first school in the United States to grant the M.D. degree.  - Boston (pronounced ) is the capital and most populous city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States. Boston is also the seat of Suffolk County, although the county government was disbanded on July 1, 1999. The city proper covers with an estimated population of 667,137 in 2015, making it the largest city in New England and the 23rd most populous city in the United States. The city is the economic and cultural anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area known as Greater Boston, a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) home to a census-estimated 4.7 million people in 2014 and ranking as the tenth-largest such area in the country. Alternately, as a Combined Statistical Area (CSA), this wider commuting region is home to some 8.1 million people, making it the sixth-largest as such in the United States.  - Robert Traill Spence Lowell IV (March 1, 1917  September 12, 1977) was an American poet. He was born into a Boston Brahmin family that could trace its origins back to the \\"Mayflower\\". His family, past and present, were important subjects in his poetry. Growing up in Boston also informed his poems, which were frequently set in Boston and the New England region. The literary scholar Paula Hayes believes that Lowell mythologized New England, particularly in his early work.  - Robert Giroux (April 8, 1914  September 5, 2008) was an American book editor and publisher. Starting his editing career with Harcourt, Brace & Co., he was hired away to work for Roger W. Straus, Jr. at Farrar & Straus in 1955, where he became a partner and, eventually, its chairman. The firm was henceforth known as Farrar, Straus and Giroux, where he was known by his nickname, \\"Bob\\".  - The Boston Brahmin or Boston elite are members of Boston's traditional upper class. They form an integral part of the historic core of the East Coast establishment, along with other wealthy families of Philadelphia, New York City, Virginia and Charleston. They are often associated with the distinctive Boston Brahmin accent, Harvard University, and traditional Anglo-American customs and clothing. Descendants of the earliest English colonists, such as those who came to America on the \\"Mayflower\\" or the \\"Arbella\\", are often considered to be the most representative of the Boston Brahmins.  - The Pulitzer Prize is an award for achievements in newspaper, magazine and online journalism, literature, and musical composition in the United States. It was established in 1917 by provisions in the will of American (Hungarian-born) Joseph Pulitzer who had made his fortune as a newspaper publisher, and is administered by Columbia University in New York City. Prizes are awarded yearly in twenty-one categories. In twenty of the categories, each winner receives a certificate and a US15,000 cash award (raised from 10,000 starting in 2017). The winner in the public service category of the journalism competition is awarded a gold medal.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States.

Pulitzer introduced the techniques of yellow journalism to the newspapers he acquired in the 1880s. He became a leading national figure in the Democratic Party and was elected congressman from New York. He crusaded against big business and corruption, and helped keep the Statue of Liberty in New York.  - The Mayflower was the ship that transported the first English Separatists, known today as the Pilgrims, from Plymouth to the New World in 1620. There were 102 passengers, and the crew is estimated to have been about 30, but the exact number is unknown. This voyage has become an iconic story in some of the earliest annals of American history, with its story of death and of survival in the harsh New England winter environment.

In contrast, organisms that live in more moderate environments may be termed mesophiles or neutrophiles.  - Phototaxis is a kind of taxis, or locomotory movement, that occurs when a whole organism moves towards or away from stimulus of light. This is advantageous for phototrophic organisms as they can orient themselves most efficiently to receive light for photosynthesis. Phototaxis is called positive if the movement is in the direction of increasing light intensity and negative if the direction is opposite.  - In cell biology, an organelle is a specialized subunit within a cell that has a specific function. Individual organelles are usually separately enclosed within their own lipid bilayers.  - A taxis (plural taxes , from the Ancient Greek , meaning \\"arrangement\\") is the movement of an organism in response to a stimulus such as light or the presence of food. Taxes are innate behavioral responses. A taxis differs from a tropism (turning response, often growth towards or away from a stimulus) in that the organism has motility and demonstrates guided movement towards or away from the stimulus source. It is sometimes distinguished from a kinesis, a non-directional change in activity in response to a stimulus.  - Light is electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The word usually refers to visible light, which is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the sense of sight. Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400700 nanometres (nm), or 4.00 × 10 to 7.00 × 10 m, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths). This wavelength means a frequency range of roughly 430750 terahertz (THz).  - Saltern is a word with a number of differing (but interrelated) meanings. In English archaeology, a saltern is an area used for salt making, especially in the East Anglian fenlands.  - Peripheral membrane proteins are membrane proteins that adhere only temporarily to the biological membrane with which they are associated. These proteins attach to integral membrane proteins, or penetrate the peripheral regions of the lipid bilayer. The regulatory protein subunits of many ion channels and transmembrane receptors, for example, may be defined as peripheral membrane proteins. In contrast to integral membrane proteins, peripheral membrane proteins tend to collect in the water-soluble component, or fraction, of all the proteins extracted during a protein purification procedure. Proteins with GPI anchors are an exception to this rule and can have purification properties similar to those of integral membrane proteins.  - Globular proteins or spheroproteins are spherical (\\"globe-like\\") proteins and are one of the common protein types (the others being fibrous, disordered and membrane proteins). Globular proteins are somewhat water-soluble (forming colloids in water), unlike the fibrous or membrane proteins. There are multiple fold classes of globular proteins, since there are many different architectures that can fold into a roughly spherical shape.  - Phototrophs (\\"Gr\\": ,  = light,  = nourishment) are the organisms that carry out photon capture to acquire energy. They use the energy from light to carry out various cellular metabolic processes. It is a common misconception that phototrophs are obligatorily photosynthetic. Many, but not all, phototrophs often photosynthesize: they anabolically convert carbon dioxide into organic material to be utilized structurally, functionally, or as a source for later catabolic processes (e.g. in the form of starches, sugars and fats). All phototrophs either use electron transport chains or direct proton pumping to establish an electro-chemical gradient which is utilized by ATP synthase, to provide the molecular energy currency for the cell. Phototrophs can be either autotrophs or heterotrophs.  - Sensory rhodopsin II ( SRII ) , also known as pharaonis phoborhodopsin ( ppR ) , is a membrane protein of archaea , responsible for generation of phototaxis signal . Sensory rhodopsin II is found in Halobacterium salinarum and Natronomonas pharaonis  - Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organisms' activities (energy transformation). This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water  hence the name \\"photosynthesis\\", from the Greek , \\"phs\\", \\"light\\", and , \\"synthesis\\", \\"putting together\\". In most cases, oxygen is also released as a waste product. Most plants, most algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called photoautotrophs. Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies all of the organic compounds and most of the energy necessary for life on Earth.  - The Archaea (or or ) constitute a domain and kingdom of single-celled microorganisms. These microbes (archaea; singular archaeon) are prokaryotes, meaning that they have no cell nucleus or any other membrane-bound organelles in their cells.  - Proteins (or ) are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity.  - An integral membrane protein (IMP) is a type of membrane protein that is permanently attached to the biological membrane. All transmembrane proteins are IMPs, but not all IMPs are transmembrane proteins. IMPs comprise a significant fraction of the proteins encoded in an organism's genome. Proteins that cross the membrane are surrounded by \\"annular\\" lipids (see annular lipid shell), which are defined as lipids that are in direct contact with a membrane protein. Such proteins can be separated from the biological membranes only using detergents, nonpolar solvents, or sometimes denaturing agents.  - In modern molecular biology and genetics, a genome is the genetic material of an organism. It consists of DNA (or RNA in RNA viruses). The genome includes both the genes, (the coding regions), the noncoding DNA and the genomes of the mitochondria and chloroplasts.  - A biological membrane or biomembrane is an enclosing or separating membrane that acts as a selectively permeable barrier within living things. Biological membranes, in the form of cell membranes, often consist of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded, integral and peripheral proteins used in communication and transportation of chemicals and ions. Bulk lipid in membrane provides a fluid matrix for proteins to rotate and laterally diffuse for physiological functioning. Proteins are adapted to high membrane fluidity environment of lipid bilayer with the presence of an annular lipid shell, consisting of lipid molecules bound tightly to surface of integral membrane proteins. The cellular membranes should not be confused with isolating tissues formed by layers of cells, such as mucous membranes and basement membranes.  - Salt pork is salt-cured pork. It is prepared from one of three primal cuts: pork side, pork belly, or fatback. Depending on the cut, respectively, salt pork may be lean, streaky or entirely fatty. Made from the same cuts as bacon, salt pork resembles uncut slab bacon, but is considerably saltier and not bacon-cured or smoked. It is thus virtually identical to the Ukrainian food \\"salo\\", which also displays similar variation in meat-to-fat ratio. Long used as a shipboard ration, salt pork now finds use in traditional American cuisine, particularly Boston baked beans, pork and beans, and to add its flavor to vegetables cooked in water, or with greens as in soul food. It is also central to the flavoring of clam chowder. It generally is cut and cooked (blanched or rendered) before use.  - A gene is a locus (or region) of DNA which is made up of nucleotides and is the molecular unit of heredity. The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as geneenvironment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye colour or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life.  - The lipid bilayer (or phospholipid bilayer) is a thin polar membrane made of two layers of lipid molecules. These membranes are flat sheets that form a continuous barrier around all cells. The cell membranes of almost all living organisms and many viruses are made of a lipid bilayer, as are the membranes surrounding the cell nucleus and other sub-cellular structures. The lipid bilayer is the barrier that keeps ions, proteins and other molecules where they are needed and prevents them from diffusing into areas where they should not be. Lipid bilayers are ideally suited to this role because, even though they are only a few nanometers in width, they are impermeable to most water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules. Bilayers are particularly impermeable to ions, which allows cells to regulate salt concentrations and pH by transporting ions across their membranes using proteins called ion pumps.  - In cell biology, the nucleus (pl. \\"nuclei\\"; from Latin or , meaning \\"kernel\\" or \\"seed\\") is a membrane-enclosed organelle found in eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotes usually have a single nucleus, but a few cell types, such as mammalian red blood cells, have no nuclei, and a few others have many.  - Membrane proteins are proteins that interact with, or are part of, biological membranes. They include integral membrane proteins that are permanently anchored or part of the membrane and peripheral membrane proteins that are only temporarily attached to the lipid bilayer or to other integral proteins. The integral membrane proteins are classified as transmembrane proteins that span across the membrane and integral monotopic proteins that are attached to only one side of the membrane. Membrane proteins are a common type of proteins along with soluble globular proteins, fibrous proteins, and disordered proteins. They are targets of over 50% of all modern medicinal drugs. It is estimated that 2030% of all genes in most genomes encode membrane proteins.  - Halobacterium salinarum is an extremely halophilic marine Gram-negative obligate aerobic archaeon. Despite its name, this microorganism is not a bacterium, but rather a member of the domain Archaea. It is found in salted fish, hides, hypersaline lakes, and salterns. As these salterns reach the minimum salinity limits for extreme halophiles, their waters become purple or reddish color due to the high densities of halophilic Archaea. \\"H. salinarum\\" has also been found in high-salt food such as salt pork, marine fish, and sausages. The ability of \\"H. salinarum\\" to survive at such high salt concentrations has led to its classification as an extremophile.

Caviezel's character wakes up first. He makes sure everyone is alive, then discovers that the windows are barred and the only door has a mechanized lock. He finds a ringing phone and picks it up. The caller asks what is going on and Caviezel tells the caller that everyone is fine. The Caller tells him he will return in a few hours. Somewhere else, a money drop off is occurring. Mr. Coles has been kidnapped. In the warehouse, Pantoliano's character asks to be untied. As Caviezel prepares to untie him, Pepper's character convinces him not to, telling Caviezel that Pantoliano is not on the same side, or he would not have been tied up. As Caviezel and Pepper look for the keys to release Sisto from the handcuffs and treat his wound, Kinnear wakes up and fights with Caviezel and Pepper. At the drop off, the signal in the money bag goes silent; the cops enter to find the money gone. In the warehouse, the men find a newspaper featuring a story about the kidnapping of a wealthy businessman named Coles. The men suspect that they were involved with the kidnapping, but do not know what their involvement was. They begins to experience flashbacks. A gun is recovered, and Caviezel wins possession of it.

Here is a goal: Make a cake in a mug Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"Creating a mug cake is a quick and easy dessert solution that is especially ideal for one or two people, or when you're craving for a sweet treat but don't want to bake a full-sized cake. Here's a detailed step-by-step guide on how to make a cake in a mug.  Requirements: 1. Mug: Ensure you select a mug that is microwave safe. It should be large enough to prevent the batter from overflowing during cooking. 2. Ingredients: Usually a mug cake requires common ingredients like:    - All-purpose flour – 4 tablespoons    - Sugar – 2 to 4 tablespoons    - Baking powder – 1/8 teaspoon    - Salt – a small pinch    - Milk – 3 tablespoons    - Butter – 2 tablespoons    - Vanilla extract – 1/2 teaspoon    - Chocolate chips (optional) – 2 tablespoons Ingredients can vary depending on the flavor of the cake you want. For instance, you would add cocoa if you are making a chocolate mug cake. Gather Your Ingredients 1. Start by gathering all the ingredients you need. This will save time and ensure you have everything ready before you start. Prepare The Batter 1. Melt your butter in the microwave. Do not over-melt it; heat just until it's turned from solid to liquid. Let it cool for a few seconds.  2. In your mug, add the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking powder, and a pinch of salt) and mix well with a spoon. The baking powder will act as a leavening agent to help the cake rise. 3. Add the liquid ingredients (milk, melted butter, and vanilla extract) to your mixture in the mug. 4. Stir everything together until the mixture is smooth. Make sure the batter is free of lumps and the ingredients are well combined. 5. If you want, add your optional ingredients like chocolate chips or a dollop of Nutella, stir again. Cooking 1. Place your mug in the microwave. Set the timer to about 90 seconds on high. Microwaves may vary, so keep a close eye on your cake. 2. Let it cool for a minute or two as it will be very hot after being microwaved. Serving 1. You can eat the cake straight from the mug. If you like, garnish your mug cake with cream, a dusting of powdered sugar, or a spoonful of ice cream. 2. Remember, the mug will still be hot, so handle it carefully.  Enjoy this quick and easy dessert! Please note that it's more cake-like than your standard pre-baked cake, but the benefit is that it can be ready in a matter of minutes with minimal cleanup. Plus, the convenience and novelty of having a personal cake in a mug make the process enjoyable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Where might John be? - ocean - southern europe - japan - rice paddy - italy  The best answer is","output":"Italy.  John is most likely in Italy, given his desire to sneak out and get an authentic pizza. Italy is known as the birthplace of pizza, and it is home to some of the most renowned pizzerias in the world. The country boasts a rich culinary history, with a distinct focus on fresh ingredients, traditional recipes, and an unwavering dedication to quality. When people think of authentic pizza, Italy is usually the first place that comes to mind. In Italy, pizzas are traditionally thin-crusted and baked in wood-fired ovens, giving them a unique, smoky flavor that distinguishes them from other pizza variations found around the world. The country is also famous for its diverse range of regional pizza styles, from the Neapolitan margherita to the Roman pizza al taglio, rendering it a veritable pizza enthusiast's paradise. While John could theoretically find a decent slice of pizza in other countries or regions, nothing quite compares to the genuine article. Southern Europe does have its share of good pizza establishments, particularly in countries like Spain and Greece, but they are not on par with the Italian pizzerias. In Japan, Italian cuisine has become increasingly popular, and there are many pizzerias in major cities like Tokyo and Osaka. However, the Japanese take on pizza often incorporates unique twists, such as unconventional toppings or creative presentations, which may not satisfy someone craving an authentic Italian pizza experience. As for the ocean and rice paddies, neither of these locations offers much by way of pizza or culinary options in general. The ocean, being a vast body of water, provides minimal access to pizza, with the small exception of any potential pizzerias on cruise ships or in coastal areas. Similarly, the rice paddy, typically found in Asian countries like China, Vietnam, and Thailand, is primarily associated with the farming of rice, not the production or consumption of pizza. In summary, Italy is the most likely location for someone like John to seek out an authentic pizza experience. With its rich culinary heritage, diverse range of regional pizza styles, and passionate dedication to quality, Italy stands above the other options as the best place to satisfy one's pizza cravings."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Where to move them (or which paddock) is entirely up to you, and the forage in your pastures.  Different paddocks will have forage plants coming at different stages. Targeting pastures or paddocks where grasses haven't quite headed out but are past the 3- or 4-leaf stage is ideal. Each year you begin grazing it's best to start in a different pasture or paddock than the year before, and graze different paddocks from the year before, never keeping to the same schedule as last year's grazing season. This is so that you allow different pastures opportunity to get ahead or reach a different physiological state than they would if they were grazed at the same time year after year. It's perfectly fine to allow some paddocks to get ahead and reach flowering and/or seed set before either grazing, or mowing. Some of your pastures may have a variety of legumes that need to be allowed to set seed before next grazing, all to maintain a healthy stand. These range from clovers, sainfoin and cicer milkvetch to alfalfa, lespedeza and birds-foot trefoil. Depending on the grazing intensity and targeted utilization rate, you should look for things like how much is forage is left behind (basically height-wise, as well as leaf area) from what was there just before the animals were turned in, and ask yourself if you grazed too heavy or possibly too light. One important thing to remember is that it's very easy to allow animals to consume too much grass and not leave enough grass behind. So if you think you may have grazed too light, check plant height before and after to be sure with your grazing or yard stick. Basically, determining how much to leave behind is an art that requires a lot of observation, trial and error, and practice. There is no perfect one-size-fits-all way to judge how much to take versus how much to leave behind. This will help you determine how long your rest period may need to be. Your initial estimated rest period may be too short, or too long; it all depends on how slowly or quickly the plants recover from grazing.","output":"The article discusses the importance of rotating grazing paddocks yearly, targeting ideal forage stages, and monitoring grazing intensity to maintain healthy pastures and optimize livestock grazing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question. What is divided into 114 suras?","output":"The Quran, the holy book of Islam, is divided into 114 suras, also known as chapters. As the central religious text of Islam, the Quran is believed to be the word of God, which was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad by the angel Gabriel over a period of 23 years. The Quran provides guidance to Muslims on various aspects of their life, including spirituality, ethics, morality, and the legal and social framework for the Islamic community. The Quran's 114 suras are not arranged in chronological order but are ordered based on their lengths, with the exception of the opening chapter, Al-Fatiha. Generally, the suras are organized from the longest to the shortest, although there are some exceptions. The suras encompass a diverse array of themes and topics, providing Muslims with insights and guidance on various aspects of their religion and life. Here is a brief overview of a few significant suras from the Quran: 1. Al-Fatiha (The Opening): As the introductory chapter of the Quran, Al-Fatiha consists of seven verses and serves as an essential prayer recited by Muslims in their daily prayers. The sura emphasizes the importance of seeking guidance and mercy from Allah. 2. Al-Baqarah (The Cow): The longest sura in the Quran, with 286 verses, Al-Baqarah revolves around a wide range of topics, including faith, laws, family matters, and guidance for building a righteous community. It also contains the story of the cow from which the chapter derives its name. 3. Ali 'Imran (The Family of Imran): This chapter has 200 verses and discusses numerous topics, including the importance of patience, faith, and trust in God. Additionally, it speaks of the spiritual connection between Muslims, Christians, and Jews, who share a common source of divine revelation. 4. An-Nisa' (The Women): As the title suggests, this sura, comprising 176 verses, primarily focuses on the rights and responsibilities of women in Islam. It includes guidance about marriage, inheritance, and the importance of treating women fairly and equitably. 5. Al-Kahf (The Cave): Containing 110 verses, Al-Kahf tells the story of a group of young men who sought refuge in a cave to protect their faith. The sura also highlights the importance of patience, the dangers of wealth and materialism, and the virtue of remaining steadfast in faith. 6. Ya-Sin (Yaseen): Often referred to as the \\"heart of the Quran,\\" this chapter contains 83 verses that emphasize the importance of worship, the reality of the afterlife, and the importance of the Quran as divine guidance. 7. Ar-Rahman (The Most Merciful): This sura, consisting of 78 verses, highlights the bountiful blessings that God has bestowed upon His creation. It emphasizes the importance of gratitude and recognizing Allah's mercy in all aspects of life. These are just a few examples of the diverse and profound suras that make up the 114 chapters of the Quran. Each sura provides a wealth of guidance, lessons, and principles that are essential to the lives of Muslims and their practice of Islam. The Quran, as a complete book, serves not only as a guide to the moral and spiritual life of Muslims but also as a foundation for Islamic jurisprudence and theology."},{"instruction":"Q: Is this product review positive?

Answer:","output":"The last step of the process involves the interaction between the magnetic field and the magnetized metal, leading to potential applications or phenomena that can be harnessed for practical use. There are several possibilities for this final step, depending on the specific context and objectives. 1. Electromagnet generation: The magnetized metal, now an electromagnet, can be utilized in multiple applications varying from simple to complex. Electromagnets are commonly used in everyday devices like speakers, headphones, and electromagnetic door locks. They are also crucial in more sophisticated equipment like MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) machines and particle accelerators for scientific research. 2. Induction and energy transformation: The magnetic field created around the wire can interact with a secondary coil or wire bound to another metal. This interaction induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the secondary coil, thereby generating an electrical current through electromagnetic induction. This process is the backbone of transformers and electrical generators used to step up or step down voltage and convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, respectively. 3. Motor operation: The interaction between the magnetic field and the magnetized metal can be utilized to rotate a metal shaft, effectively converting electrical energy into mechanical energy. This principle forms the basis of electric motors used in various applications, from simple toys and household appliances to industrial machinery and electric vehicles. 4. Magnetic levitation (Maglev): The strong magnetic field generated through current-carrying conductors can be used to levitate objects, counteracting the force of gravity. Magnetic levitation technology has been applied in the field of transportation, where Maglev trains can achieve high speeds with minimal friction, leading to more efficient, fast, and smoother rides. 5. Data storage: The magnetization of the metal can be used for storing data in digital devices. In hard disk drives, small regions of the metallic disk are magnetized in specific patterns to represent binary data (1s and 0s). The data can then be read or rewritten by controlling the magnetic field applied to these regions. In conclusion, the last step of this process depends on how the generated magnetic field and magnetized metal interact, leading to various applications and phenomena.

So, the player who had the second longest touchdown run is Matt Cassel. Note that although Trent Edwards' play was longer, it was a pass, not a run.

Movie title: Murder by Death Movie plot: A group of detectives, each accompanied by a relative or associate, is invited to \\"dinner and a murder\\" by the mysterious Lionel Twain (Truman Capote). Having lured his guests to his mansion (the address of which is shown early on as \\"22 Lola Lane\\" and spoken later as \\"Two-Two Twain\\") managed by a blind butler and a deaf-mute cook, named Yvetta (Nancy Walker), Twain announces that it is in fact he who is the greatest detective in the world. In order to prove his claim, he challenges the guests to solve a murder which will take place in the house at midnight that very night; a reward of 1 million will be presented to the winner.Before midnight, the butler is found dead, and at midnight Twain himself appears, also dead; the cook is discovered to have been an animated mannequin, now packed in a storage crate. The party spends the rest of the evening investigating, dining and bickering. They are manipulated by a mysterious behind-the-scenes force, confused by red herrings, baffled by the \\"mechanical marvel\\" that is Twain's house and ultimately find their own lives threatened. The ending piles on twist after twist as each sleuth presents his or her theory on the case.After a brutal night during which one pair is almost killed by a snake, another by a scorpion, another by a falling ceiling, a fourth by poison gas and the fifth by a bomb, they all collect in the office where the butler... believed to have been murdered earlier... is sitting behind the desk very much alive and not at all blind: \\"The butler did it\\". However, each detective then claims that the butler is in fact various incarnations of Twain's associates (such as Irving Goldman or Marvin Metzger) or even his daughter. At first the butler plays the part of each of the persons with whom he's identified, but then pulls off a mask to reveal Lionel Twain himself, very much alive.

Leicester 3/1. Referee: Michael Oliver. Managers: Mark Hughes (Stoke), Nigel Pearson (Leicester) Head-to-head league record: Stoke wins 27, draws 25, Leicester wins 26. Team news. Stoke. Stoke will assess the condition of forward Mame Biram Diouf ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash with Leicester at the Britannia Stadium. Since scoring the Potters' winner in their shock victory at Manchester City on August 30, Diouf has been away on international duty with Senegal and had not been back in training with his club by Friday. Stoke's Mame Biram Diouf scored a shock winner for Stoke in their 1-0 victory at Manchester City. Winger Oussama Assaidi is in contention to make his 'second debut' after rejoining the Staffordshire outfit on another season-long loan deal from Liverpool on transfer deadline day. But midfielder Stephen Ireland (rib) looks set to miss out along with Geoff Cameron (hernia) and Peter Odemwingie (knee), both of whom have undergone surgery. Provisional squad: Begovic, Sorensen, Bardsley, Pieters, Huth, Muniesa, Wilson, Shawcross, Teixeira, Wilkinson, Whelan, Palacios, Nzonzi, Adam, Sidwell, Walters, Arnautovic, Diouf, Bojan, Crouch, Moses. Leicester. A trio of new signings come into the reckoning for Leicester manager Nigel Pearson ahead of his side's Barclays Premier League clash with Stoke on Saturday. Defender Danny Simpson, along with strikers Tom Lawrence and Nick Powell - the latter on loan from Manchester United - are added to the squad for the game at the Britannia Stadium. Promising youngster Tom Lawrence has arrived at Leicester from Manchester United on a permanent basis. Defender Matthew Upson (foot) remains sidelined, and although Matty James is training again after a lay-off with a shin injury, the game comes too soon for the midfielder. Provisional squad: Schmeichel, Hamer, De Laet, Konchesky, Wasilewski, Schlupp, Moore, Morgan, King, Hammond, Albrighton, Knockaert, Mahrez, Vardy, Taylor-Fletcher, Ulloa, Nugent, Wood, Drinkwater, Cambiasso, Simpson, Powell, Lawrence. Key match stats (supplied by Opta) The Potters are unbeaten in five home meetings with Leicester in all competitions (W4 D1). Indeed, none of the last 10 clashes between the Potters and the Foxes have been won by the away side (six home wins, four draws). Leicester City are without a clean sheet in 11 Premier League games; the longest run of any current top-flight side. Since the start of last season, only Chelsea (2) and Liverpool (5) have scored more than once against Stoke at the Britannia Stadium. Stoke are unbeaten in their last five home meetings with Leicester, not losing since James Scowcroft scored the only goal for the Foxes in an August 2002 second tier clash. The Potters, who lost 1-0 to Aston Villa on the opening day, have not lost consecutive home league games since April 2013. Nigel Pearson’s side have scored in 33 of their last 34 league games, failing only to net against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Indeed, that 2-0 defeat at Chelsea was Leicester’s first away defeat this calendar year (W8 D4). The Foxes have blocked 25 opposition shots so far this season; at least 10 more than any other team in the Premier League. Stoke are the only Premier League side yet to net in the first-half in 2014-15. Leicester new boy Nick Powell currently has the best min/goal ratio of any player in Premier League history, having scored once in 29 minutes of top-flight football.","output":"Here are the highlights for Stoke City vs Leicester City Premier League clash: 1.

Question: SEOUL — North Korea’s recent threat to pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S. has added new urgency to South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s visit to Washington next Tuesday. President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors. Why does Trump want North Korea to denuclearize? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - because it will benefit North Korea, the US, and other nations - because President Moon wants him to - because he said he would - not enough information Answer:","output":"because it will benefit North Korea, the US, and other nations"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Kocianski credits this as when she fell in love with professional wrestling. She cites Bret Hart, Owen Hart, and Ted DiBiase as her favorite wrestlers. On the July 9, 2007, episode of Raw, Phoenix returned as a villain, when Melina claimed to be injured. Phoenix replaced Melina in a tag team match as Jillian Hall's partner, and the two lost to Candice Michelle and Mickie James. At the SummerSlam pay-per-view, Phoenix won the Interpromotional Divas battle royal to become the number one contender for Michelle's WWE Women's Championship. Phoenix was then pushed as a dominating Diva, dubbing herself \\"The Glamazon\\" and attacking James, Hall, and Michelle on the September 10 episode of Raw. At Unforgiven, however, she failed to capture the Women's Championship from Michelle. Their storyline rivalry continued when Phoenix pinned Michelle during a non-title mixed tag team match on Raw on September 24.  At No Mercy in October, Phoenix defeated Michelle to win her first WWE Women's Championship. She retained the title on the October 22 episode of Raw in a two out of three falls match, in which Candice Michelle was injured by Phoenix shaking the rope, causing her to fall off the top turnbuckle and legitimately break her clavicle.  During a 10-Diva tag team match at Survivor Series, Phoenix's team lost after Melina was pinned by Mickie James. On the November 26 episode of Raw, James defeated Melina in a number one contenders match for Phoenix's Women's Championship, setting up a title match between the two at Armageddon, a match in which Phoenix successfully defended her Women's title. On New Year's Eve 2007, Phoenix successfully defended her title in a Triple Threat match against Melina and James, after pinning Melina.  Phoenix, along with then-ally Melina, took part in the Playboy BunnyMania Lumberjack match at WrestleMania XXIV, where she defeated the team of Ashley and Maria. On April 14, 2008 Phoenix faced Mickie James with her Women's Championship on the line and lost, ending her reign as champion. Phoenix received a rematch on the May 5 episode of Raw in a lumberjill match, but lost after Melina unintentionally hit her in the face with her boot. On the May 12 episode of Raw, Melina and Phoenix partnered to face Maria and James. During the match, Melina unintentionally knocked Phoenix off of the ring apron, resulting in Phoenix abandoning Melina, which allowed James and Maria to pick up the win. Later that night, Melina and Phoenix brawled in a backstage segment, ending their alliance. At Judgment Day, Phoenix failed to regain the Women's Championship in a Triple Threat match after James pinned Melina to retain the title. At One Night Stand, Phoenix defeated Melina in the first women's \\"I Quit\\" match in WWE history.

Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \\"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\\": Dylan's audience of \\"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\\" contrasted with their fans, \\"veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion. To many of Dylan's followers in the folk music scene, the Beatles were seen as idolaters, not idealists.\\" Within six months of the meeting, according to Gould, \\"Lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated Dylan's nasal drone, brittle strum, and introspective vocal persona\\"; and six months after that, Dylan began performing with a backing band and electric instrumentation, and \\"dressed in the height of Mod fashion\\". As a result, Gould continues, the traditional division between folk and rock enthusiasts \\"nearly evaporated\\", as the Beatles' fans began to mature in their outlook and Dylan's audience embraced the new, youth-driven pop culture.During the 1964 US tour, the group were confronted with the reality of racial segregation in the country at the time, particularly in the South.

The answer provided does not correctly answer the question about the company that sponsors the Thanksgiving Day parade.  The company that sponsors the Thanksgiving Day Parade is the well-known and highly regarded American department store chain Macy's. The parade is officially called the \\"Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade\\" and takes place annually in New York City. Since its inception in 1924, the parade has grown to become one of the most enduring and iconic Thanksgiving traditions in the United States. The origins of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade can be traced back to the early 1920s when a group of Macy's store employees, many of whom were immigrants, wanted to celebrate Thanksgiving in the spirit of the festivals they had back in their home countries. The first parade featured live animals from the Central Park Zoo, but the balloon characters that the parade is famous for today were introduced a few years later, in 1927. Held on Thanksgiving Day, the parade commences at 9:00 AM and makes its way through Manhattan, attracting approximately 3.5 million spectators along the 2.5-mile parade route and an estimated 50 million viewers nationwide on television. The parade is renowned for its large helium balloons featuring popular character and balloonicles, which are a fusion of a cold-air balloon and a self-powered vehicle that rolls down the route. Additionally, there are floats with various themes, celebrities, marching bands, clowns, and dance performances. In summary, the company that sponsors the Thanksgiving Day Parade is Macy's, a prominent American department store chain, and the parade has become an integral part of the Thanksgiving celebration in the United States."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Alexander is conducting reactions in his college chemistry class.

Movie title: Justice League: Doom Movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (August 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The Justice League, with Cyborg's assistance, stop the Royal Flush Gang's attempted robery of a diamond vault using complex technology that allows them to pass through solid objects. Meanwhile, Vandal Savage plots to exterminate the greater part of the human population and start a new civilization; he discreetly gave the technology to the Gang for testing purposes. To ensure the Justice League cannot stop him, Savage hires Mirror Master to hack into the Batcomputer and steal contingency plans devised by Batman to incapacitate his League teammates, in case they go rogue. Savage assembles Mirror Master, Bane, Cheetah, Ma'alefa'ak, Star Sapphire, and Metallo, who all have personal vendettas against the heroes and pays them to simultaneously attack using the stolen plans, albeit altered to be lethal. When the supervillains agree, he welcomes them to the Legion of Doom. The villains each do their part to take out each member of the Justice League:  Batman, as Bruce Wayne, is informed by Alfred Pennyworth that the bodies of Thomas and Martha Wayne have been exhumed and are missing. At his parents' graves, Bruce is ambushed by Bane, who gains the upper hand and renders Bruce unconscious. Bruce is buried alive in his father's coffin; he is left a tape recorder with a message from Bane taunting him, which motivates him to break out of the coffin. He realizes that the League has been attacked using his contingency plans, which were constructed from studying physical and psychological weaknesses in the event the League went to the other side or succumbed to mind control. With Cyborg's help, he saves his teammates one by one. Wonder Woman is attacked by Cheetah with a scratch that sends nanomachines into her bloodstream. The nanomachines attach to the brain stem and cause her to believe everyone she sees... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Justice League: Doom,\\" it is the Royal Flush Gang that is stopped by Batman and the rest of the Justice League from a robbery at a diamond vault. The Royal Flush Gang was using complex technology that allowed them to pass through solid objects, which was discreetly provided to them by Vandal Savage for testing purposes. Vandal Savage is the main antagonist of the movie, plotting to exterminate a significant part of the human population and start a new civilization. To prevent the Justice League from stopping him, he hires Mirror Master to hack into the Batcomputer and steal contingency plans devised by Batman in case any of his teammates go rogue. Vandal Savage then assembles a team of supervillains, all of whom have personal vendettas against the heroes, and pays them to attack the Justice League members using the stolen plans, but alters them to become lethal. The villains in this team are Mirror Master, Bane, Cheetah, Ma'alefa'ak, Star Sapphire, and Metallo, and they form the Legion of Doom. The villains each attack and incapacitate the members of the Justice League, using the weaknesses and contingency plans designed by Batman. However, Batman, with the help of Cyborg, manages to save his teammates one by one. Together, they work to stop Vandal Savage's sinister plot and save humanity. In conclusion, the movie \\"Justice League: Doom\\" revolves around the efforts of the Legion of Doom, led by Vandal Savage, to take down the Justice League using their weaknesses. The Royal Flush Gang, stopped by Batman and the Justice League, was only a small part of Vandal Savage's grand plan.

From the Abominable Snowman to the Loch Ness Monster, there's no shortage of mythical creatures rumoured to walk the Earth - and no shortage of people convinced they truly do exist. But few legendary beast aficionados are as committed as those dedicated to Bigfoot, with legions of hunters from Texas to Oregon dedicated to tracking down Sasquatch. Among them are Rick Dyer, a hunter from Georgia, and Las Vegas entrepreneur Tom Biscadi - both of whom say they are the man to uncover the truth about the mythical monster. The A-team: Las Vegas Bigfoot expert Tom Biscardi with his crack team of Sasquatch hunters. Found it? Rick Dyer has claimed to have tracked Bigfoot down not once but twice. Now a new BBC documentary, Shooting Bigfoot, has delved into their often bizarre world where conspiracy theorists and unscheduled falls in the river are all part of the job. But while the men are convinced, not everyone agrees, among them the mother of Rick's daughter Audrey. And the fact she's not convinced is partly down to Rick himself, who in 2008 claimed to have found Bigfoot but was soon revealed to have found nothing more than a Sasquatch costume that he had filled with possum roadkill. 'I hurt a lot of people in 2008 with the. hoax,' he admits, 'a lot of true believers, and I'd like to redeem myself and show. that I'm the real deal.' In a bid to prove it, he's travelled to Texas where reports from San Antonio say that a homeless person encountered the beast while sleeping rough in the woods. 'Some homeless people called it in and. three motorists called it in, and then I came up here and across this. path, I saw it,' says Rick. 'I'm not going to tell you how tall it is because I don't. know but it was a hairy upright creature and when I saw it, my heart. dropped. 'I am 100 per cent in no doubt that there is a Bigfoot and. that there is a Bigfoot right here.' But while Rick is dedicated to the pursuit of Sasquatch, his six years in the game make him a novice compared to Biscardi, who has spent 37 years hunting Bigfoot. 'I've seen the creature with my own eyes,' he reveals. 'I was 12ft away from one once and I freaked out. 'I made a dedication to. myself that day that I'm going to bring one of these things back because. I know they exist. 37 years later, I'm still doing it.' Hoax: Dyer's 2008 'discovery' turned out to be a Sasquatch costume filled with dead possums. The real deal? A computer generated image showing what the primate-like Bigfoot might actually look like. Famous: A still from the 1972 Patterson-Gimlin film purporting to show Bigfoot. Quite what Mrs Biscardi makes of it all is anyone's guess, although his son TJ has been known to team up with his father and his crack 'A-team' of Bigfoot hunters. Travelling with TJ and Tom is Young Blood, described by Biscardi as his 'chief tracker and sharpshooter' and Chico, an elderly survival specialist. When Biscardi isn't out hunting for Bigfoot, he's busy making documentaries; among them Bigfoot Lives, Bigfoot Lives 2 and Bigfoot Lives 3. It might sound bizarre but Biscardi is convinced he knows what he's doing. 'You hear about people saying they're a. Bigfoot hunter, Bigfoot researcher, Bigfoot this and that, crypto. zoologist,' he complains. 'Crypto my ass - the name of the game is this: you either heel. and toe it down that street and go out into the brush and look or. you'll never find anything.' While Rick might call himself a Bigfoot hunter, he says that he too is the real deal. 'God has sent me something to say \\"Look,. there is a Bigfoot, be committed now.\\" Rather menacingly, he continues: 'Unfortunately for the Bigfoot,. I'm going to have to kill it. If there is someone out here in a costume,. they will be dead soon because I'm going to kill them.' So does Bigfoot really exist? Biscardi is convinced that the primate prints he finds come from a juvenile Sasquatch while Rick goes public with claims that yet again, he has managed to shoot and kill Bigfoot - and has the corpse to prove it. 'Growing up I thought I'd be a cowboy,' adds Rick, 'but I gave it up for the same reason that you don't. pursue a lot of your little pipe dreams. 'This is not a pipe dream - a. pipe dream is something you can't achieve.' Storyville: Shooting Bigfoot, tonight at 10pm on BBC4.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but  Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible.  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM,  Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets.  Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings,  Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from  Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew  Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").

In Michaelmas 1836, Ruskin matriculated at the University of Oxford, taking up residence at Christ Church in January of the following year. Enrolled as a gentleman-commoner, he enjoyed equal status with his aristocratic peers. His study of classical \\"Greats\\" might, his parents hoped, lead him to take Holy Orders and become a bishop, perhaps even the Archbishop of Canterbury. Ruskin was generally uninspired by Oxford and suffered bouts of illness. Perhaps the keenest advantage of his time in residence was found in the few, close friendships he made. His tutor, the Rev Walter Lucas Brown, was always encouraging, as was a young senior tutor, Henry Liddell (later the father of Alice Liddell) and a private tutor, the Rev Osborne Gordon. He became close to the geologist and natural theologian, William Buckland. Among Ruskin's fellow undergraduates, the most important friends were Charles Thomas Newton and Henry Acland.  His biggest success came in 1839 when at the third attempt he won the prestigious Newdigate Prize for poetry (Arthur Hugh Clough came second). He met William Wordsworth, who was receiving an honorary degree, at the ceremony. But Ruskin never achieved independence at Oxford. His mother lodged on High Street and his father joined them at weekends. His health was poor and he was devastated to hear his first love, Adele Domecq, second daughter of his father's business partner, was engaged to a French nobleman. In the midst of exam revision, in April 1840, he coughed blood, raising fears of consumption, and leading to a long break from Oxford.  Before he returned, he answered a challenge set down by Effie Gray, whom he later married. The twelve-year-old Effie had asked him to write a fairy story. During a six-week break at Leamington Spa to undergo Dr. Jephson's (1798-1878) celebrated salt-water cure, Ruskin wrote his only work of fiction, the fairy tale, The King of the Golden River (published in December 1850 (but imprinted 1851) with illustrations by Richard Doyle). A work of Christian sacrificial morality and charity, it is set in the Alpine landscape Ruskin loved and knew so well. It remains the most translated of all his works. At Oxford, he sat for a pass degree in 1842, and was awarded with an uncommon honorary double fourth-class degree in recognition of his achievements.

Question:   John has a diamond that is the same size as a beach ball. Which is likely less dense diamond or ball?    Text:  A given volume of a denser substance is heavier than the same volume of a less dense substance. Answer:","output":"Based on the provided text, we can determine which of the two, the diamond or the beach ball, is likely less dense by understanding the relationship between density, mass, and volume. The text states that \\"a given volume of a denser substance is heavier than the same volume of a less dense substance.\\" This indicates that density is a measure of how much mass is found within a certain volume of a substance. Now, let's compare the diamond's mass and volume to that of the beach ball. A diamond is a crystalline form of carbon and has a high density due to its tightly packed carbon atoms. Meanwhile, a beach ball is generally made of lightweight, flexible, and inflatable materials, such as plastic or vinyl. This makes the beach ball significantly lighter and less dense than a solid object of the same size, such as a diamond. However, the question states that John's diamond is the same size as the beach ball, which means their volumes are essentially equal. Since the diamond is a much denser material than the beach ball, its mass for the given volume would be much greater than the mass of the beach ball. Considering the relationship between density, mass, and volume, as well as the properties of both a diamond and a beach ball, it is safe to conclude that the beach ball is likely less dense than the diamond. The diamond, owing to its tightly packed carbon atoms, would have a greater mass within the same volume, thereby making it a denser substance in comparison to the beach ball's lightweight, inflatable material composition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Scottish channel, which will receive £19m new cash and have a nightly 21:00 news show, has prompted criticism from Welsh politicians. The announcement came after the BBC said it was investing an extra £8.5m a year in Welsh TV programmes - short of the £30m demanded by politicians. BBC Wales said the needs of viewers in Scotland were \\"different\\". Tory AM Darren Millar tweeted that it made the funding for Wales look like an \\"insult\\", while Labour shadow culture minister Kevin Brennan said it seemed that BBC Wales was \\"being short-changed compared to Scotland\\". Under the Welsh package announced on Tuesday, the BBC said it would invest an extra £8.5m a year in English-language television programmes for Wales. The BBC said the investment was a 50% increase and would fund new drama, comedy and entertainment programmes. Bethan Jenkins, assembly culture committee chair and a Plaid Cymru AM, said she did not want to begrudge the Welsh deal but said different nations would \\"feel rightly aggrieved\\" at the different levels of investment. Ms Jenkins' culture committee called for £30m extra to be spent on BBC English-language drama and broadcasting earlier this month. Suzy Davies, Conservative AM for South Wales West and also a committee member, described the \\"sheer imbalance\\" as an \\"affront to Wales' journalists and to licence-fee payers\\". But Alun Davies, Minister for Lifelong Learning and Welsh Language who has policy responsibility for broadcasting, said the creation of a separate channel would not answer the needs of Wales. \\"A separate channel with tiny audiences will not bridge the current information deficit,\\" he said. \\"We need a comprehensive service on all of the BBC's existing channels and outlets which meet Wales' needs in news, sport and culture.\\" Speaking on BBC Radio Cymru, BBC Wales director Mr Davies said the Welsh funding deal was a substantial settlement and said political pressure played its part in both nations. \\"There will be an announcement in due course about how the £8.5m will be spent. I do not spend my time comparing directly with what is happening in Scotland,\\" he said. \\"In Wales, we have intentionally chosen to spend the money on BBC One and BBC Two. \\"We know through engaging with the audience that those are the channels where they want to see Wales being reflected.\\" A spokesman for the National Union of Journalists said: \\"Wales is being treated disgracefully, as there are no apparent plans for a similar channel or investment here. \\"We call on BBC Cymru Wales to revisit the package announced yesterday and return with more imaginative and far-reaching proposals, similar to the ones being planned for Scotland.\\" A BBC spokeswoman said \\"the needs of audience in Scotland are different\\" and \\"as a result, different choices have been made that then require different levels of funding\\".

Juan Carlos was born to Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona and Princess Maria Mercedes of Bourbon-Two Sicilies in Rome, Italy, where his grandfather, King Alfonso XIII of Spain, and other members of the Spanish Royal Family lived in exile following the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931. He was baptized as Juan Carlos Alfonso Victor Maria de Borbon y Borbon-Dos Sicilias. He was given the name Juan Carlos after his father and maternal grandfather, Prince Carlos of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. His early life was dictated largely by the political concerns of his father and General Franco. On the evening of Holy Thursday, 29 March 1956, Juan Carlos's younger brother Alfonso died in a gun accident at the family's home Villa Giralda in Estoril, Portugal. The Spanish Embassy in Portugal then issued the following official communique:  Whilst His Highness Prince Alfonso was cleaning a revolver last evening with his brother, a shot was fired hitting his forehead and killing him in a few minutes. The accident took place at 20.30 hours, after the Infante's return from the Maundy Thursday religious service, during which he had received holy communion.  Alfonso had won a local junior golf tournament earlier in the day, then went to evening Mass and rushed up to the room to see Juan Carlos who had come home for the Easter holidays from military school. It is alleged that Juan Carlos began playing with a gun that had apparently been given to Alfonso by General Franco. Rumors appeared in newspapers that the gun had actually been held by Juan Carlos at the moment the shot was fired.  As they were alone in the room, it is unclear how Alfonso was shot, but according to Josefina Carolo, dressmaker to Juan Carlos's mother, Juan Carlos pointed the pistol at Alfonso and pulled the trigger, unaware that it was loaded. Bernardo Arnoso, a Portuguese friend of Juan Carlos, also said that Juan Carlos fired the pistol not knowing that it was loaded, and adding that the bullet ricocheted off a wall, hitting Alfonso in the face. Helena Matheopoulos, a Greek author who spoke with Juan Carlos's sister Pilar, said that Alfonso had been out of the room and when he returned and pushed the door open, the door knocked Juan Carlos in the arm, causing him to fire the pistol.

Brown village extracted fossil fuels such as coal from their mountains, while Yellow village was mostly focused on extracting gold the old fashioned way.  Which village has more of an impact on Earth's temperature?  Hint: When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change. A:","output":"Brown Village has more of an impact on Earth's temperature. This is because they extract and presumably burn fossil fuels such as coal, which releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

Write an article based on this summary: – A news conference in Stillwater, Okla., on Wednesday was meant to announce new 3D mammography equipment at a local medical facility. Mayor Gina Noble had another surprise announcement to offer, the Tulsa World reports. As part of a PSA spot for the new machinery, Noble agreed to go on camera getting a mammogram herself, and within 24 hours of doing so she received what she said was a \\"daunting diagnosis,\\" per the Stillwater News Press: She had breast cancer. \\"I was meant to do that mammography, and thank goodness we did, because we did catch it early,\\" Noble says, explaining that she's in stage zero of the disease, meaning it's localized and hasn't spread. KOCO notes she has no family history of the illness and has undergone previous mammograms. The 3D procedure, which the CEO of Stillwater Medical Center says took about seven minutes, allows doctors to view breast tissue in 1mm increments—so where they may get just one image from a 2D scan, a 3D scan can produce as many as 50 images from all different angles with just a five-second breast compression.

However, Mayor Gina Noble had a surprise announcement to share that emphasized the importance of this technology in early detection of breast cancer. According to Tulsa World, Mayor Noble was initially supposed to participate in a public service announcement (PSA) spot for the new machinery. She agreed to go on camera getting a mammogram herself. Within 24 hours of the procedure, she received a \\"daunting diagnosis\\": she had breast cancer. She told the Stillwater News Press, \\"I was meant to do that mammography, and thank goodness we did because we did catch it early.\\" Noble explained that she's in stage zero of the disease, meaning it's localized and hasn't spread. KOCO notes that she has no family history of the illness and has undergone previous mammograms. The 3D mammography procedure, which the CEO of Stillwater Medical Center says took about seven minutes, allows doctors to view breast tissue in 1mm increments. In contrast to a single image from a 2D scan, a 3D scan can produce as many as 50 images from various angles with just a five-second breast compression. Currently, only two other cities in Oklahoma (Tulsa and Oklahoma City) have access to this technology. Mayor Noble, one of the first patients to benefit from it, says she'll begin treatment by mid-August. The National Breast Cancer Foundation notes that treatment options for stage zero breast cancer could include surgery or radiation, as reported by the New York Daily News. At the news conference, Noble urged others to take advantage of this life-saving technology. \\"Please make the call and schedule a 3-D mammography,\\" Noble said, adding, \\"It saved my life.\\" As Mayor Noble's experience demonstrates, embracing 3D mammography screening can play a crucial role in the early detection and treatment of breast cancer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The statement \\"People are watching an event or ceremony outdoors\\" is very broad and could refer to a multitude of events, ranging from a simple family picnic to a music festival, a political rally, a wedding ceremony, or even a sports competition.  While it is possible that they are watching the Summer Olympics (an outdoor event), it is not explicitly stated or necessarily implied. The Olympics are held every four years in different locations and are a globally recognized event. If such a high profile event was taking place, it is likely that the premise would include more specific details to identify it. Furthermore, there's a significant difference in scale and context between a general \\"outdoor event or ceremony\\" and \\"the Summer Olympics\\". The Olympics are a globally attended competition featuring athletes from all over the world, which requires a high level of organization, participation, and specific infrastructural settings. On the other hand, the term \\"event or ceremony\\" could be applied to small local gatherings or to large, organized celebrations, either public or private.  In other words, the premise is too vague and does not furnish us with enough details to be able to accept the hypothesis as true. Additional information, such as the content and scale of the event, the number of people and athletes participating, or references to specific sports and competitions usually present in the Summer Olympics, could help in determining the truth of the hypothesis.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"To answer these two questions, I will research each topic separately and provide information to address the questions. Then, I will evaluate if the answers are the same or different. Step 1: Research types of suspensions used in automobiles: Suspension systems in automobiles are essential for maintaining stability, comfort, and control while driving. There are several types of suspensions used in automobiles. Some common types include: 1. Independent suspension: This type of suspension allows each wheel to move independently, providing better handling and ride quality. Examples of independent suspension systems are:     a. MacPherson Strut     b. Double Wishbone     c. Multi-link 2. Dependent suspension: In this system, the movement of one wheel affects the movement of the other wheel on the same axle. Examples of dependent suspension systems are:     a. Solid axle     b. Beam axle     c. Leaf spring Step 2: Research why pressed steel is used in automobile frames: Pressed steel is used in automobile frames due to its various advantages. Some reasons why pressed steel is preferred: 1. Cost-effectiveness: Pressed steel is relatively inexpensive compared to other materials, making it an economical choice for mass-produced automobiles. 2. Lightweight: Pressed steel is lighter than some other alternatives, contributing to better fuel efficiency and improved performance. 3. Strength and durability: Due to its manufacturing process, pressed steel is strong and provides the necessary support for the vehicle's body. 4. Flexibility in design: Pressed steel allows for flexibility in design, as it can be shaped into various forms required for automobile frames. Step 3: Evaluate if the answers are the same or different: The answers to the two questions are different. - Question 1 focuses on the types of suspension systems used in automobiles, which are essential for vehicle stability, comfort, and control. - Question 2 focuses on why pressed steel is used in automobile frames, discussing the advantages of using pressed steel in terms of cost, weight, strength, and flexibility in design. Thus, the answers to the two questions are not the same, as they address different aspects of automobile construction and functionality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Additionally, Amy had an incredible ability to engage with people and make them feel at ease, a trait that would certainly come in handy as the barbecue was expected to be a melting pot of diverse personalities and backgrounds. As a well-known and well-liked figure within the community, Amy had built a strong network of connections and friendships over the years, making her the perfect unofficial ambassador for the event. She had lived in the small town for her entire life and had come to know the ins and outs of town politics, local gossip, and important or exciting town events. Her familiarity with the townspeople would ensure that the barbecue was a fun and memorable occasion for everyone involved. Megan on the other hand, although having lived in the town for some time now, hadn't managed to establish as deep connections as Amy, especially after being frequently occupied with work and family commitments. This only fueled her eagerness in inviting Amy, with the hope that she could learn a thing or two from her innate social skills. Another rationale behind Megan inviting Amy was her capacity to get people together and create a sense of unity. Given that the holiday weekend was a time for families and friends to rejoice and share memorable experiences, Amy was undoubtedly the perfect person to have around, helping foster a sense of togetherness and camaraderie among the attendees. Megan was confident that if Amy could make it to her barbecue, she would be able to create the ideal environment in which people could converse openly, laugh wholeheartedly, and enjoy each other's company.

The group rose to fame after releasing their multi-platinum second album The Writing's on the Wall in 1999. The album featured some of the group's most widely known songs such as \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\", \\"Jumpin' Jumpin'\\" and \\"Say My Name\\", which became their most-successful song at the time, and would remain as one of their signature songs. \\"Say My Name\\" won Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and Best R&B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards. The Writing's on the Wall sold more than 15 million copies worldwide, essentially becoming their breakthrough album.  Along with their commercial successes, the group became entangled in much-publicized turmoil involving the filing of a lawsuit by Luckett and Roberson for breach of contract. The issue was heightened after Michelle Williams and Farrah Franklin appeared in the video of \\"Say My Name\\", implying that Luckett and Roberson had already been replaced. Eventually, Luckett and Roberson left the group. Franklin would eventually fade from the group after five months, as evidenced by her absences during promotional appearances and concerts. She attributed her departure to negative vibes in the group resulting from the departure. After settling on their final lineup, the trio recorded \\"Independent Women Part I\\", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film, Charlie's Angels. It became their best-charting single, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for eleven consecutive weeks. The success cemented the new lineup and skyrocketed them to fame. Later that year, Luckett and Roberson withdrew their case against their now-former bandmates, while maintaining the suit against Mathew, which ended in both sides agreeing to stop public disparaging.  Later that year, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album Survivor, Rowland appeared on the remix of Avant's single \\"Separated\\". Survivor, which channeled the turmoil the band underwent, spawned its lead single of the same name, which was a response to the experience. The song went on to win a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. The themes of \\"Survivor\\", however, caused Luckett and Roberson to refile their lawsuit; the proceedings were eventually settled in June 2002. Meanwhile, the album was released in May 2001, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold. To date, Survivor has sold over twelve million copies worldwide, over forty percent of which were sold in the US alone. The album also spawned the number-one hit \\"Bootylicious\\". After releasing their remix album This Is the Remix in 2002, the group announced their temporary break-up to pursue solo projects.  In January 2013, Destiny's Child released a compilation album entitled Love Songs, a collection of romance-themed songs from their previous albums and newly recorded song \\"Nuclear\\". On February 3, 2013, during Beyonce's performance at the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show, held at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Rowland and Michelle Williams joined her on stage to perform \\"Bootylicious\\", \\"Independent Women\\" and \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\". On February 24, 2013, Rowland co-hosted the Academy Awards pre-show for the 85th Academy Awards alongside Kristin Chenoweth, Lara Spencer, Robin Roberts and Jess Cagle. In May 2013, it was announced that Rowland would replace Britney Spears as a judge on The X Factor USA for its third and final season, joining Simon Cowell, Demi Lovato and fellow new judge Paulina Rubio. Later that month, Rowland performed as a supporting headlining act at the RiverFest 2013 in Little Rock, Arkansas.  Rowland embarked on the Lights Out Tour, a co-headlining tour with The-Dream, to promote her fourth studio album Talk a Good Game. Formerly titled Year of the Woman, the album was released on June 18, 2013 in the US. It is Rowland's first release with Republic Records following Universal Music Group's decision to close Universal Motown and Universal Republic, and reviving Motown Records and Republic Records. Talk a Good Game sold 68,000 copies in its first week and debuted at number four on the Billboard 200, becoming Rowland's third top-ten album in the US. The album's lead single \\"Kisses Down Low\\" was a moderate success on the US R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and was certified gold by RIAA for exceeded 500,000 copies sold. The second and final single \\"Dirty Laundry\\" was acclaimed by critics for its lyrical and the emotional honesty. In December 2013, Rowland appeared in Beyonce's \\"Grown Woman\\" music video and alongside Williams in Beyonce's \\"Superpower\\" music video and provided backing vocals on the same track, taken from her self-titled fifth studio album.  In February 2014, Rowland was featured on Joe's single \\"Love & Sex Part 2\\". In March 2014, she was named a spokesperson for cosmetic company, Caress. During an interview with HuffPost Live on March 26, 2014, Rowland revealed that she has begun recording her fifth studio album and said the new music, which encompasses horns, drums, and flutes, was influenced by iconic female singers including Diana Ross. Rowland also announced in the interview that she left Republic Records, adding that she \\"just needed a fresh, new start.\\" In June 2014, Rowland and Beyonce were featured on Williams' single \\"Say Yes\\". The same month, her song \\"The Game\\" and its music video appeared on Pepsi's visual album for the 2014 FIFA World Cup titled, Beats of the Beautiful Game. On July 19, 2014, Rowland was featured on Adrian Marcel's song \\"Honey\\" from his mixtape Weak After Next and on Beau Vallis's song \\"Love Stand Still\\". Rowland also contributed background vocals to the song \\"You're My Star\\", the first single released from Tank's 2014 album Stronger.  In August 2015, she was featured on Jacob Whitesides's single \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\". Rowland was part of the recurring cast of the second season of the American drama television series Empire. She played Leah Walker, Lucious Lyon's mother, in flashbacks and starred in five episodes. She recorded a song for the show called \\"Mona Lisa\\" which was included on the EP Empire: Music from \\"Be True\\", released on October 21, 2015. On October 26, 2015, Rowland released a new song titled \\"Dumb\\" which is rumoured to appear on her upcoming fifth album. Rowland's new record does not have a release date yet.  Rowland along with Missy Elliott, Kelly Clarkson, Zendaya, Janelle Monae, Lea Michele and Chloe & Halle, were all featured on a charity single put together by US First Lady Michelle Obama. \\"This Is For My Girls\\" was written by Diane Warren and was released on March 15, 2016. The song was created to raise funds and awareness towards Obama's \\"Let Girls Learn\\" initiative - aimed at boosting education rates amongst adolescent girls around the world who are denied the right to an education  The iTunes-exclusive record was used to both coincide with Obama's Texan SXSW speech and to promote the \\"Let Girls Learn\\" initiative. The following month, Rowland hosted BET's docu-series Chasing Destiny, where she and choreographer/director Frank Gatson Jr. searched to find the next superstars for an all female group. They eventually formed the girl group June's Diary.  On 24 December 2016, it was announced that Rowland would replace Jessie J as a coach on the sixth season of The Voice Australia, that aired in early 2017. Rowland played the role of Margot Scotts in the television film Love By the 10th Date, which premiered on Lifetime on January 28, 2017. On 11 April 2017, Kelly is also set to release her first book named Whoa, Baby!: A Guide for New Moms Who Feel Overwhelmed and Freaked Out (and Wonder What the #*& Just Happened). On 8 August 2017, it was announced that Rowland was joining new judge Jennifer Hudson on the thirteenth season of The Voice US who served as the winning coach on last season's The Voice UK.

After that, we will convert the longer string to lowercase letters, and finally, return all the unique alphabets used in that string. Here's a step-by-step process of how to achieve this: 1. Determine which string, A or B, is longer:    A = \\"ErcFFjUfqSsmrGqfLxaCIQplseygBsRE\\"    B = \\"gPbCSsmrGqfLxaCIeNbAxiy\\"    Length of A = 33    Length of B = 22    Since the length of A is greater than the length of B, we will proceed with string A. 2.

Context: I was fencing wire at Flat Broke Acres and trying to tighten up the wire a bit. I lost the grip of the fencing wire and the pliers smacked me in the mouth. This is what I hit myself in the mouth with. The curved end glance off my left front central incisor. It hurt some, my lips were lacerated, I scared my wife when I came in to take a look at it in the mirror but the pain to come was far worse. Tooth was intact thank goodness and was a bit wobbly and I said to myself yup, this could be a problem. A month or two later I hit it again when I was putting a portable step fence panel in the bed of the truck and it bounced and split the bridge of my nose and hit the tooth again. did not break or get displaced. Thank goodness I have a particularly thick head. Tooth trauma is a strange thing. It can blow up anywhere up to a year later. So almost 6 months later I was flying to a meeting in Orlando and of course the tooth decided to react to changes in atmospheric pressure just so I could experience the exquisite pain of barodontalgia. Kind of pain that makes you want to pry the top of your head off with a pitchfork because it would take your mind off the pain. Problem was it did not resolve after landing or anytime during the 4 days I was at the meeting. A combo regimen of acetaminophen and ibuprofen manage the pain well enough until I could get home and have it seen to. Pain did not end but the Xray showed no fracture or endodontic lesion. Strange. Then as suddenly as it occurred, the pain ceased. Strange x 2. Snapped another film and there was no pathology. Tooth was vital on pulp testing. So I did nothing more. I chalked it up to it being a karmic reminder about patients and dental pain as I’ve never had a cavity let alone a dental abscess. It let me feel your pain.

However, they did go through a sequence of events and experiences post-accident to deal with the tooth pain. They initially managed the pain through a combination of acetaminophen and ibuprofen until they could get back home and have it seen by a professional. Upon examination and x-rays, there was no sign of fracture or endodontic lesion and the tooth was vital on pulp testing.

The evolution of insect wings has been a subject of debate. Some entomologists suggest that the wings are from paranotal lobes, or extensions from the insect's exoskeleton called the nota, called the paranotal theory. Other theories are based on a pleural origin. These theories include suggestions that wings originated from modified gills, spiracular flaps or as from an appendage of the epicoxa. The epicoxal theory suggests the insect wings are modified epicoxal exites, a modified appendage at the base of the legs or coxa. In the Carboniferous age, some of the Meganeura dragonflies had as much as a 50 cm (20 in) wide wingspan. The appearance of gigantic insects has been found to be consistent with high atmospheric oxygen. The respiratory system of insects constrains their size, however the high oxygen in the atmosphere allowed larger sizes. The largest flying insects today are much smaller and include several moth species such as the Atlas moth and the White Witch (Thysania agrippina).

What is the answer for the question: What work's entrance chorus fit the situation almost exactly? from the following article ?  \\"Climbing over rocky mountain\\" is the best known piece from Thespis, as it was transplanted in 1879 into one of Gilbert and Sullivan's most successful operas, The Pirates of Penzance. In 1902, Gilbert told a correspondent that this had happened accidentally. He and Sullivan had arrived in New York to produce the new opera, but the composer discovered that he had left his sketches behind in England. Fortunately, the entrance chorus from Thespis fitted the situation almost exactly, so it was substituted instead.Several scholars have doubted that explanation. In Sullivan's autograph score for the later work, the first part of \\"Climbing over rocky mountain\\" is actually taken from a Thespis copyist score, with the Thespis words cancelled and the new words written in, which raises the question of why Sullivan had a Thespis score to hand, if not for that purpose.Some suggest that other music from Thespis could have been used in Pirates. Goldberg suggests that \\"It is reasonable to believe that Sullivan made generous use of his Thespis music in other operettas: perhaps owing to the circumstances under which The Pirates of Penzance was written, it contains more than one unacknowledged borrowing from the unlucky firstling of the lucky pair.\\" Reginald Allen says that \\"it seems certain\\" from its \\"rhythmic structure\\" that part of the Act I finale of Thespis, \\"Here's a pretty tale for future Iliads and Odysseys\\" became the original Act II finale in Pirates, \\"At length we are provided with unusual felicity\\", which was later deleted.

Write an article based on this summary: Teach your fish to follow your finger. Train your betta to flare on command. Teach your betta to jump. Train your betta to swim through a hoop. Keep trying! Article:","output":"Title: The Exciting World of Betta Training: Follow, Flare, Jump, and Swim! Intro A common misconception with fish as pets is the limited interaction humans can have with them. They swim in their aquarium, eat their food, and generally live their life with confined spontaneity. But what if that perception can change? Especially when it comes to betta fish, there's definitely more to them than meets the eye! Today, we're going to learn how to train a betta to follow your finger, flare on command, jump, and even swim through a hoop. Keep trying because persistence pays off! Teaching Your Betta to Follow Your Finger Training a betta to follow your finger sounds somewhat incredulous, but it's possible! Betta fish are very curious creatures who are stimulated by external changes to their environment, therefore, following your finger can pose as an intriguing challenge. Start by placing your clean finger on the outer part of the tank. Catch your betta's attention, then slowly move your finger around. Initially, they might not engage, but patience is key here. Reward your betta with food when it starts following your finger. This process conditions the fish to associate your finger with positive consequences (food!) and thus motivates them to keep following. Inculcating the Flare-on-Command Skill The flaring technique in betta fish is a spectacle to behold. In the wild, betta fish flare their gills to intimidate competitors. By replicating their environment, we can teach them to flare on command. Initially, train your betta to flare by introducing a mirror into their tank for short periods. The reflection will prompt a defensive response, causing them to flare. After several times, your betta should associate flaring with the mirror. Then, combine the mirror exposure with a unique hand signal. Over time, your fish will learn to flare at the sight of your unique hand signal, even without the mirror. Jumping Out of the Water While it might seem a little unconventional, bettas can indeed be taught to jump. In their natural habitat, bettas sometimes leap out of the water to catch prey. With enough patience and the correct training approach, your pet betta can learn to do this on command. Start by hovering a feed pellet just beyond the water surface. As your betta gets used to reaching for it, gradually elevate the pellet higher each time. Soon, your betta will jump to get its meal. Pair this action with a verbal command or a specific hand gesture, and with consistent practice, your fish will jump at your command. Swimming Through a Hoop Swimming through a hoop is another fun activity for your betta. Not only does it provide mental stimulation, but it is also an impressive party trick! Start with a soft, flexible hoop that's large enough for your betta to swim through. Place it just under the water surface. Entice them to pass through with food if needed. Once they get comfortable, gradually lower the hoop deeper into the water. Regular consistency with this training can make your betta master this skill in no time. In conclusion, a betta fish’s potential for interaction goes beyond just swimming around the tank. They are intelligent creatures capable of performing exciting and endearing tricks. Remember, patience and persistence are crucial in training your betta. So relax, take a deep breath, and keep trying! Betta training welcomes you to a world where your fish can follow your finger, flare on command, jump, and swim through a hoop."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate this to English?","output":"EULEX is attempting to reach an agreement with Pristina and Belgrade; I hope that a quick solution can be found for this situation. EULEX (European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo) is a European Union civilian mission that aims to help strengthen the rule of law and judicial independence in Kosovo. In this context, it is working to establish a mutual agreement between Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, and Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, in order to resolve any ongoing or potential disputes between these two entities. Given the long history of political tensions and conflicts between Kosovo and Serbia, reaching a comprehensive and lasting agreement is a challenging task for all parties involved. The main objective of EULEX's engagement in this process is to foster dialogue and cooperation between the two capitals, as well as to support the institutions of Kosovo in their efforts to enforce the rule of law and improve the overall legal framework. In order to achieve these goals, EULEX carries out several tasks, including providing expertise and technical assistance, monitoring and advising on legal proceedings, and facilitating training for local authorities and legal professionals. Through these actions, EULEX contributes not only to the development of a well-functioning judicial system in Kosovo but also to the broader efforts towards reconciliation and regional stability in the Western Balkans. However, there are numerous obstacles in the way of a swift and effective resolution of the situation between Pristina and Belgrade. These challenges include deeply rooted historical grievances, differences in political stances and objectives, and ongoing issues impacting the daily lives of people on both sides of the border. Some of the most pressing concerns involve disputes over territory, national identity, and the rights of minority populations, as well as the implementation of already agreed-upon arrangements and regulations. Despite these difficulties, the involvement of EULEX in the negotiation process between Pristina and Belgrade is crucial in ensuring that progress is made towards a mutually beneficial and peaceful resolution. By actively engaging both parties in constructive dialogue, identifying common ground, and creating an environment conducive to compromise, the prospects for a successful outcome can be significantly improved. In sum, EULEX's efforts to reach an agreement with Pristina and Belgrade are vital for facilitating a swift and effective resolution of the ongoing situation between Kosovo and Serbia. Through continued dialogue, cooperation, and the provision of support in enforcing the rule of law, the mission seeks to promote lasting peace and stability in the region, ultimately benefiting the lives of the people on both sides of the border."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I'll show you step-by-step to make sure it's easy for you to understand. Here we go: 1. Ingredients: For this, you'll need water, tea bags of your choice (like black or green tea), and flavored simple syrup. You can use any flavor you like, such as strawberry, lemon, or mint. 2. Boil water: Ask a grown-up to help you with this part. Pour some water into a pot and let it boil on the stove. Make sure it's enough water to fill your teacup or mug. 3. Put tea bag in a cup: Take your teacup or mug and place a tea bag inside. 4. Add hot water: Once the water boils, ask a grown-up to carefully pour the hot water into your teacup or mug. Fill it almost to the top, but leave a little space for the simple syrup. 5. Let it steep: Let the tea bag sit in the hot water for around 3-5 minutes.

Advani spent his initial years in Kuwait before moving to Bangalore, India. He received his education at the Frank Anthony Public School, Bangalore and completed his bachelor's degree in Commerce from Sri Bhagawan Mahaveer Jain College. He received training in snooker from former national Snooker champion Arvind Savur. Pankaj Advani, on international competitive debut in the discipline, won the IBSF World Snooker Championship (i.e. the World Amateur Snooker Championship) on 25 October 2003 in Jiangmen, China. He was 18 years old, and became the youngest Indian to win the title, his first world title. A decade later, as a 28-year-old, at the IBSF World 6-Red World Snooker Championship in Sharm-El-Sheik, Egypt, he won one of the amateur world titles (on debut in the short format).  As a new player on the tour, Advani would need to win four matches to reach the main stage of the ranking events. He did this in just his fourth attempt, when qualifying for the International Championship. He defeated Craig Steadman 6-1, six-time world champion Steve Davis 6-5 (after being 1-4 down), Alan McManus 6-3 and Michael Holt 6-4 to reach the venue stage for the first time. He made four century breaks during qualification, the most of any player. Advani was to play a wildcard match once at the tournament in Chengdu, China, to reach the last 32, however he decided to withdraw from the tournament to take part in the World Billiards Championship, which he went on to win. He also reached the semi-finals of the minor ranking European Tour Event 1, beating four-time world champion John Higgins 4-1 along the way. Advani lost to Mark Selby 2-4. Advani played in eight of the ten of these Players Tour Championship events and finished 40th on the Order of Merit.  At the 2013 Welsh Open, he became the first Indian player to reach the quarter-final stage of a ranking event with a 4-1 win over Graeme Dott in the last 16, but lost 2-5 to Judd Trump. Advani's season ended when he was beaten 8-10 by Joe Swail in the first round of World Championship Qualifying. He was ranked world number 74 after his first year on the main snooker tour.

A recent tweet by an astrophysicist commemorating the birthday of Sir Isaac Newton on December 25 has caused quite a stir among the Twitterati and has since been retweeted more than 70,000 times. This astrophysicist took to Twitter to pay tribute to the legendary mathematician and physicist, Sir Isaac Newton, whose birthday falls on December 25th. The tweet was intended as a simple gesture of appreciation and recognition for one of the most influential figures in the history of science. However, it fueled an unexpected debate that led some people to accuse the astrophysicist of \\"trolling Christmas to show how smart he is.\\" These accusations were met with a sense of surprise and bewilderment by the astrophysicist. He clarified that his intention was not to be \\"somehow anti-Christian\\" by mentioning Newton's birthday on a day that carries great significance for millions of people all around the world. The purpose of his tweet was definitely not to downplay the importance of Christmas, but rather to highlight the incredible contributions of Isaac Newton to our understanding of the natural world. Responding to the unexpected reactions to his tweet, the astrophysicist shared his thoughts in another tweet: \\"Imagine a world in which we are all enlightened by objective truths rather than offended by them.\\" This statement, in essence, underlines the importance of recognizing and appreciating objective truths without allowing our emotions to cloud our judgments. At its core, the incident serves as an interesting reflection on the way we perceive information and interact with it in our increasingly connected world. The exchange of thoughts and ideas on social media platforms has undoubtedly made it easier for us to stay informed and learn new things. However, it also carries the risk of triggering emotional responses and misunderstandings, which can lead to unnecessary controversy. Moreover, this entire episode highlights the significance of promoting scientific literacy and critical thinking in our modern, digital society. By fostering a deeper understanding of the world around us, we can prevent the spread of misinformation, reduce emotional reactions, and better appreciate the value of objective truths. It is crucial to remember that the progress of human civilization has been fueled by the contributions of great minds, like Isaac Newton, who relentlessly pursued knowledge and pushed the boundaries of our understanding. Celebrating their accomplishments does not necessitate disrespecting or undermining anyone's beliefs or religious practices. In conclusion, the astrophysicist's tweet commemorating the birthday of Isaac Newton on December 25 should ideally be seen as an opportunity to appreciate the achievements of one of the most prominent scientific luminaries in history. This incident serves as a reminder that we must strive to create a world where objective truths are valued and acknowledged without being overshadowed by emotional responses or misunderstandings, thus promoting harmony and mutual respect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Americans should avoid all but essential travel to all or parts of 14 Mexican states, the U.S. State Department warns as violence has spread. Shootouts, kidnappings and carjackings have climbed, as have cartels, also known as transnational criminal organizations (TCO), the State Department said this week in a broadened travel warning. While millions of U.S. citizens safely visit Mexico every year, the country's ongoing violence and security concerns pose risks for U.S. citizens, and travelers should take precautions, the State Department advises. \\"The TCOs themselves are engaged in a violent struggle to control drug trafficking routes and other criminal activity. As a result, crime and violence are serious problems throughout the country and can occur anywhere. U.S. citizens have fallen victim to TCO activity, including homicide, gun battles, kidnapping, carjacking and highway robbery,\\" its alert says. More than 47,500 people were killed in drug-related violence in Mexico between December 2006 and September 2011, according to the State Department. While most of those murdered were involved in criminal activity, innocent people were also caught in the crossfire, the State Department said. Mexican President Felipe Calderon declared a crackdown on cartels in late 2006. The number of Americans reported murdered in Mexico last year was 120 -- up from 35 reported in 2007. \\"We strongly advise you to lower your profile and avoid displaying any evidence of wealth that might draw attention,\\" the alert says. The travel warning urges Americans to defer nonessential travel to all or parts of the following 14 states: Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, Nuevo Leon, San Luis Potosi, Sinaloa, Sonora, Tamaulipas, Zacatecas, Aguascalientes, Guerrero, Jalisco, Michoacan and Nayarit. Travelers should also exercise caution visiting all or parts of Baja California, Colima and Morelos, it says. The previous U.S. travel warning issued for Mexico by the State Department, dated in April, advised American to avoid travel to all or parts of 10 states.

However, it can be inferred that it may have involved some form of racist behavior or comments, as the Kick Racism Out Of Football campaign is specifically mentioned in the context. The campaign's belief that Aragones will receive only a mild punishment could imply that they are concerned about the Spanish Football Federation's commitment to fighting racism in the sport. The statement also suggests that the Spanish Football Federation has taken some time to address the issue (\\"belatedly opened a disciplinary\\"), meaning that their response might have been considered slow or inadequate by the campaign or other observers. It is possible that this delay could have attracted further criticism, particularly if the issue in question was viewed as serious or damaging to the sport's reputation. Overall, this text is centered around an incident involving Spain's football coach Luis Aragones, who is expected to receive disciplinary action for potentially racist behavior or comments from the Spanish Football Federation.

HM Revenue chiefs were yesterday ordered by MPs to stop sending threatening letters to people who owed them money, warning that cars and televisions would be seized and sold off for a pittance. In a scathing rebuke, tax bosses were told by the Commons' Treasury committee that the 'widely used' practice of mailing out threats to auction off people's property was 'completely inappropriate'. Labour MP George Mudie, deputy chairman of the committee, even suggested that HM Revenue and Customs had been breaking the law by sending out the 'horrifying' letters. 'Horrifying threats': HM Revenue has been sending out letters to people threatening to auction off their property. And he accused Chancellor George Osborne of turning a blind eye to the abuse after one of his Treasury Ministers appeared to condone it. Earlier this year, The Mail on Sunday exposed how the tax office was targeting thousands of people among Britain's ten million self-assessment taxpayers who had failed to respond to tax demands. In a damning report this weekend on HMRC's performance, the Treasury committee said: 'These letters appear to have been widely used without sufficient thought to whom they were sent to, even being sent to people who did not actually owe money. 'Such language is appropriate only where there is strong evidence of persistent and deliberate non-payment.' Mr Mudie, who led the inquiry,  praised The Mail on Sunday for exposing the HMRC tactics. He said: 'This was one of the most disturbing things uncovered in our inquiry. They were sending these out to taxpayers, seemingly on a random basis, and telling them to pay up within weeks. 'There was no question of saying  we would like to discuss this with you, or you can phone this number, and you have a right of appeal. 'It was just: pay up this money – and it was often a four-figure number – within weeks or we will seize your goods. 'Imagine the effect on someone elderly and vulnerable living on their own if they got a letter like that.' 'Disappointing': Treasury Minister David Gauke was on the receiving end of stern criticism from the committee. The Leeds MP also warned that unless the letters were being sent to people who had repeatedly and deliberately refused to pay up, they were illegal. He also voiced his anger that Treasury Minister David Gauke, who oversees HMRC, appeared to condone the practice. Mr Mudie said: 'The Minister came before us and I was disappointed because he took the line that they owed money and they had to get it. 'He seemed to think it was acceptable but the committee didn't.' Earlier this year, The Mail on Sunday exposed how HMRC was targeting thousands of people among Britain's ten million self-assessment taxpayers who had failed to respond to tax demands. In a provocative twin-track tactic, tax chiefs set out to humiliate people into paying up by threatening to seize their possessions and auction them off publicly for a fraction of their real value, and warning them that if they refused the Government would run out of money to treat the sick and educate the nation's children. One letter sent from the HMRC office in Croydon described in graphic terms how 'embarrassing' and costly it would be for the taxpayer if a debt of more than £2,000 was not settled. 'We must collect this tax from you to pay for the hospitals and schools we all rely on. We will do that by taking your possessions and auctioning them publicly. 'We don't like doing this because people have told us it is embarrassing for them and it will cost you so much more to pay this way. 'For instance, if your car is worth several thousand pounds, it might sell for only a few hundred pounds at auction, a flat-screen TV costing £2,000 would typically sell for about £200-£300, and an £800 laptop would sell for about £100.' Praised: The Mail on Sunday story from earlier this year that exposed how HMRC was sending menacing letters to late payers. In their report, MPs painted a dismal picture of HMRC as an organisation in deep crisis, with 'endemic delays'. Staff were so over-stretched that more than half of calls from the public went unanswered and letters were ignored for months. The report comes after HMRC  admitted last year that six million people had paid the wrong amount of tax in previous years. Last night HMRC remained defiant about the letters, saying most of the them were sent to people who either repeatedly failed to respond or refused to pay up. The Treasury declined to make a statement last night. Write highlights for this article.","output":"The UK Treasury Committee has ordered HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to stop sending threatening letters to people who owe them money, stating that cars and televisions would be seized and sold off. The committee deemed the \\"horrifying threats\\" of auctioning people's property as \\"completely inappropriate,\\" and said the language used in the letters may in some cases have been illegal. The letters were deemed inappropriate as they were being sent to taxpayers on a random basis, sometimes to individuals who didn't owe any money. The committee also criticized the HMRC's performance and highlighted the organization's crisis, with staff stretched so thin that more than half of calls from the public went unanswered and letters were ignored for months."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Process:  - Rinse the dishes before placing them in a dishwasher - Load glasses and plastic wear on the top rack - Put plates, bowls, pots, and pans on the bottom rack - Place all the utensils in the utensil basket - Put detergent into the detergent holder - Close the door and push the start button -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are dishes left from a dinner happens, how will it affect HURTING the dishwasher to clean better.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Rinse the dishes before placing them in a dishwasher Justification: Rinsing the dishes removes any large food particles and debris, which prevents clogging the dishwasher's filter and ensures better overall cleaning. Step 2: Load glasses and plastic wear on the top rack Justification: Glasses and plastic wear are more delicate and generally lighter, so placing them on the top rack reduces the risk of damage and allows better water circulation around them. Step 3: Put plates, bowls, pots, and pans on the bottom rack Justification: These items are generally heavier and more sturdy, so placing them on the bottom rack allows them to be exposed to the more powerful water jets and get a better overall cleaning. Step 4: Place all the utensils in the utensil basket Justification: The utensil basket helps keep utensils separated and organized, ensuring they are cleaned thoroughly without getting tangled or scratched. Step 5: Put detergent into the detergent holder Justification: The detergent holder releases detergent during the washing process, ensuring the dishes are cleaned with the right amount of detergent. Step 6: Close the door and push the start button Justification: This initiates the dishwasher cycle and begins the process of cleaning the dishes. Perturbation Hypothesis: Suppose there are dishes left from a dinner that happens, how will it affect hurting the dishwasher to clean better.  Considering the perturbation hypothesis, if there are more dishes left from a dinner, it may lead to a higher load of dishes than usual in the dishwasher. This could potentially affect the dishwasher's ability to clean effectively, as overcrowding may restrict water flow and the proper circulation of detergent. To address this issue, it's crucial to not overload the dishwasher and, if necessary, run multiple cycles to accommodate the extra load of dishes. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis directly affects the process by potentially causing overcrowding of dishes in the dishwasher, which may lead to a less effective cleaning. To ensure optimal cleaning, it's essential to not overload the dishwasher and run multiple cycles if needed."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the real names of the men that helped add a \\"more analogue sound\\" to a song previously recorded by M.I.A?, using the article: In 2001, M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) had worked exclusively in the visual arts. While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine. Having produced rough tracks via trial and error, she honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers. Through these collaborations, she sought to produce a diverse style and \\"drag [her collaborators] out of their boxes, musically\\".DJ Diplo introduced elements of Brazilian baile funk to \\"Bucky Done Gun\\". Fellow composer-producer Richard X worked on the track \\"Hombre\\", which featured a drum pattern created from the sounds made by toys that M.I.A. had bought in India, augmented with sounds produced by objects such as pens and mobile phones. Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, known professionally as Cavemen, worked on \\"Galang\\", which M.I.A. had initially produced with her 505 and a basic four-track tape recorder. Working with Cavemen in a professional studio, she added a bass line and new vocals to give the song \\"a more analogue sound\\" than was possible with the 505. The track was co-written by Frischmann, whose input M.I.A. described as \\"refreshing\\". She initially hoped to feature guest vocalists on..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The real names of the men that helped add a \\"more analogue sound\\" to a song previously recorded by M.I.A. are Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, who are known professionally as Cavemen.

I do try not to take IMDb ratings to heart, but I was flabbergasted when I saw the 5.4 rating to one of my childhood favourites. It doesn't wow me as much at 17, but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie. Kids will definitely love it and won't mind the flaws, and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the film. None of the film was preachy in any way, in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness. I will admit though that the story is on the thin side, and some scenes like Screweyes's death(which still freaks me out) may be a tad on the scary side. But the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation. The music by James Horner is very beautiful, and the song featured is memorable, catchy and amusing. I really liked the characters, Louie is probably the most in-depth of them all, but the dinosaurs were at least engaging. Martin Short's clown was both hilarious and emphatic, the part when he tells Screweyes \\"I quit!\\" had me in stitches. My favourite is Screweyes though, an effective villain who is crafty and I suppose intelligent. If anything though, I wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he could've been more developed in terms of depth. The script, while not Oscar-worthy, has its funny and heart-warming parts, and should keep kids and adults entertained. The voice acting for me was what made the movie. John Goodman, Martin Short, Rhea Perlman, Felicity Kendall and Yeardley Smith all gave solid performances, but special mention has to go to Kenneth Mars for he was absolutely superb as Screweyes and almost unrecognisable. All in all, this is a good movie. I don't get the rating, honestly I don't. Sure this film isn't perfect, and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as Land Before Time, but it is good fun. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox Choose your answer. What is the sentiment of this review?

Personal preferences: If this is your first Pokémon game, X/Y would be a good choice as it introduces several new Pokémon and mechanics, and is considered beginner-friendly. 2. If you have played Pokémon before and liked Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald, then ORAS would be a great choice since it offers improved graphics, updated gameplay, and extra content compared to the original titles. 3. Sun/Moon offer an entirely new region, Alola, with different mechanics and new Pokémon. If you like trying new things and exploring new regions, then waiting for Sun/Moon would be the better option. To summarize, depending on what you value in a Pokémon game, whether it is familiarity, nostalgia, or novelty, each of these choices has its own appeal.

Four passenger airlines were hijacked by 19 terrorists, targeting major U.S. landmarks. Two planes, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, were flown into the North and South towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, causing the collapse of both towers. A third plane, American Airlines Flight 77, was crashed into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, leading to a partial collapse of the building. The fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93, was initially headed for a target in Washington, D.C., but crash-landed in a field in Pennsylvania after passengers attempted to retake control from the hijackers. Although the group's leader, Osama bin Laden, initially denied any involvement, in 2004 he claimed responsibility for the attacks. The 9/11 bombings resulted in nearly 3,000 fatalities, over 6,000 injuries, and lasting physical, economic, and emotional impact on the world.

Carolina starting quarterback Jake Delhomme sat out the game with an elbow injury, and was replaced by David Carr. The Buccaneer offense started the game with an exhausting, 11-play, 71-yard drive, capped off by a 3-yard scramble by Jeff Garcia for a touchdown.

Title: This rendition of Verdi's requiem is unacceptable Review: I agree with many people who have a problem with Andrea Bocelli. Surely, they could have chosen a much better tenor, like Jose Carerras or Roberto Alagna. Renee Fleming does have a charming voice, and Borodina has great depth in her emotion, but these two don't seem to fit as a balanced cast in this requiem by Verdi. And personally, I prefer Gergiev conducting the Russian operas, not an Italian piece.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this version of Verdi's requiem to anyone. Bocelli is just not operatic with his voice. He should stick with his Pop music and stay away from Puccini, Donizetti, etc.I would recommend conductor Emil Tabakov's version, with singers Romanko, Ombuena, and de Grandis. As long as the CD on Capriccio Records doesn't run out of stock. Answer:","output":"No, this product review is not positive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Teenagers and their families will have found out the good news and the disappointments. That is really the story of the day - the hundreds of thousands of individual triumphs and disasters that make up this collective academic rite of passage. An analysis of Twitter today showed that \\"Good luck\\" was one of the most-used phrases. And parents would have stepped away for a few moments to look at their phones to check text messages from their children that would put years of ambition into a few words. It might be expressed through cliches of leaping teenagers and tearful conversations into mobile phones - but each set of results is a turning point in young lives. School is officially finished and now there are big decisions. For an increasing number, the destination is going to be university. The figures for university places published on results day are still incomplete - but they show a 3% increase on the same time this year, with 424,000 already allocated. This includes a rising number of EU students, who would have applied before the referendum, and it remains to be seen whether the numbers hold up for next year. But despite tuition fees being pushed up even higher, to Â£9,250 from next year, the numbers going to university increase relentlessly. And the clearing process, which has got under way today, will find places for tens of thousands more students, with universities competing to fill any empty spaces. It will re-ignite the question whether university is worth the expense. A study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that doubling the number of students had not meant a reduction in higher graduate earnings. Instead the labour market has changed, with more graduate jobs and diminishing opportunities for less well-qualified workers. In the United States, having a degree has become a clear dividing line, with graduates much more likely to be in secure, better-paid jobs, while non-graduates are increasingly facing insecure and low-paid jobs. But the IFS report also has a strong note of caution that at some point a rising number of students will tip over into a process of diminishing returns. The increase in university numbers might seem to run counter to the other headline - that the proportion of top A-level grades has fallen for the fifth successive year. But apart from the most marginal of changes, the exam results this year are remarkably similar to those from last year. The fall in A* and A grades is only by 0.1% and the overall pass rate is identical. Such stability is not accidental. It's the effect of a system designed to make each year comparable with the last. We report the rise and fall of results as though measuring a natural phenomenon, like taking the changing temperature outside the window. But an exam-grading system sets its own boundaries and outcomes - and this year's results are almost identical with those from last year. There is no grade inflation and no sudden falls. Head teachers have long complained that below this smooth surface there are all kinds of individual problems - but the big picture remains one of year-to-year consistency. The results day also casts a light on what subjects are being studied. Maths, English and biology are the most popular. But there was a further decline in modern languages, with the number taking French A-level, the most popular language, falling below 10,000 for the first time. Head teachers have suggested that schools under financial pressure might not be able to afford to run subjects with small numbers of students. The Institute of Physics was concerned that the numbers studying physics had fallen this year. But for now, with all the results announced and envelopes opened, the next phase of the story will be personal rather than political, with celebrations and commiserations, as the long summer weeks after A-levels come to a symbolic end.","output":"Teenagers in the UK are receiving their A-level results today, which mark a turning point in their lives as they decide what comes next, with many heading to university.

Abstrakti tietotyyppi Could you please translate this to English?","output":"Abstract Data Type The term \\"Abstrakti tietotyyppi\\" is Finnish and can be translated to \\"Abstract Data Type\\" in English. An abstract data type (ADT) is a high-level description of a collection of data and the operations that can be performed on that data. It is a conceptual representation of how data can be organized and manipulated. The representation of an abstract data type hides the implementation details from a user. This means the user only needs to understand what the data type does, but not how it does it. ADTs promote the principle of data abstraction, which allows simpler and more modular programming. ADTs are often defined by their operations and behaviors, rather than their specific implementation. For example, a stack is an abstract data type with the operations push and pop. There could be many different implementations of a stack (e.g., using an array or a linked list), but the user of the stack does not need to be aware of these details, as long as they understand the basic functionality provided by the stack. Some common ADTs include: 1. Stack: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure that supports inserting an element at the top (push operation) and removing the top element (pop operation). 2. Queue: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure that supports inserting an element at the rear (enqueue operation) and removing the front element (dequeue operation). 3. List: An ordered collection of elements that supports adding, removing, and searching for elements based on their position in the list. 4. Tree: A hierarchically organized data structure that consists of nodes, with one designated as the root node and each node having a possible set of child nodes. 5. Graph: A collection of nodes and edges that connect nodes, representing a nonlinear data structure that can be used to model complex relationships between objects or data points. Each of these abstract data types can have multiple implementations, which can be optimized for specific environments or use cases. These concrete implementations can be selected based on their performance, memory usage, and other factors that are important for the specific application using the ADT. The use of abstract data types helps to ensure that the code is more maintainable, scalable, and easier to understand and modify as requirements change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the answer: What architectural term was applied by the Romans to any public building built in a rectangle twice as long as it was broad with an internal 2 storied colonnade?","output":"The architectural term that the Romans applied to any public building built in a rectangle twice as long as it was broad with an internal two-storied colonnade is known as the \\"Basilica.\\" Originally, the term basilica referred to a type of ancient Roman building that served various purposes, including judicial proceedings, commerce, and other public gatherings. These were important civic structures located primarily in the Roman Forum, the central gathering place in ancient Roman cities. The structure of a Basilica typically features a central nave, which is the open central space that runs longitudinally from the entrance to the end of the building, and two aisles on either side. The interior of the building showcases a two-storied colonnade or arcade, which are rows of columns supporting arches. This design often uses Doric, Ionic, or Corinthian columns, acknowledging the influence of ancient Greek architecture on Roman designs. One of the distinguishing aspects of a Roman basilica is the presence of an apse, a semicircular or polygonal space at one or both ends of the building. The apse was typically used for the magistrate's seated position, or for housing a statue or other important artifacts. The oblong shape of a basilica made it an ideal space for a variety of activities. The design allowed for an open floor plan that could be easily adapted to accommodate large crowds, as well as to provide privacy with the help of internal partitions when needed. These buildings often had high, vaulted roofs supported by wooden beams, allowing for plenty of natural light to enter through clerestory windows, creating a spacious and grand atmosphere within the basilica. There are several well-known examples of Roman basilicas, such as the Basilica Julia and Basilica Aemilia in the Roman Forum, and the Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine, also known as the Basilica Nova. As the Roman Empire expanded, the concept of a basilica spread throughout Europe and the Mediterranean region. The architectural form of the basilica greatly influenced the development of early Christian architecture, as it was adopted for constructing churches. Many early Christian basilicas, such as Old St. Peter's Basilica in Rome and the Basilica of San Clemente, were built on the foundations and design principles of ancient Roman basilicas. Over time, the term \\"basilica\\" has become more closely associated with Christian churches, particularly those that have significant historical, architectural, or ecclesiastical importance. In fact, today many renowned churches around the world, such as St. Peter's Basilica and the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, still carry the historic name which originated from ancient Roman architectural principles."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},Y={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],F={key:0},R={key:1};function j(o,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",Y,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",H,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
