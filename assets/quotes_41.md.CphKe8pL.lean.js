Please answer the following question: Information:  - A Special Interest Group (SIG) is a community within a larger organization with a shared interest in advancing a specific area of knowledge, learning or technology where members cooperate to affect or to produce solutions within their particular field, and may communicate, meet, and organize conferences. The term originated on CompuServe, an early online service provider, where SIGs were a section of the service devoted to particular interests.  - Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.  - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers.  - Computing is any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating a mathematical sequence of steps known as an algorithm  e.g. through computers. Computing includes designing, developing and building hardware and software systems; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; doing scientific research on and with computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; and creating and using communications and entertainment media. The field of computing includes computer engineering, software engineering, computer science, information systems, and information technology.  - The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is an international learned society for computing. It was founded in 1947 and is the world's largest scientific and educational computing society. It is a not-for-profit professional membership group. Its membership is more than 100,000 as of 2011. Its headquarters are in New York City.  - CompuServe (CompuServe Information Service, also known by its acronym CIS) was the first major commercial online service provider in the United States. It dominated the field during the 1980s and remained a major influence through the mid-1990s. At its peak in the early 1990s, CIS was known for its online chat system, message forums covering a variety of topics, extensive software libraries for most computer platforms, and a series of popular online games, notably MegaWars III and Island of Kesmai. They are also known for their introduction of the GIF format for pictures, and CIS was a very popular GIF exchange mechanism.  - ACM SIGACT or SIGACT is the Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory , whose purpose is support of research in theoretical computer science . It was founded in 1968 by Patrick C. Fischer .  - An online service provider can, for example, be an Internet service provider, an email provider, a news provider (press), an entertainment provider (music, movies), a search engine, an e-commerce site, an online banking site, a health site, an official government site, a wiki, or a Usenet newsgroup. In its original more limited definition, it referred only to a commercial computer communication service in which paid members could dial via a computer modem the service's private computer network and access various services and information resources such a bulletin boards, downloadable files and programs, news articles, chat rooms, and electronic mail services. The term \\"online service\\" was also used in references to these dial-up services. The traditional dial-up online service differed from the modern Internet service provider in that they provided a large degree of content that was only accessible by those who subscribed to the online service, while ISP mostly serves to provide access to the Internet and generally provides little if any exclusive content of its own. In the U.S., the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act (OCILLA) portion of the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act has expanded the legal definition of online service in two different ways for different portions of the law. It states in section 512(k)(1):  - In theoretical computer science and mathematics, the theory of computation is the branch that deals with how efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm. The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory and language, computability theory, and computational complexity theory, which are linked by the question: \\"\\"What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?\\".\\"  - Theoretical computer science, or TCS, is a division or subset of general computer science and mathematics that focuses on more abstract or mathematical aspects of computing and includes the theory of computation.

Question: What do parents encourage kids to do when they experience boredom? Options:  A. read book  B. travel  C. sleep  D. play chess  E. falling down A:","output":"Parents often encourage their children to engage in activities that can help them cope with boredom while promoting creativity, critical thinking, and personal growth. Among the options provided, A. Read a book is the most in line with common sense. Reading a book allows children to explore new worlds, develop a habit of learning, enhance vocabulary, and improve comprehension abilities. It fosters discipline, concentration, and creative thinking, which contribute to their problem-solving skills and success in life. Books can transport kids into different cultures, perspectives, and scenarios, broadening their minds and nurturing empathy. Aside from reading, option D. Play chess is also a reasonable suggestion. Chess is a strategic game that stimulates brain function, fosters intellectual skills, and develops logical thinking. It can help children to focus better, plan their moves, and strategize. The game allows them to grasp abstract concepts, making them better equipped to face real-life problems. Additionally, the competitive nature of chess keeps it entertaining, and winning games can significantly boost a child's self-confidence. Options B. Travel, and C. Sleep are not as effective in dealing with boredom, especially during the moment of boredom. While traveling offers valuable experiences, it may not be feasible as a day-to-day solution, due to logistical constraints and time limitations. Sleeping is essential for overall well-being, but encouraging children to sleep whenever they are bored isn't an optimal solution, as it does not foster creativity or address the underlying issue. Option E. Falling down is not a suitable suggestion at all. It does not address boredom and can be physically harmful to children. In conclusion, parents should encourage activities that promote personal growth and intellectual development, such as reading a book or playing strategic games like chess. These activities help children learn essential life skills while keeping them engaged and entertained."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The right-wing government being mentioned here refers to a conservative, economically liberal-leaning administration that held power for two consecutive terms. While it is not specified which particular government is being discussed, the involvement of Goldman Sachs suggests that the administration engaged in some secretive and potentially unscrupulous financial practices. Goldman Sachs is an American multinational investment bank and financial services company known for its involvement in global finance, often providing investment and consulting services to governments and large corporations. In this context, it appears that this bank collaborated with the right-wing government in question to manipulate or mask certain financial figures, potentially to promote a more favorable economic narrative or to cover up financial mismanagement. Such deceptive practices would likely erode trust in both the government and the institutions involved, raising questions about transparency, accountability, and the ethical implications of using influential financial entities to influence the public's perception of a government's performance.

What is the answer?","output":"General Thomas Jonathan \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson was given the nickname \\"Stonewall\\" because of his stern defense at the First Battle of Bull Run (also known as the First Battle of Manassas) during the American Civil War. The battle took place on July 21, 1861, near the town of Manassas in Virginia. Confederate forces, led by General P.G.T. Beauregard and General Joseph E. Johnston, faced Union forces under the command of General Irvin McDowell. The origin of the nickname \\"Stonewall\\" traces back to an incident during the battle when General Jackson's brigade was holding a defensive line on Henry House Hill against the advancing Union troops. Confederate Brigadier General Barnard Elliott Bee Jr. observed Jackson's stern determination and unwavering resolve under intense fire. In an effort to rally and inspire his own troops, General Bee proclaimed, \\"There stands Jackson like a stone wall! Rally behind the Virginians!\\" This exclamation led to Jackson being referred to as \\"Stonewall Jackson\\" among his fellow soldiers and in subsequent accounts of the battle. The First Battle of Bull Run proved to be a significant Confederate victory and demonstrated the ferocity and brutality of the American Civil War. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson's steadfast leadership and defensive tactics played a crucial role in the Confederacy's success at the battle. His resolute demeanor and courage during the fight would make the \\"Stonewall\\" nickname synonymous with his legacy as a commander. Following his impressive performance at Bull Run, Jackson would go on to become one of the most renowned Confederate generals during the Civil War. His effective use of speed, audacity, and surprise in the famous Shenandoah Valley Campaign in 1862 helped keep Union forces off balance. Additionally, his tactical prowess was a major factor in Confederate victories at battles such as Second Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville. Unfortunately, at Chancellorsville in May 1863, General Stonewall Jackson was mistakenly shot by his own troops during a night reconnaissance mission. He would succumb to complications from his wounds and pass away on May 10, 1863. Despite his tragic and unexpected end, General Stonewall Jackson remains an iconic figure in American military history for his exceptional leadership and skill during the American Civil War."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They have a beaker of boiling water, a beaker of ice water, and a beaker of water at room temperature.  But I can use this background: A thermometer is a device used to measure temperature. It is placed in contact with an object and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium with the object (they will have the same temperature). The operation of a thermometer is based on some property, such as volume, that varies with temperature. The most common thermometers contain liquid mercury, or some other liquid, inside a sealed glass tube. The liquid expands and contracts faster than the glass tube. Therefore, when the temperature of the thermometer increases, the liquid volume expands faster than the glass volume, allowing the liquid to rise in the tube. The positions of the liquid in the tube can then be calibrated for accurate temperature readings. Other properties that change with temperature can also be used to make thermometers; liquid crystal colors and electrical conductivity change with temperature, and are also relatively common thermometers.  What is an answer for this question: If the students move the thermometer from one beaker to another and the mercury levels rise, is the temperature higher or lower? The answer to this question is:","output":"The temperature is higher. If the mercury levels rise in the thermometer, it means that the temperature of the liquid in the second beaker is higher than in the first one because the mercury expands and rises in the tube when heated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  Paragraph: Two farmer's associations used different agricultural methods when growing crops. Bold farm used lots of fertilizers over the years, while Shallow farm used organic methods combined with methods from permaculture.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farm contributes less to the consumption of oxygen in the water?

What is the best way to: how to keep your pipes from freezing in the winter","output":"Keeping your pipes from freezing in the winter involves multiple steps and considerations. Frozen pipes can lead to water damage, so it's a very important task to perform well. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to approach this: 1. **Insulate the Pipes**: The first and most important way to prevent the pipes from freezing is by insulating them. There are materials available like foam rubber or fiberglass sleeves that can insulate your pipes and help keep the temperature from falling. Why this step important? It reduces heat transfer and keeps your pipes warmer. 2. **Seal the Cracks and Openings**: If there are any cracks or openings in your walls, you should seal them to prevent cold air from reaching the pipes. This can be done with caulk or spray foam to keep out cold air. Why this step important? It prevents cold air from accessing the pipes directly. 3. **Let the Faucet drip**: If you're expecting a particularly cold night, let your faucet drip slightly. This helps relieve pressure in the system and prevents pipes from freezing. Why this step is important? Moving water in the pipes will prevent it from freezing, and releasing the pressure helps in case the water does freeze, to prevent the pipe from bursting. 4. **Use Heating Tape**: For pipes that are easily accessible, like pipes under a sink, apply heating tape. It acts like an electric blanket for your pipes, providing heat directly to them to keep them from freezing. Why this step important? It directly warms the pipes and prevents the temperature from dropping down. 5. **Keep the Heat On**: No matter if you are at home or not during a cold period, it's better to leave the heat on as it helps to keep the pipes warm. Why this step important? Leaving the ambient temperature at a comfortable level can prevent the overall temperature of the pipes from dropping too low. 6. **Open Cabinet Doors**: Opening cabinet doors, particularly those under sinks, can allow the heat from your home to reach the pipes and keep them warmer. Why this step important? It allows heat exchange to occur more easily and keeps hidden pipes at a warmer temperature. By following these steps, you can help prevent your pipes from freezing in the winter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Plot title: Homecoming Movie plot: An unnamed US president (whose appearance is modeled after Bill Clinton and whose voice is modeled after George W. Bush) is running for reelection during a divisive war, and one of his speech writers, David Murch (Jon Tenney), goes on TV to speak with talk show host Marty Clark (Terry David Mulligan) and strident right-wing sexpot (and Ann Coulter-like) Jane Cleaver (Thea Gill). Another guest is Janet Hofstader (Beverly Breuer), the Cindy Sheehan-like mother of a dead soldier, who demands to know what her son died for. Murch gets a bit teary-eyed and explains that he lost his older brother Philip (Ryan McDonnell) in Vietnam.\\"Believe me,\\" he tells the grieving mom, \\"if I had one wish, I would wish for your son to come back, because I know he would tell us how important this struggle is.\\" Cleaver is so impressed with Murch's handling of the situation that she takes him out for a drink later, picks his brain, and eventually seduces him. The Karl Rove-like Kurt Rand (Robert Picardo) interrupts their tryst, calling to let Murch know that the president plans to make his line part of his stump speech.Soon, the soldiers killed in Iraq do start returning from the dead, and it doesn't go the way Murch predicted. They are not back to feast on the living, but unhappily for the president and his supporters, they just want a chance to vote in the upcoming election. \\"We'll vote for anyone who ends this war,\\" one explains.

Movie title: The Spirit of St. Louis Movie plot: On the night before his epic solo flight across the Atlantic, Charles Lindbergh (James Stewart) lies awake in his hotel bed, worrying about his chances. Will he have enough fuel? Will he even be able to take off? Rain falls outside his window, dimming the chances for an early start. Time is short, and Lindbergh knows he must make his attempt soon, because there are others trying to make the same flight.Tossing and turning, he thinks back to the events that led him here. Once, flying airmail for the Army, his plane failed in a Midwest blizzard, and after bailing out, he had to find his way through the dark and take a train to his destination. Lindbergh was no stranger to the dangers of flight, but his faith in its capabilities was unshakable, and a dream formed in his mind: he wanted to do something remarkable, something that would show people what airplanes could really do.Back at his home base in St. Louis, he calls a New York aircraft builder to get a quote on a special plane. One that can make a very long distance flight: New York to Paris, non-stop. Lindbergh next sets out to raise the money needed to buy it, and manages to get several St. Louis businessmen interested. They like the idea, and they see its value, but aren't sure about Lindbergh's chances. Is he really sure he can do this? He convinces them that he can, and the name \\"The Spirit of St. Louis\\" is coined for the project.Lindbergh travels to New York to purchase the special plane, but the deal falls through and he returns home, discouraged. Another possible builder is found however, and Lindbergh is off to California to see the small Ryan Aircraft Co. He locates the sleepy little factory and finds the firm's president Frank Mahoney (Bartlett Robinson) frying fish with a torch. Amused, Lindbergh makes the deal, and they all get to work. In a few weeks, a little silver plane has taken shape, and Lindbergh takes it up for testing. Satisfied, he heads back to St. Louis, but learns that another team has taken off from Paris and is trying to make it... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"The Spirit of St. Louis,\\" there is no specific mention of Charles Lindbergh finding a medal. However, it is important to note that after completing his historical solo flight across the Atlantic, Lindbergh was awarded numerous medals and honors in recognition of his achievement. One of the most prominent medals he received was the Medal of Honor, the highest military award presented by the United States for personal acts of valor above and beyond the call of duty. The movie focuses on the events leading up to Lindbergh's famous flight and his unwavering determination and perseverance to achieve his dream. It highlights the many challenges and obstacles he faced, from dealing with harsh weather conditions to convincing potential investors of his vision. As Lindbergh moved closer to realizing his goal, he overcame financial setbacks and technical problems to eventually purchase the plane, \\"The Spirit of St. Louis.\\" These achievements and setbacks, rather than any specific medals found by Lindbergh, form the basis of the movie's narrative. The film serves as an inspiring portrayal of Lindbergh's journey, demonstrating that persistence and dedication can lead to incredible outcomes. As a result, the movie can be considered an investment worth considering if the potential audience appreciates historical biographical stories that emphasize the triumph of the human spirit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He is a successful businessman, owning a majority of local businesses and employing a large workforce. His philanthropic efforts have made a significant difference in the lives of the townspeople, earning him admiration and affection. One day, a mysterious stranger arrives in town, calling himself Carlos. He has an eerie familiarity with Ignacio, which disturbs Ignacio and causes him to question the man's intention. Carlos shows an unusual interest in Ignacio's personal and professional life and soon befriends several townspeople. Act II: Carlos subtly manipulates conversations and events to cast doubt on Ignacio's character and trustworthiness. Whispers of suspicion start to spread, but many residents remain fiercely loyal to Ignacio. As tensions grow, Ignacio's daughter, Isabella, returns home from studying abroad. She is eager to reconnect with her father but unwittingly becomes close friends with Carlos. Carlos confides in Isabella and reveals a dark, hidden secret: Ignacio was once a notorious crime boss known as \\"El Lobo\\" responsible for a series of high-profile heists and brutal crimes. He had staged his death and reemerged as the admired Ignacio, having left all criminal ties behind. Act III: Overwhelmed by this revelation, Isabella confronts her father.

Carlos, realizing that Ignacio's transformation is genuine, unexpectedly helps Ignacio make the sacrifice and also surrenders to the authorities, finally finding closure. The town is left to grapple with the truth and reconciles with the knowledge that Ignacio, though flawed, genuinely cared for his community. Isabella, having discovered her father's true nature, comes to forgive him and carries on his philanthropic work, ensuring his legacy lives on through love and compassion.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person that said Solti is tense at rehearsals?, using the article: In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. Let me explain both questions separately. 1. Why does the Indian Government need Rs 2000 notes? The Indian Government introduced the 2000-rupee note to replace the older 1000-rupee note. The main reason was to improve the money management in the country. Imagine you have a big piggy bank, but you can only save coins. Now think of having a bigger piggy bank where you can save bigger coins or even notes. The Rs 2000 note is like that bigger piggy bank. It helps people save more money in less space and makes it easier for everyone to carry. 2. How do people with narcissistic personality disorder choose whom to marry? Narcissistic personality disorder is like when someone loves themselves a lot and thinks they are very important. These people may choose their life partners based on how the other person makes them feel or how they think the other person will make them look even more important.

He was the eldest son of Benjamin and Elizabeth Conacher, and the third of ten children overall. He had four brothers and five sisters. Conacher scored the first goal in Pirates history on American Thanksgiving Day Thursday November 26, 1925, against the Boston Bruins. He scored nine goals in 33 games in 1925-26, then returned to Toronto to play professional baseball with the Toronto Maple Leafs. An outfielder on the team, Conacher and the Maple Leafs won the International League championship then defeated the Louisville Colonels to win the Little World Series.  He returned to Pittsburgh for the 1926-27 NHL season, but was dealt early in the year to the New York Americans in exchange for Charlie Langlois and 2,000. The trade nearly proved disastrous for Conacher. He scored 8 goals in 1926-27 and improved to 11 in 1927-28, but playing for a team owned by notorious bootlegger Bill Dwyer resulted in his becoming a heavy drinker. Conacher served as player-coach in 1929-30, but his play and health had deteriorated. Two events in that off-season saved Conacher: he swore off alcohol completely upon the birth of his first child, and his playing rights were sold to the Montreal Maroons.  Conacher periodically struggled with Montreal, and at one point was placed on waivers with no other team willing to take over his contract. Nonetheless, his overall play and point totals increased for three consecutive seasons with the Maroons, peaking at 28 points in 1932-33. He was named to the Second All-Star Team that season, but was traded to the Chicago Black Hawks in exchange for Teddy Graham. Conacher was a key figure in the club's first-ever Stanley Cup victory that season. He finished second to the Canadiens' Aurel Joliat in the voting for the Hart Trophy and earned a spot on the NHL's First All-Star Team.  On Wednesday October 3, 1934, Conacher was involved in one of the largest transactions in league history. He was dealt to the Montreal Canadiens, along with Leroy Goldsworthy and Roger Jenkins in exchange for Montreal superstar Howie Morenz, Lorne Chabot and Marty Burke. The deal was only part of a series of trades involving four teams that represented one of the biggest deals in NHL history. Immediately following the Chicago trade, Conacher was sent back to the Maroons, along with Herb Cain, in exchange for the rights to Nelson Crutchfield. Conacher spent his last three NHL seasons with the Maroons and won his second Stanley Cup in 1935. He ended his hockey career after the team was eliminated from the playoffs by the New York Rangers on April 23, 1937. That final year he was runner-up to Babe Siebert in the 1937 Hart Trophy voting and was placed on the NHL Second All-Star Team.

As the Sultan leaves, the trail of a burrowing rabbit crosses the desert towards the cave. Hassan spots the burrow tunneling under the entrance of the cave and attempts to chase out the intruders, but has trouble remembering the command to open the door. Inside the cave, Bugs Bunny and his traveling companion Daffy Duck emerge from the burrow, believing they have arrived at Pismo Beach. Daffy's complaints about travelling underground (\\"What a way for a duck to travel; underground!\\") and that they're at the wrong place are silenced when he spots the riches. Determined to keep it all for himself, he stomps repeatedly on Bugs to force him back into the burrow. Meanwhile, Hassan finally says the correct command to open the door and marches in. He is met by Daffy, who is wheeling a cart full of loot. Mistaking Hassan for a \\"redcap\\" (porter), Daffy asks him to call a cab. In response, Hassan brings his sword down on Daffy's head, splitting in half both the diamond-adorned hat he is wearing and a single feather underneath. Daffy chuckles nervously before he flees in terror and uses a large gem to try bribing Bugs into saving him, but Bugs is only concerned with dusting himself off from the earlier abuse from Daffy. Hassan rushes towards them both, sword raised. Daffy hides and tells Hassan to chop the rabbit, but Bugs has disguised himself to be a genie in a bottle and fools Hassan with a rich offer for releasing him. Hassan does, taking no notice of Daffy's attempt to expose Bugs. Bugs tells Hassan the treasure is his to claim. Daffy sardonically mocks Bugs for allowing Hassan access to the treasure he wanted for himself. Outside the cave, Bugs surveys the desert and concludes he is in the wrong place. Suddenly, Daffy runs out of the cave carrying a large gem. Hassan is in hot pursuit, enraged over the duck's efforts to lay claim to the treasure. Daffy begs Bugs to save him,...

Melania Trump, the former model and reluctant first lady, often lets her fashion choices do the talking for her.      Since her belated move into the White House in June, Melania Trump hasn’t yet announced an issue, or even an area of interest, for which she plans to advocate from her powerful platform. She has made few public speeches or statements, beyond introductions at campaign rallies she attends with her husband. But she’s dutifully stepped into the silent role of enhancing her husband by appearing impeccably and appropriately dressed by his side.      Story Continued Below      “Classy and conservative,” were the reviews from the local Saudi Arabian press after the first lady landed in Riyadh last spring dressed in a black, belted jumpsuit. The deep red Christian Dior “bar suit” she wore to visit Paris for Bastille Day in July was deemed to be a culturally appropriate choice highlighting an icon of French fashion.      But on Tuesday, she appeared to put the wrong foot forward when she boarded Marine One, en route to visit emergency responders in hurricane-ravaged Texas, wearing towering black snakeskin stilettos.      The emblematic first image of the first lady heading off to visit a hurricane in heels — a moment that the president has seized on as an opportunity to project strength and show off decisive leadership — instead became another symbol of a White House that can often seem out of touch.

Lisa Kline, who worked as a stylist to vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin during the 2008 election, said in an interview she thought “it was a mistake in the message it relays. A lot of eyes were on them. They’re going to a devastated area. She should be dressed accordingly.”      The heels at least temporarily stole the spotlight from a gloomy president who aides said has been buoyed by what he sees, so far, as an effective coordinated response to a record-breaking storm.      “Tan suit looks pretty good today, doesn’t it?” Valerie Jarrett, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama, tweeted, referring to the Republican outcry over Obama’s summer look to discuss serious national security issues at a news conference in 2014.      Former first lady Michelle Obama also created her own fashion scandal in 2009, when she wore a pair of 540 Lanvin sneakers to volunteer at a food bank in Washington.      “Small gestures send big messages,” journalist Jamil Smith wrote on Twitter, regarding the first lady’s shoe choice. “It isn’t that they keep getting it wrong. They don’t care about getting it right.”      On board Air Force One to Corpus Christi, as the picture of the delicate heels ricocheted across the Internet, Melania Trump changed into a pair of bright, white sneakers, which looked fresh out of the box.      She wasn’t the only female member of the Trump delegation wearing footwear that raised eyebrows — two other women were spotted on Air Force One wearing pumps and suede heels.      The debate over the first lady’s shoes wasn’t an isolated fashion faux pas for the women who act as the face of the Trump administration.      A week after her father’s inauguration in January, Ivanka Trump posted a picture of herself wearing a 5,000 silver Carolina Herrera gown — the same night protests erupted at airports across the country over Trump’s executive order banning refugees from majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States.      People close to the first daughter said at the time she felt “terrible” about the dissonance between the image projected from her Kalorama mansion and the painful photographs of refugees being detained at international airports. But the picture still lives on her public Instagram account, where it has been applauded with more than 266,000 “likes.”      Louise Linton, the wife of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, seemed to relish her distance from the average, middle-class American woman when she posted a Jackie O.-inspired snap of herself on Instagram, while accompanying her husband on a “day trip” to Kentucky earlier this month aboard a government plane. In the photo, Linton tagged all of the designer labels she was sporting, including her Hermes scarf and her Valentino rockstud heels.      She then lashed out with snide vitriol at a mother of three from Oregon who expressed distaste at her public post. An apology came later, via a crisis-managing publicist, in which Linton called the post and her comments “highly insensitive.”      There was no acknowledgment from the White House that the first lady’s storm attire was at all off-key. Instead, her staff blamed the media for creating a “sad” side circus to an otherwise somber day.      “It’s sad that we have an active and ongoing natural disaster in Texas,” said Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for the first lady, “and people are worried about her shoes.”      Later Tuesday, the first lady’s office released a statement on the storm. “I want to be able to offer my help and support in the most productive way possible, not through just words, but also action,” the first lady said. “What I found to be the most profound during the visit was not only the strength and resilience of the people of Texas, but the compassion and sense of community that has taken over the state. My thoughts and prayers continue to be with the people of Texas and Louisiana.” ||||| Vanessa Friedman ON THE RUNWAY      When is a shoe not just a shoe?      When it is a pair of very high, needle-thin heels worn by the first lady of the United States on her way to the site of a natural disaster. Then it becomes a symbol for what many see as the disconnect between the Trump administration and reality; another example of the way in which this president and his family continue to define “appropriate” their own way; and an excuse for partisan name-calling.      Or so became apparent Tuesday morning when President Trump and his wife left the White House to fly to Texas for a briefing on the devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey, and Mrs. Trump appeared on the lawn in black pegged trousers, black shades, an olive green bomber jacket — and her stilettos, now a trademark. Very much the same kind of shoes, in other words, she has been wearing since long before she joined her husband on the campaign trail.      Though by the time the plane had landed Mrs. Trump looked altogether more grounded, in white sneakers and crisp white shirt, with a ponytail pulled through a black baseball cap emblazoned with the word “FLOTUS,” during her time in the air the original shoes went from being mere footwear to objects of vilification thanks to social media’s specific kind of alchemy.      Nothing says I'm in touch with the people like... https://t.co/ZD6cEfG0LS — Todd Stashwick (@ToddStashwick) August 29, 2017      In response to the critical reaction, Stephanie Grisham, Mrs. Trump’s communications director, emailed the following statement: “It’s sad that we have an active and ongoing natural disaster in Texas, and people are worried about her shoes.”      The president and Mrs. Trump arriving in Corpus Christi, Tex., on Tuesday. Doug Mills / The New York Times      That’s a fair point, to a certain extent. Certainly there was a backlash to the backlash, with Chelsea Handler, for example, being attacked in turn for her tweet attacking Mrs. Trump’s spikes.      Not to mention some partisan crowing about the sneakers.      Look at that - Melania in Jeans/Sneakers - Fake News Strikes Out again. Thank you POTUS & FLOTUS for showing support to the people of TX! pic.twitter.com/vqLw727ISy — DARSAVMO (@darsavmo) August 29, 2017      But to dismiss all this as merely much ado about heels, or an example of the pettiness of our divided electorate, is to ignore the reality of the current conversation around the president — to pretend not to notice how sensitized everyone has become to his unpredictable reactions to major events, and to deny the power of the telling detail to invite applause, condemnation or misinterpretation.      It is precisely the superficial nature of clothing, the fact that garments are immediately accessible to all, that makes them the go-to stand-in for more nuanced, complicated emotions and issues.      Mrs. Trump’s heels, after all — they appear to be classic Manolo Blahniks — are redolent of a certain clichéd kind of femininity: decorative, impractical, expensive, elitist (all adjectives often associated with the brand “Trump”).      That they also are part of the identity the first lady brought to Washington — that her comfort level and ability to walk in exactly the kind of shoes that cause other women, wearing more solid shoes, to wince and crunch their toes in imaginary pain was part of her narrative and image from the start — does not obviate the fact that they have also come to represent her remove, for both good and ill. Women in the capital are generally more associated with sensible pumps than teetering patent leather numbers.      This Mrs. Trump understands, which is why she changed into a more suitable costume (I use that word deliberately) for her arrival in Corpus Christi, Tex. The problem is that, as first lady, in an environment as fraught as the current one, there is no such thing as offstage. Even boarding a plane becomes a quasi-official moment in which all messaging, spoken or assumed, is mined for meaning.      Mrs. Trump clearly knows this to a certain extent and has accepted it as an exigency of her job; how else to interpret the Dolce & Gabbana black lace coat and veil she wore to visit the pope on the president’s first foreign tour, or the classic red Dior suit she chose for her arrival in France for Bastille Day? Or the fact that, while hosting Akie Abe, the first lady of Japan, on Mrs. Abe’s visit to Mar-a-Lago, she wore flat sandals for their tour of the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens? (When in Florida. ...)      The sharp point of the stilettos is that this kind of proactive analysis needs to be applied as consistently as possible across all public appearances (which, when you are in the White House, is all appearances).      In Mrs. Trump’s job, as in her husband’s, details matter. Even shoes. Put your best foot forward, and all that. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a short and simple explanation of something.

(A) glass window (B) rubber band A:","output":"The answer your students should choose for this logic test is (B) rubber band. The scenario presented in the test involves Bill dropping a rock onto a glass window and a rubber band. The question asks which object will not break as a result. When analyzing the potential outcomes of these two distinct materials reacting to the impact of a rock, we can consider their inherent properties and typical behavior. 1. Glass Window: Glass is a rigid, brittle material that is commonly known to be prone to breaking or shattering upon impact, especially when subjected to considerable force. In this case, the force exerted by a rock falling onto the glass window could very likely cause it to break, particularly if the area of impact is a weak point in the structure of the glass. 2. Rubber Band: Rubber, on the other hand, is a flexible, elastic material that possesses the ability to stretch and deform in response to applied forces. Due to its elastic nature, a rubber band is more capable of absorbing and dispersing the force of a falling rock without breaking. It can handle the impact by deforming, and then returning to its original shape after the force has been removed. Based on this comparative analysis of the two materials, it is reasonable to deduce that the rubber band would be more likely to remain intact and not break when placed under the force of a falling rock. Consequently, the correct logical answer your students should choose is option (B) rubber band, since it is the object that would not break in this scenario."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The country is an important American ally that boasts cutting-edge architecture, including a vertical disc-shaped office building and the world's tallest tower. Black's daughter, Jessica Beasley, said she is concerned about her father's health in jail and believes any inappropriate pictures that the Athens, Georgia, man may have taken were unintentional. Photographing or filming restricted areas can be punishable by fines and jail time under OPTIONS: - American law. - Athens law. - Black law. - Georgia law. - Gulf law. - Jessica Beasley law. - Robert Alan Black law. - US Embassy law. - United Arab Emirates law.","output":"Photographing or filming restricted areas can be punishable by fines and jail time under United Arab Emirates law. This legal restriction serves to protect sensitive sites and maintain security within the country. As a visitor to the UAE, it is important to be aware of these laws and abide by them to avoid legal consequences. The United Arab Emirates, particularly in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, is known for its iconic and modern architectural marvels. However, certain areas are deemed off-limits for photography by the government due to their strategic or sensitive nature. These may include military installations, government buildings, transportation facilities like airports, and other critical national infrastructure. In the case of Robert Alan Black, the 70-year-old American architect who was arrested for taking photographs of a restricted area, it is essential to remember that ignorance of the law is not an acceptable defense. As a foreigner visiting another country, individuals must adhere to the laws and customs of that nation. Jessica Beasley, the daughter of the detained American, expressed worry about her father's health while in jail and insisted that any inappropriate pictures taken by him were unintentional. This story highlights the importance of understanding and complying with local laws and regulations while traveling, as failure to do so might lead to unintended legal consequences and personal distress. Apart from the United Arab Emirates, many countries have specific rules regarding photography and filming of certain sites. Before traveling, it is crucial for individuals to familiarize themselves with these laws to ensure a smooth and trouble-free trip. In some cases, special permission or permits may be required to photograph or film particular areas. In conclusion, respecting and adhering to the laws and customs of the countries we visit is not only crucial for our personal safety and well-being but also reflects well on our role as responsible global citizens. By remaining informed and cautious, we can appreciate and admire the beauty and culture of foreign places without compromising their security or privacy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - air - atlanta - georgia - countryside - landscape Answer:","output":"The given question is: He went to visit his brother going to a Bulldog school in the south, the humidity was intense but seemed plain and ordinary by now to his brother where? We have five options to choose from: 1. Air: This option does not provide a specific location where the brother is. Air simply refers to the atmosphere or general environment, which is not relevant to the question asked. 2. Atlanta: Atlanta is a major city in the southern United States, located in the state of Georgia. Atlanta is well-known for its humid subtropical climate, which features hot, muggy summers and mild winters. However, the connection to a Bulldog school is not clearly established in this option. 3. Georgia: Georgia is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States and has a humid subtropical climate typical of the region. The University of Georgia, a public research university in the city of Athens, is often referred to as a Bulldog School since the Georgia Bulldogs are its athletic teams. This option seems to be the most in line with common sense as it combines the elements of location, the Bulldog reference, and the climate mentioned in the question. 4. Countryside: Countryside refers to a rural or non-urban area that is typically characterized by open landscapes, natural beauty, and agricultural or pastoral activities. While this option could provide a type of environment that the brother is experiencing, it doesn't provide a specific location and is not directly related to the Bulldog reference. 5. Landscape: Landscape refers to the visual appearance of an area of land, including its physical features, human-made elements, and the way these components are arranged. Like the first option, \\"air,\\" this option does not provide a specific location and is not relevant to the question asked. Considering the factors mentioned in the question, such as the Bulldog school reference and the humid climate, the option that is most in line with common sense would be Georgia. This is because Georgia is not only home to the University of Georgia, commonly referred to as a Bulldog School, but it also experiences a humid subtropical climate typical of the southern United States. Additionally, Atlanta, the capital city of Georgia, further strengthens the connection between the question and the state.

'Mother Robin' wins CNN Hero of the Year Lim wins CNN's Hero of the Year Los Angeles (CNN) -- Robin Lim, an American woman who has helped thousands of poor Indonesian women have a healthy pregnancy and birth, was named the 2011 CNN Hero of the Year on Sunday night. Through her Yayasan Bumi Sehat health clinics, \\"Mother Robin,\\" or \\"Ibu Robin\\" as she is called by the locals, offers free prenatal care, birthing services and medical aid in Indonesia, where many families cannot afford care. \\"Every baby's first breath on Earth could be one of peace and love. Every mother should be healthy and strong. Every birth could be safe and loving. But our world is not there yet,\\" Lim said during \\"CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,\\" which took place at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles and recognized Lim and the other top 10 CNN Heroes of 2011. Many women in the developing world do not have access to contraception or maternal care. According to the United Nations Population Fund, three out of five women giving birth in South Asia do so without a skilled birth attendant on hand. In Indonesia, the average family earns the equivalent of 8 a day, according to the International Monetary Fund. But a baby delivery costs about 70 at a hospital, and a Caesarian section can cost as much as 700. Lim believes Indonesia's high maternal and infant mortality rates are caused in part by these costs, which many women cannot meet. \\"The situation is bad ... babies are unattended, deliveries have become commercialized, and mothers die from hemorrhage after childbirth because they can't afford proper care,\\" Lim told CNN earlier this year. The CNN Hero of the Year was chosen by the public after an 11-week vote on CNN.com. For being named Hero of the Year, Lim will receive 250,000 for her cause. That's in addition to the 50,000 that she and the rest of the top 10 Heroes each received for making the top 10. This is the fifth year that CNN, with the help of entertainers and other celebrities, have honored everyday people changing the world. Among this year's presenters were comedians Jerry Seinfeld and George Lopez; actors J.R. Martinez and Chris Colfer; musical artists Ice Cube and will.i.am; model Christy Turlington Burns; former NFL quarterback Kurt Warner; and actresses Laura Dern, Mary-Louise Parker and Sofia Vergara. (Photos: Scenes from the night) Kid Rock performed the song \\"Care\\" from his platinum-selling album \\"Born Free,\\" while Miley Cyrus sang her triple-platinum hit \\"The Climb.\\" Turlington Burns introduced Lim's video tribute during Sunday's show, before the Hero of the Year announcement. As founder of Every Mother Counts, she is also a passionate advocate for maternal health around the world. \\"Eight years ago, after giving birth to my first child Grace, I felt what could have been a life-threatening complication,\\" she told the audience of nearly 5,000. \\"It suddenly got very scary, very fast. If I hadn't received the expert care in the hospital birthing center I was in, then I may have not been so fortunate. \\"My wish is that every mother all over the world has the same chance surviving childbirth I had. My friend Robin Lim shares that wish and she spends her days and nights making it so.\\" Photos: See how Lim helps thousands of women Turlington Burns recently made the trip to Indonesia to meet Lim and see her work firsthand. Lim became a midwife after her sister -- and her sister's baby -- died from complications during childbirth several years ago. She and her husband then sold their home in Hawaii and moved to Bali to \\"reinvent their lives,\\" she said. \\"It was there she learned she could make a difference,\\" Turlington Burns said. \\"She opened a clinic, Bumi Sehat, so poor mothers can give birth safely and be treated with dignity and respect. She has delivered thousands of babies, and that is why they call her 'Ibu' -- Mother.\\" After being announced as the CNN Hero of the Year, a tearful Lim accepted the award from host Anderson Cooper and made an impassioned plea for help. \\"Today on our Earth, 981 mothers in the prime of their life will die -- and tomorrow again and yesterday,\\" she said. \\"And I'm asking you to help change that. We don't even know how many babies are lost, but all of us can help change that.\\" Miss the show? Don't worry, you can catch it later this month.

Article: When I was nine years old, I loved to go fishing with my dad. But the only thing that wasn't very fun about it was that he could catch many fish while I couldn't catch anything. I usually got pretty upset and kept asking him why. He always answered, \\"Son, if you want to catch a fish, you have to think like a fish\\", I remember being even more upset then because, \\"I'm not a fish!\\" I didn't know how to think like a fish. Besides, I reasoned, how could what I think influence what a fish does? As I got a little older I began to understand what my dad really meant. So, I read some books on fish. And I even joined the local fishing club and started attending the monthly meetings. I learned that a fish is a cold-blooded animal and therefore is very sensitive to water temperature. That is why fish prefer shallow water to deep water because the former is warmer. Besides, water is usually warmer in direct sunlight than in the shade. Yet, fish don't have any eyelids  and the sun huts their eyes... The more I understood fish, the more I became effective at finding and catching them.. When I grew up and entered the business world, I remember hearing my first boss say, \\"We all need to think like sales people.\\" But it didn't completely make sense. My dad never once said, \\"If you want to catch a fish you need to think like a fisherman.\\" What he said was, \\"You need to think like a fish.\\" Years later, with great efforts to promote long-term services to people much older and richer than me, I gradually learned what we all need is to think more like customers. It is not an easy job. I will show you how in the following chapters.

With zero debate, they adopted a party platform that includes support for a widely discredited form of mental health \\"treatment\\" known as \\"reparative therapy.\\" Also called \\"conversion therapy,\\" this dangerous pseudo-medical practice aimed at transforming homosexuals into heterosexuals has been widely demonstrated to be both ineffective and harmful, not to mention offensive. The clearly misguided assumption underlying such therapy is the belief (often reinforced by self-serving interpretations of any number of religious texts) that homosexuality is a disease. However, much like drapetomania (the pseudo-scientific \\"disease\\" an enterprising white man conveniently identified in the mid-19th century was described as the condition that led black slaves to attempt escape), homosexuality is in fact not an illness, but rather a fact of human nature. And rejecting human nature can have devastating effects on the psyche, demonstrating that if there is a real disease that needs fixing here, it's homophobia, not homosexuality. By explicitly supporting such pseudo-therapy, the OPTIONS: - American Medical has done more than simply turn a blind eye to science and the potentially deadly consequences of the negative attitudes and self-hatred that such \\"treatments\\" reinforce. - Melody Moezzi has done more than simply turn a blind eye to science and the potentially deadly consequences of the negative attitudes and self-hatred that such \\"treatments\\" reinforce. - Moezzi has done more than simply turn a blind eye to science and the potentially deadly consequences of the negative attitudes and self-hatred that such \\"treatments\\" reinforce. - Psychiatric has done more than simply turn a blind eye to science and the potentially deadly consequences of the negative attitudes and self-hatred that such \\"treatments\\" reinforce. - Republicans has done more than simply turn a blind eye to science and the potentially deadly consequences of the negative attitudes and self-hatred that such \\"treatments\\" reinforce. - Texas has done more than simply turn a blind eye to science and the potentially deadly consequences of the negative attitudes and self-hatred that such \\"treatments\\" reinforce. - Texas GOP has done more than simply turn a blind eye to science and the potentially deadly consequences of the negative attitudes and self-hatred that such \\"treatments\\" reinforce. - World Health Organization has done more than simply turn a blind eye to science and the potentially deadly consequences of the negative attitudes and self-hatred that such \\"treatments\\" reinforce. - drapetomania has done more than simply turn a blind eye to science and the potentially deadly consequences of the negative attitudes and self-hatred that such \\"treatments\\" reinforce.","output":"So, some people in Texas who are part of a big group called Republicans decided that they know more about people's feelings and who they love than big important groups like the World Health Organization and the American Medical group. They said they support something called \\"reparative therapy,\\" which is kind of like a fake treatment that some people think can change who someone loves. But those important groups I mentioned earlier say that this therapy is not good and can actually hurt people. You see, some people think that liking someone of the same gender is not normal and is like being sick, but that's not true. It's just a part of how some people are. Imagine if someone told you that liking ice cream is a disease and you needed to be \\"cured\\" - that would be pretty silly, right?  The people in Texas who support this fake treatment are not looking at the real science and they might even be making things worse for those who they want to \\"cure.\\" It's important to remember that everyone is different and it's okay to love whomever you want.

Context: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump disclosed in a financial report filed with the government’s ethics watchdog Tuesday that he had reimbursed his personal lawyer more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses. In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties. Trump listed several hundred million dollars in liabilities in his financial report. Critics seized on... Question: Why are critics accusing Trump of a violation?

'The food was delivered quick and OMG was it good!': Expressing the quality of food and the service. The use of the phrase \\"OMG was it good!\\" is exclamatory and indicates strong positive feelings towards the food. 5. 'I will definitely come back again!!!

The group achieved commercial success in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with its first two albums Skid Row (1989) and Slave to the Grind (1991) certified multi-platinum, the latter of which reached number one on the Billboard 200. The band's third album Subhuman Race (1995) was also critically acclaimed, but failed to repeat the success of its predecessors. During this period, the band consisted of bassist Rachel Bolan, guitarists Dave Sabo and Scotti Hill, drummer Rob Affuso, and frontman Sebastian Bach. After the Slave to the Grind promotional tour, an EP of covers B-Side Ourselves was released in September 1992. Before a third album could be recorded, Skid Row took an extended hiatus in 1993 on McGhee's recommendation to wait for the grunge movement to fade away. For some time, Skid Row parted ways with Wagener, possibly due to the music taking a different direction for the follow-up to Slave to the Grind. In 1994, the band returned to the studio with producer Bob Rock to record its third album. Subhuman Race was released in March 1995, and charted in the top 40 on the American charts. Although it did not achieve the success of its predecessors, it charted one single in the US and received positive reviews.  At that point, the band shifted to performing at smaller venues and its videos were rarely played on MTV, partly because of the rise in popularity of grunge and subsequent decline of many 1980s heavy metal styles. Skid Row was the opening act for Van Halen on its North American leg of the tour. Eventually, Bach left the band in late 1996 after an argument with Bolan who turned down an opening slot on the Kiss reunion tour even though Bach already booked it. Other band members told Bach that Skid Row was too big for an opening act and that they were not going to do the show. Bach then left a message on a bandmate's answering machine telling them the band was never too big to open for Kiss.  Bolan had a side project, a punk band Prunella Scales who was playing at the same time as the planned Kiss show. The rift between Bach and the other band members subsequently led to him leaving Skid Row. Four years later, Skid Row was one of the opening acts for the 2000 Kiss Farewell Tour. In 1998 Skid Row released the compilation 40 Seasons: The Best of Skid Row. After Bach's departure, the remaining members continued as Ozone Monday with singer Shawn McCabe of Mars Needs Women. In 1998 and 1999, the group opened up for Kiss and Motley Crue under the new moniker.

Having recently given birth to her beautiful baby, Emily was filled with both joy and anxiety as she faced the challenges that came with early motherhood. She found it all overwhelming – the sleepless nights, the numerous diaper changes, and the daunting responsibility of keeping her baby safe and healthy. Mary, a trusted friend and experienced mother, was the perfect person for Emily to turn to for assistance. Having already gone through the ups and downs of raising a child, Mary was well-equipped to offer timely advice and share valuable tips to make Emily's life easier. Firstly, Mary provided Emily with guidance on how to establish a routine for her baby. This included structuring feeding times, coordinating naps, and creating some semblance of a daily schedule. Emily soon learned that consistency and predictability were crucial, not only for her baby's well-being but also for managing her own expectations and sanity as a mother. Secondly, Mary encouraged Emily to pay close attention to her baby's cues and needs and respond promptly. As they spent more time together observing the baby, Emily became more attuned to understanding her baby's cries, recognizing when the baby was hungry or needed a diaper change - all of which contributed to building a strong bond between mother and child. Additionally, Mary familiarized Emily with essential baby care tasks, such as proper bathing techniques, dressing and swaddling, and even the best ways to soothe a fussy baby. Under Mary's gentle guidance, Emily began to feel more confident in her ability to nurture and take care of her precious newborn. Moreover, Mary helped Emily to understand the importance of self-care during her journey as a new mother. She reminded Emily that taking care of herself, both physically and emotionally, would allow her to be the best parent possible for her child. Mary shared techniques such as mindfulness meditation to help Emily manage stress and anxiety, and also encouraged her to reach out to other mothers, friends, and family members for emotional support when needed. Lastly, Mary served as an invaluable resource for Emily about the various milestones, growth stages, and development patterns that her baby would soon go through. Emily gained a clear understanding of what to expect in the coming months - from teething to crawling to walking - and felt more prepared to handle each phase with grace and confidence. In conclusion, Emily asking Mary for help with the baby after coming home proved to be an excellent decision as it allowed her to gain valuable knowledge, skills, and assurance in her new role as a mother.

(A parody of Wallace Wimple and his wife \\"Sweetie Face\\".) The scene cuts to Daffy eating corn while singing \\"I Dream of Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair\\" minding his business. A shadow of Meek is show getting ready to chop off Daffy's head. Then he jumps and shouts \\"WATCH IT, BUB!!!\\" directly in his face. After a brief talk to Meek, he flicks his beak at his face and marches to a hay stack. Meek chops the stack various times and on the last chop, he thinks he kills the duck. Daffy fakes his death by squirting ketchup and throwing his feathers around (\\"You crushed my little head!\\") This fools Meek by pretending he is beheaded and runs rapidly. Meek feels sad and goes back to his house, where Daffy is seen putting lots of sugar cubes into a cup of coffee. Meek guiltily tells him that he has killed a duck. Daffy cheers up Meek into giving him a cup of coffee and asks how many lumps (of sugar) his wife usually gives him. Meek shows Daffy a 'lump' (a bump on his head), and Daffy hits him on the head (giving him another 'lump') and pours cream on it. Daffy dances on the cakes and pies, singing \\"Shortening Bread\\", and Meek immediately recognizes the duck he thought he killed (\\"Say.

His date grows increasingly bored and disgruntled by Bradley's refusal to leave, until she finally walks out on him, which doesn't bother him in the slightest. An unidentified man sees her leave, and presumably upset over the disrespect shown towards the young woman, he follows Bradley to a bar where he confronts him with a knife. After a brief struggle, Bradley manages to turn the weapon against the man and kills him. Even though he killed in self defense, Bradley immediately flees the scene knowing the Thai authorities will arrest him and probally sentence him to death for the killing as a result of being a foreigner in their country.The next day, Bradley begins his trip deep into the rain forest first by traveling by train to a point several hundred miles north of Bangkok. At the train's stop, John rents a canoe and a guide to take him down a nearby river towards the Burma border. Still fearing that he'll be captured by the Thai authorities, he pays off the man to not mention their encounter. After rowing a ways and taking several wildlife photos, Bradley's guide, Tuan, mentions his concerns about traveling so far down river, which he reports as being dangerous. Bradley agrees to head back after one more day of traveling.That evening, Bradley falls asleep, and when he awakes the next day, he finds Tuan dead with an arrow in his throat.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Biodiversity is determined by many things, and one of them is abiotic stress. If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh.  I am facing a new situation today: Henry is currently writing a research paper for his biology class. The subject of the paper is abiotic stress. For his paper, he is analyzing two different forests of differing stress levels and writing about the differences seen in the environments. For the area with a low level of stress Henry chose the Narshe Forest, located near the mountains of Harkal. The area of high stress that Henry will be looking at is the Midgar forest. After choosing the two areas, Henry feels he deserves a break from his paper and goes to watch a baseball game.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Will the animal population be higher or lower in the Midgar forest? A:","output":"The animal population will likely be lower in the Midgar forest due to the higher level of abiotic stress in that area. As mentioned in the background article, when abiotic stress increases, biodiversity and the number of species tend to decrease.

Information:  - Montenegro (or or ; Montenegrin: \\"Crna Gora\\" /   , meaning \\"Black Mountain\\") is a sovereign state in Southeastern Europe. It has a coast on the Adriatic Sea to the south-west and is bordered by Croatia to the west, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the northwest, Serbia to the northeast, Kosovo to the east, and Albania to the south-east. Its capital and largest city is Podgorica, while Cetinje is designated as the Old Royal Capital (\\"prijestonica\\").  - Serbia, officially the Republic of Serbia, is a sovereign state situated at the crossroads of Central and Southeast Europe, covering the southern part of the Pannonian Plain and the central Balkans. Relative to its small territory, it is a diverse country distinguished by a \\"transitional\\" character, situated along cultural, geographic, climatic and other boundaries. Serbia is landlocked and borders Hungary to the north; Romania and Bulgaria to the east; Macedonia to the south; and Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Montenegro to the southwest; it also claims a border with Albania through the disputed territory of Kosovo. Serbia numbers around 7 million residents, and its capital, Belgrade, ranks among the largest cities in Southeast Europe.  - Music theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music.   - \\"Onamo, 'namo!\\" (Serbian Cyrillic: , '!) also known as the Serbian Marseillaise ( ) was a popular anthem in Montenegro in the late 19th to early 20th century. The royal state anthem of Montenegro at the time was To Our Beautiful Montenegro, while the education anthem was the Hymn to Saint Sava.  - Ubavoj nam Crnoj Gori ( Serbian :     , English : To Our Beautiful Montenegro ) was the national and state anthem of the Kingdom of Montenegro in the late 19th - early 20th century . A popular song called Onamo , ' namo ! ( There , o'er There ! ) also existed . The educational system had an honorific song , the Hymn to Saint Sava , which was sung in the Saint 's honour . The lyrics were made in 1865 by the Serb poet and a priest named Jovan Sundei , who was the secretary of Prince Nikola I of Montenegro . The music was composed by Jovo Ivaniševi , drawing from \`\` Uskliknimo s ljubavlju '' , hymn to Saint Sava and later adapted by Anton Schulz . The anthem was first performed on October 17 , 1870 , after which Prince Nikola declared it as the state anthem . In 1993 , the anthem was one of the proposals during the unsuccessful negotiations to adopt an Anthem of the Republic of Montenegro . The main problem was its monarchist lyrics .  - A national anthem (also state anthem, national hymn, national song etc.) is generally a patriotic musical composition that evokes and eulogizes the history, traditions and struggles of its people, recognized either by a nation's government as the official national song, or by convention through use by the people. The majority of national anthems are either marches or hymns in style. The countries of Latin America tend towards more operatic pieces, while a handful of countries use a simple fanfare.  - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - The Kingdom of Serbia, often rendered as \\"Servia\\" in English sources during the time of its existence, was created when Prince Milan I of Serbia, ruler of the Principality of Serbia, was crowned king in 1882.  - An anthem is a musical composition of celebration, usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the national anthems of countries. Originally, and in music theory and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred choral work and still more particularly to a specific form of Anglican church music.  - Musical composition can refer to an original piece of music, either a song or an instrumental music piece, the structure of a musical piece, or the process of creating or writing a new song or piece of music. People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music. In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist. \\"Composition\\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \\"score\\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers. In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.  - A constitutional monarchy (also known as a parliamentary monarchy) is a form of monarchy in which the sovereign exercises their authorities in accordance with a written or unwritten constitution. Constitutional monarchy differs from absolute monarchy (in which a monarch holds absolute power), in that constitutional monarchs are bound to exercise their powers and authorities within the limits prescribed within an established legal framework. Constitutional monarchies range from countries such as Morocco, where the constitution grants substantial discretionary powers to the sovereign, to countries such as Sweden or Denmark where the monarch retains very few formal authorities.  - The Great National Assembly of the Serb People in Montenegro, known as the Podgorica Assembly ( /Podgorika skupština), was an assembly of the representative body of the Montenegrin people (the Kingdom of Montenegro) in November 1918, after World War I, that was to decide whether Montenegro was to unite with the Kingdom of Serbia. It was organized by a Serbian government committee. The two sides were known as the \\"Greens\\" and the \\"Whites\\", in favour of a confederation (independence) and unification (annexation), respectively. The assembly concluded the decision to merge Montenegro with Serbia. The creation of Yugoslavia followed.  - The Kingdom of Montenegro (Serbian:  a a / \\"Kraljevina Crna Gora\\"), was a monarchy in southeastern Europe, present day Montenegro, during the tumultuous years on the Balkan Peninsula leading up to and during World War I. Legally it was a constitutional monarchy, but absolutist in practice. On 28 November 1918, following the end of World War I, with its government still in exile, the unconstitutional Podgorica Assembly proclaimed union with the Kingdom of Serbia, and was merged into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes three days later, on 1 December 1918.  - Anglican church music is music that is written for liturgical worship in Anglican church services.    What is the relationship between 'ubavoj nam crnoj gori' and 'national anthem'?","output":"\\"Ubavoj nam Crnoj Gori\\", which translates to \\"To Our Beautiful Montenegro\\" in English, was the national and state anthem of the Kingdom of Montenegro in the late 19th and early 20th century. A national anthem is a patriotic musical composition that is generally recognized either by a nation's government as the official national song, or by convention through use by the people.

The U.S. Supreme Court signaled Wednesday it may be open to new limits on the government's ability to track someone's movements by accessing data on that person's cellphone.  A case before the high court could result in a landmark decision in the ongoing debate over civil liberties protections in an era of rapid technological change.  At issue is whether law enforcement will be able to access cellphone data that can reveal a person's whereabouts without having to first obtain a court-issued search warrant.  The case stems from the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. On Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information.  They also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  \\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \\"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\\"  Some of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age.  \\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said.

Answer the following question: Process:  - The body&#x27;s temperature increases over 98.6 degrees F - The hypothalamus in the brain sends a message to the body - Sweat glands in the skin receive the message - The sweat glands start combining water and chemicals to make sweat - The sweat leaves the skin through pores.  suppose during Summer happens, how will it affect less armpit sweats.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation affecting less armpit sweat during summer is indirectly impacting a step of the process.  The body's temperature increases due to the warmer environment in summer, and the hypothalamus sends signals to the body to release sweat to regulate temperature. However, the armpits, which have a high concentration of sweat glands, may not produce as much sweat during summer if certain factors indirectly affect the process: 1. Hydration: During summer, the body needs more water to produce sweat and cool itself down. If a person is dehydrated, it could lead to reduced sweating, including in the armpits. 2. Acclimatization: If an individual has been living in a hot environment for some time, the body adjusts and adapts its cooling system. This might lead to better efficiency in the sweating process and a reduced volume of sweat, including in the armpits. 3. Antiperspirants: Applying antiperspirants to the armpits can block or minimize sweating in that specific area. This effect is indirect since the product interferes with the sweat glands’ response to the hypothalamus signal. 4. Clothing: Wearing loose and breathable clothes during summer can impact the amount of sweat produced. Loose clothes allow air to circulate better, helping sweat evaporate faster and cooling the body more efficiently. This results in less need for sweat production, indirectly affecting the armpit sweat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

From the dilapidated state of LaGuardia's Central Terminal Building to the minimal public transport links and outdated air traffic control system, the metro area's airports are in desperate need of modernization. But now it's time for Biden and other leaders to put their money where their rhetoric is. The Federal Government and local politicians must step up and take sustained action. And the goal should be to fix the problem, not point fingers. Despite its outdated condition, LaGuardia serves 25 million passengers a year. As the closest airport to Manhattan, it is coveted by airlines. As such, the airports serve as a symbol for the entire","output":"nation's infrastructure crisis. The crumbling roads, bridges, and rail systems across the United States not only threaten public safety but also hinder economic growth. If the country is to thrive, both local and federal governments must recognize the urgency of the situation and dedicate resources accordingly. In an extraordinary turn of events, the collective efforts of Vice President Joe Biden, the Federal Government, local politicians, and airline companies initiate a remarkable transformation of LaGuardia Airport. Recognizing the significance of a world-class airport for New York City and the nation, they collaborate to allocate millions of dollars toward the renovation and modernization of the facilities, ultimately aiming to serve the increasing number of passengers and meet the demands of the 21st century. Over the next decade, work begins in earnest to transform not only LaGuardia but also airports across the country, as part of a nationwide infrastructure program. The blueprint for LaGuardia's transformation consists of five key areas: reconstruction of terminals, improved air traffic control systems, increased security measures, enhanced public transportation links, and the establishment of eco-friendly practices. First and foremost, the Central Terminal Building is demolished and replaced with an architecturally stunning, state-of-the-art terminal that features better passenger flow, new amenities, dining facilities, more efficient baggage handling systems, and various accommodations for passengers requiring mobility assistance. This terminal sets the standard for airports globally, showcasing advanced technology and a focus on customer satisfaction. Next, the new air traffic control system is integrated to reduce delays caused by the outdated infrastructure. This, combined with additional runways and the implementation of \\"NextGen\\" satellite-based technology, significantly increases the overall efficiency and capacity of the airport. The security measures at LaGuardia are ramped up, with investments in advanced screening technology, dedicated security personnel, and data-sharing agreements with international partners. This ensures the safety of passengers and staff without infringing on personal privacy too heavily. To promote a more sustainable future, the new LaGuardia incorporates environment-friendly designs, such as solar panels, green roofs, and efficient waste management systems. These initiatives set an example for airports globally, as the aviation industry continues to embrace and invest in green technology. Moreover, the outdated public transportation links are revamped to address concerns and provide more efficient transport options for passengers, including new bus lines, rail systems, and improved roadways. These upgrades greatly ease congestion, minimize environmental impacts, and make traveling in and out of the airport seamless and hassle-free. The renovation of LaGuardia Airport ultimately serves as a catalyst for a nationwide initiative to modernize airports, transportation systems, and public facilities. As a result, the United States witnesses a transformative period that not only enhances passenger experience but also revitalizes the nation's infrastructure. Through the concerted efforts of government and various stakeholders, the dedication of funding, and a shared vision of progress, the story ends with a reinvigorated America boasting a robust, cutting-edge infrastructure network, ready to lead the world in the 21st century."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Assisting Zionist causes Einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which opened in 1925, and was among its first Board of Governors. Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university. He also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs. Among those, he advised first creating an Institute of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land. That should be followed, he suggested, by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology, to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria, which he called an \\"evil\\" that was undermining a third of the country's development. Establishing an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic, for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments, was also important. Chaim Weizmann later became Israel's first president. Upon his death while in office in November 1952 and at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion offered Einstein the position of President of Israel, a mostly ceremonial post. The offer was presented by Israel's ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who explained that the offer \\"embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons\\". Einstein declined, and wrote in his response that he was \\"deeply moved\\", and \\"at once saddened and ashamed\\" that he could not accept it.

This tilt, known as the axial tilt or obliquity, is approximately 23.5 degrees from the perpendicular plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun. This tilting plays a crucial role in the distribution of sunlight and heat across the planet, making it the primary reason behind the differences in energy allotment received by various regions on Earth. The Earth's tilt affects the angle at which sunlight strikes the surface of the planet, which in turn affects the amount of solar energy absorbed by the Earth. When one side of the Earth (Northern or Southern Hemisphere) is tilted towards the Sun, it receives more direct sunlight and experiences the warmer season known as summer. Conversely, when the same hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun, it receives less direct sunlight and goes through the colder season known as winter. During the course of the Earth's annual orbit around the Sun, the variation in energy received by each hemisphere changes gradually, giving rise to transitional seasons – spring and autumn. During spring, the hemisphere gradually tilts towards the Sun, receiving more energy and warming up the temperatures, while in autumn, the hemisphere tilts away from the Sun, receiving less energy and leading to cooler temperatures. In addition to causing seasonal variations, the axial tilt also contributes to the creation of different climate zones on Earth. The planet can be divided into three primary climate zones: 1. Tropical Zone: The area around the equator (between 23.5 degrees North and 23.5 degrees South) is the tropical zone, which receives the highest amount of solar energy. This leads to generally warm temperatures and high humidity throughout the year. 2. Temperate Zone: Located between 23.5 and 66.5 degrees latitude in both hemispheres, the temperate zones have more moderate climate conditions due to the influence of both warm and cold air masses. These regions experience significant variations in temperature and precipitation throughout the year as they go through all four seasons. 3. Polar Zone: The regions near the poles (above 66.5 degrees latitude) fall under the polar zone and experience the lowest amount of solar energy. Extremely cold temperatures, long winters, and brief summers characterize these areas. In summary, Earth's tilt on its axis is the key factor determining the distribution of energy received from the Sun, driving the occurrence of different seasons and creating distinct climate zones on the planet. This axial tilt ensures that sunlight and heat are spread across the Earth's surface unevenly, leading to temperature variations and forming various weather patterns and ecosystems."},{"instruction":"Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Available options: a). No. b). Yes. I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what are social security taxes Suggested answer: The Social Security Administration is headquartered in Woodlawn , Maryland , just west of Baltimore . Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"Social security taxes refer to the taxes paid by employees, employers, and self-employed individuals to fund Social Security programs such as retirement, disability, survivor benefits, and Medicare. It is mandatory for workers, employers, and self-employed individuals in the United States to contribute to this system, which serves as a form of financial protection for individuals and families in times of need. The Social Security Administration (SSA), headquartered in Woodlawn, Maryland (just west of Baltimore), is the United States agency responsible for administering the Social Security programs. While the location of the SSA headquarters is accurate, the suggested answer does not accurately address the question about social security taxes. A more appropriate answer to the question should focus on explaining what social security taxes are and their purpose. For instance: Social security taxes are compulsory contributions made by workers, employers, and self-employed individuals in the United States to the Social Security program. This program, administered by the Social Security Administration, provides financial benefits and support for eligible individuals and their families in various life situations, such as retirement, disability, or the death of a family member contributing to the Social Security system. Social security taxes ensure that the program remains solvent and can continue to provide crucial support to millions of Americans. The funds collected through social security taxes are split into two parts: 1. Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI): This portion of the tax covers retirement, disability, and survivor benefits. Employees and employers each pay 6.2% of the employee's wages, adding up to a total contribution of 12.4%. For self-employed individuals, the entire 12.4% is paid by them as they are considered both the employer and employee. 2. Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI): This part of the tax covers Medicare, a national health insurance program primarily for individuals aged 65 and older. Employees and employers each contribute 1.45% of the employee's wages, totaling 2.9%. Similarly, self-employed individuals pay the entire 2.9% tax. In conclusion, the suggested answer is not sufficient in addressing the question about social security taxes, as it merely provides the location of the Social Security Administration's headquarters. Instead, the answer should focus on explaining the concept of social security taxes, their purpose, and how they are collected and distributed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Four more people have died in the national meningitis outbreak, bringing the death toll to 19, health officials said Wednesday.      The deaths are among the 247 people in 15 states sickened in the outbreak. They all received shots of an apparently contaminated steroid medication made by a Massachusetts specialty pharmacy.      Most of the patients contracted a rare fungal form of meningitis, after getting the shots for back pain over the past few months. Two developed infections from joint injections.      Of the latest deaths, two were in Tennessee and one each was reported in Florida and in Virginia, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday. That brings deaths to eight in Tennessee; three in Florida and Michigan, two in Indiana and Virginia, and one in Maryland.      Test results so far show infections with three kinds of fungus, most of them a form of black mold, the CDC said. Of 42 patients, 40 were infected with Exserohilum fungus. The others were infected with Aspergillus or Cladosporium. All are treated with the same anti-fungal medications.      Three lots of the suspect steroid were recalled last month by the New England Compounding Center of Framingham, Mass. All the illnesses have been traced to one of those lots.      Food and Drug Administration officials last week said they found fungus in 50 vials of the preservative-free steroid called methylprednisolone acetate. However, they have not said what kind of fungus they detected.      On Monday, FDA officials said they are investigating two more drugs made by New England Compounding _ another steroid and a solution used during heart surgery. Initially, the FDA said two heart transplant patients who got the heart solution developed fungal infections but later said one case involved a solution made by another company. They also have cautioned there could be other explanations for the infections.      ___      Online:      CDC outbreak information: http://www.cdc.gov/HAI/outbreaks/meningitis.html ||||| By Marice Richter      DALLAS Oct 17 (Reuters) - The number of West Nile virus cases across the United States has topped 4,500, with another 282 cases reported last week, making 2012 the nation's second-worst year on record for the mosquito-borne disease, government figures showed on Wednesday.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"The two questions are very similar, as both are asking about the presence of a black line on the nail and seeking a solution to remove it. The difference is that the first question does not provide a visual reference, while the second one mentions a picture to further clarify the issue. To help you with the issue of the black line on your nails, I will provide a step-by-step process to understand and address the problem: Step 1: Identify the cause The first step is to understand the cause of the black line on your nail. Some common reasons are: - Linear melanonychia: a pigmentation issue causing a dark line on the nail - Beau's lines: nail injury or severe illness causing horizontal ridged lines - Splinter hemorrhage: small blood clot, which can appear as a black line under the nail Step 2: Rule out potential health concerns Consult a dermatologist or healthcare professional to rule out any underlying health conditions that could be causing the black line on your nail. In some cases, a dark line could indicate a benign growth, while in rare cases, it could signal a malignant melanoma. Step 3: Treat the underlying cause If it's determined that an injury or illness contributed to the appearance of the black line, appropriate treatment for the condition should be pursued under medical guidance. If it's due to a growth or another issue, your healthcare professional will recommend necessary treatment options. Step 4: Practice good nail care Proper nail care, including keeping your nails clean and neatly trimmed, can prevent potential nail injuries and ensure healthy growth. It's also essential to maintain a balanced diet, which promotes healthy nail growth. Step 5: Patience As nails grow slowly, it may take several months for the black line to disappear completely, especially if it's due to any growth or injury that affected your nail bed. Remember, the most critical step is consulting a medical professional who can give you an accurate diagnosis and guide you through the process of managing and treating the issue."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Those of you who are regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that I suffer from a very sensitive, itchy scalp and I am constantly on the hunt for haircare products that are natural and non-irritating but that also treat my hair well and leave it feeling soft, shiny and clean. So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage.

Communicate with your stylist about how you normally wear your hair.\\" Article:","output":"Title: How to Choose the Perfect Hair Stylist and Get the Haircut You've Always Wanted Introduction:  Choosing the right hairstylist is crucial for getting a haircut that makes you feel confident and beautiful. A good hairstyle can boost your self-esteem, accentuate your facial features, and even turn heads when you walk into a room. It's essential to find a hairstylist who understands your style, preferences, and expectations. In this article, we will guide you through the process of finding the perfect stylist and getting a haircut that suits you perfectly. Step 1: Shop around for a hairstylist The first step in finding the right hairstylist is to ask for recommendations. Speak to friends, family, and colleagues who have a hairstyle you admire. They can give you insights into their hairstylist's skill, personality, and expertise. Additionally, you can read online reviews or consult social media platforms to discover the best stylists in your area. Create a list of potential hairstylists and start exploring their work. Step 2: Book a consultation appointment Once you have your list of potential hairstylists, book consultation appointments with your top choices. A consultation is an essential part of the journey, as it allows you to meet the stylist and share your expectations. During this meeting, you can discuss the kind of hairstyle you want, your lifestyle, hair type, and other crucial factors. A good stylist should listen to you, analyze your hair, and give you honest advice on what will work best for you. Step 3: Bring a visual aid Pictures are worth a thousand words, especially when it comes to hairstyles. Bring a magazine or an internet picture with you to give your stylist a visual reference of the haircut you have in mind. This way, you can clearly communicate your desired hairstyle to avoid any misunderstandings or disappointments. A skilled hairstylist should be able to adapt the style in the picture to suit your facial features, hair type, and personal taste. Step 4: Communicate openly with your stylist Communication is key in ensuring you get the desired results. Be open with your hairstylist about how you normally wear your hair and your expectations. Let them know which part of styling is most important to you, whether it's the cut, color, or maintenance. Share any concerns or past experiences that have made you cautious. Remember that a good stylist will have your best interests at heart and work with you to find a solution that meets your needs. Conclusion: Finding the perfect hairstylist involves research, open communication, and a thorough consultation. By following these steps, you increase your chances of walking out of the salon with a haircut that leaves you feeling fabulous.

Use a meat thermometer specially designed for microwave use if you cook meat in the microwave.\\" Article:","output":"Title: The Importance of Choosing the Right Meat Thermometer: From Instant-Read to Microwave Thermometers Introduction Cooking meat to the appropriate temperature is essential for both food safety and culinary excellence. To achieve this, it's important to have the right tool: a meat thermometer. However, not all meat thermometers are created equal, and using the wrong one could lead to an undercooked meal or even foodborne illness. In this article, we will explore the different types of meat thermometers available and discuss how to select the appropriate one for various culinary tasks, including grilling, roasting, and microwave cooking. The Dangers of Using the Wrong Thermometer Before diving into the different types of meat thermometers, let's examine the risks associated with using the wrong thermometer. Oftentimes, people may mistakenly use candy thermometers or oven thermometers in place of a proper meat thermometer. This can lead to problems, as these thermometers are designed for different purposes and have different temperature ranges. Using an incorrect thermometer can result in meat that is either undercooked or overcooked, potentially causing foodborne illnesses or a disappointing meal. Therefore, always read the label of the thermometer to ensure it is specifically designed for meat. Instant-Read Thermometers for Grilling For meats that cook quickly, such as ground beef patties, pork chops, and grilled chicken, an instant-read thermometer is the ideal choice. These thermometers provide quick and accurate temperature readings, usually within seconds, allowing you to monitor your meats closely and ensure they reach the optimal internal temperature for both safety and flavor. The best instant-read thermometers are digital and have a thin probe that can be easily inserted into the thickest part of the meat. Look for features such as an auto-off function and splash-proof design for added convenience and durability. Probe Thermometers for Roasting When cooking larger cuts of meat, such as whole birds, ham, beef, or lamb roasts, a probe thermometer is the preferred choice. These thermometers feature a probe that is inserted into the meat before cooking. The probe remains in the meat throughout the cooking process, while the base unit (displaying the temperature) sits outside the oven or grill. This allows for constant monitoring of the meat's internal temperature without having to frequently open the oven door or grill lid. Some probe thermometers come equipped with preset temperature settings for various types of meat, ensuring the desired level of doneness is achieved without guesswork. Others may have wireless capabilities, allowing you to remotely monitor your meat's progress from a distance. It is important to study the features offered by each probe thermometer before purchasing one that best suits your needs. Microwave-Safe Meat Thermometers If you find yourself frequently cooking meat in the microwave, it is essential to invest in a meat thermometer specifically designed for this purpose. Standard meat thermometers are typically not microwave-safe and can be damaged or cause damage to the microwave itself. There is a range of thermometers available designed specifically for microwave cooking, offering the ability to measure the temperature of your meat without posing a risk to your microwave. These thermometers often come with a heat-resistant silicone grip, ensuring that you can safely and comfortably handle the thermometer after the cooking process. Be sure to always use the targeted temperature chart that comes with the microwave-safe thermometer for safe cooking or refer to the USDA guidelines. Conclusion From instant-read thermometers for grilling to microwave-safe options, choosing the right meat thermometer for the task at hand is essential. By reading the thermometer label and selecting the appropriate tool, you can ensure your meat cooks to the perfect temperature for both food safety and delicious taste. With the right thermometer in your arsenal, you're one step closer to achieving culinary excellence and serving mouth-watering dishes to your family and friends."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was a much bigger risk to play around the table than the bench, because the","output":"table was placed precariously close to the edge of a cliff, overlooking the vast ocean below. This didn't deter the group of friends, who were always up for a bit of danger and excitement. They had fondly named themselves \\"The Daredevils,\\" and their reputation in the small town near the coast was one of infamy and curiosity. The group consisted of five friends who were as close as family: Jack, the self-proclaimed leader; Sarah, practical and clever; Tom, the quiet and sensitive one; Emily, always full of energy and spirit; and Peter, the comic relief. It was on a balmy summer evening when they decided to take their game to the edge – literally. They were playing cards, and as the sun dipped over the horizon, casting a warm glow amidst the waning daylight, they shared stories, laughter, and anxiety, as the stakes kept growing higher. As the game progressed, a cliff-side breeze brought with it the scent of salty sea spray, which only added to the thrilling, yet precarious atmosphere. Each member of the group knew that a tactical move or even a slight nudge could send either the cards or a fellow Daredevil tumbling over the edge to their peril below. This only heightened the adrenaline rush, forcing each of them to handle the cards delicately and with explicit precision. Slowly, the crowd around them grew – the Daredevils had become somewhat of a local phenomenon, and their ever-more daring antics had captured the attention and imagination of the townspeople. Some had come to watch in awe, while others clucked their tongues disapprovingly, whispering urgent prayers to the heavens for the safety of these misguided souls. Tonight, the Daredevils took things up a notch – perhaps too far. They introduced a new element to their game: a blindfold. Each player took turns wearing the blindfold, trusting the others to accurately describe their position and surroundings and to guide them. Tensions were higher than ever before, as they relied entirely on the descriptive cues and the careful whispers of their friends – all while their hearts pounded with anticipation. Sarah was the first to wear the blindfold, swallowing a lump in her throat as darkness enveloped her. She listened attentively to the soft voices of her friends as they instructed her on how to move and strategize. Although it was a simple card game, Sarah could feel her pulse quicken as she felt the ocean breeze and knew that one wrong move would be catastrophic. The game continued, each one of them taking their turn under the blindfold. Laughs and gasps from the audience punctuated the evening, which eventually became night as the moon rose to illuminate the table. Against the bright moonlight and the sound of the waves crashing against the cliffs, they felt invincible. It was finally Jack's turn to play blindfolded. He was the boldest of the group, and also the most reckless. Trusting his friends implicitly, he quickly tied the blindfold around his eyes and confidently leaned forward, awaiting instructions. The others hesitated – they shared a glance, knowing that Jack would follow their directions without hesitation. They knew he was strong-willed enough to push the boundaries of safety, treading the fine line without fear. But they also loved their leader, and so, they decided to guide him to victory with utmost care. As the game advanced and the stakes continued to rise, the whispers of the wind and the crashing waves seemed to synchronize with their increasingly tense breaths. Jack made a crucial move, guided by his friends' hushed voices. Everyone held their breath. Suddenly, a rogue gust of wind ripped through the scene, howling around the table and sending cards flying into the abyss below. The crowd gasped, and without thinking, Jack instinctively lunged to save the cards – momentarily forgetting the blindfold and his perilous proximity to the edge. In that heart-stopping moment, the remaining four Daredevils lunged forward as well, gripping tightly onto Jack's arm and pulling him back with all their might. The blindfold fell away, and Jack stared wide-eyed over the edge of the cliff, realizing just how close he had come to certain death. The Daredevils exchanged shaky breaths, their eyes locked onto one another. They could feel the weight of the crowd's collective exhale behind them and knew that their days of playing on the edge were over. From that day forward, the group played their games on solid ground, using the experience as a reminder of how precious life was and how quickly things could change. News of their daring nights at the cliff continued to be whispered within the small coastal town, and they became a living legend – an embodiment of youth and adventure. No longer testing fate, the Daredevils learned the true value of friendship and trust. Sobered by their near-brush with disaster, they became closer, wiser, and more grounded, for they had learned that thrills, while exhilarating, came with the responsibility we hold for one another's lives, hearts, and souls."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The premise suggests that the loss being discussed is regrettable and treated gravely by Poirot, while the hypothesis states that the loss is acceptable, and there is no cause for worry.

Airlines have stopped or changed the flights across the Atlantic Ocean, leaving hundreds of passengers stuck in airports. Grimsvotn is one of the largest and most active volcanoes in Europe. What makes Grimsvotn different is that it lies under a huge glacier of ice up to 12 metres thick. The hot volcano heats up the ice above it, which then forms a layer  of water between glacier and the volcano, keeping it stable. As the water flows out from under the glacier, the pressure lifts. The lava  from the volcano then comes up to the surface. This is exactly what is happening today. Now airlines have to make changes to their flights so as not to fly through the clouds of volcanic ash. According to KLM, one of Europe's biggest airlines, airplanes cannot go under the cloud or over it. Going through the cloud can result in ash getting stuck in the airplane's engines, causing damage to the plane. The eruption has also caused problems for animals in Iceland. The volcano left ash and sharp, glass-like rocks all over the countryside. Farmers are keeping their animals inside to stop them eating ash-covered grass or the sharp objects.

As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.

Article: Former Heisman Trophy winner and NFL quarterback Tim Tebow made his intentions to play baseball known several weeks ago, and now he has an organization. And wouldn't you know it, he's signed with another orange and blue team, much like the Florida Gators and Denver Broncos.      Tim Tebow ... Meet the Mets.      We have signed OF @TimTebow to a minor league contract. He will participate in the #Mets Instructional League. pic.twitter.com/I6gmW0b6hY — New York Mets (@Mets) September 8, 2016      The AP reports that Tebow and the Mets agreed to a 100,000 signing bonus. As James Wagner notes on Twitter, 100,000 is the highest bonus a team can give to a post-draft signee without incurring penalties. To put that figure in context, signing bonus slots for 10th-round picks in 2016 ranged from 161,300 to 156,000.      Tebow will continue his work as a college football analyst for the SEC Network, which will require him to be absent from instructs for at least a couple of days a week. The Mets were reportedly the only team willing to make such allowances for Tebow.      As for anyone misguidedly wondering about the impact on the Mets in 2016, there is zero. Instructional leagues are where teams start the earliest stages of development on players either needing experience or long-injured players go to get back some game speed during their rehab process. Generally speaking, a player like Tebow in instructionals is far, far away from hitting the majors.      As for the notion that Tebow might somehow be \\"taking someone else's spot,\\" he's not. Spots in instructionals aren't limited and most of the game action isn't even limited to regular game-type situations. The at-bats aren't really limited, nor is the time spent on any given individual.      Basically, there's no real risk from a baseball standpoint for the Mets here. They are simply seeing what they can get out of a 29-year-old athlete who has flashed some upside despite being very raw. On that point, here's what GM Sandy Alderson said on Thursday:      This decision was driven by baseball, we are intrigued with the potential he has. @MetsGM on the minor league signing of @TimTebow. — New York Mets (@Mets) September 8, 2016      One thing that will surely be different than normal? The Tebow Media Circus along with the flocks of fans that come with it. One doesn't often see anything close to that in the instructionals.      As for the rest of us who are allowed to live in Tim Tebow's world, we're onto the next chapter. We know he's signed with the Mets. Now we breathlessly wait to see how far his major-league dream gets. His progress during the 2017 season will go a long way toward the conclusion of that chapter. How he fares in instructionals this year doesn't really impact that, but instead simply lays the foundation for 2017 spring training and beyond.      So what will constitute success for Tebow? He'll tell you himself:      \\"I would consider success giving it everything I have.\\" - @TimTebow talks about his own expectations for success with the #Mets. — New York Mets (@Mets) September 8, 2016      Either way, the show starts soon. ||||| The Mets have signed former NFL quarterback and now aspiring pro baller Tim Tebow to a minor league contract, the team confirmed Thursday.

The national sports phenom and Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback will head to the Mets Instructional League in Port St. Lucie, Florida, Sept. 18 to start his professional baseball career, the team said.      \\"While I and the organization are mindful of the novel nature of this situation, this decision was strictly driven by baseball,\\" Mets general manager Sandy Alderson said during a conference call.      \\"This was not something that was driven by marketing considerations or anything of the sort. We are extremely intrigued with the potential Tim has.\\"      Last week, the 29-year-old Tebow worked out for nearly 50 scouts from 28 Major League Baseball teams, including the Mets, in Los Angeles as he embarked on yet another chapter in his unique athletic story.      The outfielder went through drills at the University of Southern California's Dedeaux Field for more than an hour, confidently chasing a dream deferred for 12 years. Declaring his football career essentially over, the 255-pound left-hander insists he is serious about becoming more than a baseball curiosity.      Tebow, who once led the Denver Broncos to a hail mary playoff win and whose plane was tracked by media nationwide when he flew to New York to sign a deal with the Jets as a backup quarterback, hasn't played baseball regularly since his junior year of high school. He left early to enroll at Florida, beginning a fabled college football career that led to the 2007 Heisman and two national titles for the Gators.      Celebs in the Stands: World Series Game 7      But 12 years ago, Tebow was a .494-hitting, all-county outfielder who loved hitting a baseball every bit as much as he loved leading a huddle.      \\"The second-hardest decision I ever made was giving up baseball to go to the University of Florida and play football,\\" Tebow, whose choice of Florida over Alabama was the toughest, said last week. \\"There wasn't a season that went by that it wasn't something that I thought about. When I felt like I had this opportunity, I wanted to take it and pursue it with everything I had.\\"      \\"The goal would be to have a career in the big leagues,\\" Tebow added. \\"I just want to be someone to pursue what I believe in, what I'm passionate about. A lot of people will say, 'But what if you fail? What if you don't make it?' Guess what? I don't have to live with regret. I did everything I could. I pushed it. I would rather be someone that could live with peace and no regret than what-if, or being scared.\\"      Top Sports Photos      Copyright Associated Press / NBC New York ||||| Jayson Stark thinks it is very difficult to believe the Mets' signing of Tim Tebow to a minor league contract was just a baseball decision, calling him a marketing opportunity. (1:12)      Tim Tebow signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets on Thursday and will begin his professional baseball career in the fall instructional league on Sept. 19 in Port St. Lucie, Florida.      Mets general manager Sandy Alderson insisted that signing Tebow, a former NFL quarterback, is not a publicity stunt.      \\"While I and the organization, I think, are mindful of the novel nature of this situation, this decision was strictly driven by baseball,\\" Alderson said on a conference call with Tebow and agent Brodie Van Wagenen on Thursday to announce the agreement that includes a 100,000 signing bonus. \\"This was not something that was driven by marketing considerations or anything of the sort. We are extremely intrigued with the potential that Tim has.      \\"He has demonstrated over his athletic career that he is a tremendous athlete, has got character, a competitive spirit. Aside from the age (29), this is a classic player-development opportunity for us. As an organization, we're going to provide that development opportunity for Tim.\\"      The decision nonetheless was made at the highest levels of the organization -- by Alderson and chief operating officer Jeff Wilpon -- and did not intimately involve the team's baseball-operations personnel. The Mets were one of 28 teams to attend Tebow's showcase last week in Los Angeles.      Tebow acknowledged his upcoming baseball journey is \\"not one that will be necessarily easy.\\"      \\"I know this is a tough game,\\" Tebow said. \\"But I'm looking forward to putting in the work and I felt like this was the best fit.\\"      Tebow, who hasn't played organized baseball since his junior year at Nease High School in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, in 2005, has been working out with former big league catcher Chad Moeller in Scottsdale, Arizona, since Memorial Day. Tebow spent almost two hours last week at the Southern California's Dedeaux Field running a 60-yard dash, shagging fly balls, throwing from the outfield and taking swings against former major league pitchers David Aardsma and Chad Smith in his audition for clubs.      Tim Tebow will report to the fall instructional league on Sept. 19, but will be excused a couple of days each week to fulfill his commitment as a college football analyst for ESPN. AP Photo/Chris Carlson      Tebow won the Heisman Trophy for the Florida Gators in 2007 and helped the team take two national championships. He played professionally for the Denver Broncos and New York Jets from 2010 to 2012. He spent training camps with the New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles in 2013 and 2015, respectively, but never played in the regular season for those teams.      Since 2013, Tebow has been a college football analyst for ESPN. Alderson said Tebow will be excused a couple of days each week from fall instructional league to fulfill that commitment.      \\"Tim is committed to his role at SEC Network and ESPN this fall,\\" Stephanie Druley, ESPN senior vice president, event and studio production, said in a statement. \\"We have always been supportive of Tim's athletic pursuits. His new schedule will allow him to continue as a college football analyst on SEC Nation this fall.\\"      Former major league pitchers Dallas Braden, who is now an ESPN analyst, and C.J. Nitkowski questioned how serious Tebow was about playing baseball based on the arrangement to give him excused days off each week.      Wonder how the kid who doesn't get to go to instructs feels about Tebow breaking down a defense as opposed to taking hacks or fly balls... — Dallas Braden (@DALLASBRADEN209) September 8, 2016      I was on board with this #Tebow thing until I read he will miss multiple days per week in instructional league to do TV. No longer serious. — CJ Nitkowski (@CJNitkowski) September 8, 2016      After Tebow participates in the fall instructional league, which primarily is for teenage prospects, Alderson is not ruling out sending Tebow to the Arizona Fall League or a winter league. First, the Mets want to better gauge Tebow's readiness and determine whether it would be more beneficial to receive individual instruction during the offseason.      Even if Tebow never reaches the majors, Alderson insisted this is a win for the Mets because of the example Tebow's work ethic and character will set for the minor leaguers.      Still, Alderson insisted Tebow has on-field potential.      \\"Any player evaluation starts with tools,\\" Alderson said. \\"From that standpoint, without grading everything out, suffice it to say Tim has been a great athlete. He has demonstrated more than rudimentary baseball skills. We think, with his commitment to success, that this is an opportunity that is worthwhile.      \\"In terms of power, in terms of arm, in terms of foot speed, all of those things, we think he can be a baseball player. I think that is underscored by his competitiveness and his determination to succeed and to improve. From our standpoint, this is another opportunity for us to develop a player and see where it goes. We understand most players don't make it to the major leagues.\\"      Alderson said there's no guarantee Tebow will be invited to major league camp during spring training. He also added Tebow's signing is a \\"standalone proposition\\" and unrelated to Van Wagenen representing other Mets clients, including Yoenis Cespedes -- who has an opt-out this winter -- as well as Noah Syndergaard and Jacob deGrom.      \\"Brodie represents a number of players on our team,\\" Alderson said. \\"But in the course of our conversations regarding Tim, none of those players were mentioned, none were in mind. I think Brodie is professional enough to keep all of those things separate.\\"      The Mets will not be able to capitalize on Tebow's fame from a marketing standpoint, either. For that to happen, Tebow must be added to the team's 40-man roster and sign the group licensing agreement. MLB.com and Mets.com, in fact, are rejecting any fan who tries to make a custom Tebow jersey through the website.      Tebow said he came close to pursuing baseball a year ago, but the Eagles' interest tabled it.      \\"It's been something that I've been thinking about for a little while and came close to pulling the trigger on last year,\\" Tebow said. \\"Then, actually, when I was in the middle of going through a day of training for baseball, [then-Eagles coach] Chip Kelly called and then I had to figure that out. ... We all know how that turned out.\\"      Former Broncos teammate Eric Decker, now with the New York Jets, said he \\"expected\\" Tebow to be signed.      \\"When you have 30 scouts coming to your workout, someone is going to sign you,\\" Decker said. \\"We'll see how he does next spring in whatever camp it is. Best of luck to him.      \\"I believe Tim has a big heart and he's a good person. He's such a competitor that this is an outlet for him. But from the outside, I can see how it looks as a publicity stunt. I mean, he's got a good gig right now with the SEC Network. I'm sure he could do a daily talk show if he wanted. He's well-liked. I think this is him being competitive, wanting to get that fire again.\\"      Asked about his preferred position, Tebow said he'll take his cue from the organization. But he noted he's a lefty thrower, so there's a limit.      \\"My best position is whatever they feel like it is,\\" he said. \\"I feel comfortable in the outfield. I feel comfortable at first base.\\"      What would Tebow deem success during his baseball pursuit? Is it major leagues or bust?      \\"I would consider success giving everything I have,\\" he said.      Decker said that's the kind of teammate that Tebow has been in the past and what he expects him to be in the future.      \\"Guys will have to respect what he's done during his tenure in the NFL and who he is and the college football player he was. There's going to be mixed emotions (among his new teammates), I'm sure,\\" Decker said. \\"He's going to be a good teammate. I think he's going to be very respectful.      \\"He's not going to come in with a chip on his shoulder or (say), 'I'm Tim Tebow, here's the red carpet.' He's not that type of guy in my experience. Guys will respect his work ethic and the person.\\"      ESPN's Darren Rovell and Rich Cimini contributed to this report. |||||Summary:","output":"Former NFL quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy winner, Tim Tebow, has signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets to play baseball. Since leaving football behind, the 29-year-old has played college football analyst for ESPN, but has now decided to take up baseball, something he loved during his junior year of high school in Florida. With a 100,000 signing bonus, Tebow will head to the Mets Instructional League in Port St. Lucie, Florida this month. His goal is to have a career in the big leagues, and although his progress will be slow, there is no rush."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Where do you buy rennet? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Possible answers: [i] no [ii] yes","output":"[i] no The two questions are not paraphrases of each other, as they inquire about different aspects of cheese-making and rennet. To address the first question, although traditional cheese-making involves the use of rennet, a complex set of enzymes found in the stomach of ruminant animals like cows, sheep, and goats, there are alternatives to rennet for making cheese. These alternatives are based on non-animal sources and vegetable coagulants: 1. Vegetable-derived rennet: There are plants that have coagulating properties, such as fig tree bark, nettles, thistle, and artichoke flowers. These can be used to make vegetarian cheeses that don't require animal-derived rennet. However, they might alter the flavor of the cheese, and the resulting taste may vary from the traditional characteristics of cheese that uses animal rennet. 2. Microbial rennet: This type of rennet is derived from fungi and bacteria. Microbial rennet-producing microorganisms are cultivated in labs, resulting in coagulating enzymes similar to the ones found in animal rennet. Cheese made with microbial rennet closely resembles traditional cheese; however, it might have a slightly different texture or taste. 3. Genetically engineered rennet: Another alternative for cheese-making is the use of genetically engineered rennet. This type of rennet is produced by inserting DNA that codes for rennet-producing enzymes into yeast or bacteria. The enzymes produced by this process are very similar to animal rennet, and cheese made with this source maintains its traditional texture and flavor profile. As for the second question, you can buy rennet both online and in physical stores. Generally, specialty food stores or stores that sell cheese-making supplies will carry rennet in various forms, including liquid, tablet, and powder. Additionally, many online retailers and shops cater to cheese-makers and supply all the necessary ingredients, including rennet. Some popular online shops include The Cheese Maker, Cheese Making Supply Co., and New England Cheesemaking Supply Company. Be sure to read the product descriptions to determine which type of rennet you are purchasing, as this can drastically impact the cheese-making process and final product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: Pontius Pilate offers to release either Jesus of Nazareth or Barabbas, in keeping with the Passover custom. The crowd gathered for the pardoning chooses Barabbas, and Jesus is condemned to crucifixion. Returning to his friends, Barabbas asks for his lover, Rachel. His friends inform him that Rachel has become a follower of Christ. Rachel soon returns, but she is not happy to see Barabbas. Barabbas witnesses the crucifixion of Jesus. As Jesus dies, the sky turns black, and Barabbas is shaken. He watches Christ's body sealed in the tomb. On the third morning, Barabbas finds the tomb open. Rachel tells him that Christ has risen, but Barabbas says it is an illusion, or that His followers have stolen the body. He visits the apostles; they do not know where He is, but also believe He is risen. Rachel preaches in Jerusalem about the Christ. She is stoned to death at the insistence of the priests. Barabbas returns to his criminal ways and robs a caravan transporting several of the priests. He throws stones at one of them rather than fleeing, and is captured by Roman soldiers. The law forbids Pilate from executing someone who has been pardoned, so he sentences Barabbas to lifelong slavery in the sulfur mines of Sicily. Barabbas survives this hellish existence for the next twenty years.  He is chained to Sahak, a sailor who was sent to the mines for allowing slaves to escape. Sahak is a Christian. Sahak at first hates Barabbas for being pardoned instead of \\"the Master\\", but the two men eventually become friends. Over time, Sahak becomes too weak to work. As the guards are about to kill him the mine is destroyed in an earthquake. Sahak and Barabbas are the only survivors. Julia, the superstitious wife of the local prefect, considers them blessed. The prefect is due to leave for Rome to be appointed to the Senate. Julia insists that Barabbas and Sahak accompany him for good luck. contains an answer for the question: Who are the apostles unsure about where the person is?, what is it ?

A cool, soothing relief is noticeable as the liquid form passes through your esophagus.  The daily dose is usually 2 to 4 teaspoons (10 to 20 ml) taken 4 times a day. It is best taken 20 minutes to one hour after a meal.  Antacids may bring about side effects -- namely constipation or diarrhea. PPIs are one of the best ways to treat acid reflux. It works by turning off the pump that produces hydrogen, an important component of acid in the stomach. Less hydrogen production means less irritation to your esophagus. For maximum effect, PPIs are taken at least 30 minutes before breakfast.  The daily dose for different types of PPIs are:Omeprazole 20 mg once a dayLansoprazole 30 mg once a dayPantoprazole 40 mg once a dayEsomeprazole 40 mg once a dayRabeprazole 20 mg once a day PPIs may present side effects of headache, stomachache, and an urge to vomit. H2 receptor’s sole purpose in the stomach is to produce acid. H2 receptor blockers antagonize this production of acid. These are an alternative to PPIs that your doctor may recommend.  The daily dose for different types of H2 receptor blockers are:Cimetidine 300 mg 4 times a dayRanitidine 150 mg twice dailyFamotidine 20 mg twice dailyNizatidine 150 mg twice daily H2 receptor blockers may give side effects of headache, constipation, and diarrhea.

Rank: Admiral Throughout his career, Sir Charles Knowles focused on the intellectual aspect of the naval service, authoring several signal books. He had the opportunity to put his ideas into practice during his time in the navy. Discipline aboard his ships was a challenge, mainly due to a significant portion of untrained seamen and raw recruits. This, coupled with his problematic relationship with his superior, Sir John Jervis, eventually led to his retirement from active service after the Battle of Cape St Vincent. Following his retirement, he concentrated on scholarly studies of issues affecting the naval service."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

We eloped with only the two of us, our officiant, and our photographer in attendance.     Before I hired the photographer, I had a meeting with her and told her that there were certain parts of my body I was very insecure about, and being plus sized, I needed a photographer who could accommodate that. She quickly told me that since she is also plus-sized, she was great at angles and editing that would flatter or hide the areas I was insecure about. I was so relieved, because I loved her work. We hired her the same day.     We paid our photographer for 6 hours which included get ready, first look, ceremony, traditional, and dinner pictures which just included a toast and cake cutting. Our contract stated that our package included 300 edited images. It also states that the photos will be delivered within two months, but she has up to 90 days to deliver.  Totally fine. My only request was for ONE image that wasn't watermarked so we could send out announcements. She happily agreed.     When we booked her for our wedding, our package also included an engagement shoot. It was beautiful. The pics were delivered later than the stated time in the contract, but at this point they were so beautiful, I didn't care. I loved them so much, I booked her for our Christmas photos. She sent me a couple of photos with no watermark so I could send out Christmas cards, but I didn't get our album of 40 photos until February.  I was pretty upset about it, but at that point, I had already paid her in full for our whole wedding.     The wedding came and went, and it was beautiful. I got a few watermarked sneak peaks, and I was super excited to get the rest. I few weeks later, I contacted her about the image without the watermark so I could send out announcements. She told me she would have to edit it. She never sent it. I left it alone, because at point, it had been 6ish weeks since the wedding, and I was supposed to have them within 60 days. The 60 day mark passed and I didn't hear from her, so I sent her a message asking for an update, and she told me that they weren't ready yet.     I received my pictures today after two and a half months. The sneak peaks that were watermarked were not in the album.  I received a total of 152 photos. Several of which were the same photo, just one in color, and one in black in white. If you include the sneaks which I don't have yet, I've received about 160 photos. And they are not good AT ALL. They are horribly unflattering, crooked, off centered, and she didn't even edit out things like a pimple on my husband's face. Very basic things. Some of them are so unflattering, I don't even feel comfortable showing other people. They're so bad they brought me to tears. And it's even worse because I only have HALF of the pictures I was promised to pick from.     AITA for sending her an email and telling her how unhappy I am? I don't want to be rude or mean, but I'm just at a loss.

It can be argued that an early example of an elected head of government would be George Washington, who was elected as the first President of the United States in 1789. In that case, the second head of government elected would be John Adams who succeeded George Washington and became the second President of the United States in 1797. However, this question can be interpreted in different ways, as it does not specify the country or criteria for determining who counts as an elected head of government.

At least 17 people were injured when a man lit a firebomb inside the Tsuen Wan Line train at 7.14pm, according to police. Flames and smoke quickly filled the carriages, prompting a mad rush off the train and for the exits.      Ray Chau, a 27-year-old interior designer, said smoke quickly spread through the train, with one person literally left on fire.      “When the train reached Tsim Sha Tsui, people immediately dashed out from the carriages. It was chaotic, like a scene out of Train to Busan,” Chau said, referring to a part in the 2016 zombie horror-thriller film when train passengers fight off the fictional creatures.      At least 15 injured in blaze as man attempts to ‘throw Molotov cocktail’ on Hong Kong MTR train      “I saw a spark two compartments away, there was a lot of smoke ... smoke in one compartment quickly filled the entire train,” Chau said. “The train journey felt particularly long ... there was nothing we could do but inhale the smoke.”      Chau said he saw a burns victim upon arriving at the injured-packed platform.      “One man was completely on fire, his long trousers became shorts ... he crawled and fell, others helped to put out the fire,” he said.      A 23-year-old woman, who identified herself only as Ling, said she remembered hearing the train captain say: “What is it? What is it?” over the public announcement system.      Just seconds later smoke filled the compartment, but she was unable to see exactly what caused the incident.      Video clips provided by Chau to the Post showed the Tsim Sha Tsui station platform packed with passengers after the blaze. People filled the escalators and staircases in an effort to leave. Torn newspaper could be seen scattered across the floor of the station.      Another passenger, surnamed Lam, said she heard passengers screaming as thick smoke started to push its way into her carriage.      Police cordoned off the pedestrian crossings at the junction of Nathan Road and Haiphong Road, where emergency vehicles lined both sides of the street.      Tsim Sha Tsui station was closed immediately following the incident, and a free shuttle was ­provided by the MTR for passengers heading ­towards Jordan and Yau Ma Tei.      Train service updates continued broadcasting in Tsim Sha Tsui station at regular intervals, despite there being no passengers, but instead scores of police officers, firefighters, cleaning personnel and media workers.      “Because of an incident at Tsim Sha Tsui, the train service on the Tsuen Wan line between Central and Tsuen Wan Station is running at four-minute intervals and will not stop at Tsim Sha Tsui Station,” a female announcer said.      “Staff are handling the situation.

(Associated Press)      HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong authorities have arrested a man for arson after a fire broke out in a subway car during rush hour Friday in a busy tourist district, injuring 18 people, two of them critically.      Police said there was no evidence to indicate the fire was a terror attack. Police District Commander Kwok Pak-chung said the 60-year-old man told rescuers as he was being taken to a hospital that he was the one who set the fire, and that he had done so for an unspecified personal reason.      \\"He was incoherent,\\" Kwok said, adding that police believe he used a flammable liquid.      Videos circulating on social media showed a chaotic scene of a fire inside the subway car and a man lying on the platform as people frantically used clothing to try to put out flames on his pants.      In addition to the two in critical condition, six others were in serious condition, and 10 were stable, police said. The injured included seven males and 11 females, but the information provided by the government did not indicate whether it included the suspect.      Hundreds of police and firefighters responded at 7:14 p.m. to the fire, which shut down the busy Tsim Sha Tsui station in downtown Kowloon.

A year after Sandy, mold a lingering problem for buildings, health Ramin Talaie / Getty Images A year later, a house damaged by Superstorm Sandy stands protected by a fence in the Belle Harbor section in the Queens borough of New York City. Hundreds of buildings are still affected, and some people are dealing with health problems because of mold. One year after Superstorm Sandy, the smell hasn't gone away. Hundreds — possibly thousands — of structures sit in limbo, musty with the stench of mold growing behind padlocked doors. \\"People are still in limbo,\\" said Tom Peter, the owner of Insurance Restoration Specialists in New Jersey. \\"There are a lot of houses that haven't been touched.\\" In New York City alone, 433 buildings remain red-tagged as unsafe to enter a year after Sandy blew ashore on Oct. 29, 2012, while 1,013 others are yellow-tagged with some restrictions, according to the Buildings Department. Jeffrey Gross, vice president of operations at Maxons Restorations in New York, said the numbers may be even higher because some people continue to live in their homes if the mold is growing out of sight, such as in basements or behind walls. And that mold can contribute to health problems. He estimated there are a couple of hundred New York City apartment buildings in need of cleanup, and 2,000 to 3,000 single-family homes with mold and other hurricane contamination problems. \\"Staten Island and Rockaway are probably some of the areas that are furthest behind on the road to recovery,\\" Gross said. Red tags indicate the building is unsafe. Property is seriously damaged and is unsafe to enter or occupy. Structures that have been demolished are no longer considered red.Yellow tags indicate restrictions. The property is damaged; entry limitations are specified on each posting. Probably hundreds of homeowners are in the same situation in New Jersey, Peter estimated, based on the work he's seen in the field. \\"They're waiting for permits. They're waiting for money. They're waiting for decisions — from agencies, or family members,\\" he said. People without insurance may be facing bills from 5,000 to 30,000 for a big mold removal, which involves scrubbing the mold clean at the source and then letting it completely dry with a powerful HEPA vacuum. The big problem, many of the experts said, is that a lot of people cleaned even behind the walls but failed to let it completely dry. The mold returned. \\"People started smelling things last summer,\\" Peter said. \\"The biggest surprise was when I opened up some walls six months after the storm and found some walls still wet,\\" Peter said. 'There's usually a lot more in the walls' In New York City, 1,684 single-family homes have received free post-Sandy mold removal through a public-private program administered by the Local Initiatives Support Corp. In all, 776 properties in Queens, 622 in Brooklyn, 283 in Staten Island and three in the Bronx have been remediated. Manhattan hasn't had any qualifying properties since there aren't many single-family homes in qualifying income ranges in its flood areas, said Nick Charles, director of communications for LISC New York. And although the number of people seeking mold remediation is winding down, it's possible there will be another surge once homeowners in insurance limbo finally get the OK to rebuild. \\"Once the contractor shows up and sees mold, (the homeowner) will have to come back to us,\\" because no contractor will want to work where mold is in the air, Charles said. Mold doesn't go away on its own. \\"Whatever you see on the outside, there's usually a lot more in the walls,\\" said Patricia Harman, director of standards and communications for the Restoration Industry Association trade group. \\"Because there was so much damage, and people were not allowed to get into their residence or business for so long, there was a lot of damage.\\" She agreed that drying out a building as quickly as possible is key, and it was a big lesson learned after Katrina. Katrina, for all its devastation, ensured that things weren't worse during Sandy, she said. \\"There were a lot of lessons that the rest of the industry learned, FEMA learned, local government learned, in terms of mobilizing, getting supplies in advance, gas and electric in there, getting things up and running as quick as possible.\\" The mold can pose a health threat as well. \\"There are still people out there a year out that are suffering from the health effects of Sandy,\\" said Dr. Neil Schachter, medical director of the respiratory care department at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. While the mold and the stress of the disaster can create new health problems for some people, it can also make other conditions worse in people already dealing with issues ranging from asthma and allergies to rheumatic and immune diseases, he said. \\"The people I've seen, it's been pretty striking,\\" Schachter said, noting he's seen dozens of patients with Sandy-related problems. Researchers including Bill Sothern, a doctoral candidate at the CUNY School of Public Health, have begun looking at ways to quantify a hurricane's health impacts. \\"We wish we knew just how big an impact this is having. We have anecdotal complaints: 'We cleaned our house, but we're having respiratory problems,'\\" said Sothern, who also is a certified industrial hygienist and founder of the East Harlem-based mold removal firm Microecologies. \\"I don't think anyone knows the health status. What we do know [is] there are substantial remaining environmental conditions, namely mold, that give us serious cause for concern,\\" he said. The one bit of good news is that neighbors probably don't need to worry about their own health if there is a mold problem next door, Sothern said. \\"We haven't seen any evidence that it's anything more than a nuisance,\\" he said. — By CNBC's Amy Langfield.

In New York City, 433 buildings are red-tagged as unsafe to enter, while 1,013 are yellow-tagged with some restrictions due to mold growth. The presence of mold can contribute to health problems, and may exacerbate existing conditions such as asthma, allergies, and immune diseases. The mold removal process can be costly, with the range of 5,000 to 30,000 for comprehensive cleanup. Many homeowners are still waiting for permits, money, and decisions from insurance agencies before mold removal can take place. Timely building drying is crucial in preventing mold growth, a lesson learned from Hurricane Katrina."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: First let me say the director has some wonderful use of titles in his establishing shots. I really enjoyed them. I really enjoyed this movie but I got to say next to Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinear is pretty lackluster. Brosnan melts into this character so well, that it is really hard to remember that this is the same guy that played bond. It also shows his range and depth as an actor. It is kinda of an indie flick and was really nice to see especially with all of the mainstream movies that flood the movies at this time of the year. I found the characters to be well crafted. The twist in the middle I felt was especially good. I also liked how the characters come off realistically. So many times we have in film these caricatures of people that are not really characters but walking-stereotypes... I like the different approaches this movie takes. I think of sideways when I think of this movie but I think this is more watchable and a better movie overall... pick from the following. (1). negative. (2). positive.","output":"To determine the sentiment of this review, I will analyze its content step-by-step. 1.

In order to provide a detailed and long answer, let's break down the above statement into its key components: 1. General orientation: This refers to the overarching direction and guiding principles that define the general framework for decision-making, resource allocation, and activities to be carried out within a specific organization, in this case, the ministry. To provide this general orientation, it is important to have a clear understanding of the mission, vision, goals, and values of the ministry, as well as the broader context in which it operates, such as political, social, economic, or technological factors. This will help to identify priority areas and formulate long-term strategies to achieve the desired outcomes. 2. Strategic priorities: These are the key objectives and goals that the ministry has identified as central to its mandate and that will drive its activities, policies, and programs. Strategic priorities should be aligned with the general orientation and informed by a thorough analysis of the and opportunities within the ministry's area of responsibility. Examples of strategic priorities could include improving access to public services, promoting innovation in a specific sector, or achieving measurable improvements in key performance indicators. 3. Administrative priorities: In addition to strategic priorities, the ministry should also define its administrative priorities, which are the internal processes, structures, and systems that need to be in place to effectively deliver on its mandate and support the achievement of its strategic priorities. Administrative priorities might involve optimizing resource allocation, enhancing transparency and accountability, or modernizing management practices. Ensuring that these internal elements are aligned with the strategic priorities will contribute to the overall effectiveness and performance of the ministry. 4. Specific orientation: While the general orientation provides a broad direction for the ministry, the specific orientation focuses on the key priorities that have been identified as particularly important, or that are expected to have a significant impact on the ministry's overall success. This may involve a more in-depth examination of one or more strategic priorities, or the identification of important initiatives, projects, or collaborations that will contribute to the achievement of the strategic priorities. Providing specific orientation involves clearly defining the desired outcomes, specifying the necessary actions and resources, and establishing mechanisms for monitoring progress and evaluating results. In conclusion, providing a general and specific orientation for the ministry is crucial for guiding its strategic direction, aligning priorities, and ensuring effective governance and management. By establishing a clear framework and setting out key priorities, the ministry will be better positioned to deliver on its mandate, address challenges, and seize opportunities, ultimately contributing to its overall success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Vest Recklinghausen was first mentioned in 1228 as a fiefdom of the Archbishopric of Cologne and thus it belonged to the Electoral Rhenish Circle. The administrator lived in castle Westerholt, located in Herten. From 1446 to 1576 it was used as collateral, first pawned to the lords of Gemen  and after 1492 to the Lords of Schauenburg and Holstein-Pinneberg, who pawned the territory back to the Archbishops of Cologne in 1576. During the Cologne War , Vest Recklinghausen was occupied and sacked several times by troops from both sides of the conflict. In 1583, although much of the territory was already Protestant, the Calvinist Elector of Cologne, Gebhard, Truchsess von Waldburg and his wife, Agnes, ordered the destruction of the icons and decorative elements of the churches. In 1584, the territory was sacked again, this time by the competing archbishop, Ernst of Bavaria. In 1586, the territory was invaded by Martin Schenck and Hermann Cloedt, who caused great damage to the farms and small villages, and were besieged by Claude de Berlaymont, also known as Haultpenne, in the city of Werl.

If \\"As Andrea in the crop duster passed over Susan, she could see the landing strip.\\", can we conclude that \\"Susan could see the landing strip.\\"","output":"Based on the sentence, \\"As Andrea in the crop duster passed over Susan, she could see the landing strip,\\" we cannot definitively conclude that \\"Susan could see the landing strip.\\" The sentence as it's written contains potential ambiguity regarding the referent of the pronoun \\"she.\\" Let's analyze the sentence more thoroughly to better understand the possible interpretations. 1. Interpretation One: Susan can see the landing strip. In the first interpretation, \\"she\\" refers to Susan. Under this interpretation, the sentence suggests that as Andrea, who is inside the crop duster, flew over Susan, Susan gained a good enough vantage point to see the landing strip. However, this interpretation may seem a bit unusual, because it is not immediately clear how Andrea flying over Susan could directly impact Susan's ability to see the landing strip.  2. Interpretation Two: Andrea can see the landing strip. In the second interpretation, \\"she\\" refers to Andrea. In this case, the sentence describes Andrea's perspective as she flies over Susan in the crop duster. While passing over Susan's location, Andrea has a clear view of the landing strip. This interpretation seems more plausible because it is reasonable to assume that being at a higher vantage point, Andrea would have an improved line of sight to the landing strip. It's essential to recognize that the sentence itself does not make it clear which individual \\"she\\" refers to. Thus, without additional context or information, we cannot definitively conclude that either Andrea or Susan can see the landing strip. In summary, the sentence \\"As Andrea in the crop duster passed over Susan, she could see the landing strip\\" is ambiguous in its current form. While it is possible that \\"Susan could see the landing strip,\\" it is not a definitive conclusion based on the information given. We would need more context to clarify the ambiguity and determine the correct interpretation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Somebody's got to help them,'\\" she says. She knew firsthand what they were going through. Six months earlier, a tornado had struck her town, taking the lives of her 2-year-old son, C.J. and her mother-in-law. \\"It was the most terrible experience of my life,\\" she says. \\"That _ will never go away, and it broke my heart to think about what these families were going through in Otwell.\\" So Kathryn loaded her car with juice boxes, snacks and toys and drove to Otwell. She gave the items to the Red Cross, and as she was leaving, she saw a couple sorting through the ruins of their home while their children were watching. So Kathryn stopped and gave a few toys to the kids and played with them for a while. \\"The parents couldn't thank me enough for what I did for their children,\\" she says. On the drive back to Evansville, Kathryn came up with an idea to help more kids. She talked her family, friends and neighbors into joining her and spent the next few months organizing fundraisers. Finally, in August 2007, she showed C.J.'s Bus, a 35-foot school bus that was turned into a mobile playroom. In the following years, stocked with video games and DVDs, toys, crafts, books and more, the bus traveled to disaster-torn towns, giving the children there a safe place to play. So far, C.J.'s bus has traveled to three states affected by tornadoes or floods, cheering up more than 756 children, aged 3-13.

Shred cheese for pizza","output":"To shred cheese for pizza, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Choose the right cheese Select a cheese suitable for pizza, such as mozzarella, cheddar, or provolone. These cheeses melt well and provide a great texture and flavor. Make sure to purchase a block of cheese, as pre-shredded cheese can contain additives to prevent clumping. Additionally, freshly grated cheese tends to melt better. Step 2: Refrigerate the cheese (optional) Optionally, you can refrigerate the cheese for 30 minutes to an hour to make it firmer and easier to shred. This step is especially helpful if you are using softer cheeses like mozzarella. Step 3: Clean and prepare the grater Clean a box grater or flat grater with soap and water, ensuring that there are no lingering particles from previous use. Dry the grater thoroughly, as moisture can cause the cheese to stick to the grater. Step 4: Prepare your workspace Clear a clean, dry counter space to work on and lay out a cutting board or large plate to catch the shredded cheese. You may want to place a piece of wax or parchment paper on the cutting board or plate to help with easy clean-up. Step 5: Cut the cheese block Using a sharp knife, remove any rind or inedible outer layers from the cheese block. Then, cut the block into smaller, manageable pieces that can be easily held while grating. Step 6: Grate the cheese Hold the cheese firmly with one hand, and the grater with the other hand. Grate the cheese using the side of the grater with holes of your desired size, moving the cheese up and down against the grater. Apply pressure as needed, being careful to avoid grating your fingers. Rotate the block of cheese to avoid creating thin edges where it might slip and increase the risk of injury. Step 7: Measure the shredded cheese (optional) If the pizza recipe calls for a specific amount of shredded cheese, use a measuring cup or kitchen scale to determine the appropriate amount. This ensures that you have the right amount of cheese coverage on the pizza for an optimal end result. Step 8: Store or use the shredded cheese Once the cheese is shredded, it's ready to be used on your pizza. If you're not using the cheese immediately, store it in an airtight container or plastic bag in the refrigerator to keep it fresh. By following these steps, you will have successfully shredded cheese for your pizza, enhancing its flavor and texture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is the effect?","output":"The effect of the police aiming their weapons at the fugitive is multi-dimensional, resulting in a range of psychological, emotional, and physical outcomes – from the individuals directly involved in the scenario to the wider community and even society at large. To properly analyze this situation, we must examine the consequences experienced by the fugitive, the law enforcement officers, any bystanders, as well as the possible impact on the broader social context. 1. Fugitive: - Fear: The fugitive would likely experience a heightened sense of fear for their life. The mere presence of armed police officers conveys the severity of the situation and the imminent possibility of danger. - Compliance: The sight of weapons being aimed at the fugitive may force them to surrender, increasing their likelihood of obeying the police commands and reducing the chances of further resistance or escape. - Fight or Flight Response: A potential reaction to the immediate threat is the activation of the fugitive's fight-or-flight response, which can lead to unpredictable behavior, ranging from physical aggression to attempting to flee. - Stress and Anxiety: The overwhelming anxiety and stress, caused due to this life-threatening event, could have long-term effects on the fugitive's mental health, including PTSD or other trauma-related disorders. 2. Law Enforcement Officers: - Adrenaline: The tense situation would likely cause the release of adrenaline in the officers, potentially improving their focus and reactivity but also increasing the possibility of stress and anxiety. - Responsibility: The officers' decision to aim their weapons at the fugitive implies a readiness to use deadly force if necessary, adding a significant degree of responsibility and potentially impacting their emotional well-being. - Training and Protocol: The officers' adherence to their training and following established protocols during the situation can affect not only the immediate outcome but also their ability to cope with any aftermath, including any required legal proceedings or evaluations. 3. Bystanders and Members of the Community: - Immediate Safety Concerns: The presence of armed officers and a wanted fugitive can cause bystanders to feel unsafe or even at risk of being caught in the crossfire. This may result in them seeking cover or evacuating the area quickly. - Trust in Law Enforcement: The manner in which officers handle the situation can affect public perception of law enforcement's ability to protect and serve the community. Successful resolution without any harm to either the fugitive or others will improve trust, while any unfortunate outcome could lead to fear, mistrust, or legal ramifications. 4. Broader Social Context: - Media Coverage: The incident may receive extensive media coverage, affecting the public's perception of law enforcement efficiency and the fugitive's actions. The media portrayal of the situation can significantly influence opinions on policing practices, policies on use of force, and the overall safety of the community. - Legal Implications: The police's decision to aim their weapons at the fugitive might raise concerns over the use of excessive force, which could lead to debates about the necessity of lethal force in certain circumstances, as well as potential lawsuits and calls for reform in police training and protocols. - Societal Safety: The resolution of the incident has a considerable impact on societal safety, as a peaceful outcome would contribute to a sense of security and order, while a more violent ending could incite fear and apprehension among the public. In summary, the effect of police aiming their weapons at a fugitive is complex and far-reaching, encompassing psychological, emotional, and physical consequences for all parties involved. The handling of such situations and their outcomes can influence public perception of law enforcement, the legal system, as well as broader societal implications and discussions on safety and use of force."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have often felt uneasy about you . I thought the Yankees would have hung you long before this for harboring Rebs they found at your house . I suppose they never heard about your going to Col . Martin 's to kill the Union soldier that was left by his company in their stable . What might the term rebs refer to in this story ?","output":"In this context, the term \\"rebs\\" is most likely a colloquial abbreviation for \\"rebels,\\" which in the timeframe of this story is referring to the Confederate soldiers during the American Civil War (1861-1865). The war was fought between the Union (the Northern states) and the Confederacy (the Southern states) over various issues, including state rights, economic policies, and most notably, the abolition of slavery. During the Civil War, the Confederate soldiers were often called rebels because they were rebelling against the policies and government of the United States, hence the formation of the Confederacy. In the passage you supplied, the writer expresses concern over the possibility of their recipient being hung by the \\"Yankees,\\" which was a common term for Union soldiers, for harboring Confederate soldiers at their house. When the writer mentions \\"your going to Col. Martin's to kill the Union soldier that was left by his company in their stable,\\" it refers to an incident where the recipient might have actively supported the Confederate cause against the Union soldiers. The concern voiced in the text about potential consequences for the recipient's actions is a reflection of the tense and divided environment that existed during the American Civil War. In conclusion, the term \\"rebs\\" in this story refers to the Confederate soldiers, who were fighting against the Union during the American Civil War. The reference to \\"rebs\\" and \\"Yankees\\" highlights the division and animosity between the two opposing factions and the challenges faced by individuals living in that time period who may have found themselves in situations where they end up supporting one side over the other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Whose album was called Hearts and Bones? , can you please find it?   The concert took place on Saturday, September 19, 1981, on the Great Lawn, the central open space of Central Park. The first spectators, many carrying chairs or picnic blankets, arrived at daybreak to secure a good spot. The Parks Department originally expected about 300,000 attendees. Although rain fell throughout the day and continued until the start of the concert, an estimated 500,000 audience members made this the seventh-largest concert attendance in the United States in history.The stage backdrop depicted an urban rooftop with water tank and air outlet, symbolic of New York's skyline.  At twilight, the backing band went onstage, followed by New York's mayor, Ed Koch, who announced, \\"Ladies and gentlemen, Simon and Garfunkel!\\" The duo entered through a side stage door, took center stage amid audience applause, looked at each other and shook hands, and began the concert with their 1968 hit \\"Mrs. Robinson\\". After the second song, \\"Homeward Bound\\", Simon delivered a short speech which began, \\"Well, it's great to do a neighborhood concert.\\" He then thanked the police, the fire department, the park administration and finally Ed Koch. The audience booed at the mention of Koch but applauded as Simon continued. Simon & Garfunkel played twenty-one songs in total: ten by the duo, eight by Simon, one by Garfunkel, a cover of  The Everly Brothers' \\"Wake Up Little Susie\\", and the medley version of \\"Maybellene\\". Each performer sang three songs alone, including one new song apiece. Garfunkel sang the Simon & Garfunkel classic \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" and \\"April Come She Will\\", and \\"A Heart in New York\\", a song written by Gallagher and Lyle that appeared on his album Scissors Cut, which had been released the previous month. Simon's solo performances were the title song of his 1975 album Still Crazy After All These Years, the number-one single \\"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\\", and the unreleased \\"The Late Great Johnny Ace\\", which would appear on his 1983 album Hearts and Bones.

It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that’s it’s not too late to take great care of you.

In February 1984, the group released their debut album The Smiths, which reached number two on the UK Albums Chart. Both \\"Reel Around the Fountain\\" and \\"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\\" met with controversy, with some tabloid newspapers alleging the songs were suggestive of paedophilia, a claim strongly denied by the group.  In March 1984, they performed on Channel 4 music programme The Tube.  The album was followed the same year by the non-album singles \\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\\" and \\"William, It Was Really Nothing\\", which featured \\"How Soon Is Now?\\" on its B-side. Securing the band's first top ten placing, \\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\\" was also significant for marking the beginning of engineer and producer Stephen Street's long-term working relationship with the band.  More controversy followed when \\"Suffer Little Children\\", the B-side to \\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\\", touched on the theme of the Moors murders. This caused an uproar after the grandfather of one of the murdered children heard the song on a pub jukebox and felt the band was trying to commercialise the murders. After meeting with Morrissey, he accepted that the song was a sincere exploration of the impact of the murders. Morrissey subsequently established a friendship with Ann West, the mother of victim Lesley Ann Downey, who is mentioned by name in the song.  The year ended with the compilation album Hatful of Hollow. This collected singles, B-sides and the versions of songs that had been recorded throughout the previous year for the Peel and Jensen shows.

But even if economic restrictions were lifted, the restrictive and repressive state would likely still present a challenging environment for foreign investment. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un complies with what President Donald Trump has demanded, the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea, the United States would offer foreign investment “in spades” to build up the country’s infrastructure and develop its economy. “This will be Americans coming in, private sector Americans, not the U.S. taxpayer, private sector Americans coming in to help build out the energy grid. They need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea; to work with them to develop infrastructure, all the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea, so they can eat meat and have healthy lives,” said Pompeo during an interview on the Fox News Sunday program. The Secretary of State recently returned from a trip to Pyongyang, where he meet with the North Korean leader to prepare for the upcoming Trump-Kim summit that will be held in Singapore on June 12. North Korea also released three American prisoners to Pompeo as a humanitarian gesture in advance of the summit. The Trump administration is increasingly optimistic it can work out an agreement to dismantle the North’s nuclear program, its advanced ballistic missile arsenal, and chemical weapons capabilities, so as to no longer threaten the U.S. or it is allies. During the recent North-South summit, Kim committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and indicated that he seeks an end to the severe U.S.-led sanctions banning 90 percent of North Korean trade that were imposed for his country’s repeated nuclear and missile tests. “They obviously want to make concessions, a lot of...

A:","output":"No, the right answer to the question \\"what are a source of food for many fish species?\\" is not \\"bird species\\". Although some fish species might consume bird species occasionally or opportunistically, this is not the primary or most common food source for many fish species. Instead, a more appropriate answer would be \\"plankton, invertebrates, and other fish species.\\" Plankton, which includes both microscopic algae (phytoplankton) and tiny animals (zooplankton), are at the base of the aquatic food chain and provide sustenance for many smaller fish species. Invertebrates, such as insects, crustaceans (e.g., shrimp and crabs), and mollusks (e.g., snails and clams) are also essential food sources for a variety of fish species. Finally, larger, predatory fish species often feed on smaller fish species as part of their diets. Keystone species can indeed play a crucial role in the functioning of an ecosystem. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that they only serve as a food source for many fish species. Keystone species are organisms that have a disproportionately significant impact on their environment relative to their biomass. They can maintain the structure, function, and stability of their ecosystems through trophic interactions (predation, herbivory), habitat modification, and other indirect effects. It is important to differentiate between keystone species and the specific food sources that many fish species depend on for their survival."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: The 31 year-old was discovered relaxing in the sunshine next to a swimming pool on the Costa Blanca, more than four years after fleeing his armed robbery trial.      Police said the “dangerous fugitive”, from Salford, Greater Manchester, “violently resisted” arrest during last week's armed raid in the resort in Calpe, near Alicante.      Moran, the last remaining wanted criminal on a special hit list, was behind bars ahead of a court appearance tomorrow when authorities will seek to extradite him back to Britain.      It emerged tonight that he was nearly captured in November but managed to evade arrest after an astonishing car chase, in which he drive the wrong way along a busy motorway.      Moran fled Britain in February 2009 when he vaulted from the dock at Burnley Crown Court, assaulted four security officers and ran as a judge tried to remand him in custody over a £25,000 armed robbery of Royal Mail guards.      Prosecutors said a hand gun, machete and baseball bat were used during the raid outside an Asda supermarket in Colne, Lancashire in 2005, in which the security guard was assaulted.      The jury later returned a guilty verdict and he was convicted in his absence.      Friday’s raid, in an area known as the “Costa del Crime” – considered a favoured hideout of British criminals – came after a major international operation headed by the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency [SOCA].      (Serious Organised Crime Agency/PA)      Dramatic images released by authorities in Spain today showed masked officers crawling behind walls surrounding the villa before Moran was seen making trying to leap onto a tiled roof of a nearby outhouse after he spotted police.      The heavily tattooed criminal was held to the ground and handcuffed in a pair of red shorts after his botched attempt to escape into thick bushes.      His girlfriend, Genna Harvieu, sat in a chair by the pool, wrapped in a towel and surrounded by elite officers from Spain's Special Group of Operations.      Police later found two firearms, 60 rounds of ammunition, a machete and several mobile phones in his property. It remains unclear what led to the raid.      Tonight, Spain’s Interior Ministry disclosed that during his escape last year he smashed into two police cars in a 4x4 after being tracked down to the spa town of Los Alcazares in Murcia, southeast Spain.      Moran, described by police as a “violent thug”, then drove up the wrong way of the busy AP7 motorway, which runs along the Mediterranean coast.      During a search of the house he was living in at the time a handgun, ammunition, five kilos of cannabis and a vacuum packing machine were recovered.      The previous year he was named by Crimestoppers on a list of wanted criminals as it marked the fifth anniversary of its Operation Captura campaign.      Spanish police arrest a man, allegedly identified as British citizen Andrew Moran in Calpe, near Alicante (photo: AFP/Getty)      His arrest, headed up by Soca's North-West Regional Organised Crime Unit, known as Titan, now means 50 fugitives have now been caught since the operation was launched.      The arrest of his co-accused, Stephen Devalda, 29, at a hotel in Marbella, Spain, in 2011, left Moran the final man on a police hit-list of the Salford-based armed robbers.      Devalda was extradited to Britain where he was jailed at Preston Crown Court for nine years and eight months for conspiracy to commit armed robbery and seven months for jumping bail.      Matt Burton, Soca's Head of Investigations, said there was “no hiding place” for criminals.      He said: \\"Moran thought he could evade capture fleeing to Spain, frequently changing his appearance and using false identities.      “[We] have the capability to pursue criminals relentlessly, track them down, and put them behind bars.\\"      Pictures released by Soca show how the criminal changed his appearance by growing a moustache and his hair, as well as wearing glasses.      In one photograph Moran is posing with a rifle, while in another he is brandishing two automatic weapons.      Det Ch Insp Janet Hudson, from Titan, added: “No matter how hard they try to evade justice they will not succeed.\\"      Moran is due to appear in Spain’s Central Criminal Court, in Madrid, on tomorrow. ||||| One of Britain's most wanted fugitives is to be sent back to the UK after being arrested at a luxury villa on Spain's Costa Blanca.      Andrew Moran, 31, from Salford, Greater Manchester, was arrested by police in the resort of Alicante, in Calpe, on Friday.      At a court hearing in Madrid, he accepted a request for his extradition over an armed robbery in 2005.      Moran was convicted in his absence after fleeing during his trial in 2009.

Write the answer: Photophobia is extreme sensitivity to, or fear of, what?","output":"Photophobia is extreme sensitivity to, or fear of, light. This condition can manifest in individuals experiencing discomfort, pain, or an aversion to both natural and artificial light sources, including sunlight, fluorescent light, incandescent light, and even the light emitted by electronic devices such as computer screens, televisions, and smartphones. Photophobia is not a phobia in the traditional sense, as it is not necessarily an irrational fear. Instead, it is a heightened sensitivity to light that can cause physical discomfort or pain when an individual is exposed to it. This sensitivity can be temporary, as is sometimes experienced during a migraine or following eye surgery, or it can be a chronic condition. There are several potential causes of photophobia, including: 1. Genetic factors: Some individuals may have an inherited predisposition to photophobia, often linked to conditions like albinism and aniridia, where the eyes do not have enough pigmentation or the iris is underdeveloped, leading to increased light sensitivity. 2. Neurological disorders: Conditions like migraines, traumatic brain injury, and meningitis can lead to increased light sensitivity. Photophobia is a common symptom of migraines, where even normal levels of light can exacerbate headache pain. 3. Eye conditions: Certain eye conditions such as dry eye syndrome, corneal abrasion, uveitis, and keratitis can lead to photophobia. These conditions can cause the eye to become more sensitive to light due to inflammation, damage, or lack of moisture. 4. Medication side effects: Photophobia can be a side effect of certain medications such as antibiotics, antihistamines, and some antidepressants. These medications can cause light sensitivity by influencing neurological pathways or affecting eye functions. 5. Medical conditions: Other health issues like viral infections, autoimmune diseases, and vitamin deficiencies can contribute to photophobia. For example, Sjogren's syndrome, an autoimmune disease that affects moisture-producing glands in the eyes, can lead to light sensitivity. To manage photophobia, individuals can take a variety of measures: 1. Wearing sunglasses: Using sunglasses with polarized lenses or UV protection can help block out bright light and reduce discomfort in outdoor environments. 2. Adjusting indoor lighting: Dimming or using warm-toned lighting inside can help minimize the impact of indoor light sources on individuals with photophobia. 3. Taking breaks from screens: Reducing exposure to electronic devices and taking regular breaks can help alleviate the strain on the eyes in those sensitive to screen light. 4. Seeking medical advice: Consulting an eye doctor or general practitioner can help identify the underlying cause of photophobia and develop an effective treatment plan. 5. Applying artificial tears: For those experiencing photophobia due to dry eye syndrome, using lubricating eye drops can help alleviate symptoms and reduce light sensitivity. In conclusion, photophobia is extreme sensitivity to, or fear of, light that can occur due to various factors such as genetic predisposition, neurological disorders, eye conditions, medication side effects, or other medical conditions. Managing photophobia involves taking protective measures, addressing underlying causes, and seeking appropriate medical advice to develop a personalized treatment plan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By James Rush Marvel Comics has announced the new Captain America will be African-American for the first time in the comic franchise's history. Sam Wilson, also known as The Falcon, a crime-fighting partner of the original 'Cap' Steve Rogers, will be taking over the reins in the 'All-New Captain America' which is due to be released in November. Wilson is stepping in for Rogers after the original superhero lost his special powers and youth last month. The news comes in the same week comic book fans were rocked by an unexpected move by Marvel, when it revealed that Thor is now a woman. 'This new Thor isn't a temporary female substitute - she's now the one and only","output":"Thor, and she is worthy!' said Marvel editor Wil Moss in a statement. The moves are part of Marvel's ongoing efforts to diversify its characters and appeal to a broader audience. The new Captain America series, written by Rick Remender and illustrated by Stuart Immonen, is expected to explore themes of racial identity, social justice, and patriotism from the perspective of an African-American superhero. In response to the news, reactions have been mainly positive, with fans and critics alike praising Marvel for aiming to be more inclusive and representative of its audience. However, some conservative fans took to social media to voice their displeasure, arguing that the changes were pandering to political correctness. Marvel's decision to make these alterations to their classic characters suggests a stronger commitment to inclusivity and diversity, hoping to reach a broader demographic. This shift can also be seen in several comic book series such as Ms. Marvel, which features a Muslim teenage girl as its protagonist, and Iron Man, where Riri Williams, a young African-American woman, dons the armor as Ironheart after Tony Stark's apparent death. With the change in Captain America's mantle, it is expected that more stories dealing with contemporary political and racial issues affecting the nation will be included in the comic series. This might involve showcasing minorities working together to overcome adversity, exploring societal privileges, and uncovering systemic biases in policing and law-making. As the 'All-New Captain America' hits the comic stands, it is expected that Marvel will collaborate with schools, libraries, and community centers to organize panel discussions and events celebrating these new characters and the impact they have on promoting diversity, awareness, and social change. Such initiatives are aimed at sparking open conversations among young people to better understand the importance of representation and fostering empathy towards those who are different from themselves. Meanwhile, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has also showcased diversity in its recent films and TV series. On the big screen, Black Panther, Marvel's first film centering on a Black superhero, shattered box office records and garnered critical acclaim. Additionally, the Disney+ streaming platform has released shows like 'The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,' which tackles racial issues, and the upcoming 'Hawkeye' series, featuring a deaf superheroine. As the public expresses increased interest in diverse superheroes, Marvel is likely to adapt the new Captain America and Thor characters into their successful film and television projects. In conclusion, Marvel Comics' decisions to introduce an African-American Captain America and a female Thor emphasize an inclusive and progressive approach to storytelling. By putting the spotlight on underrepresented groups in their comic series and adaptations, Marvel is actively working towards challenging stereotypes, promoting diversity, and encouraging critical discussions on relevant societal issues. Great things are expected from the 'All-New Captain America' comic, and comic book fans around the world eagerly anticipate the impact that these changes will bring to both the Marvel Universe and the real world."},{"instruction":"I heard that carson was ash's best friend so he agreed to take her.

Jews of any non-Ashkenazi background, including Mizrahi, Yemenite, Kurdish and others who have no connection with the Iberian Peninsula, have similarly come to be lumped together as Sephardic. Jews of mixed background are increasingly common, partly because of intermarriage between Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi, and partly because many do not see such historic markers as relevant to their life experiences as Jews.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"The answer to the question \\"Why do marriage of mixed Jewish backgrounds occur more often?\\" lies in the changing definitions and perceptions of Jewish ethnic backgrounds, along with increasing instances of intermarriage between different Jewish groups. In Israel, the original meanings of the terms Ashkenazi and Sephardic have shifted, resulting in broader, more inclusive categories. Ashkenazi, initially referring to Jews originating from Europe, is now often applied to all European Jews and sometimes even includes those with Sephardic backgrounds. Similarly, the term Sephardic has expanded to encompass not only those with connections to the Iberian Peninsula but also Mizrahi, Yemenite, Kurdish, and other non-Ashkenazi backgrounds. There are two main factors contributing to the increased occurrence of marriages between mixed Jewish backgrounds. First, intermarriage between Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi Jews is on the rise, leading to the blending of backgrounds and traditions. Second, many individuals no longer view these historic ethnic markers as relevant to their contemporary Jewish identity and experiences. As a result, they are more likely to marry someone from a different Jewish background due to shared beliefs, values, and cultural practices, rather than focusing solely on their ancestral origins. In summary, mixed Jewish background marriages occur more frequently due to evolving definitions of Jewish ethnic backgrounds, a growing inclination toward intermarriage, and a shift in focus from historical ancestry to shared life experiences and cultural connections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Moon could soon become a robot colony of mechanical apes exploring the lunar landscape, thanks to a monkey robot designed in Germany. Engineers from the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) and the University of Bremen have developed a space robot designed to walk and climb like an ape over rocky ground, such as the terrain of the Moon. The iStruct Demonstrator has mechanical arms, legs and a spine that mimic the way primates behave - and could replace the wheeled rovers currently used in lunar missions. Scroll down for video. Engineers from the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence have developed a robot that walks and climbs like a monkey. The researchers plan to send the mechanical chimp to the moon to explore the lunar landscape because it is more agile and versatile than current wheeled rovers and explorers. The iStruct Demonstrator, pictured, weighs 18 kg. It has an articulated spinal column connecting the torso and pelvis to foot and ankle structures. These 'joints' are each fitted with sensors which react and respond to the ground below. The iStruct demonstrator has:. 43 individual force-sensing resistor (FSR) sensors. Six additional FSR sensors on exposed parts used for collision detection. A 6-axis Force/Torque-sensor. A distance sensor in heel to anticipate heel strike. A digital 3-axis accelerometer to perceive the orientation of the foot. Two temperature sensors to compensate for temperature changes in the electronics. Digital magnetic angular encoders to monitor every moving axes of the foot and ankle structure. The engineering team have already built the robo-ape and have now begun testing it in the centre's mock lunar landscape. According to researchers at the DFKI, a primate's body is better suited to the lunar terrain because its four-legged stance is stable when climbing over obstacles or hills. The robot can also right itself if it falls over. It can additionally stand on its hind legs and use its arms to pick up samples and move obstacles using its robotic hands. The iStruct Demonstrator weighs 18kg and measures 66x43x75 cm. It has an articulated spinal column connecting the torso and. pelvis to foot and ankle structures. These 'joints' are each fitted with sensors that react and respond to the ground below. It also has 26 degrees of freedom thanks to various electric motors. The iStruct Demonstrator is similar to the CHIMP robot developed for the DARPA Robotics Challenge. The iStruct Demonstrator's 'legs' and 'joints' have been engineered to mimic those of a primate. This makes the robot more capable of climbing, walking and collecting samples from the rocky Moon terrain. However, the. iStruct's articulated spine, which works as a 6-axes force-torque. sensor, is unique to this robot and. helps it move on all fours. The sensors in the foot and ankle also allow. it to maintain its balance on sloped terrain. A study from the research centre said: 'The aim of the iStruct project is the development of a robotic system which effectively improves the locomotion and mobility characteristics, if applied to the robotic system. 'The main focus in this project is the development of intelligent structures for application in mobile robots to increase the efficiency of a complex walking machine by the purposeful use of intelligent structures. 'A high number of sensors is needed to allow a precise perception of the environment; hence there will be large data sets which have to be locally pre-processed and evaluated. 'In order to meet the high requirements of the intelligent structures, sensors and actuators have to be selected or developed with regard to both their functionality and their integration capability within the intelligent structures.' In 2009, project leader Daniel Kühn worked on a similar robot called the Little Ape capable of simple quadrupedal walking. His current project is due to be completed by August.

What is the name of the person that said \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\"?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  During the 1913 Ballets Russes season in Paris, Monteux conducted two more premieres. The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of Le Sacre this spring\\".","output":"The name of the person who said, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" is Monteux. In the given context, Monteux is referring to Le Sacre or The Rite of Spring, a composition by Stravinsky."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which language is this?","output":"The language you provided is Czech. Czech is a West Slavic language spoken primarily in the Czech Republic, which is located in Central Europe. It is the official language of the country and is also spoken by Czech communities in other countries around the world. The Czech language is closely related to the Slovak language, with which it shares a high degree of mutual intelligibility. The Czech language has a rich history dating back to the 9th century. It evolved from the Old Slavonic, which was used by the Slavic tribes in Central and Eastern Europe. Through the centuries, Czech has undergone various linguistic changes and has been influenced by Latin and German. The modern Czech language was standardized in the 19th century, during the Czech National Revival movement. Czech uses a Latin-based alphabet with diacritical marks, which include háček (caron) and kroužek (ring), to modify specific characters. This alphabet consists of 42 letters, which allows for the accurate representation of Czech sounds. The grammar of Czech is complex, featuring a high degree of inflection for nouns, adjectives, verbs, and pronouns. The language has seven grammatical cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental. Moreover, Czech has a flexible word order, which provides more freedom for speakers to emphasize different parts of a sentence. Czech vocabulary is rich and diverse, containing many loanwords from Latin, German, French, and more recently, English. The language also has a plethora of idioms, proverbs, and sayings, creating a vibrant and expressive means of communication. Czech literature plays an essential role in promoting the language's rich cultural heritage. Renowned Czech authors, such as Franz Kafka, Jaroslav Hašek, Karel Čapek, and Milan Kundera, introduced the world to Czech literature and culture through their works. Learning Czech can be challenging due to its complex grammatical structure, but it is a valuable skill for those who wish to engage with the culture and people of the Czech Republic."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After three terms, he went to the University of Munich as a student of the experimentalist Wilhelm Röntgen and the theoretician Arnold Sommerfeld. After one year at Munich, he returned to Tübingen to be able to study spectroscopy with Friedrich Paschen.

On the way to Buzzsaw, Bill's car and clothes (including his wallet which contains an important contact number) are stolen by a woman named Sally and he is forced to hitchhike home naked, where he is picked up by two drunken brothers—both named Jim (Monks and Reilly).

It has a positive sentiment attached to it because the person is showing their goodwill and positive hopes towards someone else's actions. 2. Context: Given that the content of the tweet does not provide further context, it's difficult to ascertain the specific sentiment beyond a generic positive sentiment. Without further information, such as the user's historical tweets or a specific event that the tweet is referring to, I can only presume based purely on the text.  3. Capitalization: The all-caps usage can often indicate strong emotions in text-based communication. In this case, it seems to emphasize the sentiment of wishing good fortune - a stronger, more vocal or enthusiastic goodwill expression.

Article: As many as one in five US teenagers have some degree of hearing loss, according to researchers. They say the problem is growing. \\"Teenagers really don't pay attention to how much noise they are exposed to ,\\" Josef Shargorodsky of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston told Reuters. \\"Often people won't notice it, but even very little hearing loss may influence language development,\\" said Shargorodsky, one of the researchers. The study compared surveys from the early 1990s and the mid-2000s. Each included a few thousand teenagers. In the first survey, about 15 percent of teenagers had some degree of hearing loss. Some 15 years later, that number had risen by a third, to nearly 20 percent. \\"This certainly is big news,\\" said Alison Grimes, an ear doctor. \\"Hearing loss is very common in old people,\\" Grimes said, but she added that it was worrying to see it happen in the younger age group. In babies and young children, hearing problems are known to slow language development. The science is less clear for teenagers, but it is easy to imagine how being hard of hearing could influence learning, said Grimes. The reasons for the rise are still unclear. When researchers asked teenagers about noise exposure - on the job, at school or from activities, for example - the teenagers didn't report any change. But Shargorodsky said that might not be true. \\"We know from before that it is difficult to ask this age group about noise exposure - _ \\" Few people would call it noise when they listen to music on their MP3 player, for example. \\"There is a difference between what we think is loud and what is harmful to the ear,\\" said Grimes.

Green animals include, especially, amphibians, reptiles, and some fish, birds and insects. Most fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds appear green because of a reflection of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment. Perception of color can also be affected by the surrounding environment. For example, broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light. Turacoverdin is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds, especially. Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of porphyrin pigments, sometimes caused by diet. This can causes their feces to look green as well. Other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are flavins (lychochromes) and hemanovadin. Humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields. Substances that may impart a greenish hue to one's skin include biliverdin, the green pigment in bile, and ceruloplasmin, a protein that carries copper ions in chelation. What is another name for hemanovadin?

Season 2 seemed so convoluted with their multiple plotlines that very little made any sense at all. I don't want to even start talking about how misused Marianne was in S2. But in this season , Russell Edgington added something so great to the story that you didn't want it to end. I also loved that Eric had more screen time as well as Lafayette. Franklin and Tara's relationship was just so entertaining, he was really psychotic. I can't wait to see what more S4 has in store. (That rhymed, didn't it.

President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors. Question: Why does Trump want North Korea to denuclearize? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"Trump wants North Korea to denuclearize to ensure regional and global security by preventing the use of nuclear weapons and to reduce the potential risk of nuclear proliferation. This would also help in building a more stable and peaceful relationship between North Korea, the U.S., and other nations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Inquiry will focus on lack of \\"red flags\\" after suspect's actions drew FBI attention. Article:","output":"Title: FBI Policies and Practices Under Scrutiny Following Fort Hood Massacre; Former FBI and CIA Director William Webster to Lead Investigation The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is set to undergo a thorough review of its \\"policies, practices, and actions\\" before the tragic Fort Hood massacre, as announced by federal authorities. William Webster, a highly respected and experienced 85-year-old former director of both the FBI and CIA, has been commissioned to spearhead the investigation. The Fort Hood massacre, which occurred on November 5, 2009, resulted in the deaths of 13 individuals and left 32 others injured. The incident took place at the Fort Hood military base in Texas when a lone gunman, U.S. Army Major Nidal Hasan, began firing on a group of unarmed soldiers preparing for deployment. Hasan was later convicted and sentenced to death in 2013. This review aims to scrutinize the FBI and determine whether crucial \\"red flags\\" were missed during the period leading up to the attack. Despite prior actions of the suspect drawing the attention of the FBI, these possible warning signs were apparently not enough to prevent the tragedy. Webster's extensive and esteemed career make him aptly suited for the task of leading this investigation. In the past, he notably helmed a probe into the FBI's practices following the notorious spy case in 2001 involving Robert Hanssen. During this period, Webster's recommendations led to significant improvements in FBI security policies and counterintelligence capabilities. The inquiry into the Fort Hood massacre will primarily focus on the lack of \\"red flags\\" that could have potentially prevented the attack. Throughout the course of the investigation, the team will examine how the FBI handled information relating to Hasan, and whether any oversights in their decision-making process allowed the massacre to occur. In doing so, the objective is to identify areas where the FBI could enhance its current practices and prevent future incidents. This examination of the FBI's policies and procedures surrounding the Fort Hood massacre is of the utmost importance to national security. By identifying potential weaknesses in the system, authorities can ensure that the appropriate measures are taken to better protect the nation against possible acts of violence in the future. In conclusion, the upcoming investigation led by William Webster will scrutinize the FBI's \\"policies, practices, and actions\\" before the Fort Hood massacre, with the ultimate aim of improving current policies and preventing similar incidents from happening in the future. As the former director of the FBI and CIA, Webster brings significant expertise and experience to the task, ensuring a thorough review that will provide valuable insights into the organization's overall performance and efficiency."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Q: What science is the study of the shape and arrangement of cells in tissue?

Background: Antonio Ramiro Romo (born April 21, 1980) is an American football television analyst and former quarterback who played 14 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Eastern Illinois University, where he won the Walter Payton Award in 2002, and led the Panthers to an Ohio Valley Conference championship in 2001. He signed as an undrafted free agent with the Cowboys in 2003. Beginning his career as a holder, Romo became the Cowboys' starting quarterback during the 2006 season. Context: On September 7, 2008, Romo led the Cowboys to a 28-10 win over the Cleveland Browns in their season opener. Romo completed 24 of his 32 passes for a total of 320 yards and one touchdown. After the game, Romo required 13 stitches for a large gash on his chin that occurred during the third quarter when linebacker Willie McGinest hit him in the chin with his helmet. The NFL fined McGinest 7,500 for the hit.  On September 15, Romo led the Dallas Cowboys to a 41-37 win against the Philadelphia Eagles in the second game of the 2008 season. Romo completed 21 of his 30 passes for a total of 312 yards and three touchdowns. The 54 combined points scored by the Cowboys and Eagles in the first half were the second most points scored in a half during a Monday Night Football game.  Romo and the Cowboys won their third straight before losing to the Washington Redskins, falling to 3-1. Following a win against the Cincinnati Bengals, Romo was injured in a loss to the Arizona Cardinals. The Cowboys, under Brad Johnson, went 1-2 the next three games, falling to the St. Louis Rams, beating the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and losing to the New York Giants.  In what became a de facto third playoff game for Romo shortly prior to its start, on December 28, Romo and the Cowboys failed to compete against the Philadelphia Eagles in a 44-6 loss. Romo committed three turnovers in the game and went 21/39 for 183 yards and no touchdowns. The loss dropped Romo's combined record in December to 5-8 and again raised questions about his performance in games of consequence. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","output":"Yes, there are a few interesting aspects in this article.  1. Tony Romo, the person in the article, was not only a football player but is now a television analyst too. He used to play as a quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys. 2. He started his football journey at Eastern Illinois University and won a special award there called the Walter Payton Award in 2002. 3.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. friction is used for stopping a vehicle by brakes friction is used for stopping a vehicle by","output":"brakes because it plays a significant role in ensuring the safety and proper functionality of the vehicle. Friction is a force that opposes motion between two surfaces in contact with each other, and it is essential in many aspects of our daily lives. In the case of stopping a vehicle, the friction between the brake components and the wheel plays a crucial role in decelerating and ultimately halting the vehicle. Brake systems in vehicles come in different types, but the most common ones are the disc brake and the drum brake. Both systems use friction to stop the vehicle, but they achieve this goal through slightly different mechanisms. Let's examine both types in detail. Disc Brakes: Disc brakes are used in most modern vehicles. They consist of a brake rotor (a rotating disc), calipers, brake pads, and hydraulic or mechanical components that actuate the brake. When the driver steps on the brake pedal, the hydraulic or mechanical components are engaged, which causes the calipers to clamp the brake pads onto the brake rotor. As a result, friction is generated between the brake pads and the rotating disc, converting the kinetic energy of the moving vehicle into thermal energy (heat). This process decelerates the vehicle and ultimately brings it to a stop. The advantage of using disc brakes is that they dissipate heat more efficiently compared to drum brakes, allowing them to handle more braking force. This is especially useful in high-performance vehicles or those who are frequently used in hilly areas or in situations where rapid stopping is essential. Drum Brakes: Drum brakes are an older design and are commonly found in older vehicles or in modern vehicles as rear brakes. They consist of a brake drum, brake shoes, a wheel cylinder, and other connecting components. When the driver steps on the brake pedal, hydraulic pressure is transmitted through the brake lines, and the wheel cylinder expands. This expansion forces the brake shoes, which are lined with friction material, against the inside of the brake drum. The friction between the brake shoes and the brake drum opposes the rotational motion of the wheel, causing the vehicle to slow down and ultimately stop. While drum brakes are generally considered to be less effective than disc brakes, they are still commonly used on smaller or less powerful vehicles due to their simplicity and lower production cost. In conclusion, friction is used for stopping a vehicle by brakes through the interaction between the brake components and the wheel. This interaction generates resistance, which slows down and ultimately stops the vehicle. Friction is a key force that ensures braking systems in vehicles function safely and effectively, enabling drivers to control their vehicles in a variety of situations. Overall, a better understanding of friction in vehicle braking systems can aid in the development of improved and safer transportation technologies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context:  Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as \\"an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince\\", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the \\"triumphal\\" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as \\"direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle\\". Má vlast is the first of Smetana's mature large-scale works that is independent of words, and its musical ideas are bolder than anything he had tried before.

Combine facts and answer this: Percy Williams Bridgman experimented with what two dependents of ductility? A:","output":"In order to answer this question, I will first gather and combine relevant facts. Fact 1: Percy Williams Bridgman was an American physicist who conducted extensive research on the physics of materials under high pressures. Fact 2: Ductility is a mechanical property of materials that refers to their ability to deform under tensile stress without fracturing. Now, combining these facts, we can infer that Percy Williams Bridgman experimented with how different factors affect the ductility of materials under high-pressure conditions. The two dependents of ductility that Bridgman would have experimented with can vary; however, common dependents of ductility include temperature and pressure. Answer: Percy Williams Bridgman experimented with the effects of temperature and pressure on ductility."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By the 1890s, owing to the dramatic expansion of the Manual School and a new benefactor in Robert Brookings, the University began to move west. The University Board of Directors began a process to find suitable ground and hired the landscape architecture firm Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot of Boston. A committee of Robert S. Brookings, Henry Ware Eliot, and William Huse found a site of 103 acres (41.7 ha) just beyond Forest Park, located west of the city limits in St. Louis County.

If we are to live up to our educational profession, we must look our aim in the face and honestly practise what we believe.  While training of character and conduct is the accepted aim for education in general, to make this useful and practical each teacher must fix her attention on how this ultimate aim affects her own special part of the whole work.  By watching the free child she will discover how best she can help him: he knows his own business, and when unfettered by advice or command shows plainly that he is chiefly concerned with _gaining experience_.  He finds himself in what is to him a new and complex world of people and things; actual experience is the foundation for a complete living, and the stronger the foundation the better the result of later building.  _The first vital principle then is that the teacher of young children must provide life in miniature; that is, she must provide abundant raw material and opportunities for experience_.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"How does watching the child help the educator find their special part of the whole work?\\" is \\"The educator watches the child see how best she can help him. Once she finds out his needs then she can impart her special part of the whole work\\"?","output":"Yes, according to the paragraph, watching the child helps the educator find their special part of the whole work by identifying how best they can support the child's learning and development. By observing the child's interests, strengths, and challenges, the educator can determine the most effective teaching strategies, activities, and experiences that will nurture the child's growth and help them build a strong foundation for future learning. By paying close attention to the free child, the educator can witness how they naturally gravitate towards gaining experiences in their own unique way. This allows the educator to provide what the child needs in terms of raw material and opportunities for exploration, ultimately leading to an improved educational journey for the child. Moreover, by watching the child, educators can better understand the child's personality, learning preferences, and developmental needs, which helps them to tailor their instruction accordingly. This customized approach to learning, which is informed by an educator's unique understanding of each child, enables them to support the child's character and conduct development more effectively. In summary, watching the child helps the educator find their special part of the whole work by closely observing the child's interests, experiences, and developmental needs to tailor their teaching approach, activities, and materials accordingly.

Michael John Kells Fleetwood was born in Redruth, second child to John Joseph Kells Fleetwood and Bridget Maureen (nee Brereton) Fleetwood. His elder sister Susan Fleetwood, who died of cancer in 1995, became an actress. In early childhood Fleetwood and his family followed his father, a Royal Air Force fighter pilot, to Egypt. After about six years, they moved to Norway where his father was posted on a NATO deployment. In November 1977 Fleetwood and Nicks began having an affair. It would continue sporadically for the next two years during the fallout from the end of Fleetwood's relationship with Boyd, until the pair mutually decided to end the affair. \\"Never in a million years could you have told me that [her affair with Fleetwood] would happen,\\" Nicks later stated. \\"Everybody was angry, because Mick was married to a wonderful girl and had two wonderful children. I was horrified. I loved these people. I loved his family. So it couldn't possibly work out. And it didn't. I just couldn't.\\" Boyd and Fleetwood had in fact begun living together once more in 1976, and would remarry temporarily to assist their children with emigration to the United States. However they quickly divorced for the second time some months later. In November 1978 Fleetwood moved into a Bel Air home with Sara Recor, mutual friend of Fleetwood and Nicks who was at the time married to another music producer. Meanwhile, Fleetwood began working on a charity project to get Fleetwood Mac to tour the Soviet Union, however the Soviet War in Afghanistan later made the tour untenable.  Tusk, Fleetwood Mac's 12th studio album, was released in 1979. The work represented a more experimental direction taken by Buckingham. Fleetwood, recently diagnosed as having diabetes after suffering recurring bouts of hypoglycemia during several live shows, was again instrumental in maintaining the band's cohesion. He placated Buckingham over feelings of creative claustrophobia and discomfort playing alongside Nicks. On the issue of Buckingham taking creative control away from the other members of the group for the creation of Tusk, Fleetwood recounts that his three-day discussion with Buckingham culminated in him telling the latter that \\"if it's good, then go ahead.\\" Though the nature of the album strained relationships again within the band - particularly John McVie, a long-established blues musician who disliked the experimental nature of the album - Fleetwood himself rates the album as his favourite by Fleetwood Mac, and cites the freedom of creative expression allotted to each band member as integral to the survival of the group. The album sold four million copies worldwide, a return noticeably poorer than Rumours. Though Buckingham was blamed by the record labels, Fleetwood linked the album's relative failure to the RKO radio chain playing the album in its entirety prior to release, thus allowing mass home taping.  Later that year, Fleetwood Mac embarked on a lengthy tour that brought them across America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the UK. The tour lasted from October 1979 to September 1980, consisting of 113 concerts.

Laika is memorialised in the form of a statue and plaque at Star City, Russia, the Russian Cosmonaut training facility. Created in 1997, Laika is positioned behind the cosmonauts with her ears erect. The Monument to the Conquerors of Space, constructed in 1964, also includes Laika. On 11 April 2008  at the military research facility where staff had been responsible for readying Laika for the flight, officials unveiled a monument of her poised on top of a space rocket. Stamps and envelopes picturing Laika were produced, as well as branded cigarettes and matches.Future space missions carrying dogs would be designed to be recovered. Four other dogs died in Soviet space missions: Bars and Lisichka were killed when their R-7 rocket exploded shortly after launch on 28 July 1960; Pchyolka and Mushka died when Korabl-Sputnik 3 was purposely destroyed with an explosive charge to prevent foreign powers from inspecting the capsule after a wayward atmospheric reentry trajectory on 1 December 1960.Although never shown, Laika is prominently mentioned in the 1985 film My Life as a Dog, in which the main character (a young Swedish boy in the late 1950s) identifies strongly with the dog.

Although no consensus exists as to where that boundary is drawn, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences defines a short film as \\"an original motion picture that has a running time of 40 minutes or less, including all credits\\". The term featurette originally applied to a film longer than a short subject, but shorter than a standard feature film.  - Crimes of the Future is a 1970 Canadian science fiction film written, shot, edited, and directed by David Cronenberg.  - Science fiction film (or sci-fi) is a genre that uses speculative, fictional science-based depictions of phenomena that are not fully accepted by mainstream science, such as extraterrestrial lifeforms, alien worlds, extrasensory perception and time travel, along with futuristic elements such as spacecraft, robots, cyborgs, interstellar travel or other technologies. Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or social issues, and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition. In many cases, tropes derived from written science fiction may be used by filmmakers ignorant of or at best indifferent to the standards of scientific plausibility and plot logic to which written science fiction is traditionally held.  - Stereo is a 1969 Canadian film written , shot , edited and directed by David Cronenberg .

In his films, the psychological is typically intertwined with the physical.   - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.  - From the Drain is a 1967 short film directed by David Cronenberg while he was in film school.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What happens to imperfective verbs to create others? Context: The verbs of most aspect pairs differ in one of two ways: by prefix or by suffix. In prefix pairs, the perfective verb has an added prefix—for example, the imperfective psát (to write, to be writing) compared with the perfective napsat (to write down, to finish writing). The most common prefixes are na-, o-, po-, s-, u-, vy-, z- and za-. In suffix pairs, a different infinitive ending is added to the perfective stem; for example, the perfective verbs koupit (to buy) and prodat (to sell) have the imperfective forms kupovat and prodávat. Imperfective verbs may undergo further morphology to make other imperfective verbs (iterative and frequentative forms), denoting repeated or regular action. The verb jít (to go) has the iterative form chodit (to go repeatedly) and the frequentative form chodívat (to go regularly). The answer is:","output":"Imperfective verbs undergo further morphology to create other imperfective verbs, specifically iterative and frequentative forms, which denote repeated or regular action. For example, the verb \\"jít\\" (to go) has the iterative form \\"chodit\\" (to go repeatedly) and the frequentative form \\"chodívat\\" (to go regularly)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Adjectives Used: The choice of adjectives used by the reviewer allows us to see the positive nature of the review. Using words such as \\"best\\" and \\"delicious\\" to describe the bruschetta indicates that the reviewer had a very enjoyable experience with the dish. 2. Mention of Flavor Combinations: The reviewer emphasizes the enjoyable aspect of the dish by mentioning the \\"so many delicious flavor combinations.\\" This allows us to understand that the bruschetta has a diverse range of flavors and elements that work well together, contributing to the positive outlook on the dish. 3. Make a Meal of It: By suggesting that the bruschetta is good enough to \\"make a meal of it,\\" the reviewer is indicating that they believe the dish is not only delicious but also satisfying, as it could be turned into a full meal. This further emphasizes the reviewer's positive experience with the bruschetta and suggests that they believe it to be substantial and filling. 4. Highly Recommended: The most significant part of this review is the clear endorsement indicated by the phrase \\"highly recommended.\\" This clearly shows that the reviewer is not only pleased with their experience but also confident enough in the dish's quality to actively recommend it to others. In doing so, they express their support and satisfaction with the bruschetta.

Question 1: \\"What is the meaning of 'vox organalis'?\\" Question 2: \\"What does 'beghairat' mean?\\" Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Step 1: Understand the two terms 'vox organalis' and 'beghairat' and identify their meanings. 'Vox organalis' is a Latin term, where 'vox' means voice and 'organalis' is related to organ or instrument. It is often used in the context of music, specifically in organum, a type of medieval polyphonic music, to refer to the secondary voice or added voice in a composition. 'Beghairat' is an Urdu term that means someone who lacks self-respect, honor, or shame. Step 2: Compare the meanings of the two terms. Now that we have the meanings of both terms, we can see that 'vox organalis' is related to music and the addition of a secondary voice in a composition, while 'beghairat' describes a person's lack of self-respect or shame. Step 3: Determine whether the two meanings are the same. By comparing the meanings, we can conclude that the answer to these two questions is not the same. 'Vox organalis' refers to a musical concept, whereas 'beghairat' is a term describing a personal trait."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

If The office, in a former bodega, was Mazzariello's idea, and he got some help from high places early on., can we conclude that \\"The office has grown rapidly since its inception.\\"?","output":"Based on the information provided, we cannot conclusively determine that \\"The office has grown rapidly since its inception.\\" However, we can infer that Mazzariello's idea of transforming a former bodega into an office might have been successful, especially considering that he received some help from high places early on.  To fully understand and support the conclusion that \\"The office has grown rapidly since its inception,\\" we would require more information and context, such as: 1. Timeframe: An essential factor in determining rapid growth is knowing the period in which the office has been operating. For example, if \\"since its inception\\" refers to a few months or years, different growth rates may be perceived as rapid. 2. Growth Metrics: Quantitative measures such as an increase in the number of employees, revenue, or market share would help to support the statement of rapid growth. Additionally, qualitative aspects such as improved customer satisfaction, brand reputation, and industry recognition could also point towards growth. 3. Industry Benchmarks: Comparing the office's growth to that of other similar businesses would help us understand how it has performed in the context of its industry. Rapid growth could be determined if the office's growth significantly outperforms the industry average. 4. Factors contributing to growth: Identifying the drivers that have led to the office's growth, such as successful marketing campaigns, strategic partnerships, or innovative product offerings, would strengthen the conclusion that the office has experienced rapid growth since its inception. 5. Plans for future expansion: If the office has shared any plans or aspirations for scaling up operations, opening new branches, or extending its market reach, this could also provide evidence in favor of rapid growth. In summary, without additional context and information about the office's performance, industry benchmarks, factors contributing to its growth, and plans for future expansion, we cannot definitively conclude that \\"The office has grown rapidly since its inception.\\" Nonetheless, it's reasonable to assume that Mazzariello's idea, along with the support he received from high places early on, has contributed to the success of the office."},{"instruction":"Q: Question: how many presidential terms did fdr serve?

They are known to be the life of the party and the ones who help to keep morale high in the camp with their quirky humour and outrageous stunts. In their downtime, they often indulge in outrageous bets and friendly competition with other members of the camp, much to the dismay of their no-nonsense commanding officer, Colonel Potter (Jeff Bridges). When a new, perfectionist surgeon, Major Charles Winchester III (Benedict Cumberbatch), arrives at the camp, he quickly earns the rivalry of Trapper and Hawkeye, as he steals the spotlight with his exceptional surgical skills. However, unbeknownst to everyone, Winchester loves to gamble on the side, and soon, Trapper and Hawkeye learn about his secret. Seeing an opportunity, they challenge Winchester to a high-stakes bet to prove who the best surgeon in the camp truly is. Winchester, always eager to show off his skills, agrees to the challenge. The wager is that each of the three surgeons must put up 50% of their earnings in the form of cash, and the surgeon who takes the least time to complete five successful complex surgeries will win the entire pot. The news of the bet swiftly spreads through the camp, energizing the soldiers and causing a series of side bets and rivalries to crop up. With both pride and money on the line, Trapper, Hawkeye, and Winchester gear up for the intense contest. As the challenge progresses, the trio encounters several complications, including unpredictable injuries they're unaccustomed to handling, obstacles caused by their pranks and distractions, and additional drama when they must tackle highly complicated surgeries. The competition heats up when each surgeon shows their professional determination and inventive surgical approaches, pushing the limits of what they've believed they can accomplish. When the final surgery arrives, an unexpected twist occurs, requiring all three surgeons to work together to save a soldier's life, which puts the completion of the bet on hold.

IBM opened a sprawling and sophisticated semiconductor factory here on Wednesday that cost more than 2.5 billion to build and equip, the largest single capital investment the company has ever made. The factory, which opens as the computer chip business is in a slump, is a costly and risky move for IBM. But it is also an expression of confidence by the company that it can remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry, and a commitment that the best place to execute that strategy is in upstate New York. IBM is an exception among computer makers in that it still invests heavily in research to advance the design, manufacture and materials used in semiconductor chips. It is spending more than 500 million a year on semiconductor research and development. The factory will produce a wide range of specialized semiconductors used in everything from the largest mainframe computers to cell phones and video-game consoles. The new plant is part of IBM's push to gain a strong lead in chip-making beyond the personal computer business, where Intel and East Asian chip producers hold the advantage. \\"The core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack the high-performance segments of the market,\\" said John Kelly, senior vice president in charge of IBM's technology group. An advantage to having the semiconductor fabricating factory here, Kelly explained, was that it was very close to its research laboratories in nearby Westchester County, N.Y. To stay ahead in advanced chip technology, he said, moving innovations out of the labs and into the factory as fast as possible is crucial. \\"What we call the lab-to-fab time should be as close to zero as possible,\\" Kelly said. \\"If our strategy were anything but to be on the leading edge, we'd have put the plant in Asia.\\" The new factory, which will begin normal production early next year, will employ about 1,000 people.

The researchers said with more support pharmacies could provide everything from blood-pressure checks and diabetes screening to lifestyle advice. Some pharmacies already do this, but researchers said it very much depended on whether local health bosses were willing to fund them. Lead author Dr Adam Todd said: \\"These results show that pharmacies are well-placed in the community to deliver public health services. \\"This is particularly important for the poorest areas where more people die from conditions such as smoking, alcohol misuse and obesity compared to people from more affluent areas. \\"With easy access without patients needing to make an appointment, the results suggest there is a potential for community pharmacies to deliver public health interventions to areas which need it most.\\" The paper - published in the BMJ Open journal - said pharmacies could play a particularly vital role because the often-quoted inverse care law did not seem to apply. That refers to the fact that the areas with the best health services tended to be the ones with the least health problems. But as the deprived areas had the better access to pharmacies, the reverse was true, the study, which used a postcode analysis, said.

Picking out a \\"typical Singaporean face\\" is thus harder due to the melting pot of ethnicities. - North-east Indian: North-east Indian people have diverse facial features due to their tribal backgrounds. However, some common characteristics include a sharp-pointed nose, narrow eyes, and high cheekbones. 2. Why are people from North East India still referred to as Chinese? How do North East Indians feel about it? Step 1: Consider the historical background and geographical context that may contribute to the confusion between North-east Indians and Chinese. Step 2: Explain the reason: Some people might refer to North-east Indian people as\\"Chinese\\" due to their physical appearances resembling those of East Asian populations. This linkage is predominantly driven by a lack of understanding and awareness about the diverse ethnicities present in India and Asia. Step 3: Discuss North-east Indians' feelings about this misidentification: Many North-east Indians feel frustrated and offended by this mislabeling as it diminishes their unique cultural identities. It reflects a lack of understanding and appreciation for their diverse backgrounds.  3. Do those questions have the same meaning? Step 1: Reiterate the three questions. Step 2: Analyze their meanings:  - Question 1 asks about physical traits differentiating certain Asian groups from one another. - Question 2 seeks to understand why North-east Indians are sometimes referred to as Chinese and their feelings about this misidentification. - Question 3 asks if the previously mentioned questions have the same meaning. Step 3: Draw a conclusion: The questions might be interconnected but do not have the same meaning. Question 1 and 2 involve differentiating people based on ethnicity and understanding the reasons behind misidentification, while Question 3 serves as a meta-question, asking about the meanings of the previous questions. In conclusion, these questions might be related to ethnicity and identity but address different aspects, making them distinct from each other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you are struggling to get motivated, think about other times where you were able to stay on track and accomplish your goals. Think about the outcome of what you accomplished and how you felt when you succeeded. For example, if you are struggling with motivation to exercise, think about a time when you powered through and exercised and felt great afterwards. Think about how you felt during your workout, and how you felt about yourself afterwards for pushing yourself to pursue a worthy goal like getting fit. Even if you don't feel motivated, just try getting started anyways. Sometimes we build things up in our minds and make them seem like they are going to be way worse than they actually are. This is called affective forecasting, and we tend to be terrible at it. By the time you get started you will often find that things aren't so bad. For example, if you are having trouble getting motivated to write a book, open the keyboard and just start typing. Tell yourself that you will type for 5 minutes and if you still aren't motivated you will stop. You may find that by tricking yourself into starting, you will gain motivation and continue to write for much longer than 5 minutes. Part of the battle with motivation is that there are often other seemingly more interesting things in our environment vying for our attention. You can help become motivated to do something by removing the possibility to engage in other actions.  For example, if you are trying to get motivated to do your homework but you keep getting distracted by text messaging friends or browsing the web on your phone, then turn your phone off. Once your phone is off, place it somewhere that you cannot see it, such as deep in your bag. Make it difficult to get to; move your bag so that it is out of your reach. Once you no longer have the easily accessible options of texting with friends or browsing the web, you may find that the alternatives to not doing your homework are not as exciting, and so finding the motivation to do your homework may become easier. A great way to stop being distracted by video games or browsing the internet is blocking it off for a period of time. One of the tools that could be used for this is a software called Cold Turkey which is free. Some people are motivated by competition. Think back on your past and whether there have been cases where you were motivated to accomplish something because you were competing with someone else (or yourself). If this rings true for you, then foster some friendly competition. The other person doesn’t necessarily need to know that you are competing with them, even. You can turn to others to help you with motivation. Tell your friends and family about what you hope to accomplish and what you are struggling with. Don't struggle to tell them thinking what will they think about it. Talking it out with them can help you stay motivated and keep negative feelings that sap motivation at bay.  Surround yourself with people who are positive and are themselves motivated to accomplish their goals. You can catch their positive emotions and positivity and this will help you to be motivated. Summary:","output":"To overcome struggles with motivation, recall past achievements, combat affective forecasting by just starting, eliminate distractions, engage in friendly competition, seek support from friends and family, and surround yourself with positive, goal-driven individuals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A \\"contiguous zone\\" extending a further 12 nautical miles allows for hot pursuit of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. An \\"exclusive economic zone\\" extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres; 230 miles) from the baseline. Within this area, the coastal nation has sole exploitation rights over all natural resources. The \\"continental shelf\\" is the natural prolongation of the land territory to the continental margin's outer edge, or 200 nautical miles from the coastal state's baseline, whichever is greater.

Bold farm used lots of fertilizers over the years, while Shallow farm used organic methods combined with methods from permaculture.  Which farm causes more algae to grow out of control?  Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. A:","output":"Based on the information provided and the hint, it is evident that Bold farm, which uses large amounts of fertilizers, would cause more algae to grow out of control compared to Shallow farm, which utilizes organic methods and permaculture practices. When Bold farm uses excessive amounts of fertilizers, the chemicals containing nitrogen and phosphorus can dissolve in rainwater, leading to a higher concentration of these nutrients in the soil. As runoff carries away the dissolved nutrients, they eventually end up in nearby bodies of water, such as ponds, lakes, rivers, and even oceans. This process is known as nutrient pollution or eutrophication. The presence of high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in the water promotes the rapid growth and multiplication of algae, resulting in algal blooms. These algal blooms can negatively impact water quality, aquatic ecosystems, and even human health. As mentioned, when algae die, decomposers break down their dead tissues. In the process, decomposers consume a significant amount of oxygen available in the water, leading to oxygen depletion. Oxygen depletion, or hypoxia, can result in the formation of dead zones – areas with insufficient levels of dissolved oxygen to support most marine life. The Gulf of Mexico dead zone is a prime example of this phenomenon. The rivers that drain into the Gulf carry fertilizers from agricultural lands, contributing to the growing dead zone issue. On the other hand, Shallow farm uses organic methods and permaculture principles, which generally include practices such as composting, cover cropping, crop rotation, and the use of natural, sustainable fertilizers. These practices help increase soil fertility, enhance biodiversity, and maintain a healthy soil ecosystem, minimizing the risk of nutrient pollution and algal blooms. In conclusion, Bold farm, with its heavy use of fertilizers, is more likely to cause algae growth out of control, leading to negative environmental consequences like dead zones. In contrast, Shallow farm's adoption of organic and permaculture methods reduces the potential for nutrient pollution and its adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. By. Lizzie Edmonds. PUBLISHED:. 11:38 EST, 20 December 2013. |. UPDATED:. 12:41 EST, 20 December 2013. Death: Daniel Jones, who ingested a small but lethal amount of heroin at his home in Wolverhampton. A toddler killed when he took a fatal heroin overdose in. the house where he lived with his drug-addicted parents was failed by social services, according to a report. In May last year, 23-month-old Daniel Jones ingested a tiny but. lethal amount of heroin at the family’s home in Wolverhampton. A serious case review published today concluded those. tasked with looking out for the toddler failed to properly assess the risk. of harm presented to him by his parent’s habitual drug use. If care workers, doctors and health professionals had been. more ‘professionally curious’, had more ‘respectful uncertainty’ and been ‘more. assertive’ in their approach to the family, Daniel’s death may have been. avoidable, it concluded. The report stated there had been ‘a number of missed. opportunities’ to intervene in the boy’s care by the different agencies. involved. However, it also acknowledged there had been ‘examples of good inter-agency. working’. The report’s authors also said despite the. parents’ long-standing drug addiction, none of the care workers involved in the. case foresaw the risk that Daniel might be exposed to heroin, or other. substances. Earlier this year, Daniel’s father Simon Jones, 30, was. jailed for six years after admitting the boy’s manslaughter. His mother. Emma Bradburn, 34, received four years after pleading guilty to allowing the. toddler’s death. Jones fully accepted culpability for his son’s death, admitting he had been taking heroin when his son fell ill. Bradburn was drug-tested following her arrest and found to be clear of the. drug. At their sentencing hearing in July this year, judge Mrs. Justice Thirlwall told the couple it was beyond doubt they had loved their. little boy but, she added: ‘You failed woefully to protect him from the very. obvious dangers you exposed him to. ‘The danger was mortal danger, as you should have realised,’ she said. Following the death, Wolverhampton Safeguarding Children. Board immediately launched a serious case review - carried out whenever a child. has died and abuse or neglect is suspected to have been a factor. The board’s chairman Alan Coe said: ‘What comes across very. strongly from this serious case review is that practitioners who worked with. Daniel and his family should have looked beyond his apparent well-being and. understood what life was like from his perspective. ‘That they failed to do this is clearly unacceptable, and we. have a duty to Daniel to ensure that, as far as is possible, the same thing. doesn’t happen again.’ He added many parents, who had drug addictions, coped with. being parents. The report has put forward 44 recommendations, which have. now either been acted upon or are being implemented, relating to better support. for frontline staff, improvement to working practices and particularly. assessments of the risk harm to a child, and also better inter-agency. communication. Addiction: Daniel's father Simon Jones, 30 and Emma Bradburn, 34,  pictured with their son at their Wolverhampton home. They both used drugs in the house. Both Jones - who had served time in jail for. robbery  and Bradburn, 34, were known to. the addiction services team which at the time was run by the Black Country. Partnership NHS Foundation Trust prior to Daniel’s birth. There was a history of domestic trouble between the couple,. with Bradburn, a heavy drinker, on a prescription for methadone, having been a. heroin addict for 12 years. When she became pregnant with Daniel, they were referred to. Wolverhampton City Council’s children’s services, and following his birth his. development was monitored by health visitors from The Royal Wolverhampton NHS. Trust. The report found that 'Daniel died as a result of an event. that had not been foreseen by any of the professionals involved with the. family' but concluded a more assertive approach by care workers might have made. all the difference. Findings: Had social services been more 'professionally curious' and. been 'more assertive' in their approach to the family, Daniel's death. may have been avoidable, a report today concluded. It acknowledged the parents had not always been. co-operative, but concluded this had made follow-up work all the more. important. However, the report set out the frequent examples where it. found those checks were simply not carried out, or followed through on. There were 11 multi-agency Child in Need meetings between. the parents and care and health workers. But the report’s authors said the. action plans developing out of these meetings were 'not robust and did not. sufficiently address the risks to Daniel of his parents’ substance use.' ‘There do not appear to have been any significant changes. effected by the Child in Need plan over the almost two years that it had been. in place.’ Bradburn, suffering constant pain and disability from a. severe accident prior to the birth of her son, was getting medication from her. GP but also topped up the methadone she was prescribed by taking heroin, she. said, to cope with her on-going discomfort. The report said: ‘Unfortunately there was no collaborative. working between the GP practice and the addiction service, which may have. better addressed her pain and reduced her need for illicit drugs.’ Board chairman Mr Coe said the parents’ drug-use meant their ‘capacity to. meet his needs was compromised’, adding different care and health workers had ‘failed. to fully understand the potential impact of their drug use on Daniel’. ‘Their focus was too much on the parents, and not enough on. their son and the family unit as a whole. ‘Their assessments depended on the parents’ co-operation and. candour, and this was not always forthcoming. ‘Had the practitioners challenged them properly, they may. have appreciated the full extent of the potential risks that Daniel faced.’ Mr Coe added: ‘It is important to stress that things do. change as a result of tragedies like this. Already, we’ve seen a number of. improvements.’ He said the board would be monitoring the implementation of. its recommendations. Aware: Both Jones, who had served time in jail for robbery and Bradburn,. both pictured, were known to the local addiction services team prior to. Daniel's birth. A spokesman for the Black Country NHS trust said: ‘Although. the trust does not provide these addiction services any more, during the 10. months following Daniel’s death, we took action to improve the way the service. supported the whole family and took into account the impact that substance. misuse has upon a child. ‘These improvements were transferred over to the new. provider when the service was decommissioned in April 2013.’ The Royal Wolverhampton Trust, in a statement, said: ‘Patient. safety is of paramount importance to us so we will take the review’s findings. on board and learn any lessons we can in terms of safeguarding children.’ John Welsby, Wolverhampton council assistant children’s services. director, said it was ‘very clear that more could and should have been done by. the agencies who worked with Daniel and his family, including the council’. He added: ‘If the parents are deemed capable of looking. after their child, they must be given, and be seen to act upon, clear advice. about ensuring their children remain safe.This didn’t happen in this instance.’ He added the council had fully accepted all the. recommendations, had implemented changes, and was ‘determined to do all we can. to help prevent a similar tragedy from happening again’. ‘Once again, I’d like to offer our sympathies to Daniel’s. family and reassure them that, through the changes we and our partner agencies. are making, we will be doing all we can to keep our children and young people. safer in the future.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The article discusses the tragic case of 23-month-old Daniel Jones, who died after ingesting a lethal amount of heroin at his family's home in Wolverhampton.

On Earth, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river. The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of ethane, most likely mixed with methane. It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation. Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.  I am facing a new situation today: John wanted to know what makes a lake different from a pond. To that end, he first visited a lake. He labeled that part of the study as case A. Then he visited a pond. He labeled that part of the study as case B. John realized that though both of them were water-bodies, they were very different.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would case B water-body be smaller or larger than case A? Answer:","output":"Case B water-body, which is a pond, would be smaller and shallower than case A, which is a lake."},{"instruction":"Instructions: A text is given in Urdu.

Answer: tropic and sex","output":"In order to come up with the answer, I referred to the definition which asks for two types of hormones that regulate mammalian reproduction. I then provided the answer as \\"tropic and sex,\\" which are the two main categories of hormones that play a vital role in the regulation of mammalian reproduction. Tropic hormones, also known as gonadotropic hormones, are produced mainly by the anterior pituitary gland. They mainly regulate the growth and function of the gonads (testes and ovaries) in both males and females. The primary tropic hormones involved in mammalian reproduction are luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Sex hormones, on the other hand, are produced by the gonads and adrenal glands. They are responsible for the development and maintenance of secondary sexual characteristics and also play a role in sexual behavior and fertility. The main sex hormones involved in mammalian reproduction are estrogens, progestogens, and androgens. By understanding and explaining the roles of these hormones, it is clear how tropic and sex hormones regulate mammalian reproduction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less oxygen is absorbed by blood vessels happens, how will it affect a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that less oxygen is absorbed by blood vessels in the process of respiration. If this were to happen, it would directly affect the amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. Step-by-step analysis of the perturbation's effect on the process: 1. Air enters the lungs through bronchial tubes. 2. Air enters bronchioles. 3. Bronchioles have tiny air sacs called alveoli. 4. Alveoli are surrounded by small blood vessels. 5. Oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels: In this case, the hypothesis says less oxygen is being absorbed by the blood vessels, which will lead to a decrease in the amount of oxygen available in the blood. 6. Vessels deliver oxygen to every cell in the body: Since less oxygen is absorbed by blood vessels, there would be less oxygen available to be delivered to the cells, affecting their functioning. 7. Blood brings carbon dioxide back to lungs: Even with less oxygen in the bloodstream, the blood would still carry carbon dioxide back to the lungs, but the body will be functioning at a lower efficiency due to lack of sufficient oxygen. 8. Carbon dioxide released when you exhale: The carbon dioxide will still be released when you exhale, but the body's overall demand for oxygen may increase, possibly leading to an increase in breathing rate or shortness of breath as it attempts to compensate for the lower oxygen levels. The perturbation's effect on the process is that a lesser amount of oxygen is absorbed by the blood vessels, causing a decreased amount of oxygen to be delivered to the bloodstream. This affects the body's ability to function efficiently and may lead to an increased demand for oxygen, which could result in changes in breathing rate or shortness of breath.

Now, strange things are happening at this year's festival--sounds, lights, and smoke are issuing from Vampire Rock. And last night three vampires (who look like the members of Wild Wind) swooped down and carried off the band members of Matt Marvellous. Most of the finalists have pulled out of the contest and are going home.When Scooby and his party arrive at Vampire Rock, they are warmly greeted by their friends, the Hex Girls, who are scheduled to open the show. Sensing a mystery to be solved, Fred, Daphne, and Velma decide to form a rock group themselves and go undercover as The Meddling Kids.Next band to arrive is the Bad Omens and their rather shady manager, Jasper Ridgeway.

Four years pass and Michael is being ordained to the diaconate at the seminary. However, after ordination he writes a letter of resignation to his superior, Father Matthew, citing a lack of faith. Father Matthew (Toby Jones), apparently wanting to talk Michael out of his decision attempts to catch up to Michael on the street. He trips as he walks over a curb, causing a biker to swerve into the path of an oncoming car. The young woman, believing Michael to be a priest after seeing his clerical garb, asks him for absolution. Unable to refuse, Michael comforts her and performs the ritual absolving her sins. Seeing how calmly he handled the situation, Father Matthew tells Michael he is called to be a priest, whether Michael believes this or not; he later approaches Michael with an invitation to travel to Rome in order to attend a class on exorcism. Michael reluctantly accepts after being told by Father Matthew that he will be levied a 100,000 student loan if he leaves immediately, but that if he still desires to resign from his position after taking the class, then he may be free to leave.During classes, he meets a young woman, Angelina (Alice Braga), who is also taking the course. He soon learns that she is a reporter who has been asked to cover the course for an article in a newspaper. Realizing Michael is a skeptic and is very tentative in his faith, Father Xavier (Ciarán Hinds) later asks Michael to see a friend of his, Father Lucas (Anthony Hopkins), who is a renowned Welsh Jesuit exorcist. Michael agrees and meets Father Lucas at his home, where he sees one of the priest's patients: a pregnant sixteen-year-old girl. It is later revealed that she was raped by her father, which led to her possession.

Answer:","output":"Answer: (a). negative. The sentiment of the sentence \\"uneven performances\\" would likely be perceived as negative. The term \\"uneven\\" often implies inconsistency, irregularity, or unsteadiness. In the context of performances, it suggests that the quality of the performances varied, with some parts being good and others not so good, which prevents them from being considered entirely successful or satisfying. This inconsistency is typically not regarded as a desirable trait in a performance, as people usually expect and appreciate consistency in quality. The sentiment could be interpreted as a mild critique or a hint of disappointment, as it points out that the performance could have been better or consistently good. In contrast, if the sentiment were to be perceived as positive, the sentence might have used terms like \\"dynamic performances\\" or \\"skilled performances,\\" which would emphasize the strong and captivating aspects of a performance. However, the use of \\"uneven\\" in this instance leans more towards a negative connotation, indicating that the quality of the performances was not uniformly praiseworthy.

Write a title for this article: The disputed South China Sea will soon see increased U.S. military activity from five Philippine bases, following the signing of a deal between Manila and Washington that will allow the Pentagon to deploy conventional forces to the Philippines for the first time in decades. The deal — called an Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement — was reached Friday between State Department officials and the government of the Philippines, and will allow the Pentagon to use parts of five military installations: Antonio Bautista Air Base, Basa Air Base, Fort Magsaysay, Lumbia Air Base, and Mactan-Benito Ebuen Air Base. It comes at a time when the United States and its allies in the region have expressed concern about China increasingly deploying military assets to man-made islands in the South China Sea. China has laid claim to a number of islands in the South China Sea, building airbases on tiny spits of land while installing powerful radar and missile launchers. Here's why. (Jason Aldag,Julie Vitkovskaya/The Washington Post) State Department spokesman John Kirby, a retired two-star Navy admiral, said that the United States has “made absolutely no bones about the fact that we take the rebalance to the Asia Pacific region very seriously.” But he added that there is “nothing offensive or provocative” about any of the Pentagon’s deployment of troops to the region. [China testing Obama as it expands its influence in Southeast Asia] “It’s not about selling it to the Chinese or to anybody,” Kirby said, under questioning during a media briefing. “It’s about meeting our security commitments in a serious alliance with the Philippines. That’s what this is about.” The map above shows where the bases are. Antonio Bautista Air Base, on the island of Palawan, is a few dozen miles east of the disputed Spratly Islands, where China’s military buildup is underway. Basa Air Base is also near the South China Sea, and is in a rural area outside Manila. Bautista Air Base is the closest installation the Philippines has to the Spratlys, according to Philippine air force. Other bases were considered, according to Philippine media reports, but ultimately not included in the agreement. China raised questions about the plan Monday, saying that cooperation between the United States and the Philippines should not harm the sovereignty or security interests of any other country. “The U.S. has talked about militarization in the South China Sea. But can it explain whether its own increased military deployment in the region is equivalent to militarization?” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a media briefing, according to Xinhua, a state-run news agency. The United States had a conventional military presence in the Philippines for nearly a century until 1991, when the country ordered the U.S. military to leave its naval base in Subic Bay after the countries could not reach an agreement on the extension of a lease. A U.S. Special Operations task force was based in the Philippines for 13 years after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, but was phased out last year in favor of keeping a small amount of U.S. troops nearby to assist Philippine forces in their fight against Islamist militants.

Therefore, the equation becomes: 236 = -71*d - 119 Step 2: Isolate the term with the variable 'd' by adding 119 to both sides of the equation. 236 + 119 = -71*d - 119 + 119 Adding 119 to 236 results in 355. Therefore, the equation becomes: 355 = -71*d Step 3: Solve for 'd' by dividing both sides of the equation by -71. 355 / -71 = (-71*d) / -71 Dividing 355 by -71 results in -5.

This makes resonant antenna designs inherently narrowband, and they are most commonly used with a single target signal. They are particularly common on radar systems, where the same antenna is used for both broadcast and reception, or for radio and television broadcasts, where the antenna is working with a single frequency.

Context: The Bithynians were a Thracian people living in northwest Anatolia. After Alexander's conquests the region of Bithynia came under the rule of the native king Bas, who defeated Calas, a general of Alexander the Great, and maintained the independence of Bithynia. His son, Zipoetes I of Bithynia maintained this autonomy against Lysimachus and Seleucus I, and assumed the title of king (basileus) in 297 BCE. His son and successor, Nicomedes I, founded Nicomedia, which soon rose to great prosperity, and during his long reign (c. 278 – c. 255 BCE), as well as those of his successors, the kingdom of Bithynia held a considerable place among the minor monarchies of Anatolia. Nicomedes also invited the Celtic Galatians into Anatolia as mercenaries, and they later turned on his son Prusias I, who defeated them in battle. Their last king, Nicomedes IV, was unable to maintain himself against Mithridates VI of Pontus, and, after being restored to his throne by the Roman Senate, he bequeathed his kingdom by will to the Roman republic (74 BCE).

Here are some concepts: bed, comforter, side What is a sentence about these concepts?","output":"A bed with a plush comforter set out on the side can be an inviting sight, depicting the point of tranquility, relaxation, and rest in a bustling world. In general, these three concepts - bed, comforter and side, play pivotal roles in creating an atmosphere conducive for sleep and relaxation. The bed, acting as the central base unit, consists of a sturdy, comfortable, and spacious platform whereon people lay to rest, sleep, or even perform other relaxation activities like reading, watching TV, or simply lying down after a long day. A good-quality bed is essential for maintaining proper ergonomics and body posture; it's designed to support the back and align the spine while one is lying down to ensure a restful, undisturbed sleep.  A comforter, on the other hand, acts as a warming blanket. As its name suggests, it provides comfort to the user by warming them up in cold environments, offering a soft feeling, and adding to the overall aesthetics of the bed. It comes in a variety of materials like down, synthetic fibers, cotton, etc., that decide the level of warmth and ease it will provide. Some people love the weighted feeling of a comforter, valuing the security and snugness it provides. The thickness, texture and size all add to how a comforter enhances the sleep experience. The concept of 'side' in this context can be deciphered in two ways. One interpretation can be related to the side of the bed. Everybody has a preferred side on the bed; it's like an unspoken agreement. Some people prefer the right side while some lean towards the left. This choice can be due to multiple factors like the position of the bed in the room, proximity to a nightstand, charging point, window or even simple personal preference.  Another interpretation of 'side' may refer to having a comforter or any other item such as a book, water bottle, phone, etc., by one's side while lying on the bed. This again is a personal preference and depends on one's habits before sleep. Many people have certain routines they follow before sleeping, and these could include reading a book, scrolling through social media, or perhaps sipping some water or late-night tea. In conclusion, the synergy of these three concepts - bed, comforter, and side, form an essential part of our everyday life, contributing towards a comforting and restful sleep experience. It forms the crux of our sleeping arrangements, whereby a cozy bed and a warm comforter, along with personal side preferences, come together to offer us a comforting sanctuary after a hectic day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the work that was criticised as old-fashioned?  Sir William Turner Walton, OM (29 March 1902 – 8 March 1983) was an English composer. During a sixty-year career, he wrote music in several classical genres and styles, from film scores to opera. His best-known works include Façade, the cantata Belshazzar's Feast, the Viola Concerto, the First Symphony, and the British coronation anthems Crown Imperial and Orb and Sceptre. Born in Oldham, Lancashire, the son of a musician, Walton was a chorister and then an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford. On leaving the university, he was taken up by the literary Sitwell siblings, who provided him with a home and a cultural education. His earliest work of note was a collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Façade, which at first brought him notoriety as a modernist, but later became a popular ballet score. In middle age, Walton left Britain and set up home with his young wife Susana on the Italian island of Ischia. By this time, he had ceased to be regarded as a modernist, and some of his compositions of the 1950s were criticised as old-fashioned. His only full-length opera, Troilus and Cressida, was among the works to be so labelled and has made little impact in opera houses. In his last years, his works came back into critical fashion; his later compositions, dismissed by critics at the time of their premieres, were revalued and regarded alongside his earlier works. Walton was a slow worker, painstakingly perfectionist, and his complete body of work across his long career is not large. His most popular compositions continue to be frequently performed in the 21st century, and by 2010 almost all his works had been released on CD.

By Tom Leonard PUBLISHED: 17:31 EST, 25 December 2012 | UPDATED: 17:35 EST, 25 December 2012 More than 65,000 Americans have called for Piers Morgan to be deported from the U.S. after he criticized pro-gun campaigners on his chat show. A petition on the White House website accuses the television presenter of undermining the 'rights of Americans.' Any petition posted on the site that attracts more than 25,000 signatures guarantees a response from the U.S. government. Last week Mr Morgan repeatedly attacked pro-gun guests on his nightly CNN shows following the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, in which 20 children and six staff died. 'A lot of it comes from his being","output":"a British citizen expressing opinions on American issues, particularly on such a sensitive topic like gun control. The views that Piers Morgan shared on his CNN show did not sit well with the pro-gun supporters in the United States, which led them to initiate the petition to deport him. Piers Morgan's calls for stricter gun control in the U.S. on his show directly challenged the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees the right to bear arms. Many Americans feel very strongly about their right to own firearms, and Morgan's remarks were seen as not only inflammatory but also a direct attack on their constitutional rights. This led to a strong backlash against the television presenter and resulted in the petition. The petition, which was posted on the White House website, grew rapidly in popularity, achieving the necessary 25,000 signatures that guarantee a response from the U.S. government. While the petition may have been successful in catching the administration's attention, it is important to note that the idea of deporting someone over their opinions on political issues is inherently problematic. The U.S. prides itself on the values of free speech and individual liberty, and it is in this context that any response from the government must be made. In response to the petition, the-then White House Press Secretary Jay Carney acknowledged that the petition had reached the signature threshold and would receive a response, but emphasized that it would be consistent with their dedication to the fundamental principles of free speech. Later, the Obama administration reiterated its commitment to the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech, and stated that it would not \\"deport someone who engaged in the political debate.\\" Ultimately, the petition to deport Piers Morgan did not succeed in achieving its goal. However, it did serve to create a significant amount of publicity regarding the broader debate over gun control in the United States. It demonstrated the passion and intensity with which many Americans defend their right to bear arms and also exposed the massive divide that exists in the country over the issue of gun control. Piers Morgan continued hosting his show on CNN until 2014 when it was canceled due to low ratings. While Morgan was not deported for his remarks on gun control, the controversy surrounding the debate highlighted the challenges that come with navigating the complex and contentious issues that often arise in a diverse and politically charged society such as the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Why were all electric computers seen as superioir to the z2?\\"  Context: \\"Early digital computers were electromechanical; electric switches drove mechanical relays to perform the calculation. These devices had a low operating speed and were eventually superseded by much faster all-electric computers, originally using vacuum tubes. The Z2, created by German engineer Konrad Zuse in 1939, was one of the earliest examples of an electromechanical relay computer.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"All-electric computers were considered superior to the Z2 for several reasons, including speed, reliability, efficiency, and technological advancements. The Z2, designed by German engineer Konrad Zuse in 1939, was an early example of an electromechanical relay computer which used electric switches to drive mechanical relays for performing calculations. Despite its innovative design for the time, it was eventually outperformed by all-electric computers that utilized vacuum tubes and later, transistors.  1. Speed: One of the primary reasons why all-electric computers were seen as superior to the Z2 is the difference in operating speeds. Electromechanical relay computers like the Z2 were generally slower because they relied on mechanical components to complete calculations. The movement of mechanical parts took significantly longer than the near-instantaneous flow of electrons in electric circuits. All-electric computers, on the other hand, took advantage of vacuum tubes, which allowed for much faster switching and processing times. This leap in speed made electric computers more suitable for complex calculations and simulations. 2. Reliability: The mechanical parts in the Z2 were prone to wear and tear, which led to reduced reliability over time. All-electric computers, given their lack of moving parts, were less susceptible to mechanical failure and therefore offered a more dependable performance. Moreover, the vacuum tubes in all-electric computers provided a more stable operating environment, reducing the risk of errors and contributing to a more accurate and consistent processing of information. 3. Efficiency: In addition to speed and reliability, all-electric computers were also more energy-efficient than their electromechanical counterparts. Whereas the Z2 required a significant amount of energy to power its electric switches and mechanical relays, all-electric computers were able to perform the same tasks using less power. This was because vacuum tubes and, later, transistors, required less energy to switch on and off compared to the mechanical operations of an electromechanical computer. This improved energy efficiency also led to reduced operational costs, making all-electric computers a more attractive choice for businesses and research institutions. 4. Technological Advancements: The development of electronic components such as vacuum tubes and transistors allowed for even greater advancements in computing technology. These advancements resulted in the miniaturization of electronic devices and the integration of multiple electronic components on a single substrate, leading to the development of integrated circuits and microprocessors. This progress formed the basis of modern computers, which offered increased processing capabilities and versatility in their applications. 5. Expandability and Scalability: Electric computers had the advantage of being more easily expandable and scalable compared to electromechanical systems like the Z2. As new components were developed, they could be added to existing electric computer systems to improve performance or functionality. This ability to increase computing power with additional components made all-electric computers a more appealing choice for researchers and scientists, who required ever-more powerful machines to tackle increasingly complex problems. In summary, all-electric computers were considered superior to the electromechanical Z2 for several reasons, such as increased speed, reliability, efficiency, technological advancements, and expandability. The development of vacuum tubes and, later, transistors, paved the way for modern computer systems, leaving the Z2 and other electromechanical computers as an important, but ultimately less capable, stepping stone in the history of computing technology."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is something that all human have, and it tells the body what to do. DNA is the reason that we look like our parents, because we get some of their DNA to make our own. People have been trying to understand the human body for a long time. In 1860, Mr. Mendel discovered why we look the same as other people in our family. It is because of small things called \\"genes\\"  in our body. In 1953, two scientists, Watson and Crick, found out that those small parts are really messages. They're written in the DNA with a special language. In 1961, another two scientists found the first \\"word\\" that they could understand in that language. It shows how DNA tells the cell  to build its parts. So far, scientists have found all the words in the DNA map, but we still do not understand what they all do. By understanding what just one \\"word\\" means, we can help to save people from several illnesses. So the more we understand, the more doctors will be able to do. Most people hope that this will help to make better medicine and help sick people. Other people worry that when we learn more \\"words\\" and and find out more information, we will use it in the wrong way, just to make people more attractive, or stop sick people getting jobs. Question: When did Mr. Mendel discover why we look the same as other people in our family? Yes or no, is the answer \\"In 1860\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"In 1860.\\" Mr. Mendel discovered why we look the same as other people in our family during that year. His discovery was based on understanding the role of genes, which are small components in our body that determine our traits and appearances. These genes are part of the larger genetic material called DNA, which serves as a \\"map\\" for the human body and influences the development and functioning of living organisms. Mendel's groundbreaking work laid the foundation for the field of genetics, paving the way for future discoveries that would eventually lead to more detailed knowledge about DNA and how it works. In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick identified the structure of DNA as a double helix, revealing that genes are essentially coded messages. Later on, in 1961, scientists discovered the first \\"word\\" in the genetic code, which provided further understanding of how DNA instructs cells to build their components. Although the complete \\"map\\" of the human DNA has been identified, there is still much to learn about the specific functions of all the genes within it. As scientists continue to decipher the language of DNA, they hope to apply this expanding knowledge to the development of more effective medical treatments and therapies. This, in turn, will enable doctors to address a wide range of illnesses and improve the overall quality of healthcare. However, there are also concerns that misuse of this information could lead to unethical practices, such as using genetic information to discriminate against individuals or for purely superficial purposes, like enhancing physical attractiveness. Despite these potential drawbacks, the ongoing exploration of the human genome promises to yield invaluable insights into our biological makeup, ultimately helping us better understand ourselves and the world around us."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His team is providing the conference with a status update on the rover, while simultaneously publishing six scholarly papers online in the journal Science. Some of what is described in these papers, we have heard before. But there is now additional detail that should lend credibility to the earlier claims. Most of the discussion centres on a six-month investigation of a shallow depression in the crater floor close to the robot's August 2012 landing site. Known as Yellowknife bay, this topographic low has been shown through the drilling and chemical analysis of rock samples to contain ancient mudstones. Today, they are cold, dry and dusty, but their sediments were originally laid down in water that flowed in streams and eventually pooled into a lake. It is clear the conditions at the time of deposition would have been more than suitable for a wide range of microbial lifeforms. The scientists can tell that water - the \\"lubricant\\" of life - was significant and persistent in Gale, and that it must have been broadly neutral in pH, and not at all briney. Much of this is evident from the presence of clay minerals, which tend to form only under particular conditions. \\"I think what's very important here is that we've now made the case that these clay minerals were formed in situ,\\" said Prof Grotzinger. \\"They were not detrital; they were not blown in. They are representative of the aqueous environment that is suggested by the [look of the rocks], and that environment would have been a habitable one.\\" Key to this habitability is the availability of essential elements, such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulphur, nitrogen and phosphorous.  Curiosity has found them all to be present, and in a form that microbes could have accessed. The robot also detects minerals and compounds in various states of oxidation, which organisms could have exploited in simple reactions to obtain the energy needed to drive metabolism. The depression where Curiosity found the mudstones is only about 60m across, but the geologists on the science team believe this is just one small exposed area, and that the rock member (it has been dubbed \\"Sheepbed\\") may extend up to 30 square km or more, hidden beneath other sediments. The thickness of the mudstone layer also hints at the length of time the water might have been present. Curiosity scientists estimate this to be perhaps hundreds to thousands of years, just based on the visible Sheepbed layers. When the other rocks lying on top of the mudstones are taken into account - rocks that unmistakably also have been touched by water at some point - it is entirely plausible the wet environments in Gale persisted from millions to tens of millions of years. \\"Even if a surface lake dries up temporarily, there should still be groundwater in the shallow subsurface,\\" said Prof Grotzinger.  \\"And because we're advocating chemolithoautotrophy and not photoautotrophy, those chemolithoautotrophs should be just fine down in the groundwater, and when the lake comes back again they just rise up to the surface and carry on.\\" And there are some tighter constraints now on when in Mars' history these benign conditions existed, because Curiosity has been able to date the mudstones by measuring the ratio of radioactive potassium and argon atoms found within them. The result is 4.21 billion years (plus or minus 350 million years). \\"It's been a dream to do radiometric dating on Mars,\\" said Curiosity participating scientist Prof Ken Farley.  \\"Prior to these measurements, the only way you could determine time was by counting impact craters, using a model derived from Earth's Moon where rocks have actually been dated. The model is then scaled to Mars, but it is quite uncertain,\\" he told BBC News. Care has to be taken in interpreting the Curiosity result, however. It refers to the age of the source minerals in the sediments washed into the lake and not the actual time of the mudstones' deposition.  This would probably have been several hundred million years later. A different technique also reveals when erosion exposed the mudstone surface seen on the planet today. This was about 78 million years ago (give or take 30 million years) - very recent, geologically speaking. The result is significant because it will guide the strategy on where Curiosity should drill in future to find organic (carbon-rich) molecules. Their detection is a goal of the mission, but they are easily degraded in Mars' harsh radiation environment. The dating work, however, tells the science team to look for locations that are very freshly eroded, even more recently than the Sheepbed drilling points. Organics could very well survive in such places just a few centimetres below the surface. Organic molecules are important because they bear down further on the habitability question. All life as we know it trades on complex carbon chemistry.

Chemolithoautotrophs do not require light to function; they acquire energy from rocks and minerals. On Earth, these lifeforms can be found underground, in caves, and at the bottom of the ocean. The Gale Crater resembles the early Earth according to Curiosity chief scientist Prof John Grotzinger. The researchers found essential elements for life in forms that microbes could access, as well as minerals and compounds in various oxidation states that could be exploited by organisms for energy metabolism.

The Gobi Desert is located in northern China and southern Mongolia and has a wide range of temperatures, sometimes experiencing extreme cold. The Sahara Desert is situated in North Africa and is the largest hot desert in the world, with temperatures that can become extremely hot during the day but can also drop significantly at night. On the other hand, the Great Sandy Desert is located in Australia and consists mostly of sand dunes and sparse vegetation, with a harsh climate that includes high temperatures and low precipitation rates.

To understand why, let's break down the premise and hypothesis. Premise: President Clinton is rehiring Joycelyn Elders. The premise states that President Clinton is in the process of, or has the intention to, rehire Joycelyn Elders. The word \\"rehiring\\" implies that Joycelyn Elders has previously worked for President Clinton and is now being given a position once again. Additionally, the mention of Greg Diamond, Jay D. Majors, and Peter Carlin having similar answers demonstrates that there are multiple sources supporting the claim that President Clinton is rehiring Joycelyn Elders. Hypothesis: President Clinton will not be bringing Joycelyn Elders back. The hypothesis counters the premise by stating that President Clinton will not be bringing Joycelyn Elders back. The phrase \\"will not be bringing\\" implies a negative and definitive stance on the issue, meaning Joycelyn Elders is not expected to return to work under President Clinton. The hypothesis, therefore, contradicts the premise directly. Since the hypothesis contradicts the premise, we can conclude that based on the given premise, the hypothesis \\"President Clinton will not be bringing Joycelyn Elders back.\\" is false. The premise presents evidence suggesting that President Clinton is in fact rehiring Joycelyn Elders, which is the opposite of what the hypothesis posits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is Yahoo's billion-dollar bet on synergy worth it? When Google went public in 2004 for 85 a share, I wrote a column questioning such a high valuation for a company built on a math equation. Wasn't it inevitable that someone would come along with a better search algorithm? Google closed Monday at 908.53 a share. So take what I'm about to say with a pinch of cyber-salt. Yahoo is paying 1.1 billion for the blogging service Tumblr, which enjoys a loyal following among millions of young, cool, edgy and influential users, but little, if any, profit. Let me reiterate that: 1.1 billion for a privately held company that barely pulls down pocket change, if that. Moreover, Tumblr's young, cool, edgy and influential users are so fickle that Yahoo's chief executive, Marissa Mayer, had to declare Monday that Yahoo wouldn't screw up the site by making Tumblr more like, you know, Yahoo. At the risk of sounding like an old fogy, what the heck kind of business deal is this when more than a billion bucks is being spent on a financially dubious tech outfit, and the new owner has to swear it won't muck things up by actually owning it? \\"That's a fair question,\\" said John Blackledge, a financial analyst at the investment firm Cowen & Co. \\"But the purchase seems reasonable given the potential synergy.\\" I spoke with a handful of Wall Street types after the Yahoo-Tumblr deal was announced, and nearly every one of them used the word \\"synergy.\\" It's a word that's tossed around any time some mega-deal gets announced. When AOL said it was buying Time Warner for 160 billion in 2000, it was all about the synergy of the two media heavyweights. That deal is now viewed as one of the dumbest mergers in U.S. corporate history. EBay's 2005 purchase of Skype for 2.6 billion was also said to be a model of synergy. EBay was so synergized that it sold off Skype at a huge loss just four years later. And that brings up another point: Can you buy your way to cool? After EBay dumped Skype, the online calling service was snapped up in 2011 by Microsoft for a hefty 8.5 billion. Synergy was the watchword. Skype certainly isn't hurting. Microsoft estimates that a third of the world's voice calls now occur on Skype. But in an increasingly text-driven world, is that like cornering the market on a commodity that fewer and fewer people want? And is Microsoft any cooler for having Skype in its fold? You could argue that anything a techno-dinosaur like Microsoft touches becomes, by definition, instantly uncool. Yahoo has the same image problem. Yet all the analysts I spoke with said one of the reasons Yahoo would pay such a high price for Tumblr is a desire to bask in the blogging site's reflected cool. \\"Yahoo has been needing to attract a younger demographic, which is how you attract advertisers,\\" said Ron Josey, managing director of JMP Securities. \\"Maybe Tumblr is the spark to do that.\\" Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Yahoo's acquisition of blogging service Tumblr for 1.1 billion raised eyebrows for spending such a hefty sum on a company with little to no profit, with some analysts stating the deal seems reasonable for potential synergy.

A judge sentences Haley to her ultimate nightmare, attending an elite gymnastics academy run by legendary coach Burt Vickerman (Jeff Bridges).Haley was once considered one of the most talented gymnasts in the US. She made it to the World Championships, but the previous year she walked out of competition in the middle of the finals, costing the American team the gold medal and leaving many people hurt and crushed making her one of the most hated people in gymnastics.After arriving at the school, Haley has a talk with Coach Vickerman, who convinces her to take up the sport once again at least until she can enter an upcoming invitational competition. Vickerman convinces her that she can use the prize money from the competition to repay some property damage debts she still owes and after that, she can leave gymnastics once and for all. Disliking the sport's rigid rules and intense training schedule, Haley is reluctant to come out of retirement. Her attitude toward her fellow gymnasts (as well as her past that she avoids talking about) causes conflicts. After getting the cold shoulder the first day at the gym, Haley realizes what she is up against.At the invitational, Haley's talent shines and her return from gymnastics retirement seems for the better. But all is not what it seems in the scoring system. She starts to remember one of the many reasons she retired: the flaws in judging. The panels do not look at the difficulty of the move nor do they look at the technique; they merely take deductions for unimportant minor errors. As Haley narrates: \\"It doesn't matter how well you do.

This academy is known for its regimented training and strict adherence to the rules, forcing Haley to confront her past and deal with the challenges of being back in the world of gymnastics. When Haley arrived at the academy, she initially struggled with the strict rules and intense training schedule. However, after a conversation with Coach Vickerman, she agreed to participate in the sport once more, at least until she could take part in an upcoming invitational competition and use the prize money to pay off her debts from the property damage incident. Despite facing conflicts with her fellow gymnasts and dealing with the complicated emotions surrounding her past actions, Haley's talent becomes evident as she starts competing again. The school itself appears to be a high-pressure environment where the focus is primarily on following established rules and expectations within gymnastics. Through Haley's experiences and interactions with the other gymnasts and her coach, we can see that this prestigious academy holds a highly competitive atmosphere, and expects a certain level of dedication and commitment to the sport from its students. However, as Haley's journey continues, she starts to remember one of the main reasons she retired from gymnastics in the first place: the flaws in the judging system. She becomes increasingly frustrated with the way scoring is conducted and how judges seem to disregard the difficulty or technique of a gymnast's moves, opting instead to deduct points for minor mistakes that do not accurately reflect a performer's skill or effort.

The academy is characterized by its rigorous training and strict adherence to the rules in the world of gymnastics. During her time at this academy, Haley rediscovers her passion and talent for the sport, while also grappling with the flaws in the judging system and her conflicted emotions towards her past actions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In her messy closet, she found many stuff such as toys, clothes, and shoes all mixed up.  Now, Betty had two options to choose for storing her things - she could either use cardboard boxes or plastic totes. Cardboard boxes are made from thick paper, and plastic totes are made from strong plastic material. Both options could help her keep her items nice and organized. Option (i): If Betty chose the cardboard boxes, they would still last for a long time. Cardboard is quite sturdy for holding things, but it can get soggy if it gets wet and can break apart if it's too heavy. And, if mice or other small creatures come into Betty's room, they might chew on her cardboard boxes. Option (ii): If Betty decided to use plastic totes, these would last even longer than the cardboard boxes because they are made from strong plastic material. They are waterproof, so even if it gets wet, her things will stay safe and dry. Plus, mice or other small creatures won't be able to chew through the plastic easily. After thinking about both options, Betty decided to go with plastic totes to keep her closet organized. This way, her belongings would be safer and more protected.

Brian helped the woman comfort the crying child and Neil did not because  OPTIONS:  -Brian has much compassion..  -Neil has much compassion..","output":"Brian helped the woman comfort the crying child and Neil did not because Brian has much compassion. This quality of his has always set him apart from others, be it with his friends, his family, or even with strangers that he meets on the street. He's always been the guy who's ready to help, the guy who empathizes with the struggles of others and wishes to alleviate their pain in any way that he can. Brian has spent a lifetime cultivating his compassionate nature. From his earliest memories, he can recall his mother's words of wisdom emphasizing the importance of being understanding, considerate and lending a helping hand wherever it was needed. He lived by these principles, growing into a remarkable human being who saw the value in the happiness and well-being of those around him. Neil, on the other hand, wasn't devoid of compassion. It's just that his perspective on life was different from Brian's. He had a more practical approach, believing that sometimes people needed a push to handle their problems themselves, rather than relying on others. This attitude made him strong and independent but often kept him from empathizing with other people's pain. Growing up, Neil was raised to believe that people must be responsible for their own lives and sort their problems out independently. His parents emphasized teaching him to be self-reliant, never to depend on anyone for anything. While this approach made him resourceful, it throttled his natural inclination towards compassion, making empathy a lesser trait in him. It was not that Neil didn't care about others, but rather, he believed that people should be emotionally strong enough to handle their problems without needing help from others. This incident with the crying child further emphasized the difference in their personalities and highlighted the contrasting ways in which Brian and Neil approached situations. While Brian immediately got involved, trying to comfort the child and ease his anguish, Neil stood back, assessing the situation and waiting to see if the woman and the child could resolve the issue on their own. The world needs both compassionate souls like Brian and practical-minded individuals like Neil. While Brian's compassionate nature often instills hope and love in the hearts of the people he encounters, Neil's practicality helps him tackle life's hurdles with pragmatic solutions. These contrasting traits ensure that they both look at life from different perspectives, making every interaction and decision a unique blend of human emotions. Together, with their distinct traits, Brian and Neil manage to balance the nuances of empathy and pragmatism in everyday life. Although in this particular instance, Brian's compassionate nature led him to aid the woman and the crying child, Neil's presence and practical approach were essential in ensuring that they continue to find optimal solutions to life's challenges. In conclusion, although in this event, it was Brian who reached out to comfort the crying child due to his compassionate nature while Neil did not, it goes to show how people can possess different yet valuable traits that make them unique. Life is a complex tapestry of diverse emotions and approaches, and it is through such differences that we learn the importance of understanding and accepting one another despite our contrasting perspectives and beliefs."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the band member who was upset when a past band member visited the studio and no one initially recognized him? ?  After a tour of the UK performing Dark Side, Pink Floyd returned to the studio in January 1975 and began work on their ninth studio album, Wish You Were Here. Parsons declined an offer to continue working with them, becoming successful in his own right with the Alan Parsons Project, and so the band turned to Brian Humphries. Initially, they found it difficult to compose new material; the success of The Dark Side of the Moon had left Pink Floyd physically and emotionally drained. Wright later described these early sessions as \\"falling within a difficult period\\" and Waters found them \\"tortuous\\". Gilmour was more interested in improving the band's existing material. Mason's failing marriage left him in a general malaise and with a sense of apathy, both of which interfered with his drumming.Despite the lack of creative direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several weeks. During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series of concerts in Europe. These compositions became the starting point for a new album whose opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett. The songs provided a fitting summary of the rise and fall of their former bandmate. Waters commented: \\"Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt ... [that] indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd.\\"While Pink Floyd were working on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio. Thorgerson recalled that he \\"sat round and talked for a bit, but he wasn't really there\\". He had changed significantly in appearance, so much so that the band did not initially recognise him. Waters was reportedly deeply upset by the experience. Most of Wish You Were Here premiered on 5 July 1975, at an open-air music festival at Knebworth. Released in September, it reached number one in both the UK and the US. Answer:","output":"Waters"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Information:  - A Mahjanapada (Sanskrit ) (literally \\"great realm\\", from \\"maha\\", \\"great\\", and \\"janapada\\" \\"foothold of a tribe\\", \\"country\\") is one of the sixteen kingdoms or oligarchic republics that existed in ancient India from the sixth centuries BCE to fourth centuries BCE. Two of them were most probably 'ganas' i.e. republics, and others had forms of monarchy. Ancient Buddhist texts like the \\"Anguttara Nikaya\\" make frequent reference to sixteen great kingdoms and republics which had evolved and flourished in a belt stretching from Gandhara in the northwest to Anga in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent and included parts of the trans-Vindhyan region, prior to the rise of Buddhism in India.  - Patna , is the capital and largest city of the state of Bihar in India. Patna is the second-largest city in eastern India after Kolkata. It had an estimated population of 1.68 million in 2011, making it the 19th largest city in India. With over 2 million people, its urban agglomeration is the 18th largest in India. Patna also serves as the seat of Patna High Court.  - Ajatashatru (Pali: Ajtasattu; Kunika) was a king of the Haryanka dynasty of Magadha in North India. He was the son of King Bimbisara and was a contemporary of both Mahavira and Gautama Buddha. He forcefully took over the kingdom of Magadha from his father and imprisoned him. He fought a war against Vajji, ruled by the Lichchhavis, and conquered the republic of Vaishali. Ajatashatru followed policies of conquest and expansion. He defeated his neighbours including the king of Kosala; his brothers, when at odds with him, went to Kashi, which had been given to Bimbisara as dowry. This led to a war between Magadha and Kosala. Ajatashatru occupied Kashi and captured the smaller kingdoms. Magadha under Ajatashatru became the most powerful kingdom in North India.  - Shishunaga (or Shusunaga) (c. 444  363 BCE) was the founder of the Shishunaga dynasty of the Magadha Empire in the present day northern India.

Rajagriha was initially known as 'Girivrijja' and later came to be known as so during the reign of Ajatashatru.  - Pataliputra (IAST: ), adjacent to modern-day Patna, was a city in ancient India, originally built by Magadha ruler Ajatashatru in 490 BCE as a small fort near the Ganges river. Extensive archaeological excavations have been made in the vicinity of modern Patna. Excavations early in the 20th century around Patna revealed clear evidence of large fortification walls, including reinforcing wooden trusses.  - Bihar is a state in the eastern part of India. It is the 13th-largest state of India, with an area of . The third-largest state of India by population, it is contiguous with Uttar Pradesh to its west, Nepal to the north, the northern part of West Bengal to the east, with Jharkhand to the south.

John Edward McGee Jr. (born October 19, 1969), known professionally as John Edward, is an American television personality, author and alleged psychic medium. Born in Glen Cove, New York, Edward says he was convinced at a young age that he could become a psychic. After writing his first book on the subject in 1998, Edward became a well-known and controversial figure in the United States through his shows broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel beginning in July 2000 and We TV since May 2006. According to an opinion piece by Ed Stockley in the Los Angeles Times, Edward's alleged psychic abilities have never been verified using the scientific method. Critics of Edward assert he performs the mentalist techniques of hot reading and cold reading, in which one respectively uses prior knowledge or a wide array of quick and sometimes general guesses to create the impression of psychic ability. Choosing the first reading from a two-hour tape of edited shows as a sample, illusionist and skeptic James Randi found that just three of 23 statements made by Edward were confirmed as correct by the audience member being read, and the three statements that were correct were also trivial and nondescript. In another incident, Edward was said to have used foreknowledge to hot read in an interview on the television show Dateline. James Underdown of the Independent Investigative Group (IIG) attended a Crossing Over show in November 2002 and said \\"there were no indications of anyone I saw collecting information... none of his readings contained the kind of specific information that would raise an eyebrow of suspicion. ... John Edward was a bad cold reader. He, too, struggled to get hits, and in one attempt shot off nearly 40 guesses before finding any significant targets.\\"  Underdown also claimed that Edward's apparent accuracy on television may be inflated by the editing process. After watching the broadcast version of the show he had attended and recorded, Underdown attributed a great deal of Edward's accuracy on television to editing and wrote, \\"Edward's editor fine-tuned many of the dead-ends out of a reading riddled with misses.\\" In 2002, Edward said, \\"People are in the studio for eight hours, and we have to edit the show for time, not content. We don't try to hide the 'misses'.\\" Edward has denied ever using hot or cold reading techniques.  In March 2018, skeptical activist Susan Gerbic published an article in Skeptical Inquirer summarizing a number of techniques which she says are used by psychics, such as Edward, to achieve their effects.","output":"This text is about John Edward McGee Jr., also known as John Edward, an American television personality, author, and alleged psychic medium."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Low-income domestic violence victims may find long-term legal help -- representation in divorces or child-custody disputes -- hard to come by, if two organizations now providing such help can't replace their lost funding. The Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake and Utah Legal Services are already facing cutbacks after they were refused a federal grant of more than 450,000 in September. The board overseeing the state Office of Crime Victim Reparations [CVR] has voted to deny a stopgap funding request from the two organizations. While describing the request as a worthy cause, board members agreed Tuesday that funding divorces or custody disputes was outside their focus -- providing direct services for crime victims. The 175,000 requested would have allowed the legal aid groups to maintain a skeleton staff to continue providing help beyond emergency protective orders for victims, completing existing cases and offering services in limited cases. The groups also plan to enlist more pro bono attorneys through coordination with the Utah State Bar. \\"We don't have a lot more options,\\" said Anne Milne, executive director of Utah Legal Services, after learning of the CVR refusal Wednesday. The organization has already lost some staff through attrition and has turned away some cases, she said. Milne said she may ask the board overseeing her organization to give her until November to seek funding from additional sources. Without additional funding, the outlook for longer-term legal help is unclear. For two years, the groups had received 18-month civil legal assistance grants from the U.S. Department of Justice and had used them to provide such assistance. But last month, a third request was denied. Funding used to help victims obtain emergency protective orders remains in place, said Milne and Stewart Ralphs, executive director of the Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake. Although an order's requirements that an abuser stay away from a victim may remain in effect for years, protective orders only settle issues such as child custody, child support, custody and property arrangements for 150 days. Many judges are reluctant to address those issues in emergency protective orders, since the decrees stay in effect for such a short time, Milne and Ralphs said. \\"The likelihood a victim will return to her abuser increases if she cannot permanently sever the relationship and establish workable support, custody and property arrangements,\\" the funding request to CVR said. The Department of Justice said it denied the grant application, in part, because evaluators did not see enough collaboration between the organizations and victims' advocates, Ralphs and Milne told CVR board members. While the two said they believe their organizations coordinate well, the organizations cannot appeal the grant denial. Although CVR board members considered giving the money as a loan, not a grant, their vote on the funding request -- taken after Milne and Ralphs left the meeting -- was unanimous.  Question: \\"Did the Office of Crime Victim Reparations vote to uphold the funding request and if not, why was the stopgap measure refused?\\" Response: \\"They denied the request because it did not provide direct services for crime victims\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?

The statement in Finnish highlights the importance of the water and water services sector for Europe, both currently and in the future. This sector includes a range of services and activities, such as water supply, wastewater management, water infrastructure, and water resource management. The significance of the water sector can be explained by several factors, which are discussed below. 1. Population growth: As the European population continues to grow, the demand for fresh, safe drinking water will increase. This puts pressure on the water  supply, necessitating efficient water management systems and technologies to meet the needs of the people. 2. Climate change: Europe is experiencing increased effects of climate change, including rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts. These changes can directly impact water resources, making it all the more important for Europe to invest in resilient water infrastructure and adopt sustainable water management practices. 3. Water quality: Maintaining water quality is a top priority for the European Union, as clean water is vital to public health and the environment. EU legislation, such as the Water Framework Directive and the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive, set strict standards for water quality. The water sector plays a significant role in ensuring that these standards are met, by providing safe and effective wastewater treatment services and closely monitoring and managing water resources. 4. Economic growth: The water sector contributes to economic growth through job creation, investments in research and development, and providing crucial services to other industries, such as agriculture, energy, and manufacturing. As Europe seeks to boost its economy and recover from economic crises, a thriving water sector can support various industries while ensuring the long-term sustainability of water resources. 5. International cooperation: Europe is part of a global community, and as such, is responsible for contributing to international efforts to address water challenges, such as water scarcity and pollution. Through various global platforms, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, Europe can collaborate with other regions in developing and implementing innovative solutions for water management. In summary, the water and water services sector holds significant importance for Europe, both now and in the future. Ensuring that this sector is robust, sustainable, and adaptable to challenges such as climate change and population growth will be crucial for the continued wellbeing of European citizens and the environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: My Life In Ruins Movie plot: Georgia (Nia Vardalos) is a Greek American teacher who came to Greece to teach at a local college about Classic Greece. However, budget cuts caused her to be laid off and forced her to get a job as tour guide. She believes she has hit rock bottom when she loses her passion in everything. Informed by her boss, Maria (Bernice Stegers), that she ranks poorly as a guide because the tourists think she's boring, Georgia finds herself leading a tour around Greece with an assorted group of misfit tourists whom she believes is a failure since they seem to care more about buying T-shirts than learning about history and culture. Instead, she wishes to have a good group of Canadian tourists whom seems to be more engaged in history and culture than wanting to go shopping for souvenirs and hang out at the beach. Maria disagrees with Georgia's assessment, informing her that they are more interested in Nico (Alistair McGowan), a rival male tour guide also working for Maria because he's engaging in tours. As Georgia's tour departs, her driver is injured in an accident and is replaced by another driver, Poupi (Alexis Georgoulis). In a clash of personalities and cultures, everything seems to go wrong and Georgia is on the verge of quitting as she can't connect with the group to get them to appreciate Greece and its culture. This is made worse when she voices her disgust with Maria for favoring Nico over her in letting his group stay in better hotels than her group. After being ignored again, Georgia decides to send a letter to inform her that she's quitting at the end of her tour. One day, an older traveller named Irv Gideon (Richard Dreyfuss), helps Georgia see why she can't connect with the group: she finds them annoying and is bored with her current job. Therefore, he shows her how to have fun and teach her how to be more engaging to the tourists. This helps Georgia learn more about the current group of tourists she has and open her eyes to the different places where they come from. In doing so, she also teaches them the... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"My Life in Ruins,\\" Georgia forms a genuine connection with multiple characters throughout the film, particularly with Irv Gideon and Poupi.  Irv Gideon, played by Richard Dreyfuss, is an older traveler in Georgia's tour group. He becomes a pivotal character in helping Georgia find her passion again and rediscover her love for Greece and its rich history. Through his guidance and wisdom, Georgia begins to see the importance of engaging with her tourists and addressing their interests to create a better experience for them. When Georgia starts taking Irv's advice, her approach to tour-guiding shifts from focusing on her own knowledge of history and culture to considering the needs and desires of her diverse group of tourists. This adjustment allows her to form deeper connections with them, as she is learning to appreciate their individual backgrounds and stories. Her newfound perspective also allows her to develop a deeper understanding and appreciation for her home country and the beauty it holds. Furthermore, Georgia forms a genuine connection with her bus driver, Poupi, played by Alexis Georgoulis. At the beginning of the film, their personalities clash, and Georgia struggles with Poupi’s carefree attitude, which she believes is unprofessional. However, as they spend more time together and Georgia learns to adapt her approach to tour-guiding, she and Poupi begin to bond. Their connection grows stronger, and they both learn valuable lessons from each other. Poupi helps Georgia rediscover her love for Greece and the joy and beauty in the everyday life of its people. Plus, as a romantic subplot, their connection blossoms into a love story as well. In conclusion, throughout the movie \\"My Life in Ruins,\\" Georgia forms genuine connections with both Irv Gideon and Poupi, which ultimately help her rediscover her passion in the history and beauty of Greece. These connections play a significant role in transforming Georgia's life, as they restore her love for her job as a tour guide and enhance her understanding and appreciation of different people and their stories."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is the answer: What was the name of the ‘Lucky Rabbit’ in an early Disney animated film?","output":"The name of the 'Lucky Rabbit\\" in an early Disney animated film is Oswald.  Oswald the Lucky Rabbit was an anthropomorphic rabbit and Walt Disney's first original, star character. The first Oswald cartoon, entitled \\"Trolley Troubles,\\" debuted in Universal Theatres on September 5, 1927. Oswald was the first recurring cartoon character created by Walt Disney, a character whose success paved the way for the creation of other legendary characters like Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, and more. Before a falling out with hit film distributor, Oswald appeared in 26 silent, black-and-white shorts (produced from 1927 to 1928). After a rights dispute, Universal retained the rights to Oswald, and Disney was forced to create a new character. That character turned out to be Mickey Mouse. The character Oswald was an instant hit with audiences and helped put Disney and his studio on the map. Oswald's personality in his initial appearances was in the tradition of the trickster archetype prominently featured in American folklore, personifying qualities like wit, cunning, and resourcefulness. His physical appearance was typical of the funny animals of the era - anthropomorphic, mostly bipedal, and wearing clothing. Disney and his team eventually lost the rights to Oswald the Lucky Rabbit to Universal Studios, but in a bit of good fortune for the storyline of Oswald, the rights were reacquired by The Walt Disney Company in 2006. Since then, Oswald has made appearances in various Disney projects, securing his place in the Disney canon alongside other beloved characters.  The story of Oswald's creation, success, loss, and eventual recovery provides a fascinating look into the early days of animation and the business dealings of Walt Disney. Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, an important figure in animation history, contributed greatly, albeit indirectly, to Disney's transition from short films to full-length animated features. Thus, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, the first hit character of Walt Disney, not only laid foundations for most of the silent cartoon characters that preceded it but also set the stage for the Disney animation empire. Oswald's legacy, thus, is distinguished as a lucky rabbit, indeed, a significant stepping stone in the illustrious journey of Walt Disney."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q: The lungs are a series of ever-narrowing tubes that end in a myriad of tiny sacs called what?   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Breathing certainly is a major contribution to your health! Without breathing, we could not survive. Curiously, the act of breathing itself is little more than an application of Boyle’s law. The lungs are a series of ever-narrowing tubes that end in a myriad of tiny sacs called alveoli. It is in the alveoli that oxygen from the air transfers to the bloodstream and carbon dioxide from the bloodstream transfers to the lungs for exhalation. For air to move in and out of the lungs, the pressure inside the lungs must change, forcing the lungs to change volume—just as predicted by Boyle’s law. The pressure change is caused by the diaphragm, a muscle that covers the bottom of the lungs. When the diaphragm moves down, it expands the size of our lungs. When this happens, the air pressure inside our lungs decreases slightly. This causes new air to rush in, and we inhale. The pressure decrease is slight—only 3 torr, or about 0.4% of an atmosphere. We inhale only 0.5–1.0 L of air per normal breath. Exhaling air requires that we relax the diaphragm, which pushes against the lungs and slightly decreases the volume of the lungs. This slightly increases the pressure of the air in the lungs, and air is forced out; we exhale. Only 1–2 torr of extra pressure is needed to exhale. So with every breath, our own bodies are performing an experimental test of Boyle’s law.   Choices:  - brachii  - testes  - glands  - alveoli   A: A:","output":"The correct option is - alveoli.

Q:Information:  - In quantum mechanics, a boson is a particle that follows BoseEinstein statistics. Bosons make up one of the two classes of particles, the other being fermions. The name boson was coined by Paul Dirac to commemorate the contribution of the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose in developing, with Einstein, BoseEinstein statisticswhich theorizes the characteristics of elementary particles. Examples of bosons include fundamental particles such as photons, gluons, and W and Z bosons (the four force-carrying gauge bosons of the Standard Model), the recently discovered Higgs boson, and the hypothetical graviton of quantum gravity; composite particles (e.g. mesons and stable nuclei of even mass number such as deuterium (with one proton and one neutron, mass number = 2), helium-4, or lead-208); and some quasiparticles (e.g. Cooper pairs, plasmons, and phonons).  - A quark (or ) is an elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter. Quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons, the most stable of which are protons and neutrons, the components of atomic nuclei. Due to a phenomenon known as \\"color confinement\\", quarks are never directly observed or found in isolation; they can be found only within hadrons, such as baryons (of which protons and neutrons are examples) and mesons. For this reason, much of what is known about quarks has been drawn from observations of the hadrons themselves.  - Gravity, or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass are brought toward (or \\"gravitate\\" toward) one another, including planets, stars and galaxies. Since energy and mass are equivalent, all forms of energy, including light, also cause gravitation and are under the influence of it. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects and causes the ocean tides. The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing, forming stars  and the stars to group together into galaxies  so gravity is responsible for many of the large scale structures in the Universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther objects.  - Particle physics (also high energy physics) is the branch of physics that studies the nature of the particles that constitute \\"matter\\" (particles with mass) and \\"radiation\\" (massless particles). Although the word \\"particle\\" can refer to various types of very small objects (e.g. protons, gas particles, or even household dust), \\"particle physics\\" usually investigates the irreducibly smallest detectable particles and the irreducibly fundamental force fields necessary to explain them. By our current understanding, these elementary particles are excitations of the quantum fields that also govern their interactions. The currently dominant theory explaining these fundamental particles and fields, along with their dynamics, is called the Standard Model. Thus, modern particle physics generally investigates the Standard Model and its various possible extensions, e.g. to the newest \\"known\\" particle, the Higgs boson, or even to the oldest known force field, gravity.  - In particle physics , a hadron i / hædrn / ( Greek :  , hadrós , \`\` stout , thick '' ) is a composite particle made of quarks held together by the strong force ( in a similar way as molecules are held together by the electromagnetic force ) . Hadrons are categorized into two families : baryons , made of three quarks , and mesons , made of one quark and one antiquark . Protons and neutrons are examples of baryons ; pions are an example of a meson . Hadrons containing more than three valence quarks ( exotic hadrons ) have been discovered in recent years . A tetraquark state ( an exotic meson ) , named the Z ( 4430 )  , was discovered in 2007 by the Belle Collaboration and confirmed as a resonance in 2014 by the LHCb collaboration . Two pentaquark states ( exotic baryons ) , named P +  - In particle physics, mesons (or ) are hadronic subatomic particles composed of one quark and one antiquark, bound together by the strong interaction. Because mesons are composed of quark sub-particles, they have a physical size, with a diameter of roughly one fermi, which is about the size of a proton or neutron. All mesons are unstable, with the longest-lived lasting for only a few hundredths of a microsecond. Charged mesons decay (sometimes through mediating particles) to form electrons and neutrinos. Uncharged mesons may decay to photons. Both of these decays imply that color is no longer a property of the byproducts.    What entity does 'hadron' has the relation 'interaction' with? A:","output":"Hadrons have the relation 'interaction' with quarks. Hadrons are composite particles made of quarks held together by the strong force (in a similar way as molecules are held together by the electromagnetic force).

By 1930, Szigeti was established as a major international concert violinist. He performed extensively in Europe, the United States and Asia, and made the acquaintance of many of the era's leading instrumentalists, conductors and composers. In 1939, to escape the war and Nazi persecution of the Jews, Szigeti emigrated with his wife to the United States, where they settled in California. (A year later, Bartók also fled to America, and just two days after his arrival, he and Szigeti played a sonata recital at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.)During the 1930s, 1940s and into the 1950s, Szigeti recorded extensively, leaving a significant legacy.  Notable recordings include the above-mentioned Library of Congress sonata recital; the studio recording of Bartók's Contrasts with Benny Goodman on clarinet and the composer at the piano; the violin concertos of Beethoven, Brahms, Mendelssohn, Prokofiev (No. 1) and Bloch under the batons of such conductors as Bruno Walter, Hamilton Harty and Sir Thomas Beecham; and various works by J.S. Bach, Busoni, Corelli, Handel and Mozart. One of his last recordings was of the Six Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin by Bach; although his technique had deteriorated noticeably by that time, the recording is prized for Szigeti's insight and depth of interpretation.In 1950, Szigeti was detained at Ellis Island upon returning from a European concert tour and was held for several days, officially \\"temporarily excluded\\" from the country.

Please briefly summarize this news article: How Much Does a Blood Test Cost? Maybe 10,000 We’re used to comparison shopping, and we know where we can get a better deal on the exact same box of cereal or the same pair of sneakers. But when it comes to the routine blood test you get every time you see the doctor, how budget-conscious can you be? Not very, new research shows. In an eye-opening report published in the journal BMJ Open, Dr. Renee Hsia, an associate professor of emergency medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and her colleagues found that cholesterol panel could cost patients anywhere from 10 to 10,169 — a more than thousand-fold difference. A basic metabolic test for things like blood sugar ranged from 35 to 7,303. “I was expecting a little variation, maybe two-fold, or even three-fold,” says Hsia, who also studied differences in total costs for procedures like having the appendix or tonsils removed. “But I wasn’t expecting this amount.” She focused specifically on blood tests because they are automated and not prone to variations in the quality of the technician or other bells and whistles required to spit out results. “It should be like buying a loaf of bread,” she says, with only slight differences in price. MORE: An End to Medical-Billing Secrecy? But the thousand-fold range shows just how seemingly random health care pricing can be. “There is probably nothing justifiable [for the high cost] in this case,” she says. Even if the most talented technician were performing the lipid analysis using the most sophisticated machine, it’s hard to imagine those services requiring 10,000 worth of equipment or labor. And it’s not as if individual hospitals are guilty of overcharging consistently. One hospital may have high fees for one test and lower fees for others. In Hsia’s study of 150 California hospitals, the one that charged more than 10,000 for the cholesterol test was not the same one that billed more than 7,000 for a metabolic test. Factoring in things such as whether the hospital was for- or not-for-profit, whether it was a teaching hospital, and the percentage of patients covered by Medicaid still didn’t explain the gap in pricing. MORE: Bitter Pill: Why Medical Bills Are Killing Us Master lists at each hospital set these fees, she says, and in recent years, some hospital administrators have admitted that even quantitative factors such as supply, demand or overhead costs don’t factor into these prices. In 2013, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius released the prices of 100 of the most common inpatient services at hospitals across the country in an effort to make the process more transparent. And if you think you won’t have to worry about these prices because you’re insured, you may be feeling these costs the next time your premium creeps up. While private insurers negotiate with hospitals to accept certain fees, that rate is a percentage of the original charge — the higher the charge, the higher that negotiated fee will be. And insurers pass on those costs to their members. So can a financially responsible patient comparison shop for hospitals with the most reasonable fees? Not really. California law mandates that hospital report what they charge for any 25 of the most common outpatient tests. But they don’t specify what those tests are, and hospitals can chose which ones they provide to the public. The entire list of fees is also available, but not as easy to navigate for patients who aren’t familiar with the codes for the tests. “It’s not that transparent, and hard for patients to access the information,” says Hsia. “When people hear about price variation, they say it’s probably just one hospital, or one blood test or one procedure, and they think it’s the exception rather than the rule,” says Hsia. But evidence is mounting that’s not the case. “It’s not a hospital issue, it’s a fundamental problem because there is not a rational way to determine hospital pricing, and that needs to be addressed.” Summary:","output":"A new study published in the journal BMJ Open reveals the cost of a cholesterol panel blood test may differ dramatically, ranging anywhere from 10 to 10,169. The thousand-fold difference highlights an issue with seemingly arbitrary healthcare pricing. Even taking factors such as whether the hospital was for-profit or not-for-profit, or a teaching hospital into consideration, these extreme differences in pricing still could not be justified. This discrepancy not only affects those without insurance, but insured individuals may also feel the impact through increased premiums. Healthcare pricing transparency remains a significant issue and calls for a more rational method of determining hospital prices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They see lights in the sky and a furtive figure outside a window, but the family refuses to believe the brothers' story until Tommy plays them the tape. Suddenly, a high-frequency screech incapacitates everyone but six-year-old Rose. When it stops, Kurt straps a flashlight to his shotgun and decides to get everyone in his truck and leave.The truck won't start. The battery has melted so they return to the house.

Question: This article: Fifteen disparate African American men board a bus in Los Angeles bound for Washington, D.C., where they plan on attending the Million Man March. Other than their race, destination, and gender, the men have nothing in common: George is the trip organizer; Xavier is an aspiring filmmaker hoping to make a documentary of the March; Flip is the vain but charismatic and openly homophobic and sexist actor; Kyle and Randall are a homosexual couple; Gary, a biracial police officer; Jamal is a former gang banger turned devout Muslim who has evaded prosecution for the murders he committed; Evan Jr., is a petty criminal who has been permitted to break probation to attend the march on the condition that he remain handcuffed to his father, Evan Sr. As the bus travels across country, Xavier conducts interviews with the various attendees, allowing them to express their views on race, religion, and politics. The interviews often provoke outbursts from other men on the bus, invariably leading to many political confrontations. Jeremiah, the eldest member of the group, is an 80-year-old former alcoholic who lost his job and family, has found new meaning in life and is energized by the Million Man March, and embraces his African heritage; his philosophies on the black experience and stories of precolonial Africa serve to unite the men and ease tensions and the infighting among them. En route the bus breaks down and the men are forced to board another bus, driven by an ethnically Jewish white man named Rick. A couple of the passengers harass Rick as a white man, and Rick ultimately refuses to drive any further, citing the group's prejudice and his opposition to antisemitic remarks made by the leader of the march, Louis Farrakhan. George, himself a bus driver, accuses Rick of cultural racism, but begrudgingly agrees to cover for Rick who leaves.

If you feel rushed while going about your normal day, ask yourself why. Will the world end if you get home five minutes late? What if you stop to talk to the random people you meet each day? If you do stop to talk, you'll be amazed how much more connected you'll feel to your community. Hang around people who have patience. I had a lot less patience before I met my husband. Being around him daily has certainly given me a greater appreciation for the art of waiting. He's not only a great example of someone who lives his life patiently, but he tells me if I'm getting too anxious or impatient. If you don't know someone who's patient in your immediate circle of friends, take a class like yoga where meditation is part of the art.  _ .

Later, she passes the card catalogue shelves as they open behind her and suddenly begin to hurl their contents into the air.

Venkman continually flirts and lies about her abilities, while enjoying administering electric shocks to the male student. Having finally had enough, the male student departs, and Venkman continues to flirt with the young woman. Dr. Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) enters, and frantically begins to tell Venkman about the sighting at the library, insisting they leave at once to check it out.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a premise: Rex and Hawks agree that any home run hit that far must approximate the maximum-distance trajectory--that is it can only be a high fly or a normal fly, not a line drive. Here is a hypothesis: Rex and Hawks explained that it's because the angles and the momentum of the ball make it impossible otherwise. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Before we analyze this situation, it is essential to define the terms in context. 1. High Fly: A high fly is a type of ball hit into the air with a relatively steep launch angle, typically resulting in a higher and longer trajectory. 2. Normal Fly: A normal fly is a type of ball hit into the air with a moderate launch angle, resulting in a more typical trajectory that is less high and less far than a high fly. 3. Line Drive: A line drive is a type of ball hit into the air with a low launch angle, often resulting in a flat and fast trajectory that is generally closer to the ground than a fly ball. The premise states that for a home run to be hit at the maximum possible distance, it must be either a high fly or a normal fly, and not a line drive. Now let's consider the hypothesis: Rex and Hawks explain that the angles and momentum of the ball make it impossible to achieve maximum-distance trajectory otherwise. To analyze if the hypothesis can indeed be concluded as true based on the premise, we must first understand the factors that impact the distance traveled by a hit ball. The key factors are: 1. Launch angle: The angle at which the ball leaves the bat. 2. Exit velocity: The speed at which the ball leaves the bat. 3. Spin rate: The rate at which the ball spins as it travels through the air. By examining these factors, we can determine if the premise supports the hypothesis: 1. Launch angle: Maximum-distance trajectories require an optimal launch angle. If the launch angle is too shallow, the ball will not have enough elevation to travel far, reducing its chances of hitting a home run. On the other hand, if the launch angle is too steep, the ball will travel high but not far horizontally, again decreasing the probability of hitting a home run. Researchers have found that the ideal launch angle for maximum distance is between 25 and 35 degrees, which falls in the range of a high fly or a normal fly. Therefore, this part of the hypothesis is supported by the premise. 2. Exit velocity: The speed at which the ball leaves the bat has a significant impact on the distance the ball can travel. Higher exit velocities typically result in longer distances. However, a line drive with a high exit velocity might not be hit at the optimal launch angle to achieve maximum distance. Thus, even with a high exit velocity, a line drive would not be able to achieve the same distance as a high or normal fly with an optimal launch angle. This supports the premise that a home run hit for maximum distance must be a high or normal fly, and not a line drive. 3. Spin rate: The rate at which a ball spins as it travels through the air can also impact its distance. A higher spin rate can result in more lift, allowing the ball to travel further. In general, fly balls have higher spin rates than line drives, which can help them travel over the fence. This additional lift supports the hypothesis that the momentum and angles associated with high and normal fly balls make them more suitable for hitting maximum-distance home runs. In conclusion, analyzing the key factors affecting the distance a batted ball can travel - launch angle, exit velocity, and spin rate - it appears that the premise supports the hypothesis. High and normal fly balls with optimal launch angles and sufficient exit velocities are more likely to result in home runs that achieve maximum distance. Line drives cannot reach these distances due to their low launch angles, even with high exit velocities. Thus, if the premise is true, the hypothesis that Rex and Hawks propose is well-supported and can be considered true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Bossa Nova, which translates to \\"New Wave\\" or \\"New Trend\\" in Portuguese, evolved and gained international recognition during the late 1950s and early 1960s. This highly rhythmic and smooth dance style is a musical fusion born from a mix of Samba and Jazz, showcasing Brazilian culture as well as their passion for music and dance. The dance has its roots in the beachside neighborhoods of Rio de Janeiro, where it first emerged as a new expression of the Brazilian spirit and identity. Bossa Nova was globally popularized through renowned musicians and composers, such as Antonio Carlos Jobim, Vinicius de Moraes, and João Gilberto, who introduced the world to the captivating sound and rhythm of this unique dance. The classic Bossa Nova song, \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\" (Garota de Ipanema), composed by Antonio Carlos Jobim and Vinicius de Moraes, played a significant role in bringing international attention to this dance style. The Bossa Nova dance is typically danced to a 2/4 time signature, and the music is characterized by rich harmonies, gentle and flowing melodies, and minimal percussive elements. The dance itself is beautifully elegant and understated, with subtle hip movements, a relaxed and upright posture, and an emphasis on smooth, continuous motions. Bossa Nova had a considerable impact on the international dance scene and remains a timeless and enduring symbol of Brazilian culture. To this day, people around the world enjoy the captivating rhythms and graceful movements of this iconic dance from Brazil."},{"instruction":"Q:Rivers are usually larger than streams, and rivers can be divided into rivers and streams.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. It will come as no surprise to those working in the UK’s higher education (HE) sector that universities are currently suffused with anxiety. The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states: “Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.” Yet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour. In 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time-management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I end this small run of blog posts with the question posed by Professor Brian Boyd at the beginning of our evening: Do we want to close the achievement gap? We know we can close the gap. It’s been done or almost been done before in Scottish education, but the answers have been ignored as they pass us by. The simple clue is this: poverty is single biggest predictor of achievement, and according to research (Hammonds sic, reference required), aged 10, a child living in poverty is 60% less likely to get to university. Boyd borrowed from his own mother’s report card to ask us what kind of education we desire. Is it the academic success at all costs route, or is there another option we need to value as much, if not more? His mother’s report card, one that prevented her from becoming a secondary school pupil in Glasgow, is filled with G and FG, until the last point: Character and conduct - excellent. What kind of pupils do we want to develop in Scotland? What do we value in our assessment system? Opening up opportunity for all is a tough game to play when the examination system rewards only certain types of behaviour, few of them related to what the Curriculum for Excellence says we stand for. In his own small community in East Kilbride, three secondary schools enter a period of meltdown as the local rag sets about creating its own local league table of performance, with those three ‘teams’ in competition for the top spot (or at least not the bottom one). Therefore, we must stop basing “the gap” largely on attainment. First of all, Boyd would like us to remove the traditional, and non-sensical academic/vocational divide.

In another trailer, funnyman Jeff \\"Fatty\\" Portnoy (Jack Black) plays every member of \\"America's favorite obese family\\" in the highly flatulent The Fatties: Fart 2. The final trailer, for a film called Satan's Alley, features Australian \\"five-time Oscar winner\\" Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) and Tobey Maguire (as himself) as two monks who begin an impassioned affair.We are taken, via the narration of John \\"Four Leaf\\" Tayback (Nick Nolte), into a gruesome battle of the Vietnam War. This is actually a scene from Tropic Thunder, a big-budget adaptation of Tayback's wartime memoir. Starring as the central platoon are Speedman, Lazarus, Chino and Portnoy, as well as young character actor Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel). To play the role of Sgt. Lincoln Osiris, an African American, Lazarus has dyed his skin dark and refuses to break character. (\\"I don't drop character 'till I done the DVD commentary.\\") A take of Osiris crying over Tayback's (Speedman's) blown-off hands is ruined when Speedman is unable to cry and Lazarus dribbles uncontrollably into Speedman's face. The ruined take causes great frustration for the film's director, Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan). The chaos is exacerbated when the film's pyrotechnics expert, Cody (Danny McBride), mistakes Cockburn's conniptions for a signal to set off several expensive explosions.Faux Access Hollywood clips reveal that Speedman's career has been on a downward spiral.

But when the yearly games for the disabled were started at Stoke Mandeville, England in 1948 by Sir Ludwig Guttmann, the situation began to change. Sir Ludwig Guttmann, who had been driven to England in 1939 from Nazi Germany, had been asked by the British government to set up an injuries center at Stoke Mandeville Hospital near London, His ideas about treating injuries included sport for the disabled. In the first games just two teams of injured soldiers took part .The next year, 1949, five teams took part. From those beginnings, things have developed fast. Teams now come from abroad to Stoke Mandeville every year. In 1990 the first Olympics for the disabled were held in Rome, in the same place as the normal Olympic Games. Now, every four years the Olympic Games for the disabled are held, if possible, in the same place as the normal Olympic Games, although they are organized separately. In other years games for the disabled are still held at Stoke Mandeville, In the 1984 Wheelchair Olympic Games, 1,064 wheelchair athletes form about 40 countries took part. Unfortunately, they were held at Stoke Mandeville and not in Los Angeles, along with the other Olympics. The games have been a great success in helping the progress of international friendship and understanding, and in proving that being disabled does not mean you can't enjoy sport. One small source of disappointment for those who organize and take part in the games, however, has been the unwillingness of the International Olympic Committee to include disabled events at the Olympic Games for the able-bodied. Perhaps a few more years are still needed to persuade those fortunate enough not to be disabled that their disabled fellow athletes should be included. Question: What do we know about Sir Ludwig Guttmann from the passage? Options: A: He is an early organizer of the games for the able-bodied B: He is welcomed by the British government C: He is an injured soldier. D: He is from England. Answer:","output":"B: He is welcomed by the British government"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Which sample would have lower pH value, sample A or sample B?  In his chemistry lab David is learning about acids. He took three solutions to identify them correctly, sample A, sample B, and sample C. Sample A is a strong acid; sample B is a weak acid; and sample C is not an acid. David needs to identify the content of each sample by learning about their attributes.  Hint: If a solution has a higher concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, it has a pH lower than 7. A solution with a pH lower than 7 is called an acid . As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases. Therefore, the more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value is.

It is not possible to tell. The statement \\"A woman is looking at a big dog and clothes in a store window\\" provides specific details about a situation: there is a woman observing some items displayed in a store window. These items include a big dog and clothes. The woman's attention is on these items, but the action of looking does not necessarily imply that she is window shopping. Window shopping, as an activity, typically refers to the act of browsing items in store displays with no intention of buying, or just assessing the available options. It could range from casual glances to more serious observations, but the main point is that the person is not planning to make a purchase. In this statement, there is no specific indication about the intention of the woman or whether she has any plans to buy. Moreover, there is no context provided about her shopping habits, her purchasing power, or her past behavior in similar situations. Therefore, it cannot be definitively confirmed that she is window shopping for the items she is observing. While the scenario described does depict a common situation for someone to be window shopping, it is important to keep in mind that people might also look at store displays to gather inspiration, kill time, or maybe spot a specific item they want to purchase.

Write an article based on this summary: Thousands of Venezuelans in cars and motorbikes have filled roads across the country in motorised protests against President Nicolas Maduro. Article:","output":"Title: Venezuelan Citizens Rally in Massive Motorized Protests Against President Maduro Thousands of discontented Venezuelans gathered in their cars and motorcycles, filling roads across the nation in an unparalleled show of defiance against President Nicolas Maduro. The motorized protests, which took place simultaneously throughout the country, highlight the escalating political and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela under Maduro's administration, as the economy continues to deteriorate and civil unrest grows. The wave of public outrage and vehicular protests is seen as a response to the government's continued mismanagement of the economy, rampant corruption, food and medical supply shortages, and human rights abuses. The Motorized Opposition, as they have come to be known, is pushing for change and is voicing their objections to Maduro's policies through this unique and coordinated form of demonstration. Several key cities witnessed significant turnouts for the motorized protests, including the capital Caracas, Maracaibo, Valencia, and Barquisimeto. Protesters took to the streets adorned with Venezuelan national flags, banners, and placards to express their grievances with the current administration. Many can be seen honking their horns while driving at a slow pace to keep the protest orderly and safe amidst deafening chants of \\"No more Maduro. We want change.\\" Venezuela has struggled with an ongoing economic crisis in recent years, which first began with the decline in global oil prices in 2015, further compounded by controversial economic policies, allegations of currency manipulations, and social upheaval within the country. According to the United Nations, an estimated 5.4 million Venezuelans have emigrated from their homeland since 2014, due to high levels of poverty, joblessness, soaring inflation, a non-functioning health care system, and a lack of adequate nutrition. The driving force behind these motorized protests is the opposition politicians led by Venezuelan National Assembly President and interim President Juan Guaidó, recognized by 60 nations as the legitimate president of Venezuela. Guaidó's commitment to challenging Maduro's regime has emboldened Venezuelans in their quest for change. However, despite their recognition internationally, the opposition has faced considerable challenges in exercising power, as Maduro's government continues to rely on the support of the military and key Venezuelan institutions. As this massive motorcade takes shape, Guaidó has called on people to maintain pressure on Maduro's regime, emphasizing the importance of civil society voicing their discontent and engaging in nonviolent resistance. Advocates of peaceful resolution remain hopeful that these collective efforts will help initiate democratic dialogue and lead to free and fair elections, paving the way for needed policy reforms. Maduro's government has not been completely silent. They have condemned these motorized protests, characterizing them as a direct threat to national security and accusing the opposition of fostering chaos and violence to provoke foreign intervention. Moreover, the government has already mobilized security forces and has warned about a crackdown on further demonstrations, raising the specter of escalating tensions between protesters and authorities. Nevertheless, the Motorized Opposition remains undeterred, showing no signs of backing down in their pursuit for change, and manifesting their unwavering determination through these coordinated actions across the nation. As the citizens of Venezuela rally together in mass civic dissent, these protests underscore the formidable grassroots movement challenging Maduro's authority and their unyielding desire to see their country rise from the depths of its political and economic quagmire. In conclusion, the remarkable mass motorized protests in Venezuela illustrate the power of collective action and shine a light on the dire political and humanitarian situation that has gripped the country. It is crucial for international observers and policymakers to pay close attention to these events as they unfold, and support efforts to resolve the crisis peacefully through dialogue and democratic means. It is only then that Venezuela can begin to expect a future of economic stability, social progress, and a return to its full potential."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Who inspired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to throw a million bucks at South Dakota? A country singing troubadour candidate who plays guitar, drives a minivan and makes a GOP tracker the star of his latest web ad. Meet Rick Weiland, the Democratic hopeful who's trailing former Republican Governor Mike Rounds in a four-way race that also includes former Republican Senator Larry Pressler, running as an Independent and Gordon Howie, also an independent. The ad features Weiland performing a modified version of the song \\"Wagon Wheel,\\" which was originally written by Bob Dylan and later made popular by the band Old Crow Medicine Show. The original song's chorus \\"rock me momma like a wagon wheel\\" resonates well with both pop and country music fans. Weiland, who has been turning popular music into campaign ads since the start of his campaign, was looking for a song that would connect more with millennials. \\"I was driving around one day and that song came on\\" Weiland said. He then thought, \\"Well, that's gonna work.\\" When Weiland first started making music videos into campaign ads, he admitted it that it takes a lot of courage. \\"We were a little concerned because no one had done it before,\\" he said, \\"but we figured, what the heck, let's just keep coming up with good songs. It's been a lot of fun.\\" Wieland has also turned music into a family tradition, performing in a band with his two daughters, his brother and nephew called the \\"Take It Back Band.\\" They perform regularly throughout South Dakota and even hold music festival events called \\"Rick-Stock,\\" which is an obvious take on the famous Woodstock festival. Weiland started combing music and politics in 1997 when he was a Regional Director for FEMA under the Cinton administration. \\"We actually wrote some great FEMA songs,\\" he said while reflecting on his time traveling with his former FEMA colleague and friend David DeCourcy. With years of experience playing and traveling on the road, it's safe to say Weiland took this latest musical endeavor to a new level, modifying the lyrics to fit his campaign message. He plays the guitar while singing his own chorus, \\"So I'm runnin' for the Senate but I ain't a big wheel, don't have an army, just my automobile.\\" Weiland might not be running a 9 million campaign like his Republican opponent Mike Rounds aims to raise, but he does have a new million-dollar bump to sing about. The DSCC will spend 1 million on the race, mostly for television ads and to support field operations, Bloomberg Politics first reported. \\"The DSCC obviously must think I can win,\\" he said. \\"After slugging on my own here for more than a year and half with very little money, I haven't spent all my time fundraising, I've spent my money going to town to town and people are going to vote someone who has earned the privilege to represent them, not someone who is trying to buy their way in.\\" But it looks like the money won't help Weiland produce another \\"Wagon Wheel\\" style ad, with the funds expected to flood airwaves with attack ads hitting GOP nominee Rounds. That's something groups have already done, with ads attacking Rounds over his alleged involvement in a visa program scandal in the state. Those types of ads will likely help Weiland, but could also be a boon for Pressler, the independent who surged into second place in a SurveyUSA poll released Wednesday. Weiland is now trailing both Rounds and Pressler by seven and four points, respectively, according to the poll. And the poll indicates Pressler is mostly pulling votes away from Weiland. The investment in attack ads, rather than pro-Weilland ads suggests Democrats are confident either a Weiland or Pressler victory will help them keep control of the Senate. Bloomberg Politics reported that Democrats are confident Pressler, who endorsed Obama in 2008 and 2012, would caucus with Democrats if elected to the Senate, though Pressler has not said who he would side with. It wouldn't be the first time this year Democrats have pinned their hopes on an Independent candidate polling better than his Democratic counterpart. In Kansas, Democrats pulled their nominee out of the race to bolster businessman Greg Orman's bid to unseat Republican Sen. Pat Roberts. Orman also has not said who he would caucus with, though Republicans have tried to paint him as \\"Obama's candidate for the Senate.\\" Pressler also won't get a chance to reproduce his style of advertising, one of which played up a popular Hollywood movie. Pressler's campaign even bought air time during the Oscars to play up the fact that he turned down a bribe in the Abscam scandal depicted in the movie \\"American Hustle.\\" As for Weiland, he's going to keep on campaigning on the ground, and keep on singing. He revealed he has one more campaign music video to release before the Nov. 4 election. It's going to be a modified Johnny Cash classic, but instead of \\"I Walk The Line\\" it'll be called \\"I Draw The Line\\" and will go after one of Weiland's campaign staples, getting big money out of politics. Also, here is the Old Crow Medicine Show's version of \\"Wagon Wheel.\\" . CNN's Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.

My complaints here concern the movie's pacing and the material at hand. While using archival film and letters lends the film a fresh and interesting perspective, too often the material selected to highlight simply isn't very interesting (such as when Goebbels complains about this or that ailment, &tc., or the ad nauseam footage of his small German hometown). Also, the movie crawls along in covering c. 1920-1939 and then steams through the war years. In sum, the film is little better than a History Channel documentary, with the exception that the filmmaker has a slightly greater sensibility than your average History Channel documentary editor and thus can more artfully arrange the details of Goebbels' life. Still, I found it wanting. Would you say this review is positive or negative?","output":"Based on the content of the review, I would say that the review is negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the pacing of the movie, the material selected for the film, and even compares it to a History Channel documentary, which seems to be considered of lesser quality. The reviewer also found the film lacking in substance and interest due to the focus on mundane details and the imbalance in coverage between different periods of the subject's life. There is an acknowledgement of the filmmaker's slightly better sensibility, but that doesn't outweigh the overall negative perception of the film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered \\"controversial\\" I really had to see this for myself. The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men. What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it's not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films. I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema.

In 1960 , Alberto Korda took an iconic photograph of which revolutionary leader ????","output":"In 1960, Cuban photographer Alberto Korda captured an iconic photograph of famed revolutionary leader Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara. The photograph, titled \\"Guerrillero Heroico,\\" or \\"Heroic Guerrilla Fighter,\\" was taken on March 5, 1960, at a mass funeral in Havana, Cuba. The event was held in memory of those who had perished in an explosion on a boat called La Coubre the previous day, and it brought several political figures together, including Fidel Castro. At this event, Guevara appeared unexpectedly, and Korda was struck by his gaze and intensity. In that split second, Korda took two quick photographs of Che Guevara. The photograph that gained worldwide recognition shows Guevara looking off into the distance with an intense, determined expression. His eyes seem to be focusing on the future, and his facial features are accentuated by a beret adorned with a star, symbolizing his rank as Comandante in the Cuban Revolution. Korda later claimed he was inspired to take the picture by Guevara's expression. The photographer felt as though Guevara's face conveyed the spirit of the revolution and symbolized the struggle for communism. Although this photograph wasn't immediately published or distributed, it became a symbol of the revolutionary movements in the 1960s and 1970s. Alberto Korda's photograph of Che Guevara is considered one of the most famous and recognizable images of the 20th century. The \\"Guerrillero Heroico\\" has transcended the story of one man and come to symbolize resistance and rebellion against social and political injustice. The image has been reproduced countless times, appearing on t-shirts, posters, and other merchandise. Interestingly, Korda never sought royalties for the image. Despite its commercial use, he felt that the photograph should remain accessible to promote the spirit of revolution. However, Korda did, at times, object to the image being used to promote certain products or ideas that he thought were not in line with Guevara's values. In conclusion, the iconic photograph taken by Alberto Korda in 1960 captures the essence and determination of a revolutionary leader who has become a symbol of resistance, struggle, and change. Che Guevara's image will remain an enduring testament to the revolutionary spirit for generations to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The lawsuit was given an official designation by a Commission in 2006 (implicitly, a regulatory, oversight, or legal/legislative commission), and the complaint in this case was filed on January 27, 2006. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine who or what 'Justerini & Brooks Limited' is opposing (as indicated by the 'v.'—an abbreviation of 'versus' often used in the context of legal cases). 'Justerini & Brooks Limited' could be in opposition to an individual, another corporate entity, or possibly even a decision or policy.

He was the first ever draft pick for the Seattle Seahawks and the second player taken in the 1976 NFL Draft. Niehaus was the 1976 NFC Defensive Rookie of the Year and holds the Seahawk rookie record for sacks in a season with 9½. Hypothesis: Steve Niehause was the 2nd pick in the 1976 draft","output":"Yes, based on the provided context, we can draw the hypothesis that Steve Niehause was the 2nd pick in the 1976 NFL Draft. There are several supporting pieces of information that lead us to this conclusion, which I will outline below. First, the context specifically states that Steve Niehause was the \\"second player taken in the 1976 NFL Draft.\\" This statement is a direct evidence pointing to the fact that he was indeed the 2nd pick in that year's draft. Furthermore, he held the position of defensive lineman, which indicates his ability and value as a player in that position in football. Secondly, Niehaus was the first-ever draft pick for the Seattle Seahawks. This implies that the team must have had a high enough draft pick in the first round, allowing them to select such a talented player so early in the process. This provides further evidence that Niehause was an early, highly-ranked draft pick in the 1976 NFL Draft. Lastly, other accomplishments highlighted in the context, such as being named the 1976 NFC Defensive Rookie of the Year and holding the Seahawk rookie record for sacks in a season, demonstrate that Niehause's high draft position was justified. This implies that his selection as the 2nd pick in the 1976 NFL Draft was based on his talent and potential impact on the Seattle Seahawks organization. In summary, the provided context offers enough information to generate a hypothesis that Steve Niehause was the 2nd pick in the 1976 NFL Draft. The specific mention of his draft position, his selection as the first-ever draft pick for the Seattle Seahawks, and subsequent achievements as a rookie player, all support and strengthen this hypothesis. Consequently, we can conclude that Steve Niehause was indeed the 2nd pick in the 1976 NFL Draft."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Who does Pillai propose the killer is?

In Triplicane the next morning, Rajan (Sivaji Ganesan), a radio engineer and communications researcher, is found murdered with his own hand gun. His neighbor Chinnaiah Pillai (P. D. Sambandam) hears the gunshot and complains to the police. A local Police Inspector named Purushothaman Naidu arrives and investigates the scene. He is joined by C.I.D. officer Sivanandam (Javar Seetharaman)there. He concludes that the killer is some petty thief who must have shot Rajan for the lump of money found in the same room of the crime scene. However, Sivanandam states that to be of a bad solution, as the amount of money matches exactly with the withdrawal entry in the bank passbook found in the same room, without a single rupee's difference. Nonetheless, it was clear Rajan was making plans to leave Chennai, in anticipation of the bombings. Rajan's wife Usha (Pandari Bai) is almost dumbstruck and unable to speak during any inquiries. Sivanandam and Naidu feel reluctant and embarrassed to do any questioning to her.The two decide to investigate the case by questioning the people in and around the house, who are the family members or friends of Rajan. They first do their inquiry with Chinnaiah Pillai, the neighbour as he is the first to inform them. He tells that the killer could probably be Pattabi, Rajan's younger brother (T. K. Balachandran). He recounts an incident (as flashback), in which Pattabi confronts Rajan at the house's garage to ask for his share of the family property to be apportioned and given to him. Rajan, in good faith, denies to give Pattabi his share, feeling that he and his wife might squander it.

Zeus took the skies, Poseidon took the seas, and Hades was left with the Underworld upon being tricked by Zeus. The gods created the mortals, whose faith and prayers fueled the gods' immortality. As time passed, however, mortals began to question and soon resist their creators, angering the Olympians. A fisherman named Spyros finds a coffin adrift in the sea, discovering a baby, Perseus and his mother DanaÃ«. Spyros and his wife, Marmara, raise Perseus as their own son, alongside their daughter, Tekla. One day, an adult Perseus and his family watch soldiers from the city of Argos destroying the statue of Zeus. Infuriated at this, the Gods unleash the Furies who attack the soldiers and destroy the family's fishing vessel. Only Perseus survives and is found by a group of the soldiers. Perseus is brought before King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia, who are celebrating their campaign against the gods. Queen Cassiopeia compares her daughter Andromeda to the gods and boasts that she is more beautiful than Aphrodite.

Consider the infinite decimal number given:     [    0.1234567891011121314ldots     ]    This decimal number is formed by concatenating all natural numbers in order. 2. **Understanding Rational Numbers**:    A rational number can be expressed as the ratio of two integers (frac{a}{b}) with (b neq 0). The decimal expansion of a rational number is either terminating or eventually periodic. This means that after some point, the decimal digits start repeating in a fixed cycle. 3. **Assume Periodicity**:    Suppose for contradiction that this decimal number is rational. Then, its decimal representation must eventually become periodic. This means there exists some sequence (T) of (n) digits that repeats infinitely after some position (m). 4. **Non-Zero Digits in Sequence textit{T}}:    In the decimal expansion of our number, there are no sequences of zeros longer than a finite length because the digits are derived from the natural numbers, which continue to increase and do not allow infinite repetition of zeros. Thus, it is guaranteed that within any chosen n digits starting from digit m, there is at least one non-zero digit. 5. **Contradiction with Inclusion of Powers of 10**:    Since the decimal number includes every natural number in order, it must contain the digit sequences corresponding to powers of 10: (10, 100, 1000, ldots, 10^k, ldots). Among these, there will be sequences like (100, 1000, 10000, ldots) which will contain more than (n) consecutive zeros. 6. **Violation of Periodicity**:    However, if the decimal is eventually periodic starting from position (m), the periodic part (T) cannot include more than (n) zeros, as discussed before. But, the presence of long sequences of zeros (like in (1000, 10000, ldots)) contradicts this assumption since no periodic segment (T) can contain such varying lengths of zeros and non-zero digits consistently. 7. **Conclusion**:    This contradiction proves that the assumption of the decimal number being rational is incorrect. Thus, the infinite decimal    [    0.1234567891011121314ldots     ]    cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers and therefore is an irrational number.

The number of different ways to arrange these four units is 4!, which equals 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 24. However, we have to consider the arrangement within the combined unit (AB), which can be in two different ways: AB or BA.

Also, since (overline{AT} perp overline{AO}) and (overline{AO} parallel overline{PM}), we have ( AT perp PM ).     4. **Orthocenter of Triangle ( ATM ):**    Thus, ( P ) turns out to be the orthocenter of ( triangle ATM ). 5. **Key Intersection Point ( Y ):**    Define ( Y = overline{TP} cap overline{AM} ).

This condition is reminiscent of the power of a point theorem, which states that for a point ( D ) relative to a circle, the product of the lengths of the segments of any line through ( D ) that intersects the circle is constant. 2. **Using the Power of a Point Theorem:**    The given condition ( |AD|^2 = |BD| cdot |CD| ) suggests that ( D ) lies on the radical axis of the circle passing through ( A, B, ) and ( C ). This circle is the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ). 3. **Constructing the Circumcircle:**    To find the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ), we need to find the perpendicular bisectors of any two sides of ( triangle ABC ). The intersection of these bisectors is the circumcenter ( O ) of the triangle. 4. **Locating Point ( D ):**    Since ( D ) must satisfy the power of a point condition relative to the circumcircle, ( D ) must lie on the line ( BC ) extended. The power of point theorem tells us that the power of ( D ) with respect to the circumcircle is ( |DA|^2 = |BD| cdot |CD| ). 5. **Special Case Analysis:**    - If ( A ) is the circumcenter, then ( A ) is equidistant from ( B ) and ( C ), and ( angle A ) cannot be greater than ( 90^circ ) in a scalene triangle.    - Since ( angle A ) is greater than ( 90^circ ), ( A ) is not the circumcenter, and the circumcenter ( O ) lies outside ( triangle ABC ). 6. **Conclusion:**    The point ( D ) must lie on the line ( BC ) such that the power of ( D ) with respect to the circumcircle is equal to ( |AD|^2 ). This implies that ( D ) is the point where the perpendicular from ( A ) to ( BC ) (or its extension) intersects ( BC ).

Define the differences:    [    d_i = a_{i+1} - a_i quad text{for} quad i = 1, 2, ldots, 19    ]    This gives us 19 differences since there are 20 numbers. 3. Assume that none of the differences ( d_i ) are repeated more than three times.

One effective way to do this is to consider two adjacent faces of the cube.    - These two adjacent faces can be represented as a rectangle where the dimensions are the side length of the cube (assume the length is 1 unit). 3. **Identifying Opposite Vertices:**    - In this 2D unfolded view, the opposite vertices of the original cube will match up to two vertices of the rectangular configuration, specifically the vertices of the rectangle that are diagonal from each other. 4. **Shortest Path Calculation:**    - The shortest path between two diagonally opposite vertices within a rectangle that has dimensions 2 times 1 is along the diagonal of this rectangle.    - The length of the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:      [      text{Diagonal length} = sqrt{(text{length of the rectangle})^2 + (text{width of the rectangle})^2}      ]    - Given text{length} = 2 and text{width} = 1, we have:      [      text{Diagonal length} = sqrt{2^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{4 + 1} = sqrt{5}      ] 5. **Path Details:**    - This diagonal path cuts through the common edge of the two faces in the unfolded diagram, which represents the beetle's shortest route across the surface of the cube. 6. **Number of Shortest Paths:**    - There are six such pairs of adjacent faces on the cube, each providing a possible shortest path for the beetle from the initial vertex to the opposite vertex.    - Thus, there are six shortest possible paths the beetle could take. # Conclusion The beetle can move in a straight line along one of the diagonals in the 2D representation of the unfolded cube to reach the opposite vertex in the shortest distance.

So the only cases we need to check are B = 1, 2.    - For B = 1, we must have frac{2}{A - 1} in mathbb{N}, so the only possible value of n = 5.    - For B = 2, we must have frac{17}{A - 1} in mathbb{N}, and checking yields n = 5. 4. Hence proved that k = 5. 5. Now we want to solve the equation frac{m^2 + n^2}{mn - 1} = 5, so we get m^2 + n^2 = 5(mn - 1). 6. Suppose that (m, n) is the smallest root. By Vieta's relations, the other root will be (m, n) rightarrow (5m - n, m), yielding infinite solutions to the equation. 7. To find its explicit formula, we need to calculate (a_1, b_1). Now, as shown, we will show that the smallest solutions must have n = 1. 8. If mn - 1 mid m^2 + n^2, we must have    [    frac{m^2 + n^2}{mn - 1} = c    ]    And by this, we get the quadratic:    [    m^2 + n^2 = c(mn - 1) implies m^2 - cnm + n^2 + c = 0    ] 9. Let (m, n) be a solution to this diophantine, where m + n is minimal. Also, assume that the other root of this quadratic is M. Now, since m ne n, WLOG, m > n. Now we show that n = 1. 10. For the sake of contradiction, assume that n ne 1. Since n is a positive integer, we must have n > 1 implies m > n > 1. Now, since m + n is minimum, we must have     [     m + n le M + n implies m le M     ]     However, observe that since m > n > 1,     [     n(m - n) ge 2 implies mn - 2 ge n^2 implies m(mn - 2) ge mn^2 > n^3 implies n(m^2 - n^2) > 2m     ]     [     implies m^2n > 2m + n^3 implies 2m^2n - 2m > m^2n + n^3 implies 2m(mn - 1) > n(m^2 + n^2) implies m > kn - m = M     ]     a contradiction. Hence, n = 1. 11. So we obtain (1, 2), (1, 3) and their permutations to be (a_1, b_1) respectively. 12. Now all the solutions generated by this sequence are unique since if (m, n) was a solution, then (5m - n, m) is greater than our previous solution since 5m - n > 5m - m > 4m > m, m > n.

This can be expressed as: frac{|-4a|}{sqrt{b^2+a^2}}=2 Solving this equation, we get: |-4a|=2sqrt{b^2+a^2} Squaring both sides, we get: 16a^2=4(b^2+a^2) Simplifying, we get: 12a^2=4b^2 frac{b^2}{a^2}=frac{3}{1} The eccentricity e of the hyperbola is given by: e=sqrt{1+frac{b^2}{a^2}} Substituting frac{b^2}{a^2}=frac{3}{1}, we get: e=sqrt{1+3}=boxed{2}"},{"instruction":"Tom's cat needs an expensive surgery.

Let (ABCD) be the given quadrilateral, and let (M, N, P,) and (Q) be the midpoints of sides (AB), (BC), (CD), and (DA) respectively. 2. The problem states that the sum of the distances between the midpoints of opposite sides of the quadrilateral is equal to its semiperimeter. We need to prove that (ABCD) is a parallelogram. 3. First, we express the given condition using vector notation and properties of midpoints. We know that for any vector (overrightarrow{AB}) and (overrightarrow{DC}), the vector connecting the midpoints (Q) and (N) is half the difference of those vectors:    [    overrightarrow{QN} = frac{1}{2}(overrightarrow{AB} + overrightarrow{DC})    ] 4.

The given condition translates to the equation for the lengths (magnitudes) of the vectors:    [    AB + BC + CD + DA = 2(QN + MP)    ] 6. Substitute the vector relations for midpoints into this equation:    [    AB + BC + CD + DA = 2 left(left| frac{1}{2} overrightarrow{AB} + frac{1}{2} overrightarrow{DC} right| + left| frac{1}{2} overrightarrow{BC} + frac{1}{2} overrightarrow{DA} right| right)    ] 7.

For the equation to hold true, the vectors (overrightarrow{AB}) must be parallel to (overrightarrow{DC}), and (overrightarrow{BC}) must be parallel to (overrightarrow{DA}). 9.

Considerations of Edges and Vertices:**    - Mark one edge, say the edge labeled ( a ), and paint its midpoint ( P ) red.    - Each polyhedral face shares an edge labeled ( a ). By moving around the polyhedron, the red point will form a loop through successive edges. **2. Classification of Faces:**    - For each face, we can observe the orientation with respect to the alphabetical order of ( a, b, c ):      - If it is in counterclockwise order, it's called a ( 正面 ) (positive face).      - If it is in clockwise order, it's called a ( 反面 ) (negative face). **3.

Analysis of Intersections:**    - As each loop necessarily crosses another loop through a shared edge ( c ), the classification by how they cross becomes crucial:      - There are three types of arrangements for each pair of loops sharing an edge ( c ) as follows:        - In type one, red points from different loops do not intersect.        - In type two, they intersect each other's paths, counted as ( n_1 ) and ( n_2 ) respectively for face orientations. **5.

First, recall that the logarithm function ln(x) is strictly increasing. This means that if x > y, then ln(x) > ln(y). This is a fundamental property of logarithmic functions. 2. Now, consider the statement \\"ln x > ln y\\". Given the property mentioned above, this implies that x > y. 3. Next, let's analyze what x > y means in the context of cubing both sides. Since cubing is also a strictly increasing function for positive numbers, if x > y, then it follows that x^3 > y^3. 4. Therefore, we can see that if \\"ln x > ln y\\", it indeed implies \\"x^3 > y^3\\". However, this is under the assumption that x and y are positive, as the logarithm is only defined for positive values, and the property of cubing maintaining the inequality holds for positive numbers. 5. Thus, \\"ln x > ln y\\" is a sufficient condition for \\"x^3 > y^3\\". It ensures that if the former is true, the latter is also true.

To represent the points in a plane, we introduce a rectangular coordinate system on the equatorial plane. Specifically, we take the point O as the origin, and the x-axis along the line OA.

But for our consideration, since we count starting from the front, the probability for a specific one (just-being first while considering the event happening before the first zero) is effectively ( frac{1}{50} ) (each position equally likely in its group context).     - Thus,     [     mathbb{P}(I_k = 1) = frac{1}{50}     ]     And,     [     mathbb{P}(J_m = 1) = frac{1}{20}     ]     These probabilities are simplified events where no conflicts or overlaps with other counts initially interpreted and simplified. 4. **Expected Values**:     - The expected value of each indicator variable is the probability of the event it indicates:     [     mathbb{E}[I_k] = mathbb{P}(I_k = 1) = frac{1}{50} = 0.02     ]     And,     [     mathbb{E}[J_m] = mathbb{P}(J_m = 1) = frac{1}{20} = 0.05     ] 5. **Sum of Expected Values**:     - The linearity of expectation allows us to sum these expected values directly:     [     mathbb{E}[X] = mathbb{E}[I_1] + mathbb{E}[I_2] + ldots + mathbb{E}[I_{19}] + mathbb{E}[J_1] + mathbb{E}[J_2] + ldots + mathbb{E}[J_{49}]     ]     Calculating:     [     mathbb{E}[X] = 19 cdot 0.02 + 49 cdot 0.05 = 0.38 + 2.45 = 2.83     ] Conclusion:  [ boxed{2.83} ]"},{"instruction":"Ali had a collection of seashells.

Since the quadrilateral ( BC_{0}B_{0}C ) is cyclic and parallel lines are involved, it indicates that ( BC_{0}B_{0}C ) must be an isosceles trapezoid or a rectangle. In any case, this yields:    [    BM = MC.    ]    Thus, ( triangle BMC ) is isosceles, and the median ( MA_1 ) is also an altitude. 6.

To find the sum S of all these numbers, we use the sum formula for an arithmetic sequence: [ S = frac{n}{2} times (a_1 + a_n) ] So, [ S = frac{102}{2} times (201 + 403) ] [ S = 51 times 604 ] [ S = 30780 ] The sum of the numbers is 30780, which is greater than 20000.

For the shoes: Marlene is buying 3 pairs of shoes. The cost for 3 pairs of shoes at 60 each is 3 * 60 = 180. Now, let's calculate the discounted price for each type of item. For the shirts: The discount is 20%, so the discount amount is 20% of 300. Discount amount for shirts = 20/100 * 300 = 60. The discounted price for the shirts is 300 - 60 = 240. For the pants: The discount is 15%, so the discount amount is 15% of 160. Discount amount for pants = 15/100 * 160 = 24. The discounted price for the pants is 160 - 24 = 136. For the shoes: The discount is 25%, so the discount amount is 25% of 180. Discount amount for shoes = 25/100 * 180 = 45. The discounted price for the shoes is 180 - 45 = 135.

We need to show that the circles ( omega_B ) and ( omega_C ) intersect on line ( overline{BC} ). 2. **First Method Using Symmedians:**    - Consider ( overline{XY} ) as the other tangent from ( X ) to ( (AMN) ).    - **Claim:** Line ( overline{XM} ) is tangent to ( (BMY) ), implying ( Y ) lies on ( omega_B ).    - **Proof:**      - Let ( Z ) be the midpoint of ( overline{AY} ). Since ( overline{MX} ) is the ( M )-symmedian in ( triangle AMY ), and ( overline{MZ} parallel overline{BY} ), we conclude that:      [      angle AMX = angle ZMY = angle BYM      ]      Consequently, ( overline{XM} ) is tangent to the circumcircle of ( triangle BMY ).    - Similarly, since ( omega_C ) is the circumcircle of ( triangle CNY ), and since both ( A, M, Y, ) and ( N ) are cyclic, it follows from Miquel's theorem that ( omega_B ) and ( omega_C ) intersect on line ( overline{BC} ).    **Conclusion:** Hence, we have intersection using symmedians. 3. **Second Method Via Angle Chasing and Similarity:**    - Let ( omega_B ) intersect ( overline{BC} ) again at ( S ) and let ( overline{MS} ) intersect ( overline{AC} ) again at ( Y ).    - By specific angle chasing:      [      angle XMY = angle XMS = angle MBS = angle ABC = angle XAC = angle XAY      ]      Therefore, ( Y ) is on the circumcircle of ( triangle AMX ).    - Further chasing:      [      triangle ABC sim triangle XMY quad text{and} quad triangle AXY sim triangle BMS      ]      They imply:      [      frac{AN}{AX} = frac{AN/BM}{AX / BM}= frac{AC / AB}{MS / XY}= frac{AB / AB}{MS / XM} = frac{XM}{MS}      ]      Together with ( angle XMS = angle XAN ), this yields ( triangle XMS sim triangle XAN ).    - Finally, we confirm:      [      angle XNS = angle XYS = angle XYM = angle ACB = angle NCS      ]      Hence, ( overline{XN} ) is tangent to the circle through ( C, N, ) and ( S ), confirming the intersection at ( B ) and ( C ). 4. **Third Method: Moving Points Approach:**    - Animating ( X ) along the tangent at ( A ) and mapping:      - Points ( X mapsto D ) so that:      [      overline{AA} rightarrow ell rightarrow overline{BC} rightarrow overline{BC}      ]      - Each map is perspectivity and projective: Homothety and inversion.      - Verify ( D = D' ) for specific ( X = AA cap MN ), ( X rightarrow A ), and ( X rightarrow infty ).

What is the ratio of the work done by Q alone in one day to the work done by P alone in one day?","output":"Let's denote the fraction of the work done by Q alone in one day compared to P alone in one day as ( x ). This means that Q alone can complete the job in ( frac{1}{x} ) days, because if P can do the job in 4 days, and Q does ( x ) times the work P does in a day, it would take Q ( frac{1}{x} ) times as long to do the same job. Now, let's calculate the work done by P and Q together in one day. Since P can complete the job in 4 days, P's work rate is ( frac{1}{4} ) of the job per day. Q's work rate is ( x ) times P's work rate, which is ( x times frac{1}{4} = frac{x}{4} ) of the job per day. When P and Q work together, their combined work rate is ( frac{1}{4} + frac{x}{4} = frac{1+x}{4} ) of the job per day. We are given that P and Q together can complete the job in 3 days, which means their combined work rate is ( frac{1}{3} ) of the job per day. Setting the two expressions for the combined work rate equal to each other, we get: [ frac{1+x}{4} = frac{1}{3} ] To solve for ( x ), we multiply both sides by 12 (the least common multiple of 4 and 3) to get rid of the fractions: [ 3(1+x) = 4 ] Expanding the left side, we get: [ 3 + 3x = 4 ] Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get: [ 3x = 1 ] Dividing both sides by 3, we find: [ x = frac{1}{3} ] So the ratio of the work done by Q alone in one day to the work done by P alone in one day is ( boxed{frac{1}{3}}  )."},{"instruction":"A company has two types of machines, type R and type S.

When the company uses 9 machines of type R and an equal number of machines of type S (also 9), they complete the job in 12 hours. This means that the combined rate of 18 machines (9 of type R and 9 of type S) is such that they complete the job in 12 hours. The rate of work done by each machine of type R is ( frac{1}{t} ) jobs per hour, and similarly, the rate for each machine of type S is also ( frac{1}{t} ) jobs per hour. When 9 machines of type R work together, their combined rate is ( 9 times frac{1}{t} = frac{9}{t} ) jobs per hour. The same applies to the 9 machines of type S, so their combined rate is also ( frac{9}{t} ) jobs per hour. The total rate of all 18 machines working together is the sum of the rates of the machines of type R and type S, which is ( frac{9}{t} + frac{9}{t} = frac{18}{t} ) jobs per hour.

When we add another line, it will intersect each of the previously considered p + r lines in exactly one point because no three lines are concurrent. 3. The number of intersections that the new line makes is p + r, and each intersection divides the new line segment into p + r + 1 segments. Each segment will create a new region in the plane. Thus, when we add another line, we have:    [    b_{p+r+1} = b_{p+r} + (p + r + 1)    ] 4. To find the total number of new regions created when adding the remaining n - p lines, we sum up the increments:    [    sum_{r=0}^{n-p-1} (p + r + 1)    ] 5. This can be simplified as:    [    sum_{r=0}^{n-p-1}  (p + r + 1) = sum_{r=0}^{n-p-1} p + sum_{r=0}^{n-p-1} (r + 1)    ]    Breaking it down:    [    sum_{r=0}^{n-p-1} p = p(n - p)    ]    And:    [    sum_{r=0}^{n-p-1} (r + 1) = sum_{r=1}^{n-p} r = frac{(n-p)(n-p+1)}{2}    ] 6. Combining these terms, we get:    [    sum_{r=0}^{n-p-1} (p + r + 1) = p(n - p) + frac{(n-p)(n-p + 1)}{2}    ] 7. Now, the difference in the number of regions from adding n - p lines is:    [    b_n - b_p = p(n - p) + frac{(n-p)(n-p+1)}{2}    ] 8. Since ( b_p = p + 1 ), we substitute it in:    [    b_n = p + 1 + p(n - p) + frac{(n-p)(n-p+1)}{2}    ] 9. Simplify further:    [    b_n = p + 1 + p(n-p) + frac{n^2 - p^2 + n - p}{2}    ]    [    = p + 1 + frac{2p(n-p) + n^2 - p^2 + n - p}{2}    ]    [    = p + 1 + frac{n^2 - p^2 + n + p}{2}    ] 10. Therefore, the total number of regions is:    [    b_n = frac{1}{2} left( n^2 - p^2 + n + p + 2 right)    ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{1}{2}left(n^{2}-p^{2}+n+p+2right)} ]"},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x)=aln xx(ane 0);     (1) If a=1, find the intervals of monotonicity for the function f(x); (2) When a > 0, find the maximum value of the function f(x) on the interval (0,2].","output":"Solution: (1) The derivative of f(x) is f'(x)= frac{a}{x}-1= frac{-x+a}{x},x > 0.

This is a basic problem."},{"instruction":"The sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence {a_n} is S_n=3^{n2}+k. Find the value of the real number k.","output":"Given the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence {a_n} is S_n=3^{n-2}+k,   we have a_1=S_1=3^{-1}+k.   When n > 1, a_n=S_n-S_{n-1}=3^{n-2}+k-(3^{n-3}+k)=2cdot3^{n-3}.   Since {a_n} is a geometric sequence, for n=1, we have 3^{-1}+k=2cdot3^{1-3}.   Solving this, we get k=-frac{1}{9}.   Therefore, the answer is boxed{-frac{1}{9}}.   By using the relationship between the general term of a sequence and the sum of the first n terms: for n=1, a_1=S_1; for n > 1, a_n=S_n-S_{n-1}. Then, by applying the formula for the general term of a geometric sequence, the calculation can be easily done.   This problem tests the formula for the general term and the sum formula of a geometric sequence. Pay attention to the relationship between the general term and the sum of the first n terms. This problem can also be solved by utilizing the characteristics of the sum formula, and it is considered a medium-level question."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},_={key:0,class:"empty-state"},Y=["disabled"],H={key:0},F={key:1};function N(o,e,h,m,n,s){const f=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(a(),k(f,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",_,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
