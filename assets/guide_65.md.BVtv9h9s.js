Movie title: A Cry in the Dark Movie plot: Seventh-day Adventist Church pastor Michael Chamberlain, his wife Lindy, their two sons, and their nine-week-old daughter Azaria are on a camping holiday in the Outback. With the baby sleeping in their tent, the family is enjoying a barbecue with their fellow campers when a cry is heard. Lindy returns to the tent to check on Azaria and is certain she sees a dingo with something in its mouth running off as she approaches. When she discovers the infant is missing, everyone joins forces to search for her, without success. It is assumed what Lindy saw was the animal carrying off the child, and a subsequent inquest rules her account of events is true.The tide of public opinion soon turns against the Chamberlains. For many, Lindy seems too stoic, too cold-hearted, and too accepting of the disaster that has befallen her. Gossip about her begins to swell and soon is accepted as statements of fact. The couple's beliefs are not widely practised in the country, and when the media reports a rumour that the name Azaria means \\"sacrifice in the wilderness\\" (when in fact it means \\"blessed of God\\"), the public is quick to believe they decapitated their baby with a pair of scissors as part of a bizarre religious rite. Law-enforcement officials find new witnesses, forensics experts, and a lot of circumstantial evidenceincluding a small wooden coffin Michael uses as a receptacle for his parishioners' packs of un-smoked cigarettesand reopen the investigation, and eventually Lindy is charged with murder. Seven months pregnant, she ignores her attorneys' advice to play on the jury's sympathy and appears emotionless on the stand, convincing onlookers she is guilty of the crime of which she is accused. As the trial progresses, Michael's faith in his religion and his belief in his wife disintegrate, and he stumbles through his testimony, suggesting he is concealing the truth. In October 1982, Lindy is found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour, while Michael is found guilty as an accessory and given an 18-month... Answer:","output":"The public opinion turns against the Chamberlains primarily due to Lindy's seemingly stoic and cold-hearted demeanor following the disappearance of her daughter, Azaria. The fact that the couple's Seventh-day Adventist beliefs are not widely practiced in the country further alienates them from the public. Additionally, when the media incorrectly reports that the name Azaria means \\"sacrifice in the wilderness,\\" people quickly come to believe that the Chamberlains decapitated their baby as part of a bizarre religious ritual. The new evidence, witnesses, and rumors discovered by law enforcement reinforce the suspicion surrounding the family, leading to a widespread shift in public opinion against them."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?  Context: Opal Koboi is a fictional character from the Artemis Fowl series by Eoin Colfer. After the character's introduction in in the series as a supporting antagonist, Colfer again used Koboi as the main antagonist of the fourth, sixth, and eighth books in the series, giving her the status of archenemy to Artemis Fowl II. Hypothesis: Eoin Colfer has only written 3 of the books in his 8 book series with Opal Koboi being the main antagonist character.","output":"Based on the context provided, we can draw the following detailed hypothesis: Eoin Colfer, the author of the Artemis Fowl series, has incorporated the character Opal Koboi as the main antagonist in three of the eight books that make up the series. This character is first introduced as a supporting antagonist but later assumes the role of archenemy to the protagonist, Artemis Fowl II. Specifically, Opal Koboi plays the role of the primary antagonist in the fourth, sixth, and eighth books of the series. This indicates that while Eoin Colfer has written an eight-book series, only three of these books place a spotlight on Opal Koboi as the central antagonist figure. In reaching this hypothesis, it is important to take into account the given context which states that Opal Koboi is initially introduced as a supporting antagonist but later becomes the primary antagonist in three other books. This suggests that Eoin Colfer has chosen to establish a more prominent and recurring role for the character of Opal Koboi, positioning her as an oppositional force to Artemis Fowl II throughout the series. Additionally, the context highlights that Opal Koboi's role as the main antagonist is seen in the fourth, sixth, and eighth books. This information further supports the hypothesis that Eoin Colfer has indeed written three books within the series with Koboi as the main antagonist. Moreover, given her status as the archenemy to Artemis Fowl II, it can be inferred that this character contributes significantly to the development of the series' narrative and plays a vital role in shaping the protagonist's journey. In conclusion, the hypothesis that Eoin Colfer has written only three of the eight books in his series with Opal Koboi as the main antagonist character is well-supported by the context provided. The character's evolution from a supporting to a primary antagonist in three of the books illustrates her increasing significance in the series and her impact on the journey of the protagonist, Artemis Fowl II."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Loon island had a very stable environment, and there weren't many diverse species of plants and animals. Wolf island displayed lots of evidence for natural selection, and had a large variety of species inhabiting it.  and a hint : New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks.

Witnesses are assigned to a congregation in whose \\"territory\\" they usually reside and attend weekly services they refer to as \\"meetings\\" as scheduled by congregation elders. The meetings are largely devoted to study of Watch Tower Society literature and the Bible. The format of the meetings is established by the religion's headquarters, and the subject matter for most meetings is the same worldwide. Congregations meet for two sessions each week comprising five distinct meetings that total about three-and-a-half hours, typically gathering mid-week (three meetings) and on the weekend (two meetings). Prior to 2009, congregations met three times each week; these meetings were condensed, with the intention that members dedicate an evening for \\"family worship\\".

Premise: a man wearing a red, gray and blue shirt and a hat. Hypothesis: A man in a hat wears a watch. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"To evaluate whether we can conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, it'll be helpful to break down both the premise and the hypothesis in terms of their respective components. This will allow us to determine the relationship between them, and thus assess the strength of any conclusions we might draw. The Premise: A man is wearing a red, gray, and blue shirt and a hat. This information tells us the following: 1. There is a man (let's call him Person A) involved. 2. Person A is wearing a shirt with a combination of three colors: red, gray, and blue. 3. Person A is wearing a hat. The Hypothesis: A man in a hat wears a watch. This information relays the following: 1. There is a man (let's call him Person B) involved. 2. Person B is wearing a hat. 3. Person B is wearing a watch. Now that we have dissected both the premise and the hypothesis into their core components, we can start to analyze their relationship. In order to conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, there must be a direct or indirect connection between the elements in the premise and the elements in the hypothesis. Looking at the given premise, we have information about the shirt and the hat the man is wearing, whereas the hypothesis includes information about Person B wearing a hat and a watch. The only element that both statements share is that the man is wearing a hat. However, the premise provides no information about Person A wearing a watch. Additionally, the hypothesis does not mention anything about Person B's shirt. Hence, Person A and Person B can be the same person (i.e., the man in the hat), or they can be two separate individuals. Even if we assume that Person A and Person B are indeed the same person, the premise still lacks information about the man wearing a watch. The hypothesis depends on establishing a connection between wearing a hat and wearing a watch, and this connection cannot be derived from the premise. Therefore, we cannot conclusively affirm the hypothesis is true just by relying on the premise. A man wearing a red, gray, and blue shirt and a hat does not provide sufficient evidence to infer that a man in a hat wears a watch. There is no inherent link between these two statements, and as such, it would be incorrect to assume any causality or association between these scenarios purely on the given information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","output":"Title: How to Start Crocheting with a Skein of Double-Knit Yarn and a Size G Hook Hello little friends! Today we are going to learn about an amazing way to make beautiful things using yarn and a tool called a crochet hook. Have you ever heard of crocheting? It's when you loop yarn together in a special way to make things like blankets, hats, and even toys! Let's get started! To begin, you need two important things. First, pick a skein of double-knit yarn. What's that, you ask? A skein is like a big, squishy bundle of yarn, and double-knit means it's just the right thickness for our project. You can find these at a craft store, and there are so many colors to choose from! Which color do you like the most? That's the one you should choose for your project. The second thing you need is a size G (4 mm) crochet hook. This is like a special wand you'll use to weave the yarn and make pretty patterns. The size G crochet hook is perfect for beginners because it's not too big and not too small, making it easy to work with. Now that you have your yarn and crochet hook, we can start learning some basic steps on how to crochet. Don't worry, I'll explain everything step by step, so it's easy to understand and lots of fun! Step 1: Hold the crochet hook in your right hand (or left hand if you're left-handed) and make sure it feels comfortable, like you're holding a pencil. Step 2: Hold the yarn with your other hand and wrap it around your fingers, so it's easy to control and doesn't get tangled. Step 3: Make a slip knot with the yarn. This is a special kind of knot that can slide and will be the very first loop in your crochet project. To make a slip knot, loop the yarn around your fingers, then pull one end through the loop and gently pull it tight. Step 4: Put the hook into the slip knot and tighten the yarn around the hook, but not too tight! You want to be able to slide the hook easily through the loop. Step 5: Now we're ready to start making some crochet stitches! There are many different stitches, but today we'll learn how to make a \\"chain stitch.\\" Yarn over (wrap the yarn around the hook) and pull the yarn through the loop on your hook. That's it, you've made your first chain stitch! Step 6: Keep practicing the chain stitch until you feel comfortable. You can make a long chain to practice, and it's okay if it's a little wonky at first. Practice makes perfect! There you go! You've started your crocheting journey with a skein of double-knit yarn and a size G crochet hook. I hope this was a fun and easy way to learn the basics of crocheting. Keep practicing and soon you'll be able to make all sorts of beautiful things! Remember, it's okay if it doesn't look perfect right away. Everyone learns at their own pace, and the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy creating something with your own hands. Happy crocheting, little friends!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Jack The answer is:","output":"Step 1: Define the main character and the setting Jack is our main character, and the story will be set in a small coastal town with a close-knit community. Step 2: Establish a conflict Jack has been accused of a serious crime, which threatens the peace and harmony of the town. The nature of the crime is not immediately revealed to the audience, building tension and curiosity. Step 3: Introduce supporting characters Key supporting characters include Sarah, the town sheriff/detective, who is investigating the crime; Emily, Jack's childhood friend and love interest; and Mark, a rival for Emily's affection and someone who has held a grudge against Jack for years. Step 4: Establish the stakes If Jack is found guilty, he faces losing everything: his reputation and status in the community, his chance at love with Emily, and even his freedom. On the flip side, if the real culprit isn't identified soon, the town will continue to suffer from the effects of this troubling crime. Step 5: Build the narrative As more and more evidence seemingly points to Jack, he wrestles with the growing suspicion from his friends and neighbors, particularly from Emily. Jack is determined to clear his name and find the real guilty party. During his investigation, Jack uncovers hidden secrets and lies within the town -- secrets that the real culprit is using to frame Jack. Step 6: The climax Despite his findings, the situation becomes dire for Jack as Sarah, the town sheriff, closes in and prepares to arrest him. In a last-ditch effort for redemption, Jack confronts Mark, who he now believes is responsible for the crime. During a heated exchange, Mark slips and reveals incriminating information, confirming his guilt. Step 7: The resolution In a surprising twist, rather than turning Mark in, Jack decides to confront him and encourage him to right his wrongs and confess to the crime in order to prevent further harm to the community. After a heart-wrenching conversation with Jack, Mark finally admits his guilt, allowing Jack to clear his name and rebuild his life in the town. Step 8: The conclusion The movie ends on a hopeful note, with the town beginning to heal after the revelation of the true culprit. Jack and Emily's relationship emerges stronger, and Jack's newfound appreciation for the truth allows him to become a pillar in the community once again."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer to this question? who was declared as the emperor after the revolt of 1857?","output":"After the Revolt of 1857, also known as the First War of Indian Independence or the Indian Mutiny, no single Indian leader was declared an emperor. However, it is important to note that during the rebellion, a key figure who was symbolically declared as the emperor was Bahadur Shah II, the last Mughal emperor of India. The Revolt of 1857 was sparked by a variety of factors, such as the discontent in the British East India Company's army ranks due to perceived racial discrimination and their resentment over newly introduced Enfield rifles that allegedly required them to tear open cartridges greased with cow and pig fat, which had religious implications for Hindu and Muslim soldiers. Political, social, and economic grievances, combined with the rapid erosion of local aristocrats' and rulers' authority at the hands of the British, also led to widespread dissatisfaction with the colonial power. During the uprising, Indian soldiers and various rebel groups joined forces, aiming to overthrow the British and restore indigenous rule. Recognizing Bahadur Shah II's symbolic value as a unifying figure, the rebels proclaimed him the emperor of India. Bahadur Shah II, though hesitant at first, eventually accepted his role. Unfortunately for the Indian forces, the revolt was ultimately suppressed by the ruthless and overwhelming might of the British military. Many leaders of the uprising were captured, including Bahadur Shah II, who was arrested, tried, and exiled to Rangoon, Burma (now Yangon, Myanmar). The aging emperor's exile marked the formal end of the Mughal Empire. Additionally, the British Empire decided to dissolve the British East India Company, transferring the administration of India to the British Crown. With the Government of India Act 1858, the British Crown established the British Raj, which would remain in power until India gained independence in 1947. In conclusion, while Bahadur Shah II was declared as the symbolic leader during the Revolt of 1857, the suppression of the rebellion by the British military ultimately led to the establishment of the British Raj rather than a reconsolidation of power under an Indian emperor. The end of the conflict did not result in the declaration of a new emperor, but rather the direct rule of the British Crown and the continuation of colonial governance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.”  Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. What is probably true about the author?

In the human digestive system, food enters the mouth and mechanical digestion of the food starts by the action of mastication (chewing), a form of mechanical digestion, and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva, a liquid secreted by the salivary glands, contains salivary amylase, an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food; the saliva also contains mucus, which lubricates the food, and hydrogen carbonate, which provides the ideal conditions of pH (alkaline) for amylase to work. After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be in the form of a small, round slurry mass called a bolus. It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion. Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin. As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by the stomach, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis, which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes.

Your job is to decide if the content of the review and the summary match or coincide with each other.  Guidelines: The summary should represent or reflect the main idea or key points of the product review. That means if the summary captures the reviewer's primary thoughts or critiques about the product described in the review, you should respond with \\"True\\". However, if the summary doesn't align with the feedback given in the review, then you'll respond with \\"False\\".

For instance, in this specific case, the reviewer is expressing dissatisfaction with a food product named 'Mama Grain'. The key criticisms relate to the displeasing taste of the product, the reviewer's daughter refusing to eat it, and an ill-paired combination of banana and beans. Next, you should read the summary and see if it represents the reviewer's feedback accurately. Here, the summary is \\"Very fishy...too fishy\\".  Given these details, you can deduce that the summary does not coincide with the contents of the review.

Article: NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Airlines UAL.N said on Thursday it would offer passengers who volunteer to forfeit their seats on overbooked flights up to 10,000 as part of the carrier’s efforts to repair the damage from the rough removal of a passenger.      FILE PHOTO - A United Airlines Boeing 787 taxis as a United Airlines Boeing 767 lands at San Francisco International Airport, San Francisco, California, U.S. on February 7, 2015. REUTERS/Louis Nastro/File Photo      The offer came after rival Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) outlined plans to offer up to 9,950 in such cases.      United also said it would take actions to reduce overbooking flights and improve customer satisfaction.      “Our goal is to reduce incidents of involuntary denial of boarding to as close to zero as possible and become a more customer-focused airline,” the carrier said in the statement.      United had spent the last two weeks embroiled in controversy after videos recorded by fellow passengers showed David Dao, 69, yanked from his seat aboard a Louisville, Kentucky-bound United flight before takeoff from Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport to make room for airline employees.      Dao lost two front teeth in the scuffle, incurred a concussion and broke his nose, according to his lawyer, and will likely sue the airline.      Related Coverage Major U.S. airports say current rules prevent incidents like United      “Both Dr. Dao and I applaud United for promptly addressing the many issues that have plagued passenger satisfaction in the arena of airline customer service,” Dao’s attorney, Thomas Demetrio, said in a statement on Thursday. “Dr. Dao is proud, despite his ordeal, to have played a role in spearheading these announced changes.”      United typically oversells flights by less than zero to 3 percent of the plane’s seat capacity to account for no-shows.      United said it would no longer call law enforcement to deny passengers boarding, nor would passengers who are already seated be required to give up their seats on overbooked flights.      United will adopt a “no questions asked” policy on permanently lost baggage, paying customers 1,500 for the value of the bag and its contents, beginning in June.      “This is a turning point for all of us at United,” Chief Executive Oscar Munoz said in a statement.      Munoz, who took the helm at United in 2015 as part of an effort to improve customer relations, has faced calls to step down after referring to Dao as “disruptive and belligerent” in a statement following the incident.      It sparked a national conversation on U.S. carriers’ treatment of customers in an industry comprising just a handful of competitors following years of mergers and consolidations.      United announced last week that Munoz, in a move he himself initiated, would not become company chairman in 2018 as stated in his employment agreement. ||||| FILE - This Jan. 26, 2016, file photo, shows economy class seating on a new United Airlines Boeing 787-9 undergoing final configuration and maintenance work at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in...

(Associated Press)      In a report being issued Thursday about the April 9 dragging incident involving a passenger on an overcrowded United Express plane, United spelled out how it selects passengers for involuntary bumping.      United says the process is automated — gate agents don't decide who stays and who goes.      —First, anyone without a seat assignment is denied boarding.      —Passengers who paid the least for their ticket top the list for being bumped involuntarily.      —Passengers who paid the same fare are sorted by when they checked in for the flight.      —Customers with status in United's MileagePlus frequent-flyer program won't be bumped unless everyone on the plane has status, in which case the people with the lowest status get bumped first.      —Unaccompanied minors and passengers with disabilities won't be bumped.      Source: Company's \\"United Express Flight 3411 Review and Action Report\\" ||||| United Airlines said a man wouldn't give up his spot on a flight. According to witnesses, he was pulled screaming from his seat by security and back to the terminal at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. (The Washington Post)      Lawyers for David Dao, the Kentucky man who was violently removed from a flight for refusing to give up his seat earlier this month, said Thursday that they have reached a confidential settlement with United Airlines.      The agreement comes on the same day that United released the results of an internal investigation that found several mistakes were made before, during and after Dao was dragged off the April 9 flight, including calling in law enforcement to resolve an incident that was neither a safety nor security issue. The horrifying scene was caught on video and viewed by millions of people worldwide.      “We are pleased to report that United and Dr. Dao have reached an amicable resolution of the unfortunate incident that occurred aboard flight 3411. We look forward to implementing the improvements we have announced, which will put our customers at the center of everything we do,” United said in a statement.      “Dr. Dao has become the unintended champion for the adopting of changes which will certainly help improve the lives of literally millions of travelers,” said Thomas Demetrio, one of Dao’s two lawyers. “I sincerely hope that all other airlines make similar changes and follow United’s lead in helping to improve the passenger flying experience with an emphasis on empathy, patience, respect and dignity.”      Demetrio described the settlement, the terms of which will remain confidential, as “amicable.”      In its report, United says it had allowed internal policies to distract from the need to treat passengers with dignity and respect, and it outlines what the company intends to do to prevent a repeat of the incident.      “This is a turning point for all of us at United and it signals a culture shift toward becoming a better, more customer-focused airline,” chief executive Oscar Munoz said in a statement that accompanied the release of the report on the April 9 incident at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport. “Our customers should be at the center of everything we do and these changes are just the beginning of how we will earn back their trust.”      Under the airline’s new customer-first policy, travelers who voluntarily give up their seats will be eligible to receive up to 10,000 in travel certificates. United employees will be given new authority to find creative solutions to get bumped passengers to their final destinations — even if it means booking them on another airline or sending them to another airport.      Demetrio said United is taking the right steps and that he hopes other airlines will follow suit.      “Both Dr. Dao and I applaud United for promptly addressing the many issues that have plagued passenger satisfaction in the arena of airline customer service,” Demetrio said. “All of its policy changes announced today are passenger friendly and are simple, common-sense decisions on United’s part to help minimize the stress involved in the flying experience. Dr. Dao is proud, despite his ordeal, to have played a role in spearheading these announced changes. And going forward, he hopes United takes the lead in inspiring the entire airline industry to supply passengers the dignity, respect and fairness we all deserve.”      Demetrio said Dao suffered a concussion, broken nose and two missing teeth, among other injuries. Four aviation security officers involved in the incident have been placed on leave while the investigation continues.      In an interview with NBC’s Lester Holt, Munoz called the incident “a system failure across the board.” He said outdated policies and procedures, which focused more on operations and logistics than customers, put all those involved in “impossible situations.”      When asked about the conduct of the officers involved in the violent removal of Dao from the plane, Munoz said that, yes, he thought it was wrong. But he took responsibility for the situation, saying: “Did I believe what law enforcement folks did was wrong? Yeah. But once again, it was I and we who put them in that situation.”      The 11-page report lays out how a series of unrelated events came together and created the situation.      “United Airlines takes full responsibility for what happened,” reads the report’s introduction. “The intention of this report is to communicate concrete and meaningful actions that will avoid putting our customers, employees and partners in impossible situations.”      The report lays out four ways in which United says it failed both its passengers and employees. In addition to unnecessarily summoning law enforcement, the airline should not have tried to find space on the flight for crew members at the last minute. It also should have offered more compensation or more transportation options to entice customers to give up their seats voluntarily, but it acknowledged that agents did not have the authority to make such decisions. Finally, the report said the airline has not provided regular training for employees on how to deal with “denied boarding situations.”      “Our review shows that many things went wrong that day, but the headline is clear: Our policies got in the way of our values and procedures interfered in doing what’s right,” Munoz said.      The report, which outlines 10 changes the airline is making to prevent a repeat of the incident, is the most detailed account yet of the events that led to Dao’s removal from Flight 3411.      [United chief accepts blame for dragging incident]      According to the report, Flight 3411, scheduled to leave Chicago at 5:40 p.m. for Louisville, was overbooked by one seat. After no volunteers came forward, the airline bumped a passenger who had not yet received a seating assignment. That person received a check as compensation and was booked on another United flight, the report said. The remaining passengers were allowed to board.      At the same time, however, another United flight to Louisville that had been scheduled to depart at 2:55 p.m. was delayed because of mechanical difficulties. The airline needed to get four crew members who had been booked on that earlier flight to Louisville on Sunday night in order to prevent at least one flight — and possibly several others — from being canceled.      And so the crew members were rebooked on Flight 3411. As a result, the airline needed four of the 70 passengers aboard to give up their seats. The gate agent offered 800 in travel credits plus the cost of meals and a hotel stay. When no one came forward, the agent then followed United’s procedure for involuntarily bumping passengers. A United supervisor boarded the plane and told a couple they would have to leave. The couple left. The supervisor then told Dao and his wife they would have to leave. Dao refused. After receiving multiple refusals, United officials told Dao they would call authorities if he continued to protest. At this point, another passenger volunteered to leave the plane in exchange for 1,000 in compensation. But United officials still needed a fourth seat. Chicago Department of Aviation officers, who have “historically been effective in getting customers to voluntarily comply,” then arrived on the scene, the report said. They, too, were unsuccessful in persuading Dao to leave.      According to the report, the United supervisor left the aircraft to call a manager. It was at that point that Dao, the report said, “was physically removed from the aircraft” by the aviation security officers.      That moment, captured on video by other passengers aboard the flight, showed Dao yelling as he was pulled from his seat and then dragged down the aisle of the plane.      But United is promising change.      [Here’s what United with do differently after the infamous dragging incident]      In addition to increasing the compensation for passengers who voluntarily give up their seats, the airline will create an automated system to identify passengers willing to give up their seats and allow them to set the level of compensation they would be willing to accept. Starting in August, the airline also will offer additional training for front-line staff and later this year will roll out an app that will allow employees to immediately compensate customers when a service issue arises. It also will create a “customer solutions team” charged with finding ways to get displaced passengers where they need to go.      Even though United officials say only a small percentage of passengers are involuntarily bumped from the airline’s flights, they said they will reduce overbooking on those flights on which volunteers are less likely to come forward. Overbooking is not illegal, but it has drawn new scrutiny from members of Congress following the airline’s treatment of Dao.      United’s offer of 10,000 in flight certificates brings it in line with Delta, which announced earlier this month that it was boosting the maximum amount of compensation it would offer passengers. Prior to this most recent change, United agents could offer up to 500, and supervisors could approve up to 1,500 in travel certificates and 1,350 cash.      It’s unclear whether United’s actions will be enough to satisfy lawmakers, who are already demanding changes to the way airlines treat customers. Among the provisions of a bill introduced in the Senate on Wednesday is one that would require the secretary of transportation to reexamine airlines’ practice of overbooking to determine whether limits should be placed on how many seats an airline can sell.      United had already announced some new procedures and changes. Munoz said the airline will limit the use of law enforcement to “safety and security issues only.” He also announced that the airline will no longer bump passengers once they have boarded their flight unless it involves a safety or security issue.      [After United dragging incident, 3 major airlines change passenger bumping policies]      The report noted that after being removed from the plane, Dao returned and, according to video and passenger accounts, his face was bloodied. Incident reports released by the Chicago Department of Aviation this week said Dao became increasingly combative and began swinging his arms with his fists closed after one of the officers tried to grab him. It says the officer was able to pull Dao up from his seat and toward the aisle, but then lost his grip because Dao kept fighting. The police report said Dao was removed from the plane with “minimal but necessary force.”      Munoz, however, again apologized for the events and took responsibility.      “Every customer deserves to be treated with the highest levels of service and the deepest sense of dignity and respect,” he said. “Two weeks ago, we failed to meet that standard and we profoundly apologize.”      An earlier version of this post misstated the number of failures that United officials identified as part of their investigation.

Manny studied animal communication, while Dean studied animal feeding patterns and nutrition.  But I can use this background: Communication is any way that animals share information. Many animals live in social groups. For these animals, being able to communicate is essential. Communicating increases the ability of group members to cooperate and avoid conflict. Communication may help animals work together to find food and defend themselves from predators. It also helps them find mates and care for their offspring. In addition, communication helps adult animals teach the next generation learned behaviors. Therefore, communication generally improves the chances of animals surviving and reproducing.  What is an answer for this question: Which student learned more about animals working together to find food? A:","output":"Based on the given information, Dean, who studied animal feeding patterns and nutrition, learned more about animals working together to find food. While both Manny and Dean's topics of study are relevant to animal behaviors, their focus areas are different. Manny's study of animal communication provided valuable insights into the various means animals use to share information with each other. This knowledge is crucial in understanding how animals maintain social harmony and cooperation within their groups. On the other hand, Dean's research on animal feeding patterns and nutrition specifically targeted the ways animals find, access, and consume food. This would have inherently included instances of animals working together to locate and obtain sustenance. These cooperative feeding strategies may involve specific communication methods, hunting tactics, and foraging techniques that allow animals to efficiently share resources and nourishment.

Drescher was born in Kew Gardens Hills, New York, the daughter of Sylvia, a bridal consultant, and Morty Drescher, a naval systems analyst. Her family is from Southeast and Central Europe. Her maternal great-grandmother Yetta was born in Focsani, Romania, and emigrated to the United States, while her father's family came from Poland. She has an older sister, Nadine. In the 2000s, Drescher made a return to television both with leading and guest roles. In 2003, Drescher appeared in episodes of the short lived sitcom, Good Morning, Miami as Roberta Diaz. In 2005, she returned with the sitcom Living with Fran, in which she played Fran Reeves, a middle-aged mother of two, living with Riley Martin (Ryan McPartlin), a man half her age and not much older than her son. Former Nanny costar Charles Shaughnessy appeared as her philandering ex-husband, Ted. Living with Fran was cancelled on May 17, 2006, after two seasons.  In 2006, Drescher guest starred in an episode of Law & Order: Criminal Intent; the episode, \\"The War at Home\\", aired on US television on November 14, 2006. She also appeared in an episode of Entourage and in the same year, gave her voice to the role of a female golem in The Simpsons episode \\"Treehouse of Horror XVII\\". In 2007, Drescher appeared in the US version of the Australian improvisational comedy series Thank God You're Here.  In 2008, Drescher announced that she was developing a new sitcom entitled The New Thirty, also starring Rosie O'Donnell. A series about two old high school friends coping with midlife crises, Drescher described the premature plot of the show as \\"kind of Sex and the City but we ain't getting any! It'll probably be more like The Odd Couple.\\" The sitcom failed to materialize however. In 2010, Drescher returned to television with her own daytime talk show, The Fran Drescher Tawk Show. While the program debuted to strong ratings, it ended its three-week test run to moderate success, resulting in its shelving. The following year, the sitcom Happily Divorced, created by Drescher and her ex-husband, Peter Marc Jacobson, was picked up by TV Land for a ten-episode order. It premiered there June 15, 2011. The show was renewed in July 2011 for a second season of 12 episodes, which aired in spring 2012. On May 1, 2012, TV Land extended the second season and picked up 12 additional episodes, taking the second season total to 24. The back-order of season two debuted later in 2012. Happily Divorced was cancelled in August 2013.  To promote Happily Divorced, Drescher performed the weddings of three gay couples in New York City using the minister's license she received from the Universal Life Church. Drescher hand-picked the three couples, all of whom were entrants into \\"Fran Drescher's 'Love Is Love' Gay Marriage Contest\\" on Facebook, based on the stories the couples submitted about how they met, why their relationship illustrated that \\"love is love\\" and why they wanted to be married by her.

The film also has comedic elements, including repeatedly frustrated attempts by the newlywed couple to find a moment alone with each other. The story begins when Peter is sent to Manhattan to retrieve his playboy cousin Keith (Ellison) and immediately falls in love with Francey. After a whirlwind one-day courtship, Peter and Francey get married, and they and Keith return to the Morgan family's home, where Peter teaches at the university run by his father Peter Morgan Sr. (Coburn). Mr. Morgan is known for being a proud, overbearing man, so Peter is afraid to tell him about the marriage. When they arrive, Mr. Morgan and Peter's high-society fiancÃ©e Helen (Mercer) initially take Francey for another of Keith's girlfriends. While Peter decides how to approach his father with the news, Francey stays at a women-only hotel, and Peter and Keith introduce her as a new botany student. Peter mentions Francey to his father twice, but on both occasions, Mr. Morgan interrupts and ignores his son, and when Peter becomes insistent, his apparently ailing mother (Bondi) has a flare-up of her heart condition, making any further conversation impossible. For his third attempt, Peter decides to announce the marriage to his parents at the university's student-faculty prom. Keith brings Francey to the prom as his own guest, and Francey, still posing as a student, develops a friendly rapport with Mrs. Morgan, but gets into a nasty brawl with Helen in which Francey accidentally punches Peter's father. Peter says nothing at the prom, but blurts the news to his father just as Mr. Morgan is about to give an important speech, resulting in another argument and another flare-up of Mrs. Morgan's heart condition.

Tortricidae is a large family with over 10,350 species described, and is the sole member of the superfamily Tortricoidea., although the genus \\"Heliocosma\\" is sometimes placed within this superfamily. Many of these are economically important pests. Olethreutidae is a junior synonym. The typical resting posture is with the wings folded back producing a rather rounded profile.  - Olethreutinae is a subfamily of moth in the family Tortricidae.  - In biological classification, especially zoology, the type genus is the genus which defines a biological family and the root of the family name.  - \`\` Lasperesia '' and \`\` Lespeyresia '' redirect here . These are misspellings of Laspeyresia , which was invalidly established for the genus Cydia and actually refers to the noctuid moth genus Laspeyria . Cydia is a large genus of tortrix moths , belonging to the tribe Grapholitini of subfamily Olethreutinae . Its distinctness from and delimitation versus the tribe 's type genus Grapholita requires further study . Moths in this genus are generally small and dull brown ; their caterpillars are yellow or white and wormlike . Cydia includes many species of economic importance due to the damage their caterpillars inflict as pests of agricultural crops , especially fruit and nut trees . On the other hand , some Cydia species have been used for biological control of invasive weeds , and many of these small moths and their caterpillars are an important food source for other animals . A few species from the Hawaiian Islands are suspected to be extinct due to disappearance of their foodplants . Another well - known species is the Jumping Bean Moth ( C. deshaisiana ) , whose caterpillars live in Sebastiania seeds , turning them into the famous \`\` Mexican jumping beans '' .  - Zoology (UK: , zoo-OL-luh-jee; US: , zoh-OL-luh-jee) or animal biology is the branch of biology that studies the animal kingdom, including the structure, embryology, evolution, classification, habits, and distribution of all animals, both living and extinct, and how they interact with their ecosystems. The term is derived from Ancient Greek , \\"zion\\", i.e. \\"animal\\" and , \\"logos\\", i.e. \\"knowledge, study\\".  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Moths comprise a group of insects related to butterflies, belonging to the order Lepidoptera. Most lepidopterans are moths; and there are thought to be approximately 160,000 species of moth, many of which are yet to be described. Most species of moth are nocturnal, but there are also crepuscular and diurnal species.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.

James Douglass wrote in JFK and the Unspeakable that the CIA, acting upon the orders of conspirators with the \\"military industrial complex\\", killed Kennedy and in the process set up Lee Harvey Oswald as a patsy. Like Garrison, Douglass stated that Kennedy was killed because he was turning away from the Cold War and pursuing paths of nuclear disarmament, rapprochement with Fidel Castro, and withdrawal from the war in Vietnam. Mark Lane — author of Rush to Judgment and Plausible Denial and the attorney who defended Liberty Lobby against a defamation suit brought by former CIA agent E. Howard Hunt — has been described as a leading proponent of the theory that the CIA was responsible for the assassination of Kennedy.

Question: Why did the speaker feel defeated after repeatedly trying to plug in the mouse ?","output":"The speaker felt defeated after repeatedly trying to plug in the mouse for a number of reasons. These reasons are rooted in their emotions, self-perception, the significance of the task at hand, and the consequences of not being able to successfully complete it. Let's delve into the factors that contributed to this feeling of defeat: 1. Frustration: Attempting to perform a seemingly simple task like connecting a mouse, especially after multiple attempts without success, can lead to increasing levels of frustration. The speaker may have felt defeated by their inability to overcome this challenge, which only made the situation feel more dire as time went on. 2. Personal expectations and self-perception: After spending four years on the web, a person can develop a certain level of competence and expertise in managing technology. The speaker likely had high expectations for themselves, assuming that they should be able to handle a simple task quickly and efficiently. Failing to do so could have been deflating for them, making them feel incompetent and defeated. 3. Impact on productivity: The speaker mentioned having posts to write and updates to make, which implies that they had important work to complete. The inability to connect the mouse prevented them from carrying out these tasks, adding to the disappointment and aggravation. The potential consequences of falling behind on their work may have further contributed to their feeling defeated. 4. Presence of an audience: It is noted that many people are familiar with the speaker after being online for four years, which suggests that the speaker has an audience and a reputation to uphold. Knowing that others might be witnessing their struggle or anticipating their work can create mounting pressure. Feeling defeated might be an emotional response to the fear of losing face in front of their audience. 5. Overwhelming emotions: As human beings, we may sometimes disproportionately react to situations based on our current emotional state. If the speaker was already experiencing stress or frustration from other sources, attempting this simple task repeatedly could have amplified their negative emotions, making them feel even more defeated. In conclusion, the speaker felt defeated after repeatedly trying to plug in the mouse because of the frustration stemming from failing at a seemingly simple task, the incongruity between their self-perception and their performance, the interference with their productivity, and the potential impact on their reputation. This sense of defeat may have been exacerbated by overwhelming emotions and a heightened sense of pressure from their existing audience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bradbury was related to the American Shakespeare scholar Douglas Spaulding and descended from Mary Bradbury, who was tried at one of the Salem witch trials in 1692. The family lived about four blocks from the Uptown Theater on Western Avenue in Los Angeles, the flagship theater for MGM and Fox. There, Bradbury learned how to sneak in and watched previews almost every week. He rollerskated there, as well as all over town, as he put it, \\"hell-bent on getting autographs from glamorous stars. It was glorious.\\" Among stars the young Bradbury was thrilled to encounter were Norma Shearer, Laurel and Hardy, and Ronald Colman.

Question: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron.

People, towns, high schools, and colleges come together, usually in late September or early October, to welcome back alumni and former residents. It is built around a central event, such as a banquet and, most often, a game of American football, or, on occasion, basketball, ice hockey or soccer. When celebrated by schools, the activities vary widely. However, they usually consist of a football game played on a school's home football field, activities for students and alumni, a parade featuring the school's marching band and sports teams, and the coronation of a Homecoming Queen (and at many schools, a Homecoming King). A dance commonly follows the game or the day following the game. When attached to a football game, Homecoming traditionally occurs on the team's return from the longest road trip of the season.

Home to most of the university's original buildings, this portion of the campus remains the geographic and historic center of the modern campus. Originally designed by noted English-born architect William Nichols, construction of the university campus began in 1828, following the move of the Alabama state capital from Cahaba to Tuscaloosa in 1826. The overall design for this early version of the campus was patterned after Thomas Jefferson's plan for the University of Virginia, with its Lawn and Rotunda. Following the destruction of the campus during the American Civil War, a new Quad emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Different in form and function from the original design of the early 19th century, the modern Quad continues to fill its role as the heart of the campus. Although completely surrounded by academic and administrative buildings, only five structures are built directly on the Quad: the Little Round House, Tuomey Hall, Oliver-Barnard Hall, Amelia Gayle Gorgas Library, and Denny Chimes.

But have you ever wondered why those things make you uncomfortable? It's all about personal peace, which means not only an imaginary space around the body, but also the space around all the senses. People feel that their space is being violated   when they meet with an unwelcome sound, smell or look. This is probably why a man on a crowded bus shouting into his mobile phone or a woman next to you putting on strong perfume   makes you feel angry. Whether people have had a stronger wish to protect their personal space in recent times is hard to say. Yet studies of airlines show that people have a strong desire   to have space to themselves. In a survey  by Trip Advisor, a travel website, people said that if they had to pay more for some extra service, they would rather have larger seats than extra food. Although people may need their personal space, some hardly realize it. For example, people on a bus who hold newspapers in front of their faces to read in fact keep a distance from strangers. Go and watch a library table. You will notice that one of the corner seats will usually be taken first, because they are the farthest way. What if someone sits opposite to you?

He said they told him they were from either New Jersey or New York. The U.S. Embassy would not comment on whether an American had been shot.      The victim was conscious but his friends were in shock, the bar workers said.      “He was bleeding through his eye,” Lamas recalled. “I went to get the first-aid kit and I started speaking to his friends and to try and calm them down.\\"      Before the shots were fired, he heard someone shout “knives, knives, knives.\\" A beer barrel was used to block the door from the inside, and staff locked the doors and gates.

PM Theresa May said victims included a \\"number of nationalities\\", saying it was \\"an attack on the free world\\".      It comes as police have searched more addresses in east London.      Police said a \\"number of people\\" had been detained following the raids, in Newham and Barking.      Eleven people are being held after police raids in Barking on Sunday. One of the properties is believed to be the home of one of the attackers.      The three attackers were shot dead by police after driving into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbing people in Borough Market.      The Independent Police Complaints Commission said 46 shots were fired by eight police officers - three from the City of London force and five from the Met.      NHS England said 36 people remained in hospital, with 18 in a critical condition.      Bank card on body      Canadian national Chrissy Archibald, 30, was the first victim to be named.

It is the third terror attack in the UK in three months, following the car and knife attack on Westminster Bridge in March, in which five people were killed, and the Manchester bombing less than two weeks ago, in which 22 people were killed.      A new normal?      Image copyright Getty Images      Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent      With three attacks in three months, acts of terror against soft targets is beginning to feel, to some people, like the new normal.      The brutal reality is that this kind of threat is absolutely typical of what jihadists sought to achieve in all their attacks across Europe.      Since 2013 security services in the UK have foiled 18 plots. A large proportion of those have involved suspects who set out to commit acts of violence similar to the attacks on Westminster Bridge and London Bridge.      Plans to use bombs, such as at Manchester Arena, are rarer because plotters need to have the technical skills for such an appalling attack - but attacking people with cars and knives is far easier and has long been encouraged by so-called Islamic State and other jihadists.      The aim of the three attackers last night is abundantly clear - not only did they want to kill, but they wanted to lose their own lives.      They would have known full well that attacking people in the street would draw armed police in their direction and the fake bomb belts they were wearing would, in their own warped minds, hasten their demise.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. who are the real singers for milli vanilli??","output":"Milli Vanilli was a German-French R&B duo formed in 1988 by producer Frank Farian, consisting of Fabrice Morvan and Rob Pilatus. The group experienced significant commercial success in the late 1980s and early 1990s, selling millions of records. However, in 1990, it was revealed that Morvan and Pilatus, the public faces of Milli Vanilli, were not the actual singers on their albums. Instead, they lip-synced to songs recorded by other vocalists in the studio. The real singers behind Milli Vanilli were: 1. Charles Shaw - An American-German singer and rapper who provided the rap lyrics on the track \\"Girl You Know It's True.\\" Though Shaw initially revealed the lip-syncing scandal to the media, he was dismissed by Farian as a \\"disgruntled\\" contributor, and he later recanted his claims. Eventually, the truth emerged, and Shaw was acknowledged as one of the actual vocalists behind Milli Vanilli. 2. Brad Howell - A Chicago native, Howell was an experienced session singer and the lead male vocalist for Milli Vanilli. He had performed with artists like Frank Zappa and contributed vocals to many successful disco and funk-era projects. Most of Milli Vanilli's hits, including \\"Girl You Know It's True,\\" \\"Blame It On the Rain,\\" and \\"Baby Don't Forget My Number,\\" were primarily sung by Howell. 3. John Davis - Another singer from South Carolina, Davis was also one of the principal male vocalists behind Milli Vanilli's songs. Sharing vocal duties with Brad Howell, he performed on many of the group's biggest hits. However, given Farian's desire to maintain the charade around Morvan and Pilatus, Davis's role in the group was always downplayed. 4. Jodie Rocco & Linda Rocco - The Rocco sisters provided backing vocals on many of Milli Vanilli's tracks, offering harmonies and supporting vocal lines. Both sisters were American singers residing in Germany at the time and had worked closely with other artists before and after the Milli Vanilli scandal. They were part of the studio ensemble that recorded the group's music. After the lip-syncing scandal was exposed, Milli Vanilli was stripped of their Grammy Award for \\"Best New Artist,\\" and the duo soon disbanded. The real singers, however, continued their music careers with various levels of success. Following the scandal, Frank Farian attempted to capitalize on the newfound notoriety of the actual singers by assembling a vocal group called \\"The Real Milli Vanilli,\\" which featured Charles Shaw, Brad Howell, John Davis, and several other musicians. They released an album in 1991 titled \\"The Moment of Truth,\\" but it failed to achieve the same levels of success as the original Milli Vanilli records. Unfortunately, Rob Pilatus faced considerable personal challenges after the scandal and passed away in 1998. Fabrice Morvan has subsequently pursued a solo career and occasionally collaborates with other musicians, including some of the original Milli Vanilli singers."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: You make decisions, year after year, never lasting for more than a few days ending up lost and in the same place you started. Allow me to suggest some tips that may help you stick to your decisions creating long- lasting positive change in your life. Telling other people about your plan can help in many ways. First, it is always easier to stick to a decision when you have other people supporting you. Your friends are less likely to tempt you with whatever it is you are trying to control if they know that you made a decision about it. Telling other people about your decision is also helpful in that it keeps us to the pressure on you to try and stick to you plan of action. Choose a measurable and specific decision. Instead of deciding to \\"look better\\" or \\"have a better relationship with so and so\\", choose a more definable decision. Deciding to \\"eat a vegetable every day\\" or \\"go out for coffee once a week with John\\" is much easier to track and assess than a general decision to \\"be a better person\\". Build a reward system. Connected to the last tip of choosing a measurable and specific decision is that when you do accomplish this specific behavior you decided to do, give yourself small rewards along the process. For example, for every week of healthy eating treat yourself with something special. Creative visual aids. A colleague of mine decided one year for his New Year's decision to be more frugal.

Here are possible answers to this question: - laboratory - the pyramids of gaza - music shop - operating room - case  I believe the correct choice is \\"operating room\\", here's why: The answer to this question is:","output":"Operating Room. Medical instruments are primarily used in operating rooms, as these specialized tools are essential for performing various surgical procedures and medical interventions. An operating room, also known as an operating theater or surgery suite, is a specifically designed and equipped room within a hospital or clinic where surgical procedures take place. The environment in an operating room is sterile to minimize the risk of infection, and the room typically contains the necessary surgical equipment and supplies, as well as a team of medical professionals including surgeons, anesthesiologists, and nurses. Let me explain why the other options are not suitable: 1. Laboratory: While some medical instruments might be used in a laboratory for research and testing purposes, their primary use is in operating rooms for medical procedures. Labs mainly focus on the examination and analysis of biological specimens rather than surgery. 2. The Pyramids of Gaza: The Pyramids of Gaza are ancient structures with historical significance. They have no relevance to the contemporary use of medical instruments. 3. Music Shop: A music shop sells musical instruments and accessories, not medical instruments. 4. Case: A case, in this context, might refer to a container for storing or transporting medical instruments. Although it may carry medical tools, the actual usage of the instruments would take place within the operating room.

They find that the pear-shaped fat people have fewer problems than the apple-shaped  people. What seems to be most important is not just how much fat you have but where you have it. The doctors measured the apple-shaped women and pear-shaped women and examined them  with X-ray scanners (X). Human beings have two types of fat, one is outside fat that is the fat below the skin and the other is inside fat that lies inside the body. Using the X-ray scanners, the doctors found that the \\"apples\\" have a large amount of inside fat. If this inside fat is  much more than outside fat, it will probably cause health problems such as obesity  . The best treatment for obesity is to reduce the inside fat. But unfortunately diet treatment  simply makes an apple-shaped person into a smaller apple and a pear-shaped person into a smaller pear. At the moment there is no effective way of reducing the inside fat. Question: According to the relation between health and fatness - it's better to be pear-shaped than apple-shaped - it's better to be apple-shaped than pear-shaped - apple-shaped fat people have fewer problems than pear-shaped people - fatness is the most dangerous enemy to health Answer:","output":"it's better to be pear-shaped than apple-shaped"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: William S. Knowles, Dies at 95 William S. Knowles, who was 84 and in retirement when he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2001 for improving ways to manufacture drugs, including L-dopa for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, died on Wednesday at his home in Chesterfield, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis. He was 95. His death was confirmed by his daughter Elizabeth Knowles. Dr. Knowles, who had worked for the Monsanto Company from 1942 to 1986, had been retired for 15 years when he was woken up by an early-morning phone call from Stockholm in October 2001, telling him that he had won the Nobel Prize. “I’ve been retired and out of the running for some time,” he told his local newspaper in Chesterfield, The Webster-Kirkwood Times. The prize, for work in a field known as chiral chemistry, was also awarded to Ryoji Noyori of Nagoya University in Japan and K. Barry Sharpless of the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego. Just as the left hand is a mirror image of the right, many molecules come in two forms, identical in chemical composition but mirror images of each other. The two forms can have very different properties and sharply different effects on the body. For example, one version of the molecule limonene smells of oranges; its mirror image has a lemony, turpentinelike odor. The drug L-dopa is another example. In one form, called L, it reduces Parkinson’s symptoms like tremors and rigidity. But it also comes in another form, D-dopa, which is toxic. In the 1960s, the standard process to make L-dopa yielded equal amounts of the two forms. Separating them after they were made was time-consuming and expensive. Dr. Knowles figured out a way to tweak the manufacturing process to produce more of the most desirable form of certain molecules, including L-dopa. His tool was a catalyst, a substance often used to speed up a chemical reaction. He developed a process called asymmetric hydrogenation, which uses a catalyst not just to speed the reaction but also to skew it to produce 97.5 percent L-dopa and only 2.5 percent of the unwanted D form. Monsanto then began large-scale production of the drug, which is still a mainstay in treating Parkinson’s, especially in the disease’s early stages. William Standish Knowles was born in Taunton, Mass., on June 1, 1917. He graduated a year early from the Berkshire School, a boarding school in western Massachusetts, and was admitted to Harvard. But after being strongly advised that he was not socially mature enough for college, he did a second senior year of high school at another boarding school, Phillips Academy in Andover, N.H. Dr. Knowles graduated from Harvard with a bachelor’s degree in chemistry in 1939 and completed his doctorate at Columbia in 1942. He started work for Monsanto in Dayton, Ohio, before transferring to the company’s home base, St. Louis, in 1944, where he worked until retiring in 1986. In 2004, he was admitted to the National Academy of Sciences. Besides his daughter Elizabeth, Dr. Knowles is survived by his wife of 66 years, Nancy; a son, Peter; two other daughters, Lesley McIntire and Sarah Knowles; and four grandchildren. Elizabeth Knowles said her father did not keep any of the Nobel Prize money — more than 200,000. He gave some to two Monsanto colleagues who had collaborated on his L-dopa research and donated the rest to Harvard and Columbia. In retirement, Dr. Knowles restored native prairie grasses on a 100-acre farm his wife had inherited. When Missouri sought to build a highway across the land, which overlooks the Missouri River, the couple fought the plan and won: the highway was moved a few hundred feet north so it would go around the property. In 2007, the Knowleses announced that they would donate the farmland after their deaths so it could be used for a county park.","output":"Nobel Prize-winning chemist William S.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: What do people break into a brownstone to steal? Possible A: ring, subdivision, live in, new york city, circlet  Why is \\"ring\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Ring\\" as an answer is aligned with human common sense because it refers to a valuable object that people might desire and potentially break into a brownstone to steal. A ring, particularly if it's made of precious metals or adorned with gemstones, can have significant monetary value, making it a possible target for theft. Moreover, rings can often have sentimental value, making them even more attractive for potential burglars. On the other hand, the other possible answers do not align with human common sense in the context of the question: 1. \\"Subdivision\\" refers to the division of a larger piece of land into smaller lots, which cannot physically be broken into and stolen. It is an abstract concept and does not relate to the act of stealing an object from a brownstone. 2. \\"Live in\\" refers to residing in a place, which is not something one would typically break into a brownstone to steal. The act of living in a brownstone would be considered squatting or trespassing if done without the owner's consent, rather than stealing. 3. \\"New York City\\" represents an entire city, which cannot physically be broken into or stolen. It is not a specific object that could be the target of theft within a brownstone. 4. \\"Circlet\\" could potentially be considered an answer with human common sense, as it refers to a type of small, decorative circle, often worn as a headpiece. However, it is less common and less valuable compared to a ring. Circlets are typically not regarded as highly valuable items, and therefore, are less likely targets for burglars in comparison to rings. Additionally, the term \\"circlet\\" is not as universally recognized or understood as \\"ring.\\" In conclusion, \\"ring\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense because a ring is a valuable object that is commonly recognized and understood, making it a reasonable target for theft. Rings hold both monetary and sentimental value, which would tempt potential burglars to break into a brownstone to steal one. The other possible answers do not have the same association with theft or represent objects that could be broken into or stolen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The first player to get rid of their last card (\`\`going out'') wins the hand and scores points for the cards held by the other players.

If a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four card is played to go out, the next player in sequence must draw the appropriate number of cards before the score is tallied. See options at the end. Can we conclude that can you end an uno game with a draw four? Choose from: *no. *yes.","output":"Yes, you can end an Uno game with a Wild Draw Four card. In the card game Uno, the objective is to be the first player to get rid of all their cards, and this can be done using any of the cards available, including action cards like the Wild Draw Four. When a player goes out (gets rid of their last card), they score points for the cards remaining in the hands of other players. As you mentioned, if a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four card is played to go out, the next player in sequence must draw the appropriate number of cards before the score is tallied. While it is true that playing a Wild Draw Four card to go out may cause disagreements among players due to the potential for targeted and strategic play, it is still a legal move within the game. The Wild Draw Four card can be a powerful and game-changing card since it not only allows the player to change the color of the card being played, but it also forces the next player to draw four additional cards. This means that not only would the player finishing with a Wild Draw Four card win that round, but they would also likely earn a significant number of points from their opponents having to hold onto those extra cards. It should be noted that playing a Wild Draw Four card to finish the game is not always recommended since it can lead to a less friendly atmosphere amongst players. Even though it is permitted within the game's rules, it is essential to keep the game light-hearted and enjoyable for all participants. In conclusion, yes, you can end an Uno game with a Wild Draw Four. However, the strategic and potential negative implications of doing so should be kept in mind when deciding to make this move.

Polluting light is often wasted light involving unnecessary energy costs and carbon dioxide emissions. Light pollution is described as artificial light that is excessive or intrudes where it is not wanted. Well-designed lighting sends light only where it is needed without scattering it elsewhere. Poorly designed lighting can also compromise safety.

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: The Malegese Ocean is primarily connected to one river. This river is next to Hilda's farm that she has lived on for decades. Ever since she was a child, she was taught that it's important to dump excess fertilizer into the river. So, that's what she does whenever she has leftover fertilizer she isn't going to use. The Dundrin Ocean is connected to many rivers. However, these rivers are located primarily in uninhabited and natural areas of the world. There is one farm near the Dundrin, though, which is owned by Luke. Luke never disposes of any of his garbage in the ocean or rivers near his farm, and he chooses instead to store excess fertilizer for the future or properly dispose of his trash.  and a hint : Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.  Please answer this question : Which ocean would it be harder to catch a fish in? Answer:","output":"In order to answer this question, we need to consider the impact of marine pollution on both oceans and compare their potential for creating hypoxia or dead zones, which would make it difficult to catch fish. Step 1: Analyze the impact of pollution on the Malegese Ocean The Malegese Ocean is primarily connected to one river, which happens to be next to Hilda's farm. Hilda regularly dumps excess fertilizer into the river. This increases the amount of chemicals entering the Malegese Ocean, which could deplete oxygen levels, leading to the creation of hypoxia and possibly a dead zone. As a result, fish populations could be negatively impacted in the Malegese Ocean. Step 2: Analyze the impact of pollution on the Dundrin Ocean The Dundrin Ocean is connected to many rivers, mostly in uninhabited and natural areas. This could suggest that there are fewer sources of pollution, such as agricultural waste, entering the ocean. Furthermore, there is only one farm near the Dundrin, owned by Luke, who is cautious about proper waste disposal and does not dump pollutants into the ocean or rivers. This indicates that there is likely to be a lower level of pollution in the Dundrin Ocean compared to the Malegese Ocean, potentially resulting in fewer or less severe hypoxia occurrences and dead zones. Step 3: Compare the pollution levels Based on the information provided, it seems that the Malegese Ocean is subjected to higher levels of pollution, primarily due to Hilda's farm and her practice of dumping excess fertilizer into the river. In contrast, the Dundrin Ocean appears to be less polluted due to its connections with less inhabited areas and Luke's responsible practices. Conclusion: Based on the comparison, it would likely be harder to catch a fish in the Malegese Ocean compared to the Dundrin Ocean due to the increased probability of hypoxia and dead zones resulting from pollution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Albert Einstein and Pablo Picasso were not yet born. The Eiffel Tower was 14 years from being built. As a teenager, she met Vincent Van Gogh, near her home in Arles, in the south of France. He was \\"very ugly, ungracious  , impolite, sick--I forgive him, they called him loco  \\", she recalled. When she died last week at age 122, she was the world's eldest person.

Surprisingly, his innovative playing initially received greater attention and appreciation among European critics than those in the country of his birth. The British music trade magazine \\"Melody Maker\\" published a number of reviews of his recordings and assessments of his cornet playing. In the April 1927 issue, bandleader Fred Elizalde stated: \\"Bix Bidlebeck (sic) is considered by Red Nichols himself and every other trumpet player in the States, for that matter, as the greatest trumpet player of all time\\". The magazine's editor, Edgar Jackson, was equally fulsome in his praise: \\"Bix has a heart as big as your head, which shines through his playing with the warmth of the sun's rays\\" (September 1927 issue); \\"The next sixteen bars are a trumpet solo by Bix, and if this doesn't get you right in the heart, you'd better see a vet….\\" In Blackboard Jungle, a 1955 film starring Glenn Ford and Sidney Poitier, Beiderbecke's music is briefly featured, but as a symbol of cultural conservatism in a nation on the cusp of the rock and roll revolution. Brendan Wolfe, the author of Finding Bix, spoke of Beiderbecke's lasting influence on Davenport, Iowa: \\"His name and face are still a huge part of the city's identity. There's an annual Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival, and a Bix 7 road race with tens of thousands of runners, Bix T-shirts, bumper stickers, bobble-head dolls, the whole works.\\" In 1971, on the 40th anniversary of Beiderbecke's death, the Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival was founded in Davenport, Iowa, to honor the musician.  In 1974, Sudhalter and Evans published their biography, Bix: Man and Legend, which was nominated for a National Book Award. In 1977, the Beiderbecke childhood home at 1934 Grand Avenue in Davenport was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\\"Bix: 'Ain't None of Them Play Like Him Yet\\", a 1981 film documentary on Beiderbecke's life directed and produced by Brigitte Berman, featured interviews with... contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that is was said his trumpet playing with the warmth of the sun's rays?, what is it ?

There was only one bull who wasn't doing that, and that was Ferdinand. All he wanted to do was go under a shady cork tree and smell the flowers all day. Then one day his mother noticed that he wasn't playing with the other bulls. His mom asked him why he wasn't butting his head with the other bulls. He replied that all he wanted to do was to sit and smell the flowers. Luckily, his mother was very understanding. Over the years, Ferdinand grew and grew until he was as big as the tree. The other bulls wanted to accomplish one goal in life: to be in the bullfights in Madrid, Spain, but not Ferdinand. Then one day, five strange-looking men were here to see the bulls. When the bulls noticed them, they fought as rough as possible, hoping that they would get picked, but not Ferdinand who went back to smell the flowers. Just as Ferdinand was sitting, he accidentally sat on a bumblebee. That made him go crazy and on a rampage, knocking the other bulls out and crashed into a tree, making it fall down. The five men cheered as they took Ferdinand to Madrid. There was a lot of excitement when the day of the bullfight came. On posters, they called him Ferdinand the Fierce. At the ring came out banderilleros, picadors and the matador who was being cheered on. When he was bowing, a woman in the audience gave him a bouquet of flowers which landed in his hand. Then the moment came where Ferdinand came out. He was wondering what was he doing there. The banderilleros and picadors were scared and hid, but the matador was scared stiff because Ferdinand was so big and strong. But Ferdinand looked up in the stands and saw all of the beautiful hats that the women were wearing, each decorated with lovely, fragrant flowers. He couldn't stop staring at all the beautiful hats. The matador was very angry that Ferdinand wasn't charging at him. But Ferdinand was not interested in fighting; he was only interested in admiring the beautiful flowers....

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who designed the monument that had an inscription removed in 1830? ?  Radical rebuilding schemes poured in for the gutted City and were encouraged by Charles. If it had been rebuilt under some of these plans, London would have rivalled Paris in Baroque magnificence (see Evelyn's plan on the right). The Crown and the City authorities attempted to establish \\"to whom all the houses and ground did in truth belong\\" to negotiate with their owners about compensation for the large-scale remodelling that these plans entailed, but that unrealistic idea had to be abandoned. Exhortations to bring workmen and measure the plots on which the houses had stood were mostly ignored by people worried about day-to-day survival, as well as by those who had left the capital; for one thing, with the shortage of labour following the fire, it was impossible to secure workmen for the purpose. Apart from Wren and Evelyn, it is known that Robert Hooke, Valentine Knight, and Richard Newcourt proposed rebuilding plans. With the complexities of ownership unresolved, none of the grand Baroque schemes could be realised for a City of piazzas and avenues; there was nobody to negotiate with, and no means of calculating how much compensation should be paid. Instead, much of the old street plan was recreated in the new City, with improvements in hygiene and fire safety: wider streets, open and accessible wharves along the length of the Thames, with no houses obstructing access to the river, and, most importantly, buildings constructed of brick and stone, not wood. New public buildings were created on their predecessors' sites; perhaps the most famous is St Paul's Cathedral and its smaller cousins, Christopher Wren's 50 new churches. On Charles' initiative, a Monument to the Great Fire of London was erected near Pudding Lane, designed by Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke, standing 61 metres (200 ft) tall and known simply as \\"The Monument\\". It is a familiar London landmark which has since given its name to a tube station. In 1668, accusations against the Catholics were added to the inscription on the Monument which...

SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation. Humanitarian assistance has been exempted from the economic sanctions, but Beasely said import restrictions has made it more complicated to bring in aid, and made...

He is an earnest employee liked by his colleagues and is secretly in love and secretly even wanted to marry with Seo Yoon-hee (Son Ye-jin), a restaurant manager.The owner of the complex, Mr. Jo decides to hold a \\"White Christmas\\" party for tenants and VIPs on Christmas Eve, with helicopters circling above with huge lights attached below them, sprinkling snow onto the party. Dae-ho has promised to spend the day at an amusement park with his daughter Ha-na, but has to cancel when he is needed at the party. However, the building has faulty water sprinklers due to frozen pipes, but Mr. Cha, the Tower Sky's safety section head, is more concerned for the party than any possible architectural errors within the building, despite warnings from his fellow employers about these errors.One example of their warnings is when cook Young-cheol (Jeon Bae-soo) accidentally leaves a stove on for too long and causes a minor fire. Young-cheo is in love with a receptionist within the building named Min-jung, and even sneaks out of the kitchen while on duty to make her an ice cream.Meanwhile, Lee Seon-woo (Do Ji-han) is a rookie fireman entering the Yeouido Fire Station. When he gets accepted, he learns that many of the firefighters get more breaks than actual firefighting. In a prank to fool Seon-woo, the other firefighters ring the fire alarm for the squad to assemble while he takes a shower, causing him to appear in front of his entire team naked, much to the other firefighters' and even his own pleasure as they put his helmet on him for the first time.That evening, while the party is in full swing, and while Young-cheo proposes a rose to Min-jung in an elevator, huge gusts of wind cause one of the helicopters to lose control and the attached lights crash into the glass bridge connecting the two Tower Sky buildings and into a side of one of the buildings. Another... My question: Why are helicopters circling the tower?

Article: Her acting clashed with her costars’ — not that there’s anything wrong with that.      “Seinfeld” star Jason Alexander has revealed in an interview that the hit sitcom’s cast decided to kill off his character’s unbearable fiancée because she was “f- -king impossible” to work with.      The actor, who played the hapless George Costanza, told Howard Stern that actress Heidi Swedberg was given the ax after co-stars Jerry Seinfeld and Julia Louis-Dreyfus both agreed she was not jibing with the cast.      “And Julia actually said, ‘Don’t you want to just kill her?’ And Larry [David, the series’ co-creator] went, ‘Kabang! Now we gotta kill her!’ ” Alexander recalled on the “Howard Stern Show” on Sirius XM Radio.      Swedberg’s character, Susan Ross, was famously killed off in an 1996 episode titled “The Invitations” — in which she dies after licking toxic wedding-invitation envelopes that had been bought by George on the cheap.      Alexander, currently starring on Broadway in Larry David’s play, “Fish in the Dark,” told Stern that Swedberg had been unable to master her own domain.      “She’s a terrific girl. I love her. I couldn’t figure out how to play off of her,” he said. “Her instincts for doing a scene — where the comedy was — and mine were always misfiring. And she would do something, and I would go, ‘OK, I see what she’s going to do, I’m going to adjust to her,’ and then I’d adjust, and she’d change.”      In the show, George had attempted to sabotage his nuptials by taking up smoking and asking for a prenup. He even went out for coffee with actress Marisa Tomei, who played herself on the show.      The last straw came when Seinfeld himself did a scene with Swedberg. “Finally, they do an episode where Elaine and Jerry have a lot of material with her,” Alexander recalled.      After that scene, Louis-Dreyfus and Seinfeld said, “You know what? It’s f- -king impossible. It’s impossible,” Alexander told Stern.      “Every time I tell this story, I cringe because Heidi is the sweetest,” he added.      “And Julia actually said, ‘I know, don’t you just want to just kill her?’” he said. “And Larry went, ‘Ka-bang! Now we got to kill her, we got to kill her!’”      Alexander later offered a long mea culpa via Twitter.      “I feel officially awful,” he wrote in a linked apology.      “To Heidi, I personally apologize. You are a sweetheart. I actually launched into this on Stern to defend you. But this is why I’m not a lawyer.”      Swedberg — who has found a calling as a ukulele player in Los Angeles — could not be reached for comment Thursday night. ||||| Oh dear God, leave Heidi alone      Ok folks, I feel officially awful. Yesterday on @Sternshow, I retold a story I had told years ago about my personal difficulties and insecurities in playing George against the Susan that Heidi Swedberg created. The impetus for telling this story was that Howard said, \\"Julia Louis Dreyfuss told me you all wanted to kill her\\". So I told the story to try and clarify that no one wanted to kill Heidi.            And again I say, I and the cast really liked and like Heidi. She is a kind, lovely person who undoubtedly worked really hard to create Susan and that character was clearly what Larry and Jerry wanted her to be for George. I just felt I was on uncertain ground in how to play off that character and I was always concerned that it wasn't working. And that's what I would voice concern about. But because the scenes were playing the way they were, the relationship with George and Susan sustained a whole season. People clearly liked the interplay even though I believed I was \\"off\\".            Larry and Jerry were not sure how that relationship would end. They didn't really want George married but all the alternatives seemed predictable. They were always looking for an inventive end to the engagement. So when the comment was made about \\"killing\\", no one was talking about the actress - they were talking about the character. And that made a creative lightbulb go off apparently.            But in telling this story, it sounds like we are putting a heavy burden on Heidi. I, personally, am not. Heidi would always ask if there was anything in the scenes she could do or if I had any thoughts. She was generous and gracious and I am so mad at myself for retelling this story in any way that would diminish her. If I had had more maturity or more security in my own work, I surely would have taken her query and possibly tried to adjust the scenes with her. She surely offered. But, I didn't have that maturity or security. And, Larry and Jerry would probably have killed me as it was all playing exactly as they wanted. Clearly Susan and George were coming off just the way they wanted.            So, to all the press that is now running wild with this 15 year old story, please don't pervert it. No one told Heidi to do anything different - and she surely would have, if asked. And no one that I am aware of, including myself, didn't like her. And now with distance, I can look at those episodes and see that there was a fun relationship there between George and Susan. It works perfectly. I simply couldn't see it or find it at the time.            To Heidi, I personally apologize. You are a sweetheart. I actually launched into this on Stern to defend you. But this is why I'm not a lawyer. Now everybody, calm down and just enjoy the reruns and think, \\"why did he think this wasn't working? This is great.\\"      JA      Reply · Report Post ||||| Seinfeld is now streaming on Hulu and that's reason enough to get a refresher course on the A-listers that have appeared on the beloved sitcom before making it big. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"In this article, they talk about a popular TV show called \\"Seinfeld\\".

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: In what year did the colony established by Robert Cavelier de La Salle fail? ?  The French colonization of Texas began with the establishment of a fort in present-day southeastern Texas. It was established in 1685 near Arenosa Creek and Matagorda Bay by explorer Robert Cavelier de La Salle. He intended to found the colony at the mouth of the Mississippi River, but inaccurate maps and navigational errors caused his ships to anchor instead 400 miles (640 km) to the west, off the coast of Texas. The colony survived until 1688. The present-day town of Inez is near the fort's site. The colony faced numerous difficulties during its brief existence, including Native American raids, epidemics, and harsh conditions. From that base, La Salle led several expeditions to find the Mississippi River. These did not succeed, but La Salle did explore much of the Rio Grande and parts of east Texas. During one of his absences in 1686, the colony's last ship was wrecked, leaving the colonists unable to obtain resources from the French colonies of the Caribbean. As conditions deteriorated, La Salle realized the colony could survive only with help from the French settlements in Illinois Country to the north, along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. His last expedition ended along the Brazos River in early 1687, when La Salle and five of his men were murdered during a mutiny. Although a handful of men reached Illinois Country, help never made it to the fort. Most of the remaining members of the colony were killed during a Karankawa raid in late 1688, four children survived after being adopted as captives. Although the colony lasted only three years, it established France's claim to possession of the region that is now Texas. The United States later claimed, unsuccessfully, this region as part of the Louisiana Purchase because of the early French colony. Spain learned of La Salle's mission in 1686. Concerned that the French colony could threaten Spain's control over the Viceroyalty of New Spain and the unsettled southeastern region of North America, the Crown funded multiple expeditions to locate and eliminate...

Given the question: Process: - A mold spore floats through the air - The spore lands on a piece of bread - The spore grows hyphae into the bread - The mold forms a colony - Sporangiophores grow upward - The mold sends out spores.  Question: suppose more colonies of mold forming happens, how will it affect MORE mold forming on bread.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"More effect. When more colonies of mold start forming on a piece of bread, it will definitely have a greater effect on further mold growth on that particular bread. Here's how the supposed perturbation influences the second effect mentioned in detail: 1. Enhanced mold growth: As more mold colonies continue to develop on the bread, the growth rate increases due to the increased number of spores released by these colonies. The combined effect of all the colonies will lead to a rapid spread of mold across the entire surface of the bread, as more spores are available to land on it, germinate and produce new hyphae, which will grow into additional mold colonies. 2. Competition for resources: Mold feeds on organic material present in bread for sustenance. With more colonies developing, the competition for nutrients and moisture escalates, driving an overall increase in mold activity. This competition drives growth as the mold colonies are vying to establish themselves and secure the limited resources of the bread. 3. Accelerated spoilage: As more mold colonies form, the rate of bread spoilage increases accordingly, since the mold breaks down the bread's components into simpler nutrients for mold sustenance. Moreover, an increase in mold growth might lead to the production of harmful compounds such as mycotoxins, rendering the bread unsafe for consumption. 4. Enhanced sporulation: As the available nutrients and space on the bread dwindles, the mold colonies will sense environmental stress and respond by producing more spores (reproductive cells) to ensure their survival and dispersal to more favorable environments. These spores will contribute to increasing the chance of more mold formation on the bread, in addition to the possibility of finding new bread or other organic substrates to colonize. 5. Faster adaptation: With a greater number of colonies and spores, the mold population will have a higher chance of developing new traits through genetic mutations that could make them more efficient at colonizing the bread or adapting to adverse conditions. In summary, the formation of more colonies of mold on a piece of bread will have a more significant effect on further mold growth on that bread. The perturbation caused by the increase in mold colonies leads to enhanced mold growth, competition for resources, accelerated spoilage, enhanced sporulation, and faster adaptation, making the entire process more efficient and exacerbating the initial effect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Chrismansyah Rahadi ([xrisˈmanʃah raˈhadi]; 16 September 1949 – 30 March 2007), born Christian Rahadi but better known by his stage name of Chrisye ([xəˈriʃə]), was an Indonesian progressive pop singer and songwriter. In his 40-year career he won many awards and accolades; in 2011 Rolling Stone Indonesia declared him the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time. Born in Jakarta of mixed Chinese-Indonesian descent, Chrisye became interested in music at an early age. At high school he played bass guitar in a band he formed with his brother, Joris. In the late 1960s he joined Sabda Nada (later Gipsy), a band led by his neighbours, the Nasutions. In 1973, after a short hiatus, he rejoined the band to play in New York for a year. He briefly returned to Indonesia and then went back to New York with another band, the Pro's. After once again returning to Indonesia, he collaborated with Gipsy and Guruh Sukarnoputra to record the 1976 indie album Guruh Gipsy. Following the success of Guruh Gipsy, in 1977 Chrisye recorded two of his most critically acclaimed works: \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" by James F. Sundah, which eventually became his signature song, and the soundtrack album Badai Pasti Berlalu. Their success landed him a recording contract with Musica Studios, with whom he released his first solo album, Sabda Alam, in 1978. Over his almost 25-year career with Musica he recorded a further eighteen albums, and in 1980 acted in a film, Seindah Rembulan. Chrisye died in his Jakarta home on 30 March 2007 after a long battle with lung cancer. Known for his stiff stage persona and smooth vocals, Chrisye was critically acclaimed in Indonesia. Five albums to which he contributed were included in Rolling Stone Indonesia's list of the 150 Best Indonesian Albums of All Time; another four of his songs (and a fifth to which he contributed) were classified as some of the best Indonesian songs of all time in a later issue of the same magazine.

Which village had a smaller food supply?  A team of archaeologists studied two human settlements, village Alpha from about 11000 years ago and village Beta, which existed 9000 years ago. Village Beta was bigger, because their inhabitants already knew about and practiced agriculture.  Hint: Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals.

You may be tempted to hold off on delivering the bad news because you don't want to be blamed for the bad news, even when it's not your fault. However, delaying will often make the problem worse. For one, if your boss finds out that you didn't tell them, they're going to be even more unhappy. Also, if your boss has the bad news, they'll be able to prepare for the consequences instead of being blindsided by them, which means the company's reaction as a whole can be more positive.  Any problems with significant consequences should be reported as quickly as possible. Assess the potential impact of a problem to determine when to report it. Any issue that may result in danger or law suits, such as major violations of company policy, should be reported immediately. The sooner you get the information to your boss, the sooner they can take it to their boss, if they're not the head of the company. If the bad news is not urgent, keep your eyes open to see when your boss seems less busy. When you notice their workflow slowing down a bit, go in and ask if you can talk to them. That way, you give them a chance to push it off to another time if they don't have the time right now. However, an important issue, such as sexual harassment, should be reported immediately, regardless of how busy your boss is.  For less pressing news, you could pick a time when you know the person will be in a good mood, as then the bad news won't come as such a blow.  For instance, you could say, \\"I have something I'd like to discuss with you. Is now a good time?\\" Also mention about how long you think it will take. You definitely don't want to catch your boss as they're trying to get out the door or running downstairs for lunch. You could also send an email asking about a good time if that's more your boss's style. Trying to soften the blow with rhetoric is not going to help. Just get to the point. Your boss is busy, and most busy people prefer directness, as it takes less time and they don't have to guess at what you mean. Therefore, have a concise statement to open the conversation with.  For example, you could use a statement like, \\"I have some problems with the new line.\\" Phrasing the statement that way reflects ownership and the acceptance of responsibility. If you blame others, you may be viewed as a whistle-blower or company rat. On the other hand, if you know your boss likes small talk, it can help soften the blow to chat a bit first. Your tone sets the mood. If you treat the problem as something that can be fixed and you remain positive, your boss will likely see it that way, too. However, if you're all doom and gloom and come in with a depressed posture, your boss is going to pick up on that, too. Make sure you stand up straight, look your boss in the eye, and speak in a clear tone of voice. That shows you have the confidence to solve the problem. Summary:","output":"1. Avoid delaying the delivery of bad news to your boss as this could potentially exacerbate the problem or upset your boss more for not being informed earlier.  2. Speed of reporting should be done according to the significance and potential impact of the problem. High-risk issues, potentially leading to danger or lawsuits, should be reported promptly.  3. For non-urgent matters, look for a time when the boss is less busy and potentially in a good mood to deliver the news in a less shocking way.  4. Use a clear and direct approach in delivering the news, but remain respectful and considerate of how the boss likes to be approached.  5. Use concise, ownership-reflecting language, such as \\"I have some problems with the new line.\\" This presents you as responsible and willing to own your part in the problem.  6. Tone and body language are crucial. Show confidence, maintain eye contact, and approach the problem as something manageable to encourage a positive perspective on the issue."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"While these two questions may seem similar at a glance, they do have distinct intents and nuances. The first question specifically asks for advice on promoting a YouTube channel that features unique or diverse content, indicating that the person inquires about strategies specifically tailored to channels that don't easily fit into a particular category or genre. In contrast, the second question is a more general inquiry about promoting a YouTube channel, without any reference to the channel's content. However, to provide a comprehensive response, I will address and provide promotion strategies for both scenarios. 1. Promoting a YouTube channel with unique or diverse content: a) Identify your target audience: Understand who may be interested in your content. This could include multiple demographics and interest groups, recognizing that your diverse content might appeal to varying populations. b) Develop a content strategy: To maintain a level of consistency, form a plan on how frequently you will publish content and organize playlists by subject, genre, or format. This strategy will make it easier for viewers to follow your output and stay engaged. c) Engage on social media: Locate your target audience on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or Reddit. Share your content in relevant groups, pages, or communities that fit the categories of your video content. Engaging in conversations and genuinely participating in these groups will help foster credibility and recognition. d) Collaboration: Collaborate with other content creators, especially those who have a similar target audience or complementary content. This will expose your channel to new viewers with shared interests. e) Optimization: Ensure your videos have proper titles, descriptions, and tags that align with your video content. Use specific keywords related to your video's subject matter, which makes it easier for users to find your content through search engine results. 2. General strategies for promoting a YouTube channel: a) Quality content: Compelling, well-produced, and engaging content will naturally attract viewers and escalate the likelihood of them sharing your videos. b) Consistency: Posting content regularly will help you maintain visibility, giving subscribers a reason to return. c) Thumbnail and title: Enticing and accurate thumbnails and titles can increase the click-through rate (CTR) of your videos. d) Channel branding: Ensure your channel's branding is visually appealing and professionally designed, signaling credibility and trustworthiness. e) Engage with your audience: Respond to comments, encourage discussions, and show appreciation for feedback. Building a loyal audience strengthens the probability of them promoting your content for you. f) Utilize end screens and annotations: These features encourage viewers to watch more content, subscribe to your channel, or visit your website. g) Share on social media: Actively share and promote your content on different social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram, to maximize reach. h) Run advertising campaigns: Use Google Ads or other online advertising platforms to promote your content in an efficient and cost-effective manner. In conclusion, while the two questions you asked share some similarities, they also differ in their specificity concerning the content. The first question involves tailoring promotional strategies for unique content, while the second question focuses on a broader promotion strategy. By combining the strategies mentioned above, you can effectively promote your YouTube channel, regardless of the content's nature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

There were 144 prosecutions in London. One electrician, who admitted rigging meters, told the BBC poverty was the main reason people sought his services. Police said the regional variation in prosecutions reflected enforcement effort rather than actual thefts. The figures, released to BBC Essex by the Crown Prosecution Service under freedom of information laws, also showed Merseyside had seen the largest three-year increase in prosecution numbers. In 2012-13 there were 112 cases in Merseyside, followed by 202 the following year and up to 267 in 2014-15. Liverpool Citizens Advice Bureau did not respond to the BBC's questions about whether it had seen a rise in cases of people concerned about utility bills. But a spokeswoman for Merseyside Police said the high levels of cases reflected its close working with electricity companies and \\"pro-active policing\\". She said the force had done a \\"lot of work\\" targeting cannabis farms, which had been found to be stealing electricity as well as growing the class B drug. During a raid five weeks ago in north Liverpool, officers found 200 cannabis plants and the electricity illegally bypassed. Insp Sarah Jones said the mix of electricity tampering and extensive watering systems were a dangerous combination and accounted for a growing number of fires in the area. \\"The people who set up these farms often tamper with electricity meters to steal electricity,\\" she said. \\"And there will generally be a number of hot lamps which can overload electricity sockets, which can be running alongside extensive watering systems.\\" The north west region had 619 court cases in total - more than the North East, Yorkshire and Humber, East Midlands, West Midlands and the East of England combined. Areas with the smallest number of prosecutions were North Yorkshire and Northamptonshire (four), Dorset (three) and Wiltshire (one). One electrician, who spoke to BBC Essex on condition of anonymity, admitted tampering with about 20 meters and said he knew of other electricians and gas engineers who did the same. Asked who he had rigged meters for, the electrician said: \\"They're all from different backgrounds. Mainly it's just people with no money. \\"It has been single parents, people with with kids that are, I mean, in sort of poor quality housing that haemorrhage heat, a couple of old people - just all different people. Just people with no money. \\"In my book they have as much right to be warm in the winter as anyone else. I wouldn't do it for someone doing it just out of greed.\\" It is understood some electricians charge as little as Â£50 to illegally rig a meter. Alan Wells, of the National Inspection Council for Electrical Installation Contracting, said risks included electric shocks and fires. He said he was disappointed to learn some qualified electricians were carrying out illegal work. Roger Critchell, director of operations for Crimestoppers, said: \\"This is not the victimless crime that some may perceive it to be. \\"And not only is it highly dangerous, it also has very real links to serious and organised crime.\\"","output":"According to figures released to BBC Essex by the Crown Prosecution Service under freedom of information laws, electric meter rigging in the UK has reached its highest level, putting thousands at risk from fires. Prosecutions for electricity and gas meter tampering have risen by more than 130% in the past five years, from 529 cases in 2010-11 to 1,582 in 2014-15. Merseyside had the largest increase in prosecution numbers, with 267 cases in 2014-15 compared to 112 cases in 2012-13. The main reason cited for the increase in meter rigging is poverty, with one electrician stating that it is primarily people with no money who seek his services for meter tampering. However, it is important to note that regional variation in prosecutions is likely a reflection of enforcement efforts rather than actual thefts. Police have been targeting cannabis farms in Merseyside, which often steal electricity in addition to growing illegal drugs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

B). cakes because she didn't have a cookie sheet..","output":"Dharma wanted to bake some cookies and cakes for the bake sale. She ended up only baking the cakes because she didn't have a cookie sheet. This meant she could not evenly distribute the dough, which is crucial for the cookies to maintain their shape and bake evenly. Realizing she'd still like to contribute to the bake sale, she decided to focus all her efforts on making the best cakes she could. Determined to make the bake sale a success, Dharma began her quest for the perfect cake recipes. She scoured the internet, cookbooks, and even called her grandmother for her delicious recipes passed down from generations. Gathering the must-bake cakes list, she made sure to include a variety of flavors and textures, catering to the diverse group of people expected to attend the bake sale. Starting with a moist chocolate cake, she melted premium dark chocolate and combined it with rich cocoa powder, warm melted butter, sweet brown sugar, and a hint of vanilla extract. By balancing the bitterness of the dark chocolate and the sweetness of the sugar, she created a symphony of flavor in every rich slice. With a velvety chocolate ganache to top it off, the chocolate lovers would be more than satisfied. Next up was the classic vanilla bean cake. She used her grandmother’s recipe that called for a heavenly blend of pure vanilla bean and extract, creamy unsalted butter, granulated sugar, fresh whole eggs, whole milk, and cake flour. She combined these ingredients, mixing until light and airy, then baked the cake to perfection. The cake, stacked high with silky vanilla buttercream between each layer, provided a delicious, timeless treat. To cater to those who enjoyed a tang of fruity flavor, Dharma whipped up a zesty lemon cake. Fresh lemon zest and juice were the stars of the recipe, paired with sugar, flour, eggs, and unsalted butter. A tart lemon glaze elevated the cake to another level, wowing the taste buds of bake sale attendees. Realizing that there may be people who follow plant-based diets, Dharma decided to incorporate a vegan-friendly option in her cake selection – a delightful vegan carrot cake. She replaced eggs with a blend of ground flaxseed and water, and used coconut oil instead of butter. The blend of finely grated carrots, crushed pineapple, and toasted pecans resulted in a moist and delectable cake that could rival any traditional carrot cake. She adorned the cake with a dairy-free and nutmeg-spiced cream cheese frosting to further impress the crowd. Lastly, she baked a gluten-free almond flour cake for those with gluten sensitivities. The recipe included almond flour, finely grated orange zest, eggs, honey, and a touch of cinnamon. The cake had a tender crumb and moist texture, and was drizzled with an orange-honey glaze that infused flavor deep into the cake. With her cakes assembled in all their splendor, Dharma brought them to the bake sale where they were received with admiration and enthusiasm. She apologized for her lack of cookies, and her fellow bakers assured her that her exquisite cakes more than made up for her missing cookie offering. Baking lesson learned: even though she didn't have a cookie sheet, Dharma's determination and creativity enabled her to make a difference at the bake sale with an impressive lineup of cakes. Her friends and family couldn't have been more proud of her hard work, and the bake sale was a huge success, with the cakes having sold out within hours."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

An increase in predators, the emergence of a new disease, or the loss of habitat are just three possible problems that will decrease a population.  What happens to the size of a population if the number of predators for that population is increased gets bigger or gets smaller? The answer to this question is:","output":"When the number of predators for a given population increases, the size of the prey population typically decreases. The logic for this occurrence can be broken down into several steps: 1. Increase in predators: When predator numbers rise, there are more animals or organisms hunting the same quantity of prey. This step increases the prey's mortality rate because more of them are being consumed by predators. 2. Decrease in prey population size: With an increased mortality rate, the prey population will start to decline because individuals are being removed from the population faster than they can reproduce. This decrease can eventually lead to an imbalance in the ecosystem. On the other hand, if the number of predators decrease: 1. Decrease in predators: When predator numbers drop, there are fewer animals or organisms hunting the same quantity of prey. This step reduces the prey's mortality rate because fewer of them are being consumed by predators. 2. Increase in prey population size: With a decreased mortality rate, the prey population will start to increase because individuals can reproduce at a higher rate than they are being preyed upon. This increase could lead to an overpopulation of the prey species, which comes with its own set of ecological complications. It should be noted that while this is a general trend, actual results can vary depending on specific situations and factors. Some prey populations may have other environmental challenges, like disease or habitat loss, which could also contribute to population size changes. Additionally, predator-prey dynamics can often follow a cyclical pattern, where increase and decreases in each group's population size regularly occur.

I can use this background: Species go extinct constantly as environments change, as organisms compete for environmental niches, and as genetic mutation leads to the rise of new species from older ones. Occasionally biodiversity on Earth takes a hit in the form of a mass extinction in which the extinction rate is much higher than usual. A large extinction-event often represents an accumulation of smaller extinction- events that take place in a relatively brief period of time.The first known mass extinction in earth's history was the Great Oxygenation Event 2.4 billion years ago. That event led to the loss of most of the planet's obligate anaerobes. Researchers have identified five major extinction events in earth's history since:  Now, I have a new situation: John was studying the history of dinosaurs. He found that dinosaurs were flourishing before 66 million years ago. He labeled it as era A. Then he found that there was a mass extinction around 66 million years ago. He labeled that time period as era B. John found it interesting that many species have evolved in the course of history.  Answer this question please: Which era would more likely be shorter, era A or era B?","output":"Era B would more likely be shorter than Era A.  Era A represents the time before the mass extinction event when dinosaurs were flourishing. This time span corresponds to the Mesozoic Era which lasted around 180 million years, from approximately 252 to 66 million years ago. The Mesozoic Era is divided into three major periods: Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous. It was during these periods that dinosaurs thrived and dominated the planet. Era B, on the other hand, refers to the mass extinction event that occurred around 66 million years ago. This event, known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) Extinction Event, marks the end of the Cretaceous Period and the beginning of the Paleogene Period. This event was relatively brief compared to the entire Mesozoic Era, as mass extinctions typically unfold over a short geological time scale, ranging from thousands to a few million years. Given that Era A (the Mesozoic Era) spans around 180 million years while Era B (the K-Pg Extinction Event) likely took place over a much shorter time frame, we can conclude that Era B would more likely be shorter than Era A."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pick from: (A). prepare to talk (B). dance with the girl (C). move out of the state Answer:","output":"Austin should definitely opt for (A). Prepare to talk before interacting with the girl he likes at the party. It is essential for him to make a good impression and build a solid foundation if he wants to develop a deeper connection with her. Here's a detailed explanation of how Austin can prepare to talk to the girl he likes: 1. Boost self-confidence: Austin should make sure he feels confident before approaching and engaging in conversation with the girl. Confidence can be projected through body language, eye contact, and clear speech. He might want to take a moment to remind himself of his unique qualities and strengths. 2. Find common interests: If Austin knows anything about her, he should try to recall some common interests or shared experiences they might have. This will provide him with excellent conversation starters and help him connect with the girl on a more personal level. 3. Observe the situation: Before approaching the girl, Austin should take some time to observe her body language and the environment around her. This will help him determine an appropriate moment to make his move and engage in conversation with her. For example, if she appears to be enjoying her time alone, Austin might want to wait for a more opportune moment to approach her. 4. Think of conversation starters: Austin should come up with a few interesting conversation starters or questions to ask the girl. This will help break the ice and make the conversation flow more smoothly. Some good conversation starter ideas include discussing the party itself, music preferences, or asking her about her favorite activities. 5. Practice active listening: Austin should practice active listening while talking to the girl. This means he should give her his full attention, nod and maintain eye contact, and avoid interrupting her while she is speaking. Additionally, Austin should display genuine curiosity and ask her questions to get to know her better. 6. Be genuine: Austin should be genuine in his interactions with the girl. He should avoid using pick-up lines or putting on an act to impress her. Instead, he should be respectful and authentic to create a strong foundation for a potential future relationship. 7. Respect boundaries: Austin must respect the girl's personal boundaries and be mindful not to make her feel uncomfortable or pressured. If she appears disinterested or uneasy at any point during their conversation, Austin should gracefully back off and give her some space. By following these steps, Austin can adequately prepare to talk to the girl he likes at the party.

Link is often given the task of rescuing Princess Zelda and the kingdom of Hyrule from Ganon, who is the principal antagonist of the series; however, other settings and antagonists have appeared in several titles. The games' plots commonly involve a relic known as the Triforce, a set of three omnipotent golden triangles. The protagonist in each game is usually not the same incarnation of Link, but a few exceptions exist.  - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.  - An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. All computer programs, excluding firmware, require an operating system to function.  - A Platform game (or platformer) is a video game which involves guiding an avatar to jump between suspended platforms and/or over obstacles to advance the game. The player controls the jumps to avoid letting the avatar fall from platforms or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button, but now there are other alternative like swiping in touchscreen. \\"Jumping\\", in this genre, may include swinging from extendable arms, as in \\"Ristar\\" or \\"Bionic Commando\\", or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in \\"Alpha Waves\\". These mechanics, even in the context of other genres, are commonly called \\"platforming\\", a verbification of \\"platform\\". Games where jumping is automated completely, such as 3D games in \\"The Legend of Zelda\\" series, fall outside of the genre.  - DOS , short for \\"disk operating system\\", is an acronym used to describe the family of several very similar command-line computer operating systems for x86-based computers: primarily MS-DOS and PC DOS, but also DR-DOS, FreeDOS, ROM-DOS, and PTS-DOS. None of these systems were officially named \\"DOS\\", and indeed \\"DOS\\" is a general term for disk operating system.  - Ristar, released as in Japan, is a platform game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis, which released worldwide in February 1995.

In the game, the player takes control of Captain Comic, who is on a mission to the planet Tambi, where the quest begins. Comic must find three artifacts, namely the Mystical Gems of Lascorbanos, the Thousand Coins of Tenure, the Crown of the Ages. To find them, he must travel through many varied environments. The game ends when Comic is in possession of the three treasures.  - The graphical user interface (GUI ), is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation. GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of command-line interfaces (CLIs), which require commands to be typed on a computer keyboard.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images.

Options：  A. books  B. zoo  C. body of water  D. wooded area  E. animals","output":"C. Body of Water A beaver builds structures, commonly known as dams, to block bodies of water such as rivers and streams. These industrious animals are skilled engineers that have the unique ability to alter their environment to suit their specific needs. Beavers build dams for a variety of reasons, with the primary objective being the creation of a safe and protected habitat. By blocking the flow of water, beavers are able to create large ponds and wetlands in which they can construct their lodges and safely store food. These habitats offer protection from predators and provide a stable environment in which beavers can reproduce and thrive. Additionally, constructing dams allows beavers to regulate the water level around their lodge. This is particularly important during the winter months, as maintaining a consistent water level helps to prevent the entrance to their lodge from becoming blocked by ice. Beaver dams are also known for harboring a diverse ecosystem and supporting an abundance of plant and animal life. By constructing these complex structures, beavers play a vital role in maintaining the health of both their immediate and surrounding ecosystems. In some cases, beaver dams can even help to mitigate the effects of flooding and erosion, allowing other species to benefit from their presence in the area. In conclusion, the most suitable answer to the question of what beavers build structures to block is bodies of water. These industrious animals create dams to manipulate the flow of water in order to form safe and stable habitats for themselves and support a wide array of plant and animal life in the process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"To determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, we must first understand the meaning of entailment. Entailment is a relation between two sentences where if the first sentence is true, the second sentence must also be true. In other words, if we accept the truth of the first sentence, we cannot deny the truth of the second sentence without contradiction. Let's consider the given sentences: Sentence 1: \\"New York oh gosh yeah yeah\\" Sentence 2: \\"I love New York but that was really weird.\\" The first sentence may be expressing an excited exclamation about New York, but it doesn't convey any explicit sentiment or opinion. The exact meaning of the sentence is quite ambiguous because it includes non-specific phrases like \\"oh gosh\\" and \\"yeah yeah.\\" Therefore, it is difficult to deduce a clear meaning or establish a truth from this statement. The second sentence does convey a clear sentiment—love for New York—while also acknowledging that there was something weird or odd about their experience. Although there may be some overlap in emotion regarding New York in both sentences, they do not establish a direct implication between their meanings. To answer the question, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. We cannot conclude that if the first sentence is true, the second sentence must be true as they do not share a clear, direct connection in meaning or sentiment. The ambiguity of the first sentence further complicates the possibility of entailment between these two sentences."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Article: Maybe you have recently discovered that your husband looks at porn. Or perhaps this has been an ongoing issue in your relationship. Either way, its time to have an honest conversation about your feelings.  Prepare to have an open conversation about the problem. Your first step is to figure out your feelings. Ask yourself why you object to his watching porn. Is it a religious issue for you? Or is it against your moral code? Choose some words that describe how you are feeling. Be descriptive with words such as \\"frustrated\\", \\"worried\\" or \\"nervous\\". Make a list of the things you want to say. This will help you to stay on track during the conversation and make sure that you make your points clear. Talking to your husband about his porn habit is an important conversation. You want to make sure that you allow yourselves time to deal with this tough topic. Take care to choose an appropriate time to have this talk.  Try to avoid having this conversation late at night or early in the morning. You two will not be at your emotional best if you are tired. Give him a heads up. Try saying, \\"I have something important to talk to you about. When is a good time for you?\\" Don't rush the conversation. Choose a time when you know neither or you will be rushing out the door to work or being interrupted by the kids. You might have a serious aversion to porn. Those are your feelings, and that is okay. However, try not to base your talk with your husband purely on judgement.  Try to use \\"I\\" statements. For example, you can say, \\"I feel very uncomfortable when you watch porn in our home.\\" These types of statements are more effective than \\"you\\" statements. Your husband will likely be defensive if you say something such as \\"When you watch porn, you make me mad.\\" Avoid eraser words. For example, try not to say, \\"I love you, but your porn habit is disgusting.\\" Eraser words like \\"but\\" negate everything that was said before \\"but\\". It is important that you let your husband know how you are feeling. However, don't forget that effective conversations allow both of the participants to talk. Make some effort to understand your husband's point of view.  Ask open-ended questions. For example, you could say, \\"Why is it important to you to watch porn?\\" Make it a point to ask for further information. Try saying, \\"So porn makes you feel excited. Is there another way you could achieve that same feeling?\\" Ask for new information. Consider saying, \\"How do you see us resolving this issue?\\" Asking questions is an important part of having a constructive conversation. It is equally critical that you actually listen to the answers. Make it clear to your husband that you are listening carefully to his point of view.  Use non-verbal cues. You can indicate that you are listening by maintaining eye contact and making gestures such as nodding your head in understanding. Try paraphrasing. You can say something like, \\"I hear you saying that this is a long-time habit. Is that right?\\" Show respect. Allow your husband to finish his thoughts and sentences without interrupting. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article offers advice on how to have an open, honest, and constructive conversation with your husband about his porn habit.

County Cork, Ireland, 1920. Dr. Damien O'Donovan is about to leave his native village to practise medicine in a London hospital. Meanwhile, his brother Teddy commands the local flying column of the Irish Republican Army. After a hurling match, Damien witnesses the summary execution of his friend, Micheál Ó Súilleabháin, by British Black and Tans. Although shaken, Damien rebuffs his friends' entreaties to stay in Ireland and join the IRA, saying that the war is unwinnable. As he is leaving town, Damien witnesses the British Army vainly trying to intimidate a railway personnel for refusing to permit the troops to board. In response, Damien decides to stay and is sworn into Teddy's IRA brigade. After drilling in the mountains, the column raids the village's Royal Irish Constabulary barracks to acquire revolvers, then uses them to assassinate four Auxiliaries. In the aftermath, Anglo-Irish landowner Sir John Hamilton coerces one of his servants, IRA member Chris Reilly, into passing information to the British Army's Intelligence Corps. As a result, the entire brigade is arrested. In their cell, Damien meets the train driver, Dan, a union official who shares Damien's socialist views. Meanwhile, British officers interrogate Teddy, pulling out his fingernails when he refuses to give them the names of IRA members. Johnny Gogan, a British soldier of Irish descent, helps the prisoners escape, but three are left behind. After the actions of Sir John and Chris are revealed to the IRA's intelligence network, both are taken hostage. As Teddy is still recovering, Damien is temporarily placed in command.

Led by head coach Jud Heathcote, the Spartans defeated the Indiana State Sycamores in the championship game held on March 26, 1979, at the Special Events Center in Salt Lake City, Utah. The final score of the game was 75-64 in favor of Michigan State. This championship game is particularly notable for the showdown between two future Hall of Famers and NBA legends, Earvin \\"Magic\\" Johnson of Michigan State and Larry Bird of Indiana State. Both players displayed exceptional skills during the tournament and would later go on to have historic professional careers in the NBA that would define a generation of basketball. Magic Johnson, a 6'9\\" point guard, was instrumental in leading the Spartans to their championship victory, earning the title of Most Outstanding Player of the 1979 NCAA Final Four. During the title game, he scored 24 points, grabbed 7 rebounds, and provided 5 assists. His matchup against Larry Bird drew significant attention from fans and the media, as they showcased their remarkable talent and competitiveness on the national stage. Larry Bird, a 6'9\\" forward, had an incredible season with Indiana State, leading the team to a perfect 33-0 record before facing Michigan State in the championship game. Despite scoring 19 points and securing 13 rebounds in the final game, Bird and the Sycamores were unable to overcome the Spartans. The 1979 NCAA Men's Basketball Championship marked the first-ever national title for Michigan State. The Magic Johnson vs. Larry Bird matchup left a lasting impact on the sport, sparking a dramatic increase in popularity for college and professional basketball.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Desegregation in Birmingham took place slowly after the demonstrations. King and the SCLC were criticized by some for ending the campaign with promises that were too vague and \\"settling for a lot less than even moderate demands\\". In fact, Sydney Smyer, president of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, re-interpreted the terms of the agreement. Shuttlesworth and King had announced that desegregation would take place 90 days from May 15.  Smyer then said that a single black clerk hired 90 days from when the new city government took office would be sufficient. By July, most of the city's segregation ordinances had been overturned.  Some of the lunch counters in department stores complied with the new rules. City parks and golf courses were opened again to black and white citizens.  Mayor Boutwell appointed a biracial committee to discuss further changes.  However, no hiring of black clerks, police officers, and firefighters had yet been completed and the Birmingham Bar Association rejected membership by black attorneys.The reputation of Martin Luther King Jr. soared after the protests in Birmingham, and he was lauded by many as a hero. The SCLC was much in demand to effect change in many Southern cities. In the summer of 1963, King led the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom where he delivered his most famous speech, \\"I Have a Dream\\". King became Time's Man of the Year for 1963 and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. Four months after the Birmingham campaign settlement, someone bombed the house of NAACP attorney Arthur Shores, injuring his wife in the attack.

Given the following context:  Grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy electric guitar sound with a \\"thick\\" middle register and rolled-off treble tone and a high level of distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet. Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers  and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\".  In the song Mudride, the band's guitars were said to have \\"growled malevolently\\" through its \\"Cro-magnon slog\\".  answer the following question:  What two brands of amplifiers do grunge guitarists use?

His mother is worried that if the boy continues to sleep like that, he will suffocate. This is because\\"","output":"A young boy is reprimanded by his mother for sleeping with his heavy blankets over his head. His mother is worried that if the boy continues to sleep like that, he will suffocate. This is because breathing properly while sleeping is crucial for the healthy functioning of the body, and covering the head with heavy blankets can disrupt the natural flow of air and potentially lead to suffocation. Covering the head with heavy blankets can impair the breathing process in the following ways: 1. Reduced flow of oxygen: When the head is covered by heavy blankets, there is a limited supply of fresh air available to breathe in. This means that the inhaled air has a lower concentration of oxygen and a higher concentration of carbon dioxide than the air present in an uncovered space. Oxygen is essential for the proper functioning of the human body, and a lack of it can lead to various health issues, including suffocation in severe cases. 2. Increase in carbon dioxide concentration: As mentioned earlier, the air beneath heavy blankets has a higher concentration of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a waste gas that is produced during cellular respiration and needs to be expelled from the body. When sleeping in an enclosed space with limited fresh air, such as under heavy blankets, carbon dioxide can accumulate and lead to a situation called hypercapnia, where there's an excessive amount of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream. This can result in respiratory problems and suffocation. 3. Restricted lung movement: Sleeping with heavy blankets on the head can physically restrict the lung's ability to expand and contract, which is crucial for proper breathing. This can lead to inadequate gas exchange in the lungs, resulting in insufficient oxygen intake and poor expulsion of carbon dioxide, eventually causing suffocation. 4. Sleep quality: The trapped air under heavy blankets can become hot and humid, making it uncomfortable and challenging to maintain a suitable body temperature. This can lead to disturbed sleep patterns and sleep disorders such as insomnia or sleep apnea. A lack of proper sleep can have negative effects on cognitive function, mood, and overall well-being. 5. Risk of re-breathing: When a person sleeps with their head covered, they are more likely to re-breathe the air they exhaled. This air contains a higher percentage of carbon dioxide and a lower percentage of oxygen than fresh air. Repeatedly breathing in this kind of air can contribute to oxygen deprivation and an accumulation of carbon dioxide, increasing the risk of suffocation. In conclusion, the mother's concerns are valid, as sleeping with heavy blankets over the head can disrupt the normal breathing process and potentially lead to suffocation. It is essential to maintain a proper flow of fresh air during sleep to ensure an adequate supply of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide. This can be achieved by avoiding covering the head with heavy blankets and keeping the face uncovered to facilitate proper airflow, promoting good health and well-being while sleeping."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article based on this \\"One of the over-arching constitutional principles of the UK - set down in the 1688 Bill of Rights is this: \\"That the Freedome of Speech and Debates or Proceedings in Parlyament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any Court or Place out of Parlyament.\\"\\"","output":"Title: The Cornerstone of Democracy: Freedom of Speech and Debates in the UK Parliament Introduction The protection of free speech within the proceedings of the Parliament has been a fundamental principle of the British constitution since the late 17th century. The basis for this principle was enshrined in the Bill of Rights 1688, which states: \\"That the Freedome of Speech and Debates or Proceedings in Parlyament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any Court or Place out of Parlyament.\\" This ground-breaking statute transformed the political landscape of the United Kingdom and helped to establish the modern democratic system. In this article, we will delve into the historical context and significance of this constitutional principle and examine its impact on the workings of the Parliament and the broader society over the centuries. Historical Context The Bill of Rights 1688 was a significant turning point in the United Kingdom's journey toward a more just and fair parliamentary system. In the preceding years, the nation struggled with political turmoil, as power struggles between the monarchy and the Parliament were exacerbated by the religious and ideological divides within the country. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 resulted in the removal of the Catholic King James II and the ascension of the Protestant monarchs William III and Mary II. The Bill of Rights aimed to address these issues and establish a more balanced distribution of power between the monarchy, the Parliament, and the judiciary. Among its various provisions, the Act strengthened the autonomy and independence of the Parliament by ensuring the full protection of the freedom of speech and debates within its walls. Significance of the Principle The protection of freedom of speech and debates in Parliament was and is essential for securing an open and democratic political system. By guaranteeing this freedom, the Bill of Rights provided a safe space for MPs and members of the House of Lords to express their opinions, criticize the government, and debate and scrutinize proposed legislation without the fear of legal reprisals or censorship. Essentially, the freedom of speech within Parliament directly contributes to fostering healthy and robust discourse, which is a crucial component of a representative democracy. As a result, it enables the MPs to effectively represent the diverse views and concerns of their constituents and hold the government accountable for their actions. Moreover, this constitutional principle has broader societal implications as it also bolsters democratic values outside of the Parliament. The freedom afforded to representatives encourages a culture of open discussion, political engagement, and critical thinking among citizens, while ensuring a transparent government that is subject to public scrutiny. Impact and Evolution Over the centuries, the freedom of speech and debates within the Parliament has been fiercely defended and upheld. This protection enabled many significant and transformative debates and legislation, ranging from the abolition of the slave trade to the establishment of the National Health Service. Furthermore, the principle has evolved and adapted to maintain its relevance in tandem with the changes in society, technology, and the political landscape. For instance, the Parliament now increasingly relies on electronic communication methods like video conferencing, email, and social media to engage with the public and maintain communication with their constituencies. Consequently, the concept of parliamentary privilege has been continuously reinterpreted to accommodate such advancements while still preserving the original intent of the Bill of Rights. Nonetheless, challenges to the freedom of speech and debates in Parliament persist to this day. The United Kingdom faces an array of contemporary issues, including the rise of \\"fake news,\\" the spread of misinformation, and the growing polarization in politics, all of which have led to renewed scrutiny of the principle's significance, scope, and limitations. Despite these challenges, the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech and debates within the Parliament will continue to play a prominent role in upholding the democratic values of the United Kingdom as it navigates these turbulent waters. Conclusion The protection of the freedom of speech and debates in the UK Parliament, as enshrined in the Bill of Rights 1688, is truly a cornerstone of democracy and a testament to the nation's commitment to political representation and fairness. Through the centuries, this principle has consistently provided the foundation for the robust functioning of the parliamentary system and has been instrumental in fostering democratic values within the wider society. Whether facing historical challenges or contemporary uncertainties, the importance and impact of this constitutional principle remain undeniably powerful and consequential in the quest for ensuring a more just and equitable world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer a question about the following article about Circadian rhythm: The simplest known circadian clock is that of the prokaryotic cyanobacteria. Recent research has demonstrated that the circadian clock of Synechococcus elongatus can be reconstituted in vitro with just the three proteins (KaiA, KaiB, KaiC) of their central oscillator. This clock has been shown to sustain a 22-hour rhythm over several days upon the addition of ATP. Previous explanations of the prokaryotic circadian timekeeper were dependent upon a DNA transcription/translation feedback mechanism.[citation needed] What type of feedback mechanism was previously thought to be needed to sustain the clock?","output":"The feedback mechanism that was previously thought to be needed to sustain the circadian clock in prokaryotes, specifically in cyanobacteria like Synechococcus elongatus, was a DNA transcription/translation feedback mechanism. To understand this, we need to delve into the deeper aspects of Molecular Biology. DNA transcription is the process by which an RNA molecule is synthesized from a DNA template, resulting in the formation of a specific protein encoded by the gene in the DNA. Translation, on the other hand, is when the RNA molecule directs the synthesis of a polypeptide via the genetic information it carries. The original thought regarding the circadian clock was that it worked in a similar way to that of eukaryotes, where gene regulation plays a significant role. In eukaryotes, the circadian rhythm works through negative feedback loops of gene transcription and translation. Certain proteins inhibit the transcription of their own genes, making a self-sustaining cycle which aligns roughly with the 24-hour day/night cycle. Researchers believed that a similar feedback process was involved in prokaryotic cyanobacteria as well, with the circadian rhythm being controlled through a feedback loop where the transcription and translation of specific genes, and the subsequent formation and functioning of certain proteins, played a key role in timing biological activities.  However, recent research has shown that the prokaryotic circadian clock in Synechococcus elongatus can be reconstituted in vitro with just three proteins - KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC - in the presence of ATP, indicating a more protein-based oscillation mechanism. This discovery has led to a new understanding of how circadian rhythms function in prokaryotic organisms, and that a DNA transcription/translation feedback is not necessarily required, challenging the prior assumptions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer.

Disputes with leaders of Lutesville persuaded the railroad to move their route through Marble Hill instead .","output":"The two sentences, while similar in structure, convey different meanings in terms of the locations and the outcome of the disputes. Let's analyze each sentence: Sentence 1: \\"Disputes with leaders of Marble Hill persuaded the railroad to move their route through Lutesville instead.\\" In this sentence, disagreements that occurred with the leaders of Marble Hill led the railroad company to change its decision regarding the route for the railroad. As a result of these disputes, the railroad decided to pass through Lutesville, which implies that the initial plan may have included the route passing through Marble Hill. Due to the unresolvable differences with Marble Hill leaders, the company opted for Lutesville as the alternative route. Sentence 2: \\"Disputes with leaders of Lutesville persuaded the railroad to move their route through Marble Hill instead.\\" This sentence indicates that the initial plan for the railroad route may have been to pass through Lutesville. However, disagreements with the Lutesville leaders caused the railroad company to reconsider their initial choice. Consequently, the railroad revised its plan and instead chose Marble Hill as the route for the railroad. In conclusion, both sentences describe a situation where disputes with leaders of a town led the railroad company to change its initial route. However, the town leaders involved and the outcomes are different:  - In Sentence 1, the disputes are with Marble Hill leaders, and therefore the railroad chooses to pass through Lutesville.  - In Sentence 2, the disputes are with Lutesville leaders, so the railroad decides to pass through Marble Hill instead."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Market participants are on edge about whether Federal Reserve officials meeting Tuesday and Wednesday will start reducing, or tapering, their 85 billion in monthly bond purchases, a program known as quantitative easing or QE. The employment and growth outlooks have improved recently, but annual inflation continues to undershoot the Fed’s 2% target, registering just 0.7% in October. What’s a Fed to do? We asked some top economists. Here’s what they said: Donald Kohn, former Fed vice chairman and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution: “I think I would wait, but it’s a close call,” he said Friday during an interview with The Wall Street Journal’s David Wessel at George Washington University. Mr. Kohn, a 40-year veteran of the Fed who retired in 2010, said he understands that top officials want to move away from the bond purchases, which are unconventional and carry risks, and toward verbal guidance on the future path of short-term interest rates. He said forward guidance is “an easier tool to use.” Joseph Gagnon, former Fed board economist and fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics: “It is absolutely too early. The Fed has jumped the gun so many times you think they would have learned their lesson. They need to see core inflation start to move up, though I note core CPI over past 6 months is 1.8% annual rate so not too bad,” he said, referring to the Labor Department’s consumer price index. “But I am optimistic about growth in 2014 and I think they should be able to complete the taper by next fall. The ability of the economy to grow this year despite massive fiscal cuts bodes well for 2014, especially given the budget deal just announced.” Dean Croushore, visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and professor at University of Richmond: “I think the Fed should taper because the benefits of quantitative easing have been small and there are large risks of higher future inflation and high future interest rates. Low inflation is beneficial to the economy, as long as it does not become a severe deflation, which seems unlikely. Probably the markets will decline at first, but will stabilize if it goes well. The Fed will probably struggle with convincing people that it can taper while at the same time promise to keep rates low, as that was the key debate at the last [Fed policy committee] meeting. They just have to clarify that those are two very different tools; not clear if people will believe them.” Edward Leamer, economics professor at UCLA’s Anderson School of Management: “I don’t see any evidence that the bond-buying program is actually helping the economy and we are thus trading uncertain stimulus for certain expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet. The point of tapering is to make a policy change slowly, but the more we wait the more likely it will become that slow isn’t fast enough, that is to say if we start seeing some inflation. Best to turn back the clock and start the tapering in September. December 2013 is the best month that’s left.” Dean Baker, economist and co-director, Center for Economic and Policy Research: “As far as a December taper, I would be very surprised. It seems to me it would send completely the wrong message. [Fed Vice Chairwoman Janet] Yellen would want to say that she is prepared to be accommodative long into the future. This would make her look very trigger happy. You have to ask: what would be the positive? Are we worried inflation is about to take off? They are good grounds for questioning the November jobs numbers…It’s hard to see why the Fed would feel the need to taper now.” Brian Gardner and Michael Michaud, KBW Research: “While we think odds of tapering have increased given the strong November jobs report, we think the Fed will wait to see more consistent job growth before it decides to commence tapering. Over the past several years, job growth has, in our view, been spotty and not sustained. Thus, we think the Fed will be cautious and opt for more consistent data before it comes to a decision on asset purchases. We think March is when tapering will begin and we think it will begin with modest reductions.” What was this article about?","output":"This article is about whether the Federal Reserve (the Fed) should start reducing its monthly bond purchases in December.

Write some highlights for the following article: The chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission got a firsthand look Tuesday at the Indian Point nuclear plant on a visit organized by two members of Congress from New York who want the plant shut down. Chairman Gregory Jaczko toured the plant with longtime Indian Point opponents Rep. Nita Lowey and Rep. Elliot Engel, who have been raising concerns about the safety of the plant following the earthquake and tsunami in Japan that seriously damaged the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. \\"As I have repeatedly stressed to (plant owner) Entergy and the NRC, I continue to have serious concerns about several specific issues related to Indian Point,\\" Lowey said at a press conference following the tour. Indian Point is on the Hudson River, 35 miles north of midtown Manhattan. Among the chief concerns raised by Lowey and Engel is the feasibility of evacuating such a populated area in the event of an emergency. Currently the NRC requires plants to have plans in place to evacuate a 10-mile radius around their facilities. But, pointing out that the NRC urged Americans within a 50-mile radius of the damaged Japanese reactors to leave, Lowey said that \\"evacuating 20 million people within a 50-mile radius of Indian Point would be a near-impossibility.\\" \\"The bottom line,\\" said Engel after the tour, \\"I still believe Indian Point should be closed.\\" Jaczko said the visit was a good opportunity to hear firsthand from the representatives about their concerns. \\"I think it's so important that we continue to have a very open and transparent dialogue,\\" he said. Asked whether the proximity of the plant to such a densely populated area was sufficient reason to close the plant, as many New York officials have argued, including Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Jaczko said he couldn't comment since Indian Point is undergoing a formal relicensing effort right now. There are two reactors at Indian Point. One is due to be relicensed in 2013 and the other in 2015. Jaczko said the agency closely monitors the operation of all nuclear facilities \\"to ensure that they meet our very stringent safety and security requirements.\\" Indian Point, he said, meets those requirements. Lowey and Engel have introduced a bill that would require the NRC to use the same standards it uses to license new nuclear plants when relicensing older plants, \\"including evaluating terror threats, seismic risk, population density and evacuation concerns,\\" Lowey said.

This 6,825 km waterway,whose watershed   covers three million square kilometers,flows through mountains,woodlands,lakes and deserts. Its potential for fishing,tourism and shipping is great-but so are its challenges. Water shortage,already serious in Egypt and Sudan,will soon influence several other countries in the watershed as well. Today,about 160 million people depend on the Nile River for their living. Within the next 25 years,the district's population is expected to double,adding to the demand brought about by growth in industry and agriculture. The frequent drought adds to the urgency. Water quality is also a problem. Precious soil is washed out to sea. Wastes from industry and agriculture create pollution. Higher concentrations of salt influence irrigated soils. Water-borne diseases remain unchecked. In areas where it's hot and damp, _ grow so fast that they choke off lakes,dams and other sections of the river,making it difficult for fishing and other businesses to move forward. Native people along the narrow area of farmland have watched the sand move closer day by day. They've seen the river change course,and their only source of water thickened with mud. They're very poor and have few choices. But a new program,the Nile Basin Initiative(NBI),is offering very practical assistance. The program is more than just a water-management project. It's a plan for the social and economic development of a vast district: it concentrates on the needs of the poorest of the poor and the environment that supports them. These are whole ecosystem problems,calling for united solutions  .Half the Nile Basin's countries are among the world's poorest nations; yet,somehow,they must find the resources,skills and political will to overcome these challenges.

Given the question: Question: \\"What does the judiciary branch depend on for budgeting?\\"  Context: \\"There are two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the state (through budget planning and various privileges), and the private. Budget of the judiciary in many transitional and developing countries is almost completely controlled by the executive. The latter undermines the separation of powers, as it creates a critical financial dependence of the judiciary. The proper national wealth distribution including the government spending on the judiciary is subject of the constitutional economics. Judicial corruption can be difficult to completely eradicate, even in developed countries.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"The judiciary branch depends primarily on the executive branch and the legislative branch for budgeting. In many transitional and developing countries, the budget of the judiciary is almost entirely controlled by the executive branch, which can allocate funds and resources to the judicial system through budget planning and various privileges. This control over the judiciary's budget creates a critical financial dependence on the executive, undermining the separation of powers as stipulated in a democratic system. In addition, the legislative branch also plays a role in determining the budget for the judiciary by passing laws and approving annual budgets. Through this process, the legislature can allocate funds to the judiciary, influencing its financial capacity and its ability to perform its functions effectively. The proper distribution of national wealth, including government spending on the judiciary, is a subject of constitutional economics, which deals with the design of government institutions and their effect on economic outcomes. In order to maintain a fair and impartial judiciary, it is essential to establish a budgetary system that ensures financial independence and autonomy for the judiciary, which can help reduce corruption and promote the rule of law. However, eradicating judicial corruption can be difficult, even in developed countries. This is due to various factors, such as a lack of checks and balances, complex legal systems, and ingrained cultural practices. To address this issue, it is essential to foster transparency, accountability, and integrity within the judiciary through legal and institutional reforms, which may include changes in the budgeting process to minimize external influence and ensure sufficient resources for the judiciary to function effectively and independently."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: Network Movie plot: Howard Beale, the longtime anchor of the Union Broadcasting System's UBS Evening News, learns from his friend and the news division president, Max Schumacher, that he has just two more weeks on the air because of declining ratings. The two get drunk and lament the state of their industry. The following night, Beale announces on live television that he will commit suicide on next Tuesday's broadcast. UBS fires him after this incident, but Schumacher intervenes so that Beale can have a dignified farewell. Beale promises he will apologize for his outburst, but once on the air, he launches back into a rant claiming that life is \\"bullshit\\". Beale's outburst causes the newscast's ratings to spike, and much to Schumacher's dismay, the upper echelons of UBS decide to exploit Beale's antics rather than pull him off the air. In one impassioned diatribe, Beale galvanizes the nation, persuading his viewers to shout out of their windows \\"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!\\" Diana Christensen heads the network's programming department; seeking just one hit show, she cuts a deal with a band of radical terrorists (a parody of the Symbionese Liberation Army called the \\"Ecumenical Liberation Army\\"[citation needed]) for a new docudrama series called The Mao Tse-Tung Hour for the upcoming fall season. When Beale's ratings seem to have topped out, Christensen approaches Schumacher and offers to help him \\"develop\\" the news show. He says no to the professional offer, but not to the personal one, and the two begin an affair. When Schumacher decides to end Beale as the \\"Angry Man\\" format, Christensen convinces her boss, Frank Hackett, to slot the evening news show under the entertainment division so she can develop it. Hackett agrees, bullying the UBS executives to consent and firing Schumacher.

These allowances account for the changes or additional requirements that may be necessary to complete the tasks at hand. Here are seven key factors that should be taken into consideration: 1. Personal needs allowance: This allowance is made to account for the time that workers require to tend to their personal needs, such as restroom breaks and drinking water. Generally, a personal needs allowance of approximately 5% of the total working time is considered appropriate. 2. Fatigue allowance: Fatigue allowance accounts for workers' need to rest and recover from physically or mentally demanding tasks. This allowance varies depending on the nature of the work, with tasks that are more physically demanding requiring a higher fatigue allowance. The fatigue allowance can range from 5% to 15% of the worker's total working time. 3. Machine downtime allowance: This allowance is made to account for when the machines or equipment used in the operations may require maintenance, repairs, or adjustments. The downtime allowance will depend on the reliability and maintenance records of the machinery being used. 4. Learning curve allowance: It is important to consider that workers may not be fully proficient in new tasks or operations right away. A learning curve allowance accounts for the additional time that workers may need to familiarize themselves with these tasks and reach optimal productivity levels. 5. Contingency allowance: Unforeseen events and disruptions can occur during any operation or task. A contingency allowance should be made to account for these unpredictable factors, such as emergencies, accidents, or equipment breakdowns. The specific contingency allowance will vary based on the riskiness and complexity of the task. 6. Quality allowance: Ensuring that high-quality work is completed can require an additional investment of time beyond the basic duration of tasks. A quality allowance should be made to accommodate any extra time that may need to be spent on inspections, rework, or adjustments to meet quality standards. 7. Special circumstances allowance: There may be specific situations or challenges that arise throughout the task that require additional time to be allocated. These special circumstances can include working in extreme temperatures, dealing with physical constraints or limitations, or managing particularly complex or valuable materials. In conclusion, when determining the allowances to be made over and above the basic time for operations, it is crucial to consider factors such as personal needs, fatigue, machine downtime, learning curves, contingency requirements, quality assurance, and any special circumstances that may arise. By accurately accounting for these various allowances, a more realistic and practical assessment of the time required for completing operations can be achieved, ultimately leading to improved productivity and operational efficiency."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Dąbrowa Chełmińska [dɔmˈbrɔva xɛu̯ˈmiɲska] (German: Dombrowken to 1866 Damerau 1866–1942 Kulmischdamerau 1942–1945) is a village in Bydgoszcz County Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship in north-central Poland.

Options: - crash - accelerate - turn around - catch on fire - carry freight","output":"The option in line with common sense to answer the question \\"What does an airplane do before takeoff?\\" is to \\"accelerate.\\" Before an airplane takes off, it goes through a series of procedures and checks to ensure a safe and smooth flight. Acceleration is an essential part of the takeoff process because it enables the airplane to gain enough speed to become airborne. Here's a detailed explanation of the steps that lead up to the takeoff: 1. Preflight checks: Before the airplane even moves on the runway, the crew performs several preflight inspections. They involve checking the aircraft's exterior and interior, confirming the functioning of various systems and instruments, and reviewing the flight plan. 2. Boarding: Passengers are boarded, and their luggage is loaded into the airplane. The crew checks that all passengers are seated and fastened with their seat belts. The doors are then closed and properly secured. 3. Pushback: The airplane is pushed back from the gate, usually by a tow vehicle called a tug. This helps free up the gate for other aircraft and positions the airplane in the right direction to proceed on the taxiway. 4. Taxiing: The airplane taxis to the assigned runway, following the guidance of the ground crew and air traffic control. The pilots steer the airplane using taxiways and perform engine run-up tests to check the engines' performance and operation. 5. Final inspections: Before accelerating for takeoff, the pilot performs a final check of the flight controls, ensuring that all necessary systems are operational, and communicates with air traffic control to obtain clearance for takeoff. 6. Acceleration: Once clearance is received, the pilot aligns the airplane with the runway and begins accelerating. They gradually increase the engine thrust, which makes the airplane move faster down the runway. The pilot must carefully monitor the speed, ensuring that the airplane reaches the minimum takeoff speed (also known as \\"rotate\\" speed) for a safe liftoff. 7. Rotation and liftoff: Once the minimum takeoff speed is reached, the pilot gently pulls back on the control yoke or sidestick, causing the nose of the airplane to pitch upward. The airplane lifts off the ground and begins its climb, officially entering the takeoff phase of the flight. To summarize, the correct answer to the question \\"What does an airplane do before takeoff?\\" is \\"accelerate.\\" This is the step where the airplane gains enough speed on the runway to become airborne and proceed with the flight. The other options, such as \\"crash,\\" \\"turn around,\\" \\"catch on fire,\\" and \\"carry freight,\\" don't apply in the context of the question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this article and answer this question During the continuous skirmishing of the 1260s, both sides employed Muslim soldiers, mostly Turcopoles, against their Christian foes. In 1266, the Genoese had made an alliance with Baibars, who was to outfit some troops for an expedition against Acre, but the Genoese' promised fleet never got underway. In 1267, Genoa managed to capture the Tower of Flies and blockade the harbour of Acre for twelve days before being evicted by a Venetian flotilla. The ongoing warfare between Genoa and Venice had a major negative impact on the Kingdom's ability to withstand external threats to its existence. Save for the religious buildings, most of the fortified and defended edifices in Acre had been destroyed at one point or other  and according to Rothelin, the continuator of William of Tyre's History, 20,000 men in total had lost their lives, a frightful number considering the Crusader states were chronically short on soldiery. The War of Saint Sabas was settled in 1270 with a pact to cease the hostilities between the Venetians and the Genoese. In 1288, Genoa finally received their quarter in Acre back. How many years after the War of Saint Sabas was settled did Genoa finally get Acre back?","output":"The War of Saint Sabas was settled in 1270, and Genoa finally got their quarter in Acre back in 1288. To know how many years passed between those two dates, we need to subtract the smaller number (1270) from the bigger number (1288).  So, 1288 - 1270 equals 18. Genoa got Acre back 18 years after the War of Saint Sabas was settled."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer this question: who wrote the song purple rain for prince?","output":"\\"Purple Rain\\" is a song written, composed, and performed by the legendary musician Prince, born Prince Rogers Nelson. Released in 1984, the song is the title track of both the album 'Purple Rain' and the film of the same name, which starred Prince himself. The inspiration for \\"Purple Rain\\" reportedly came from various sources, combining Prince's signature fusion style of rock, pop, gospel, and R&B. At that time, he was seeking to create a robust sound that resonated with audiences past and present. Prince and The Revolution, his backing band, first debuted the song at a live performance in August 1983 at the First Avenue nightclub in Minneapolis. The recorded version on the album came from this live performance, with the band recording additional tracks in the studio later. It was then edited and mastered for smoother production quality. The song turned out to be one of Prince's most iconic hits, catapulting him to international stardom. \\"Purple Rain\\" boasts powerful lyrics and an emotional guitar solo, resonating deeply with listeners even after many years. It represents both a signature ballad for Prince and a symbol of an entire genre of 1980s pop culture. The album 'Purple Rain' achieved massive success, spending a record-breaking 24 consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard 200 chart. Furthermore, the movie, in which Prince made his acting debut, garnered more than 80 million at the box office.  \\"Purple Rain\\" won two Grammy Awards - Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Best Album of Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or Television Special. Additionally, the song took home an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score. Throughout his successful career, Prince stood out not only as a visionary songwriter but also as a dynamic live performer, multi-instrumentalist, and innovative producer. His untimely death in April 2016 left his fans mourning the loss of a true musical genius. Nevertheless, \\"Purple Rain\\" continues to reign as one of the most iconic creations of Prince's prolific career and stands tall in the pantheon of pop-culture history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ward, a paranoid schizophrenic, told doctors at high-security Ashworth Hospital that voices in his head 'wanted him to kill everyone' He then struck his two victims with a knife in front of rush hour commuters. Man, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility via video-link at Birmingham Crown Court, jailed for life.","output":"Title: The Tragic Tale of Mental Illness, Crime, and Loss in Birmingham: The Case of John Ward  23-year-old John Ward changed the lives of many on an ordinary day in Birmingham City Centre back in January. The city witnessed a horrific event that shall remain etched in the minds of its residents for a long time. On that fateful day, Wayne Busst, aged 32, and Ian Watson-Gladwish, aged 31, fell victims to a horrendous attack perpetrated by John Ward, which ultimately led to their untimely demise. Available CCTV footage starkly displays the chilling sequence of events leading up to the double manslaughter. In the tapes, Ward can be observed making purchases of a knife and alcohol, engaging animatedly in a conversation with the soon-to-be victims on the street, just hours before launching his frenzied, deadly assault.  John Ward, who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, had reportedly disclosed to his doctors at Ashworth Hospital, a high-security medical facility, that he kept hearing disturbing voices in his head encouraging him to commit acts of fatal violence. The voices were relentless, he revealed, in pushing his fragile mind to 'kill everyone.' The terrifying power of these hallucinations grew to an extent that his control over his own actions began to slip away. The fatal incident unfolded smack in the middle of rush hour. Despite the bustle and urgency around them, nothing could deter the horrific episode from taking place. In front of stunned commuters, Ward launched a brutal assault on Busst and Watson-Gladwish, brandishing the knife that he had purchased only a couple of hours earlier. The city centre, typically abuzz with the noise of traffic, work, and life, caught its breath in shock and horror as the gruesome drama played out on the streets. The aftermath brought Ward before the Birmingham Crown Court, the haunting memories of his paranoid schizophrenia testifying alongside him. At the trial, Ward communicated his plea via video link. He admitted his guilt but pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. This unusual plea posits that although he had confessed to the crime, he argued that his mental disorder had significantly impaired his abilities to control or understand his actions. Recognizing Ward's mental health status and his plea's legal validity, the court sentenced him to life imprisonment. Though Ward must bear the punishment for his actions, the trial also exposed some severe complexities entwinded with mental illness and criminal responsibility.  Despite the tragic loss of life, society is prodded to ponder on pressing questions about mental health care. How many individuals like Ward are struggling unnoticed and unaided? When does the line between victim and villain begin to blur?  John Ward’s case underscores the critical importance of robust mental health care infrastructure, early diagnosis, and timely intervention. Indeed, this incident, although deeply tragic, spotlights the dire need for addressing mental health issues publicly and proactively to prevent such horrifying incidents in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"The tournament teams include champions from 31 Division I conferences (which receive automatic bids ), and 37 teams which are awarded at-large berths .\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","output":"No, the provided statement regarding the 31 Division I conferences and at-large berths is not a reasonable answer to the question about the location of the first March Madness game. Instead, I will provide a detailed and long answer to the original question. The first March Madness game was played as part of the inaugural NCAA Basketball Tournament in 1939. The term \\"March Madness\\" was eventually coined to describe the excitement and frenzy surrounding the annual NCAA competition but was not widely used back in 1939 when the first game took place. The tournament was the creation of the National Association of Basketball Coaches, which felt the need for a national championship for college basketball. Ohio State University coach Harold Olsen played a significant role in organizing the first championship, and Dr. James Naismith, the inventor of basketball, presented the trophy to the winner. The first game of the inaugural NCAA Basketball Tournament took place on March 17, 1939, between the Brown Bears from Brown University and the Villanova Wildcats from Villanova University. It was held at the Old Alumni Hall, located on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Old Alumni Hall was built in 1865 and initially served as a gymnasium for the University of Pennsylvania. It was later converted into a multi-purpose facility. The hall hosted various events, including sports, graduation ceremonies, and social gatherings. It also housed the University's athletic department offices. The inclusion of the tournament teams from the 31 Division I conferences (which receive automatic bids) and the 37 teams awarded at-large berths is a separate aspect of the NCAA Tournament and does not directly answer the question of where the first March Madness game was played. This statement relates to the current structure of the tournament and how teams are selected to participate. The NCAA Tournament has undergone numerous changes since the first game in 1939, and the selection of teams has evolved over time to accommodate the growth of college basketball. In summary, the first March Madness game took place on March 17, 1939, between Brown University and Villanova University at Old Alumni Hall on the University of Pennsylvania's campus in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

In a telephone call Monday between Russia's Defense Minister General Sergei Shoigu and the U.S. Secretary of Defence Chuck Hagel, Shoigu described the activity of U.S. and NATO troops near Russia's border as \\"unprecedented.\\"  According to the official Russian version of the call, his American counterpart assured him the alliance did not have \\"provocative or expansionist\\" intentions -- and that Russia should know this.  But it hardly seems to matter how often NATO makes these assurances. The Kremlin will never trust them. Fear of the Western military alliance's steady march east is deep-rooted. It strikes at the very heart of Russia's national sense of security, a relic of Cold War enmity which has seeped down to post-Soviet generations.  Ilya Saraev is a 15-year-old pupil at the First Moscow cadet school in Moscow. He thinks long and hard when I ask him about NATO. \\"I think NATO might be a friend to Russia but there's one point I don't understand: Why it needs to approach the border with Russia more and more,\\" he says.

This investigation will not only focus on potential origins of these hazardous pollutants but also review previous findings from the years 2006 to 2008. HCB and PCB are persistent organic pollutants known for their toxicity and long-lasting impact on ecosystems. Their potential to bioaccumulate and biomagnify in food chains poses considerable risks to both human and environmental health. Therefore, international regulations, such as the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, have banned or restricted their production, use, and release into the environment. Despite these efforts, unintentional emissions of HCB and PCB into the atmosphere continue to occur, mainly from various small-scale industrial and commercial operations. It is essential to identify any overlooked sources of emissions to enhance our understanding of the problem and develop targeted strategies to mitigate their negative effects. The following steps can be taken to address this: 1. Thorough literature review: Conduct an extensive analysis of available scientific studies, reports, and other relevant data to identify any potential overlooked emission sources. This review should focus on both known sources, such as municipal waste combustion, and potential new sources that have not been previously accounted for. 2. Collection of samples: Perform sampling and analysis of environmental media, such as soil, water, and air, in areas where potential overlooked sources are suspected. This will help in the accurate identification and quantification of HCB and PCB emissions in those regions. 3. Field investigations: Conduct field inspections and monitoring of sites suspected to be contributing to unintentional emissions, with a focus on small-scale industrial processes, poorly regulated waste disposal, and recycling activities. 4. Collaboration with industry stakeholders: Engage relevant industries, governmental agencies, and research institutions to share information on potential emission sources and discuss solutions to reduce unintentional emissions. 5. Public awareness campaigns: Organize campaigns to educate the general public and stakeholders on the hazards of HCB and PCB emissions, the importance of complying with existing regulations, and ways to further reduce their release into the environment. 6. Review of previous results: Investigate the 2006-2008 period in detail to determine if there have been any significant changes in emission sources, patterns, or levels. If necessary, update and revise assessments and strategies accordingly. 7. Regular assessments and reporting: Undertake periodic assessments and reporting of the progress made in identifying and mitigating overlooked sources of HCB and PCB emissions. This will help to monitor overall progress, identify gaps in knowledge, and prioritize future research and intervention needs. By pursuing these avenues, we can enhance our knowledge of the sources contributing to unintentional HCB and PCB emissions and take appropriate measures to further minimize their impact on the environment and human health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Jorge Molina and a double from Ruben Castrol were enough for Betis with  Getafe substitute Francisco Casquero scoring his side's only goal as they lost 4-3 on aggregate. \\"They were much better than us. We have been humbled,\\"  Getafe coach Michel Gonzalez told AFP. Almeria scored four first-half goals in a 4-3 win at Mallorca to advance win 8-6 on aggregate while Villarreal made it to the last eight after after beating Valencia 4-2 following their goalless draw in the first leg. League leaders Barcelona secured their place in the quarterfinals on Wednesday with French international defender Eric Abidal scoring in the 1-1 second leg draw at Athletic Bilboa. Barcelona, held 0-0 at home in the first leg, went through on away goals. Defending Spanish Cup champions Sevilla and Deportivo La Coruna also went through to leave a strong quarterfinal lineup.

I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States.

On which Scottish Island would you find the Callanish Standing Stones?","output":"The Callanish Standing Stones, also known as Calanais Standing Stones, are located on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland.  The Isle of Lewis is the northern part of Lewis and Harris, the largest island of the Western Isles or Outer Hebrides archipelago in Scotland. It's known for its stunning landscapes - ranging from sandy beaches to rocky and mountainous terrain, its Gaelic culture, and rich history. Given its geographical location, it experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The Callanish Standing Stones are one of the most significant and famous prehistoric sites in Scotland. The site consists of a stone circle of thirteen stones with a monolith near its center, and a small chambered tomb to its east. Arising from the ground, these stones form a dramatic and ancient landscape feature. Their purpose remains a mystery, although theories propose a range of religious, astronomical, and social purposes over centuries.  Radiocarbon dating indicates that the stones were erected around 5,000 years ago, during the late Neolithic period, and were an important place for ritual activity for at least 2,000 years. During the Bronze Age, the site was overlaid with a burial cairn, and new stones were added around the existing stone circle and avenues. This extraordinary site evokes a striking picture of ancient life, culture, and perhaps spiritual beliefs. The stones themselves are composed of a metamorphic rock, known as Lewisian gneiss, one of the oldest rocks in Britain, even older than the rocks of the surrounding landscape. The Callanish Stones are managed by Historic Environment Scotland and they are open to public visits throughout the year. Providing 360-degree views of the surrounding landscape and water, the location of the Callanish Stones is awe-inspiring, and the sense of ancient human endeavor and spirituality that the site imparts make it a must-visit location on the Isle of Lewis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer?","output":"The brand name registered by the Wolverine Shoe and Tanning Company in 1961 is Hush Puppies. Hush Puppies is an iconic American footwear brand known for its casual and comfortable shoes. Wolverine World Wide, originally named Wolverine Shoe and Tanning Company, was founded in 1883 by G.A. Krause in Rockford, Michigan. In 1961, the company introduced the Hush Puppies brand as a new line within their offerings, breaking away from traditional, heavy-duty work boots. The Hush Puppies brand introduced a new type of shoe, which featured lightweight and comfortable materials such as pigskin suede leather and crepe soles. The name Hush Puppies was inspired by a southern United States dish known as \\"hush puppies\\". The dish consists of deep-fried cornmeal dough balls, which were typically served as a side at fish fry events. According to the brand's history, a Wolverine World Wide salesman discovered that hush puppies were often fed to noisy dogs to keep them quiet. This anecdote inspired the brand's name, as the footwear aimed to silence the discomfort and sore feet caused by wearing traditional, rigid shoes. Hush Puppies quickly gained popularity in the United States and soon expanded internationally as well. By the mid-1960s, the brand had become a global phenomenon and a symbol of casual and comfortable shoes for men, women, and children. The brand's iconic Basset Hound logo and its tagline \\"We invented casual\\" highlight the laid-back, easygoing nature of Hush Puppies and its dedication to providing comfort and style. Today, Hush Puppies is one of the most well-known and respected footwear brands worldwide. The brand's product line has evolved from its original silhouette to include a vast range of casual and dress shoes, boots, sandals, and sneakers, all staying true to the brand's commitment to comfort, style, and innovation."},{"instruction":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

On the right side, we have \\"237*k\\" and \\"-963*k\\". 1. Combine the \\"k\\" terms on the left side: -67*k + 872*k    872 - 67 = 805, so the left side is 805*k 2. Combine the \\"k\\" terms on the right side: 237*k - 963*k    237 - 963 = -726, so the right side is -726*k Now our equation is: 805*k + 47461 = -726*k 3. Now, let's put all the \\"k\\" terms on one side of the \\"=\\" sign by adding 726*k to both sides: 805*k + 726*k + 47461 = -726*k + 726*k This gives us: 1531*k + 47461 = 0 4. Let's find the value of \\"k\\" by moving 47461 to the other side of the \\"=\\" sign. 1531*k = -47461 5. Finally, we can find \\"k\\" by dividing by 1531 on both sides: k = -47461 / 1531 6.

They use past data and current conditions to predict how the population will grow or shrink and recommend how many hunting licenses the state should issue during hunting season to keep the population stable.  But I can use this background: In nature, when the population size is small, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual. When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease.

By Hugo Gye PUBLISHED: 02:12 EST, 28 August 2013 | UPDATED: 02:12 EST, 28 August 2013 British tourists risk falling foul of the law while on holiday if they are ignorant of local customs, the Foreign Office warned today. More than a quarter of UK citizens seeking consular assistance abroad are looking for help after they have been arrested. And the 'crimes' for which they have been detained are often as seemingly innocuous as wearing camouflaged clothing or eating near a church. Attraction: But visitors to Florence could be fined if they eat near churches or public buildings Stylish: But camouflage-style clothing like this is strictly illegal in","output":"Barbados and could land tourists in trouble As the summer holiday season reaches its peak, the Foreign Office has released a list of unusual laws and customs which are all too easily broken by unwitting Brits. The bizarre rules include a ban on chewing gum on public transport in Singapore, a crackdown on flip-flops in Capri, Italy, and penalties for feeding pigeons in Venice. In Florence, Italy, tourists can be fined if they are caught eating near churches or public buildings, while camouflage-style clothing is strictly illegal in Barbados, potentially landing holidaymakers in hot water with authorities. The story continues with Tom and Jane, a British couple heading to Florence for a much-needed romantic getaway. Ignorant of the local customs and strange laws, the couple finds themselves in a series of comical yet frustrating situations.  Upon their arrival in Florence, Tom and Jane decide to embrace the Italian culture and purchase a small picnic to enjoy near the church. Unaware of the local ordinance prohibiting eating near churches, the couple lays out their spread on a park bench, only to be approached by a stern-looking police officer. They are handed a hefty fine and given a stern warning about the importance of respecting local customs. The next day, the couple decides to explore the beautiful island of Capri. Eager to take in the breathtaking sights and famous monastery, Tom and Jane set out wearing flip-flops. As they walk up the monastery steps, a local Capri guide informs them that flip-flops are forbidden in the quaint island town. The couple, now agitated, must return to their hotel and change into more appropriate footwear. The week progresses with a series of mishaps, from Tom accidentally feeding a pigeon in Venice to Jane spilling a small amount of chewing gum on a train in Singapore. Each time, the couple must face the consequences of their actions and pay the respective fines or penalties. In the end, Tom and Jane return to the UK with a newfound appreciation for understanding local customs, laws, and etiquette before traveling. They realize that, while the strange rules may not make sense to them, they are nevertheless responsible for obeying them when visiting a foreign country. The story ends with the couple sharing their experiences and lessons learned with friends and family, encouraging them to be more aware of local customs while traveling. Meanwhile, the Foreign Office continues to educate British tourists about the importance of familiarizing themselves with the local customs and rules of countries they plan to visit, in hopes of preventing similar incidents from happening in the future. In conclusion, this story serves as a cautionary tale for tourists to always research and understand local customs and laws before traveling to a foreign country. By doing so, they can avoid unintentionally offending locals or breaking the law, ensuring a more enjoyable and trouble-free vacation experience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products.  Berg city used only gas powered vehicles while Hill city used electrical vehicles. The two cities had a similar population and vehicle numbers.  Which city had more problems with carbon monoxide? The answer is:","output":"Berg city had more problems with carbon monoxide.  Step 1: Identify the source of carbon monoxide in the context of the question The question states that carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons, which occurs in gasoline-powered vehicles.

Background: The general trend in electronegativity is that the value increases from left to right across a row in the periodic table and decreases down a column. The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \\"Trends in the Periodic Table,\\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull. Electronegativity decreases down a column due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms.  Paragraph: Mike has to learn more about the periodic table for his chemistry exam. To make things easier for him he chose two elements from the table, element A and element B. Element A has higher electronegativity and element B has lower eletronegativity.

So said the cheeky chameleon of an actor when he received an honorary Oscar in 2010 and remarked that the pontiff -- he didn't say which one -- wrote him a fan letter extolling his performance as the bandito Calvera in \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" (1960). This struck Wallach as odd. \\"I've played more bandits, thieves, killers, warlords, molesters and Mafiosi than you can shake a stick at,\\" he said. No doubt he got a pass from the Pope because as the bad guy, the famed character actor, who died Tuesday at 98, had a smile as lethal as his aim. The most beloved of his screen roles were as Calvera in \\"Magnificent Seven\\" and Tuco, the opportunistic robber, who was sometimes an ally but more often the adversary of Clint Eastwood in the 1966 Sergio Leone spaghetti Western \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.\\" But surely Wallach, a prolific actor who made more than 50 films and almost as many television appearances, possessed the universal blood type. His screen niche was the American ethnic. In addition to Hispanics, his characters included Arabs, Greeks, Italians and Poles. He appeared in films large and small, from \\"The Misfits\\" (1961), where he played a mechanic besotted by Marilyn Monroe, to \\"Baby Doll,\\" his 1956 screen debut as Silva Vacarro, the wily cotton planter who aims to deflower his rival's virgin bride, Carroll Baker. Sometimes he was the lead, more often the supporting player. But when Wallach was on screen, you forgot that Eastwood, Clark Gable or Ben Stiller was next to him. Occasionally the sinewy Wallach-- born to a Jewish family in 1915 in what then was the predominantly Italian-American neighborhood of Red Hook, Brooklyn -- played a Jew. Like the rabbi who helps convert Gentile Jenna Elfman so she can marry Stiller in \\"Keeping the Faith\\" (2000). And the aging screenwriter who befriends Kate Winslet in \\"The Holiday\\" (2006). Though he made more than 50 films, Wallach treated movies as a way to finance his work in theater: \\"I don't live to act, I act to live,\\" he said. Indeed, he was set to make his film debut as Maggio, the character Frank Sinatra ultimately played in \\"From Here to Eternity,\\" in 1953 (Sinatra won an Oscar). Instead, he chose to appear on stage in \\"Camino Real.\\" He was a founding member of The Actors Studio and appeared in 30 Broadway plays. Among his triumphs were Tennessee Williams' \\"The Rose Tattoo\\" (1951) and \\"Camino Real\\" (1953); the latter earned him a Tony Award. Among his personal triumphs: Wallach and his wife, actress Anne Jackson, with whom he often appeared on stage from the 1960s through 1990s, were married 66 years.

A captivating storyteller who first gained attention as a student at the Actors Studio for his monologues about his time as an Army medic in World War II clearing soldiers out of brothels, Wallach was beloved by directors and co-stars as much for his humor as his professionalism.

Write some highlights for the following article: A German cruise liner said Tuesday it plans to fly its passengers over the Gulf of Aden, instead of sailing them through, out of fear of pirate attacks in the region. U.S. Navy image of pirates operating off coast of Somalia in October this year. Hapag-Lloyd Cruises said all 246 passengers and most of the crew aboard the MS Columbus, currently at the start of an around-the-world cruise, will disembark at an undisclosed port, then fly to Dubai to continue their journey. The company called the move a precautionary measure. Pirate attacks in the waters off Somalia have shot up this year, with pirates staging increasingly bolder attacks on ever-bigger targets. So far this year, pirates have attacked almost 100 vessels off Somalia's coast and successfully hijacked nearly 40, according to the International Maritime Bureau. Freight and cargo ships, cruise liners, and private yachts have all come under attack. In many hijackings, pirates take the crew and passengers hostage while they demand a ransom. The problem has forced companies like Hapag-Lloyd, that use the Gulf of Aden, to make new plans, including stepping up security or changing their routes. One shipping company announced last month it would bypass the region altogether, sailing instead around the Cape of Good Hope and adding thousands of kilometers to its voyages. Read more about how to solve the pirate problem here. Hapag-Lloyd said a general travel warning for the area, issued by the German Foreign Ministry, played a part in the decision. But the company also said it had asked the German government for naval protection and the request was turned down. Representatives of Hapag-Lloyd and the German Defense Ministry could not immediately be reached for further comment. The passengers on board the Columbus began the first leg of their world cruise November 28 in Genoa, Italy and are due in Dubai on December 17, according to Hapag-Lloyd's Web site. Further stops include Singapore, Bali, Indonesia and Sydney, Australia. Hapag-Lloyd said that after the passengers and most of the crew disembark, the Columbus will sail through the Gulf of Aden with a skeleton staff. The passengers will stay in a five-star hotel in Dubai for three days until the Columbus arrives to take them back onboard, the company said. Both the crew and passengers approve of the safety measure, Hapag-Lloyd said. The U.S. State Department and British Foreign Office advise those traveling near the Somali coast to use extreme caution because of the recent pirate attacks. Last week, the Australian government issued a similar warning about travel to the region. The advice also urged Australian ships \\"to apply a robust and layered protective security regime\\" when traveling through the area. -- CNN's Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.

The chill of the January afternoon pierced her through, but it was fear, more than the cold, that made her limbs shake. Having just crossed over to the Left Bank, she glanced back over her shoulder and saw the towers and spires of the royal palace across the Seine. She felt as if hidden eyes there were watching her. Could anyone on the palace wall have seen her walk over the Petit-Pont? Not Amalric. He was still in the south, the King having just appointed him seneschal for Beziers and the surrounding country. But he had so many agents in Paris and allies at court. Except for Agnes, all the servants in the Gobignon town house were loyal to him. His aunt, Queen Blanche, was forever praising him to all who would listen. If Nicolette were involved in scandal, the White Queen would be furious, and would see to it that word reached Amalric. And if indeed he found out about her meeting the troubadour? Just a message, a song, let alone a meeting like this one, could mean death for her and Orlando. I should turn around right now, cross this bridge, and run back to the palace. The streets of the Latin Quarter were crawling with ruffians and criminals - it was insane for her to be walking here alone after sunset. The sight of the small knife she carried under her cloak might deter an attacker, but then she would be discovered. If I screamed for help, the whole palace would find out. Blanche would demand to know why I was here. No, she thought, her blood turning to ice, she would know why. But those eyes of his? to look into them again, was that not worth any risk? She stood, vacillating, in the shadows by a wooden house that overhung the Rue Saint-Jacques. I must see Orlando, she thought. Over a year now, and I have not been able to forget him.

Preservation of mucosal immunity has been shown to affect the risk and outcome of pneumonia in severely injured patients. Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) is the principle humoral defense of mucosal surfaces in the body and has several antiinflammatory properties. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) function to kill invading microorganisms, but their exaggerated inflammatory responses may cause tissue injury to the host. The purpose of this study was to compare the ability of different immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes to modulate PMN cytotoxic potential cocultured with respiratory epithelial cells challenged with bacteria.', 'Calu-3 cell monolayers were established on membranes (0.1-microm pore) in a two-chamber culture system. Escherichia coli (EC) incubated with either polyclonal SIgA or IgG was inoculated into the apical chamber and PMNs (10/mL) added to the basal chamber. PMN cytotoxic potential was indexed by % CD11b expression, superoxide anion (O2) production, and elastase release. Dextran flux was used to index Calu-3 monolayer permeability.', 'Addition of EC to PMN-Calu-3 cell coculture increased % CD11b expression, O2 production, and elastase release. IgG had no effect on PMN activation after EC challenge. SIgA abrogated PMN activation and the increase in Calu-3 cell monolayer permeability noted with EC or EC + IgG treatment groups.

Whether it's the taxi driver who tricks a visitor and takes them the long way round, or the shop assistant who doesn't give the correct change, or the police officer who accepts a bribe   - everybody's at it. Cheats in the nest include the scientist whose research was based on fake data, the game show competitors who worked with a friend in the audience or win a million pounds, and the doctor who made up his qualifications and wasn't really a doctor at all. Everybody cheats; nobody's playing the game. Is cheating acceptable, a natural way of surviving and being successful? Or is it something that should _ , and young people discouraged from doing? If it's the latter how can we explain to children why so many bend the rules? Take sport for example. The Word Cup was filled with cheating. Whether diving, pretending to be hurt or denying a handball, footballers will do anything for a free - kick or a penalty shot. France striker Henry denied cheating to win the free - kick which led to his side's second goal in their 3 - 1 victory over Spain. Many footballers, however, are often putting it on. Whatever the nationality there's one common ploy: the player rolls over holding their leg, ankle or head seeming to be in great pain. As a result a yellow card and / or free - kick is given for the foul and then, a few seconds later, the player is up and about as if nothing had happened ! The ref   may be taken in by it but youngsters watching the game aren't. they also see their heroes getting away with it. Of course it's not just football.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Usher was born in Dallas, Texas, the son of Jonetta Patton (nee O'Neal), from Tennessee, and Usher Raymond III. Usher spent the majority of his young life in Chattanooga: his father left the family when Usher was a year old. Usher grew up with his mother, then-stepfather, and half-brother, James Lackey (born 1984). Directed by his mother, Usher joined the local church youth choir in Chattanooga, when he was nine years old. Usher developed a friendship with American record producer, Jermaine Dupri, with whom he co-wrote and produced several tracks for his second album, My Way, released on September 16, 1997. The album's lead single, \\"You Make Me Wanna...\\", reached number one in the United Kingdom, becoming Usher's first record to be top single; the record led to his popularity reaching in the country. It also became Usher's first gold- and platinum-certified single in the United States. The album's second single, \\"Nice & Slow\\", peaked in January 1998 at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Usher his first US number-one single. In February of the same year, the single was certified platinum by the RIAA. My Way has been certified six-time platinum in the United States.  \\"You Make Me Wanna...\\" won the Best Male R&B/Soul Single at the 1999 Soul Train Music Awards. In the closing months of 1997, Usher embarked on a series of tour engagements including a spot on Puffy's No Way Out tour, dates with Mary J. Blige, and the opening spot on Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope Tour. Usher's first concert album, Live, was released in 1999, which featured appearances by Lil' Kim, Jagged Edge, Trey Lorenz, Shanice, Twista and Manuel Seal; the album has been certified gold in the United States.  Usher made his acting debut on the UPN television series Moesha, which resulted in a recurring role on the series and subsequently his first film role in 1998's The Faculty. Usher's extracurricular activities outside of the recording industry gathered momentum over the following year as he was cast in the soap opera, The Bold and the Beautiful. He completed two more films, She's All That, and his first starring role in Light It Up. He also appeared in the Disney TV movie Geppetto.  Usher's third studio album, originally titled All About U, was slated to be released in early 2001. The first single, \\"Pop Ya Collar\\", was released in late 2000 and became a number two hit in the UK but underperformed in the United States. The album was subsequently pushed back and retooled after select tracks were later leaked to the radio and Internet. After having revised and renamed to 8701, the album was released August 7, 2001 (8.7.01). The first two singles \\"U Remind Me\\" and \\"U Got It Bad\\" each topped the Billboard Hot 100 for four and six weeks, respectively. 8701 has been certified four-time platinum in the United States.  Usher appeared in the 2001 film Texas Rangers. In February 2002, Usher won a Grammy for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for \\"U Remind Me\\". The next year, he won the same award for \\"U Don't Have to Call\\", making Usher the only artist aside from Luther Vandross and Stevie Wonder to win this award consecutively. In summer 2002, Usher contributed vocals to P. Diddy's \\"I Need a Girl, Part I\\".

Jane wants to keep the money, but Alan wants to take it to the police. Alan places the suitcase and cash in a locker at Union Station, hoping he can sway Jane into surrendering it to the police. A few days later while Alan is at work, Danny (Duryea) shows up at the Palmers' apartment, tells Jane he is a detective and quickly learns she has begun spending the money. Her husband Alan likewise becomes upset when he finds she has been running up bills, clearly planning to spend the money they had agreed to store and leave untouched. Jane makes a deal with Danny to split the money. Planning to kill him, she drives Danny up into the hills on the pretense they will retrieve the cash where it's been buried. He suspects her intentions and flees. She and Alan plan a romantic evening together to make amends for their squabbling about the money. She asks Danny to meet her in the evening at Westlake Park near downtown Los Angeles, where she and Alan will be taking a boat ride. Jane has planned to kill her husband Alan in the boat but is stopped by a pang of guilt and begs him to take her to shore, then blurts out that she wants to send the claim check for the locker to the police. Unaware of why his wife is upset, Alan wants to continue with the boat ride. Hoping to find cigarettes, he picks up her bag and his own gun falls out. The startled look on his face tells Jane he knows straight off what she had in mind, she grabs the gun, they struggle and she shoots, killing him. When Danny sees the body he fears getting involved in a murder, but Jane threatens to tell the police he killed her husband unless he helps her. As she planned... The answer is:","output":"In the movie \\"Too Late for Tears,\\" Danny shows up at the Palmers' apartment.

'I suppose it's possible,' she said contemplatively. 'After all, we're so used to seeing unicorns in fantasy and folklore that maybe our brains just... filled in the gaps, you know?' She furrowed her brow, considering the idea. Step by step, she tried to piece together the puzzle of the unicorn sightings. Step 1 - Evaluate why the unicorn sightings happened First, she thought about why so many people claimed to have seen a unicorn when it was more likely they had seen the white hind. Perhaps the mythological allure of unicorns was so deeply ingrained in their minds that it was the simplest explanation for a sudden, rare sighting in the forest. Step 2 - Analyze the shared experience She then considered the shared experience; the fact that everyone described similar details and feelings during the sighting. Was it possible that there was some kind of external factor influencing their perceptions, or was it evidence of a collective unconsciousness? Step 3 - Look for any physical evidence of the unicorn or white hind Determined to get to the bottom of the mystery, Harry and she decided to investigate the forest where the sightings had occurred. They carefully combed the area, looking for any indication of either a unicorn or a white hind, finding only faint hoof prints in the soft soil – a clue, but not a irrefutable one. Step 4 - Conduct interviews with the witnesses To gather more information, they interviewed those who had reported the unicorn sightings. Some witnesses seemed adamant that they'd seen a unicorn, while others admitted they couldn't be sure. However, there was a tone of excitement and enchantment in their voices, revealing a deep desire to believe in the mystical creature. Step 5 - Weigh the possible explanations After gathering all the information they could, Harry and she weighed the possible explanations. They realized that, although the white hind seemed like a more rational explanation, they couldn't dismiss the possibility of a magical unicorn entirely. Step 6 - Accept the undefined result Accepting that they might never know for sure whether the sightings were of a unicorn or the white hind, the two of them agreed that sometimes, it was alright to embrace the unknown. The beauty of life, after all, lay in its mysteries. As they walked away from the forest, hand in hand, she felt a strange sense of comfort – not everything had to be fully understood or explained. And with Harry by her side, she knew she would always be ready to face whatever mysteries lay ahead."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. No acting the goat at Chicago Cubs when it comes to pub owner’s curse Wrigley Field is not your standard modern American sports facility, even though little could be more American than having your stadium named after a manufacturer of chewing gum. It is America’s Wimbledon, its Lord’s. It is the second oldest of the major league ballparks. There is a pervasive sense of history and a deep yearning that goes back 108 years, to the last time the Chicago Cubs won the World Series. Built on land originally occupied by a Catholic seminary and first named Weeghman Park after the original owner, the stadium was finally renamed in 1927, six years after the club had been acquired by Bill Wrigley. His family – which still has its name on downtown Chicago’s most distinctive art deco office building – owned the Cubs for 60 years, from 1921 to 1981, but never saw them win the World Series again. The closest they came was in 1945: the Year of the Billy Goat. This weekend the Cubs face the Los Angeles Dodgers in the first of a series of games that will decide the National League Championship, sending the winners to meet either the Toronto Blue Jays or the Cleveland Indians. And already their players are making nonchalant noises about how the Curse of the Goat means nothing to them. Probably the second most famous malediction in baseball – after the Curse of the Bambino, which afflicted the Boston Red Sox from 1918 to 2004 – was laid on the Cubs by William Sianis, the proprietor of the Billy Goat Tavern, who turned up for game four of the 1945 World Series accompanied by his pet goat, for which he had bought a seat. After three games in Detroit, the Cubs were leading the Tigers by 2-1. PK Wrigley, who had become the majority owner after the death of his father, objected to the smell of Sianis’s goat and ordained he could not bring the animal into the stadium. As the protesting tavern owner was ejected, he is said to have exclaimed: “The Cubs, they ain’t gonna win no more!” They promptly lost that match, and went down 4-3 in the series. Sianis is also said to have followed up with a telegram to Wrigley: “You are never going to win a World Series again because you insulted my goat.” And they haven’t. “I think the biggest thing is that nobody really cares in there about a curse or a goat or anything else,” Jon Lester, Chicago’s left-handed starting pitcher, said. “If we made a mistake, we’re not going to blame it on a curse or anything like that. Plus I think we’ve got too many young guys in there who don’t even know what that stuff is.” He sounded like a man whistling loudly to keep ghosts from the door. Those young players might not have known about the curse but they will now. Among other elements of folklore, they will know about the 42 former Cubs players who, since 1945, have gone on to win World Series titles with other clubs. And they will already be tired of hearing how generations of owners, coaches, players and fans have tried to eradicate the hoodoo. Goats have been taken into Wrigley Field and to the stadiums of the Cubs’ opponents. A slaughtered goat was hung from the statue of Harry Caray, a famous Cubs sportscaster known as the Mayor of Rush Street. A Chicago-based charity that sends goats to developing countries is called Reverse the Curse. In 2008, a Greek Orthodox priest sprayed holy water on the Cubs’ dugout after the play-offs, with no beneficial effect. Five years ago the club’s current owners, the Ricketts family, had a better idea when they made Theo Epstein their president of baseball operations. In 2004, as the 30-year-old general manager of the Red Sox, Epstein had guided the club to their World Series win, repeating the feat three years later. In 2011 he moved to Chicago, but progress was slow: in his first three seasons the Cubs finished bottom of the National League Central. And then, before the start of the 2015 campaign, he hired the 60-year-old Joe Maddon as team manager. In their first season under the son of an Italian plumber and a Polish waitress, they reached the National League championship series. This year, with the best regular-season win-loss record of any team in the major leagues (103-58), they are a best-of-seven series away from a shot at the ultimate prize. And Maddon’s pearls of wisdom, the baseball equivalent of Zen koans, are appearing on T-shirts. “Do simple better” is one. “Don’t ever permit the pressure to exceed the pleasure” is another. “It’s not going to be an oil painting every night – you can’t always be perfect.” “If I’m honest with you, you might not like me for a day or two. If I lie to you, you’re gonna hate me for ever.” And then there is his refusal to be bothered about his players’ timekeeping. “The concept of being late is overblown,” he has said. “You can’t really be late for anything.” A thought designed, perhaps, to comfort the fans who have been kept waiting more than a century. That sort of homespun wisdom sounds great when you are winning and although spirits are high enough for the owners to have awarded Epstein a five-year 50m extension, plenty of Cubs diehards will be understandably reluctant to get their celebrations in early. At least, even in disappointment, they have the consolation of knowing they attend their baseball games in uniquely magnificent surroundings. It was in 1985 that I visited Wrigley Field, two years before PK Wrigley finally caved in and installed floodlights, making it the last major league stadium to answer television’s demand for night games. The Cincinnati Reds were the Cubs’ opponents that June afternoon. The visitors had Pete Rose, known as “Charlie Hustle”, then just a year or two away from being suspended for shoving an umpire and subsequently charged with betting against his own team. The Cubs had Ryne Sandberg, a tall, well-built second baseman with, as the great Chicago Tribune columnist Mike Royko put it, “a movie-star smile”. Sandberg never won a World Series title but was beloved by fans for the way he played the game with grace, elegance and sportsmanship as well as power. Sometimes that can be worth more than trophies. But maybe not this year. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs baseball team, is steeped in history and tradition, but also carries with it the infamous Curse of the Billy Goat. The curse dates back to 1945 when William Sianis, the owner of the Billy Goat Tavern, supposedly cursed the team after being ejected from the stadium due to the smell of his pet goat. Since then, the Cubs have not won a World Series, despite various attempts to 'reverse the curse' by introducing goats into the stadium, charity events, and even holy water sprays on the players' dugout. This year, the Cubs are performing well and their fans hold onto the hope that the curse could finally be broken, with spirits remaining high in anticipation of a possible World Series win."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nigel Ernest James Mansell,  (; born 8 August 1953) is a British former racing driver who won both the Formula One World Championship (1992) and the CART Indy Car World Series (1993). Mansell was the reigning F1 champion when he moved over to CART, becoming the first person to win the CART title in his debut season, and making him the only person to hold both the World Drivers' Championship and the American open-wheel National Championship simultaneously. His career in Formula One spanned 15 seasons, with his final two full seasons of top-level racing being spent in the CART series. Mansell is the second most successful British Formula One driver of all time in terms of race wins with 31 victories, and is seventh overall on the Formula One race winners list behind Michael Schumacher, Lewis Hamilton, Alain Prost, Sebastian Vettel, Ayrton Senna and Fernando Alonso. Nigel Ernest James Mansell was born on 8 August 1953 in Upton-upon-Severn, Worcestershire, the son of Eric (d. 1 April 1991), an engineer and Joyce Mansell (d. 17 May 1984).  He had a fairly slow start to his racing career, using his own money to help work his way up the ranks. After considerable success in kart racing, he moved to the Formula Ford series to the disapproval of his father. In 1976, Mansell won six of the nine races he took part in, including his debut event at Mallory Park. He entered 42 races the following year and won 33 to become the 1977 British Formula Ford champion, despite suffering a broken neck in a qualifying session at Brands Hatch. Doctors told him he had been perilously close to quadriplegia, that he would be confined for six months and would never drive again. Mansell discharged himself from the hospital and returned to racing. Three weeks before the accident he had resigned from his job as an aerospace engineer, having previously sold most of his personal belongings to finance his foray into Formula Ford. Later that year he was given the chance to race a Lola T570 Formula 3 car at Silverstone. He finished fourth and decided that he was ready to move into the higher formula.  Mansell raced in Formula Three in 1978-1980. Mansell's first season in Formula Three started with a pole position and a second-place finish. However, the car was not competitive, as a commercial deal with Unipart required his team to use Triumph Dolomite engines that were vastly inferior to the Toyota engines used by the leading teams. After three seventh-place finishes and a fourth in his last race, he parted from the team. The next season saw him take a paid drive with David Price Racing. Following a first win in the series at Silverstone in March, he went on to finish eighth in the championship. His racing was consistent, but a collision with Andrea de Cesaris resulted in a huge cartwheeling crash which he was lucky to survive. Again he was hospitalised, this time with broken vertebrae.  His driving was noticed by Colin Chapman, owner of Lotus, and shortly after his accident, hiding the extent of his injury with painkillers, Mansell performed well enough during a tryout at the Paul Ricard circuit with Lotus, where he was pitted against a number of other drivers to determine who was going to take the second seat for the 1980 season alongside Mario Andretti, as Argentinean Carlos Reutemann was leaving to go to Williams. Driving a 79, the seat eventually went to Italian driver Elio de Angelis, but Mansell was selected to become a test driver for the Norfolk-based Formula One team. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: did he have any injuries in his career?","output":"Yes, Nigel Mansell had multiple injuries throughout his racing career. Some of the notable ones include suffering a broken neck in a qualifying session at Brands Hatch, being perilously close to quadriplegia, and having broken vertebrae from a collision with Andrea de Cesaris, which resulted in a huge cartwheeling crash. Despite these injuries, Mansell continued his racing career and achieved significant success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Long ago in the Iron Age a shadow loomed over a lonely village of Thens. For every five years, eight village youths are stolen from their families to the capital of the Minos Empire and placed in the underground labyrinth to be a sacrifice to the Minotaur, the Minoan god. Theo, haunted by the loss of his love, Fion, in an earlier sacrifice, is convinced that the beast is not a deity and that his love still lives within the labyrinth. His father Cyrnan, the village leader, tries to reason with Theo not to go but Theo is driven by blind rage and made his way in with seven other youths to be sacrifical lambs. However, Theo intends to kill the Minotaur. Along with his fellow captives, Tyro, Danu, Vena, Morna, Didi, Ziko and Cyrnan, they are placed in the labyrinth by King Deucalion, with the youths slaugthered one by one by the Minotaur. However, Theo is aided by Deucalion's sister, Queen Raphaella, who reveals that her mother gave herself to the most disturbing actions to create a living god, the Minotaur. As the Minotaur grows, so does its appetite when it murdered Deucalion's brother, resulting with the human sacrifices to appense the Minotaur while ensuring Minos's surival.Theo along the way discovers the labyrinth is connected to an underground vent and Tyro tempts the Minotaur to crash into one of the vents but is unsuccessful as the Minotaur eats him alive. Theo then tempts the Minotaur and in the process, the Minotaur breaks his left horn, but continues to charge after Theo. As Theo ran back towards the enlarged vent, he scratches the walls and generates a spark that ignites the whole labyrinth, and dives into a pond of water where Raphaella was waiting for him. They emerge from the water as the flames die out, but the beast is still alive and attempts to charge at them again. Theo takes the horn out of the rubble from where the vent was, and just as the beast attempts to kill him, stabs the Minotaur through the mouth and continues on charging until it hits a collapsed rock formation which impales the...

Identify the correct terms for \\"new\\", \\"bridge\\", and \\"Darnytskyi\\" in Russian. 2. Combine the Russian terms to form the translated phrase. Step 1: Translating the individual words - \\"New\\" in Russian is \\"новый\\" (pronounced \\"novy\\") - \\"Bridge\\" in Russian is \\"мост\\" (pronounced \\"most\\") - \\"Darnytskyi\\" is a proper noun and a district name in Kyiv, Ukraine. Thus, we will not translate it but convert it to Russian Cyrillic, which is \\"Дарницкий\\" (pronounced \\"Darnitsky\\"). Step 2: Combining the translated terms Now, we will combine the translated words in the right order. In Russian, adjectives usually come before the nouns they're describing. Therefore, \\"новый\\" should come before \\"мост\\" and \\"Дарницкий.\\" Phrase: новый Дарницкий мост (pronounced \\"novy Darnitsky most\\") So, \\"New Darnytskyi Bridge\\" is said as \\"новый Дарницкий мост\\" in Russian."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which gardener had plants with more underground rot?  Kat and Joe were into vegetable gardening. Joe started the no-till gardening method, while Kat applied conventional gardening methods.  Hint: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted. Answer:","output":"Joe had plants with more underground rot. This is because Joe used the no-till gardening method, and the paragraph states that no-till farming can lead to disadvantages such as underground rot, low soil temperatures, and high moisture. Since Kat applied conventional gardening methods, it is less likely that her plants had the same level of underground rot as Joe's."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You don't need to fake cheeriness, but try not to get bogged down in worrying about the particulars of your relationship. Let your time together be easy, fun, and stress-free. If you and your boyfriend only ever talk about the heavy stuff, he may have formed negative associations around hanging out with you. That said: if you need to talk about these things, you may as well let them out. Whether it's a walk, a trip to the beach, or a movie night – find something that you both can get excited about. Consider what he's into lately, and what he might most want to spend his time on. Think back to where you met him and what the two of you did together at the beginning of your relationship. Find common ground.  If you aren't sure, you might need to take a more active approach. Try as many different things as you can until you find a few that you both enjoy. Think about what he does with his friends. You don't need to do these things, and you shouldn't cut completely into his friend time – but it might help to understand where his time is going. Engage with his thoughts and feelings while still being true to your own. Be considerate, and don't force him to do things that make him comfortable. Don't try to make him jealous or stressed-out just so that he will hang out with you. When you are hanging out together, try to strike a balance between what you want to do and what he wants to do. Sometimes, you might have to spend time doing something that bores you in order to be around him. If you do things that your boyfriend likes doing, he may be much more open to spending time with you when you're doing things that he doesn't enjoy. For example: Say that you hate baseball, but your boyfriend loves it – and you love going to museums, but your boyfriend can't stand them. Make an agreement: if you go to a baseball game, he'll accompany you to a museum! . Check back in periodically to see if things have improved. If you find your boyfriend spending more time with you in an enjoyable way, then you should keep doing what you're doing. However: if he still isn't spending time with you despite your best efforts, then it might be time to end things. You may simply not have common interests; he may not like you as much as you think; or he may just generally not spend much time with his partners. Whatever the case, he's clearly not giving you the attention you need – so if you aren't comfortable, you might consider leaving him. Summary:","output":"To get your boyfriend to spend more time with you, try doing fun and stress-free activities together that you both enjoy. Find common interests and take turns doing things each of you likes. Be considerate of his feelings and don't force him to do things he doesn't like.

Context: Reaching high levels of professional and financial success at any cost has been the modern-day Mecca to multitudes of business men and women for several decades. Unfortunately, the attainment of such an all-consuming goal has not produced the peace and happiness that was expected. There was a dark side to success. Fairly recently, the question of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness has taken center stage in many circles of psychological research. Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits. The majority of these studies agree on one thing – there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career. The studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals – it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed. The danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm. They cope with it the best they can; but allow no time for recovery from the depletion of resources. Professional burnout from chronic stress debilitates the individual to the point that s/he can no longer function effectively on a personal or professional level. Psychology Today tells us that “Burnout is one of those road hazards in life that high-achievers really should be keeping a close eye out for, but sadly – often because of their “I can do everything” personalities, they rarely see it coming.” Question: The author probably believes that what would probably help prevent burnout? Answer: The answer is:","output":"The author probably believes that maintaining a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences, managing stress effectively, and allowing time for recovery from stress would help prevent burnout."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Usually it is the highest rank in an army, and when it is, few (if any) persons are appointed to it. It is considered as a five-star rank (OF-10) in modern-day armed forces in many countries.  - Marshal (also spelled marshall) is a term used in several official titles in various branches of society. As marshals became trusted members of the courts of Medieval Europe, the title grew in reputation. During the last few centuries, it has been used for elevated offices, such as in military rank and civilian law enforcement.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean.

Q:Article: Parents whose children think the latest Nike or Adidas shoes may be better than buying old-fashioned plimsolls   because they encourage a healthier style of running, researchers said. Big companies, like Nike and Adidas, make millions of dollars from selling highly-cushioned shoes  both as fashion and sports shoes. The researchers warn that wearing such shoes from an early age can make it difficult to run in a healthy way. Once we have grown used to running in this kind of shoes, it is very difficult to change our technique, even if we remove our shoes, it can raise the risk of injury. Children should be encouraged to wear shoes with thin soles such as plimsolls from a young age to help them develop a natural \\"barefoot\\" running style, experts said. Dr Mick Wilknson, who did the research, told the British Science Festival in Newcastle, \\"If I would advise someone on what to give their child, I would say don't go and buy them expensive Adidas or Nike, just get them a pair of flexible, flat shoes. Give them basic foot-ware, nothing fancy, nothing particularly cushioned.\\" Running in flat shoes, barefoot, encourages the runner to use the front of their foot which is a better technique for running, especially long distances as the human was designed to do. Around the world, and in particular in the US, running barefoot is becoming more and more popular with many long distance runners training without shoes. Dr Mick Wilknson believes that training and running barefoot or in flat running shoes can help reduce injuries to runners, he said: \\"Injury rates in running have not changed since the 1970s, despite claims of improvements in running shoes. That has led some to conclude that barefoot running is better.\\" Question: Why are people advised to wear plimsolls? Yes or no, is the answer \\"They are healthier\\"? A:","output":"People are advised to wear plimsolls because they promote a healthier style of running and help develop a natural \\"barefoot\\" running technique. Plimsolls, with their thin soles and basic design, encourage runners to use the front of their foot, which is a better technique for running, especially in long distances, the way humans were naturally designed to do. Researchers, like Dr. Mick Wilkinson, believe that training and running in plimsolls or barefoot can help reduce injuries to runners, as opposed to using highly-cushioned shoes from big brands like Nike and Adidas. These cushioned shoes can make it difficult for individuals to run in a healthy way, and once they get used to this style, it becomes challenging to change their technique. In conclusion, the answer is yes, wearing plimsolls is considered healthier as they contribute to a better running technique and potentially reduced risk of injury."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We want people to feel happy with their lives.\\" There are now more than 500 Laughter Clubs in India and over 1,300 in the world. Many doctors are also interested in the effects  of laughter on our health. According to a 5-year study at the UCLA School of Medicine in California, with laughing there is less stress in the body. Laughter improves our health against illness by about 40%. So what happens at a Laughter Club? I went along to my nearest club in South London to find out. I was quite nervous at the beginning of the class, to be honest, I wasn't interested in laughing with a group of strangers, and I was worried about looking silly. Our laughter teacher told us to clap our hands and say \\"ho ho ho, ha ha ha\\" while looking at each other. However, our bodies can't tell the difference between real laughter and unreal laughter, so they still produce the same healthy effects. Surprisingly, it works! After ten minutes everybody in the room was laughing for real and some people just couldn't stop! At the end of the class I was surprised by how relaxed and comfortable I felt. So if you're under stress, then start laughing. You might be very pleased with the results. Question: How many Laughter Clubs are there in the world today? Options: A: Over 300. B: Over 500.

Libyan officials rejected the ICC, claiming that it had \\"no legitimacy whatsoever\\" and highlighting that \\"all of its activities are directed at African leaders\\". That month, Amnesty International published their findings, in which they asserted that many of the accusations of mass human rights abuses made against Gaddafist forces lacked credible evidence, and were instead fabrications of the rebel forces which had been readily adopted by the western media. Amnesty International did however still accuse Gaddafi forces of numerous war crimes. On 15 July 2011, at a meeting in Istanbul, over 30 governments recognised the NTC as the legitimate government of Libya. Gaddafi responded to the announcement with a speech on Libyan national television, in which he called on supporters to \\"Trample on those recognitions, trample on them under your feet ...

The group arrive at the railway station in the fictitious small Kent town of Chillingbourne (filmed in Chilham, Fordwich, Wickhambreaux and other villages in the area), near Canterbury, late on Friday night, 27 August 1943. Peter has been stationed at a nearby Army camp, Alison is due to start working on a farm in the area, and Bob left the train by mistake, hearing the announcement \\"next stop Canterbury\\" and thinking he was in Canterbury. As they leave the station together Alison is attacked by an assailant in uniform who pours glue on her hair, before escaping. It transpires that this has happened quite a few times before, to other women. Alison asks Bob if he could spend the weekend in Chillingbourne to help her solve the mystery. The next day, while riding a farm cart in the countryside, Alison meets Peter, who surrounds her cart with his platoon of three Bren Gun Carriers. Alison agrees to meet Peter again. The three decide to investigate the attack, enlisting the help of the locals, including several young boys who play large-scale war games. The three use their detective skills to identify the culprit as a local magistrate, Thomas Colpeper (Eric Portman), a gentleman farmer and pillar of the community, who also gives local history lectures to soldiers stationed in the district. Alison interviews all the glue man's victims to identify the dates and times of their attacks. Gibbs visits Colpeper at his home and borrows the fire watch roster listing the nights Colpeper was on duty in the town hall, whilst a paper drive for salvage by Johnson's boy commandos lets Johnson discover receipts for gum used to make glue sold to Colpeper.

They'd told him that this is what they did for fun. Chloe assured him that they \\"lived for this kinda shit.\\" Ok, fine. He could sort of see that.

The image may be life size or not, the scale is often shown, and may show the habit and habitat of the plant, the upper and reverse sides of leaves, and details of flowers, bud, seed and root system.  - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - Ulster (or \\"Cúige Uladh\\" , Ulster Scots: \\"Ulstèr\\" or \\"Ulster\\") is a province in the north of the island of Ireland. In ancient Ireland, it was one of the fifths ruled by a \\"rí ruirech\\", or \\"king of over-kings\\".  - Botanical illustration is the art of depicting the form, colour, and details of plant species, frequently in watercolour paintings. They must be scientifically accurate but often also have an artistic component and may be printed with a botanical description in book, magazines, and other media or sold as a work of art. Often composed in consultation with a scientific author, their creation requires an understanding of plant morphology and access to specimens and references.   - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth.  - The British Isles are a group of islands off the north-western coast of continental Europe that consist of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland and over six thousand smaller isles. Situated in the North Atlantic, the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159 km, and a combined population of just under 70 million. Two sovereign states are located on the islands: Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island with the same name) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The British Isles also include three Crown Dependencies: the Isle of Man and, by tradition, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, although the latter are not physically a part of the archipelago.  - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.

He was sitting in his armchair in the front room.  I sat next to him. We were reading aloud,our heads bent over the page in front of us,a finger marking the words;separated by seven decades,brought together by words. It's a common scene in British families;however,in our case,the usual order of things is reversed .Granddad had been blind since I was tiny,so I was reading to him.When reading aloud,people usually read something that's of interest to the listener. So I didn't read children's books;I read the sorts of things Granddad liked to hear about. Much of the vocabulary in Granddad's reading material was far beyond me. When I met unfamiliar words,I'd spell them out.  Granddad would help me. It must have been painful for him to hear news;but he never hurried me along or complained. Our reading wasn't really about getting knowledge. It was a way for us to spend time together.  My grandfather wasn't always blind. He had been a good carpenter .The first Christmas of my parents' marriage,he built my mother a bookcase,which now belongs to my son Jonah,providing a link between four generations.  I was a fortunate child;I spent a lot of time with my grandfather,and he opened the world to me in a particular way. Reading was our way of building a relationship that has had a lasting effect on me. In the school holidays,I sometimes accompanied him on trips to the seaside with the local association for the blind. This might seem strange,but I felt that my personal value was realized because I could finally do something for Granddad.  A decade later,I found a position in a nursing home,which reminded me of my early experiences;reading to senior citizens was a connection back to Granddad.

McFarland, is expected to step down and has been offered the position of U.S. ambassador to Singapore, a U.S. official said on Sunday.      Kathleen Troia \\"K.T.\\" McFarland arrives at Trump Tower in New York, U.S., January 3, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Segar      The move will be seen as a victory for Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, who is retooling the national security team he inherited from retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, who resigned as Trump’s first national security adviser in February.      McFarland, 65, is a former national security analyst for Fox News and was one of Trump’s original hires after he won the presidential election on Nov. 8.      The exact date of her departure was unclear, said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.      News of her pending departure came less than a week after Trump removed his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, from the National Security Council at McMaster’s urging. Bannon had a seat on the council’s “principals committee,” which included the secretaries of state, defense and other ranking aides. Flynn was forced to resign on Feb. 13 over his contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, before Trump took office on Jan. 20.      McFarland’s expected departure will likely elevate the status of Dina Powell, who is deputy national security adviser for strategy. She had served in Republican President George W. Bush’s State Department, and had advised Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, during Trump’s transition to the presidency.      Trump’s White House has been rife with infighting and palace intrigue as the president has struggled to get past some early stumbles. ||||| K. T. McFarland has been asked to step down as deputy National Security Advisor to President Donald Trump after less than three months and is expected to be nominated as ambassador to Singapore, according to a person familiar with White House personnel moves.      The departure of the 65-year-old former Fox News commentator comes as Trump’s second National Security Advisor, H.R. McMaster, puts his own stamp on the National Security Council after taking over in February from retired General Michael Flynn.      McFarland proved not to be a good fit at the NSC, the person said, adding that Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly was involved in the decision as well.      Her removal follows a reorganization of the NSC in the past week that removed Stephen Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist and senior counselor, from the principals committee, the Cabinet-level interagency forum that advises the president on pressing security matters.      Other officials, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were brought back onto the committee as “regular attendees,” reversing a move made in January. The changes were outlined in a presidential memorandum dated April 4.      Former Goldman Sachs executive Dina Powell stays on as another deputy national security adviser, and a second person is expected to be named to a similar role to replace McFarland.      Personnel Changes      Get the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day. Get our newsletter daily.      Trump’s young White House has been marked by several personnel changes, including the reassignment of Katie Walsh, its first deputy chief of staff, and reported infighting between the camps of Bannon on the one hand and adviser/Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner on the other. In that clash, the pair were asked to iron out their differences, which have played out in the media, and concentrate on backing the president’s agenda.      McMaster looked to minimize the significance of the demotion of Bannon, former executive chairman of Breitbart News, which came as the president was weighing options for action against Syria, his administration’s first major decision on a military intervention.      “This is not as significant as it appears,” said the 54-year-old Army lieutenant general. “Steve Bannon provides the president with advice on a broad range of issues and will continue to do so.”      Kathleen Troia (K.T.) McFarland was brought to the White House by Flynn, who was fired for not disclosing his level of contacts with Russia to the president or vice president. A staff member of the NSC in the 1970s, McFarland lost a bid for the 2006 Republican Party U.S. Senate nomination in New York.      The most recent U.S. ambassador to Singapore, Florida attorney and Barack Obama fundraiser Kirk Wagar, departed in January upon Trump’s inauguration. McFarland’s appointment would be subject to Senate confirmation. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"President Donald Trump's Deputy National Security Adviser, K.T.

Context: SEOUL — North Korea’s sudden threat to pull out of the upcoming summit with the U.S. raises new doubts of whether a denuclearization deal is possible. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed to meet with U.S President Donald Trump in Singapore on June 12 to work out an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. But on Wednesday North Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Kwan released a statement through the state-run KCNA news agency that criticized “unbridled remarks” made specifically by the U.S. president’s National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding that Pyongyang completely decommission its entire nuclear arsenal, along with its ballistic missile program and chemical weapons stockpile, before receiving any compensation or concessions. He expressed “indignation” at the U.S uncompromising position and said North Korea might pull out of the Trump-Kim summit, unless the Trump administration acts with “sincerity” to improve relations through dialogue. “If the United States is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue and cannot but reconsider our proceeding to the North Korea-U.S. summit,” the statement said. The vice foreign minister also said it was “absolutely absurd” that Bolton would compare Libya’s experience dismantling its relatively rudimentary nuclear program as a model for dealing with the North’s more advanced and expansive capabilities. He also denounced the Trump administration for “miscalculating the magnanimity” of Kim Jong Un’s decision to suspend further nuclear and missile tests, and his willingness to engage in nuclear talks, as “signs of weakness,” that were the result of what the U.S. administration has dubbed its “maximum pressure” campaign that led international efforts to impose punishing sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade.

Her heart melted at her son's eyes. She gave him a gold coin. When the father asked his son what he had earned, the son presented him the gold coin. The father asked him to throw it into a well. The next day, he asked his son to earn something. This time he went crying to his sister who gave him a coin. When he showed it to his father he again asked him to throw it in a well. Then the father asked him to earn more money. This time since there was no one to help him, the son was forced to go to the market. One shopkeeper told him he would pay him two coins if he carried his trunk to his house. He did so and sweated plenty. As he returned home he was asked to do the same. The son almost cried out. He could not imagine throwing his hard-earned money like this. He cried, \\"My entire body is aching. You are asking me to throw the money into the well.\\" At this moment, the businessman told him one feels the pain only when the fruits of hard labour are wasted. On the earlier two occasions he was helped and therefore had no pain in throwing the coins into the well. The son had now realized the value of hard work.

Even though my generation never actually saw him play, we were able to access plenty of archive footage in which he showcased his skill on the pitch. But the real insight came from generations before me, like my parents or grandparents. Through them, I was able to learn about the man and athlete known to the world as \\"A Pantera Negra\\" (The Black Panther). Those stories still resonate till this day almost like fairy tales. The young kid who ended up traveling almost 5,000 miles to pursue his passion for soccer and ended up with a lot more than he bargained for. The teen striker moved to Portugal at the age of 18, after a former Brazilian footballer working at the time as a scout, told Benfica's manager Béla Guttmann about his promising talents. Since joining the team in 1960 up until 1975, Eusebio won 11 league titles, one European Cup, five Portuguese cups, among several other team and individual records. People would say he was the best player to ever grace Portugal with his talent. That the way he exploded on the pitch with his fast pace combined with the power of his right foot was a joy to watch. Adding his phenomenal stats with 733 goals, including 41 for country, it then became obvious we were talking about one of the greats. It didn't take me long to understand what people meant every time they spoke about him. A few YouTube clips could easily testify to this and go as far as to reveal that such attributes would still make him a star, even in today's game. His success on the pitch, however, took on massive proportions, as it was not a mere sporting achievement. It was proof that Portugal was able to produce great talent and conquer new and different horizons. It gave people hope, happiness and some comfort, which was all much needed at the time. During the period when Eusebio burst onto the scene, Portugal was going through a rough stage under the decades-long dictatorship of Antonio Salazar. Only what was known as the \\"three F's:\\" Fado, Football and Fatima (the Virgin Mary) would cheer the masses. So the level of success that Portugal enjoyed under the leadership of Eusebio was crucial as a distraction that kept the population together. It is therefore no surprise that many people from all over the country admired Eusebio, regardless of the club they supported. As years went by and my passion for the game of soccer grew stronger, the \\"King's\\" (his other nickname) life and career became even more appealing to me. I can't deny that a big part of it has to do with my allegiance to Benfica, the club for which the Mozambique-born Portuguese footballer played 15 out of his 22 years as a professional athlete. It was obvious that this love affair would continue after his career ended. After retiring, he was offered a role as an ambassador, which he played until his last breath. Equally, he also acted worldwide as a spokesperson for the game. The part seemed fitting for a man of his skills. More than just making use of his legendary status, as a man he was known for being a humble, kind and tremendously charismatic, making him very popular across the country as well as beyond our own borders. It is then no surprise that, on January 5th, the world reacted with shock to the news of his passing at the age of 71. Soon after, I was called by CNN to travel to Lisbon in order to cover the story. I remember having mixed feelings at the time. On one hand I was saddened by the news, but on the other hand I felt incredibly privileged to have the opportunity to cover the story by attending his funeral from a journalistic standpoint. This had a very special meaning, as it allowed me to also pay my respects as a long-time admirer. I was able to witness how his death brought the country closer together. It was beautiful to see the amount of people that followed the coffin or showed up at the church. The crowds assembling close to his statue at the Stadium of Light, statue which by the way was covered from head to toe with flowers and scarves from various Portuguese clubs, as a sign of admiration. You could say that on that day, even the biggest soccer fanatic was colour-blind. There was no Benfica, Sporting or Porto -- there was only a unified country! At a time when Portugal is facing a long, hard financial depression -- which has not only affected our country's economy, but also our spirits -- it was remarkable to see that, even if just for a few days, fans -- including longtime rivals -- were paying homage to a man they've learned to respect and admire for his talent and flair, but also for his personality. His name is still very much present in the culture of not only the club, but the country. Being such a timeless character, I can only wait for the time where I tell my kids the same stories I was told growing up. It is an ongoing way of celebrating his life.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Water from the surface seeps below the soil - The water comes into contact with the rock below - The rock over the years carves through the rock - The space in the rock becomes larger and forms into a cave - As more rather rushes through the cave becomes a cavern.  Question: suppose Large and heavy thunderstorms happens, how will it affect Water will seep below the soil.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"A: More Large and heavy thunderstorms would significantly impact the amount of water that seeps below the soil, resulting in increased water flow. This is because thunderstorms bring intense rainfall that saturates the surface soil with more abundant volumes of water than typical precipitation events. There are several reasons why it would lead to more water seeping below the soil: 1. Increased moisture content in soil: Heavy rainfall during thunderstorms results in a higher quantity of water on the surface. This water will naturally infiltrate the soil, increasing the moisture content within the soil layers. As the water moves downward through the soil, it will displace air and other gases, creating a greater potential for water to seep deeper into the soil. 2. Erosion and soil movement: The intense force of rainwater during a thunderstorm can cause soil particles to move and erode. This can lead to the creation of new pathways for water to travel through the soil and even expose deeper layers of the ground that might be more permeable to water infiltration. 3. Saturated soil: As the soil becomes more saturated, its capacity to hold water decreases. This means that excess water from the thunderstorm must find its way downwards since it cannot be held on the surface or within the upper soil layers. Consequently, more water will seep into the deeper layers, eventually reaching the rock below. 4. Runoff and infiltration: Surface runoff from intense rainfall during thunderstorms can increase the volume of water that reaches areas with more permeable soil. This excess water will, in turn, infiltrate the soil and contribute to more water seeping below the surface. 5. Groundwater recharge: A heavy thunderstorm can also lead to more significant groundwater recharge. The increased volume of water infiltrating the soil and percolating through the layers will eventually reach the water table, replenishing groundwater levels and potentially even increasing underground water flow towards nearby rock formations. In conclusion, large and heavy thunderstorms result in more water seeping below the soil due to the increased volume and intensity of rainwater. Various factors, such as increased moisture content, erosion, saturated soil, and runoff, all contribute to this phenomenon. This increased water flow can significantly impact the formation and development of underground rock structures like caves and caverns, as the process of water interaction and carving through the rock accelerates due to the additional water input from the thunderstorms."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question \\"How will their daughter feel as a result?\\", is \\"sad no one pays them attention\\" a valid answer? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, it is difficult to definitively conclude how their daughter will feel as an outcome of the fishing trip. However, let us analyze the given answer option, \\"sad no one pays them attention,\\" and other possibilities taking into consideration various factors that could affect their daughter's emotions. The given answer, \\"sad no one pays them attention,\\" does not seem like a valid response, specifically considering that Skylar is taking their daughter on a fishing trip, which implies that they are spending quality time together. This act demonstrates that Skylar is indeed paying attention to their daughter and investing time in bonding with her through an outdoor activity. However, without knowing the daughter's preferences, interests, or experiences relating to fishing, it's challenging to infer her emotional response accurately. Some alternative scenarios and corresponding emotions include: 1. If the daughter enjoys fishing and appreciates spending time with her parent, she might feel happy, excited, and content during and after the trip. 2. If she is new to fishing and has never been on a trip before, the experience could provoke feelings of curiosity, wonder, or learning something new. Additionally, it could spark fear or nervousness if she isn't accustomed to being near water or handling fishing equipment. 3. If the daughter doesn't particularly enjoy fishing but appreciates Skylar's effort to bond with her, the emotions could be mixed. She might feel happy that her parent is making an effort to spend time with her yet somewhat frustrated or bored due to her disinterest in fishing. 4. If she dislikes fishing and resents being forced to partake in the activity, the emotional response could be negative, such as feeling angry, upset, or disappointed. In conclusion, it would be inappropriate to assume that the daughter will feel \\"sad no one pays them attention\\" as a result of the fishing trip. Given the various possible emotional outcomes, it's essential to consider factors such as the daughter's interests, their relationship dynamics, and past experiences with similar activities to understand her emotions accurately."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hannah Roberts. PUBLISHED:. 11:33 EST, 19 July 2013. |. UPDATED:. 12:17 EST, 19 July 2013. Jailed: Nicole Minetti has been sentenced to five years for grooming prostitutes for Silvio Berlusconi's bunga bunga parties. An Anglo-Italian showgirl has been sentenced to five years in prison for procuring and grooming prostitutes for Silvio Berlusconi’s bunga bunga parties. Nicole Minetti, whose mother is British, acted as a Madame running a stable of more than 30 young women for the ex-premier’s sex parties, a court in Milan ruled. Minetti, 28, a regional councillor for Berlusconi’s People of Freedom party in Milan, helped to recruit 33 female guests, who were given envelopes stuffed with 500 Euro notes and expensive gifts after the dinners at the prime minister’s luxury villa near Milan. Convicted alongside Miss Minetti were former TV anchor Emilio Fede and talent scout Lele Mora who each received seven year jail sentences. Prosecutor Pietro Forno had told the court that Minetti acted as ‘the brothel manager, paying salaries and choosing locations’. Files included a telephone tap transcript in which a former police officer told a friend sordid details about the bawdy parties. He said: ‘Minetti was there with her chest out kissing Berlusconi continuously. It was a real whorehouse. All the girls were given rings and necklaces.’ In a separate but related trial that ended last month, Berlusconi was convicted of underage sex with Moroccan nightclub dancer Ruby the Heart Stealer, then just 17. Ruby, real name Karima El Mahroug, who testified at Minetti’s trial, reportedly performed a lesbian kiss with Minetti at one of the bunga bunga parties. El Mahroug told the court that Minetti was a central figure at the parties and had dressed up as a nun for Berlusconi before stripping down to her underwear. Minetti had been lining up call girls just hours before the investigation into Berlusconi began, the court heard. Sentenced: Emilio Fede, right, and Lele Mora, right, were also jailed for seven years. Guilty: In a separate but related trial that ended last month, Berlusconi was convicted of underage sex with Moroccan nightclub dancer Ruby the Heart Stealer, then just 17. In text messages intercepted by investigators, Marystell Polanco, a television star, wrote: ‘Papi is here Saturday,’ to which Minetti replied: ‘How do you know he is here Saturday?’ At the same time Minetti messaged the glamour model Floriana Marincea writing: ‘He’s here Saturday. We absolutely must be there. Do you have a pretty friend we can take?’ Miss Marincea texted back: ‘Yes, I’ll find someone, pretty.’ Miss Minetti replied: ‘Who is it?’ getting the reply: ‘She’s very trustworthy, good-looking. I’ve known her since she was 14 and she’s now 25.’ But the defence claimed Minetti was ‘not the organiser of the parties but instead one of many women who had an affectionate relationship with the prime minister - some were given Land Rovers others were given positions in local government. Evidence: Ruby, real name Karima El-Mahroug, is a model and nightclub dancer who testified at Nicole Minetti's trial. Former lawyer Corso added the relationship was a bit like 'you scratch my back and I will scratch yours'. A trained dental hygienist, Minetti, whose mother Georgina Reed is from Newcastle upon Tyne, treated Mr Berlusconi’s broken teeth after he was hit in the face with a statue at a rally in December 2009. There were raised eyebrows when despite zero experience she was entered as a candidate for local elections, winning a seat on the council for the Lombardy region. In a ‘spontaneous declaration’ to the court, Minetti claimed she had been in a relationship with Berlusconi. ‘He began court me discreetly and I don’t deny being fascinated by him,' she said. She added: ‘My feelings for the prime minister were true love.’ Last night Minetti’s lawyer Pasquale Pantano said she was ‘stupefied by the excessive sentence’.","output":"1.

The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history.  - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack.  - In politics and military planning, a war effort refers to a coordinated mobilization of society's resourcesboth industrial and humantowards the support of a military force. Depending on the militarization of the culture, the relative size of the armed forces and the society supporting them, the style of government, and the popular support for the military objectives, such war effort can range from a small industry to complete command of society.  - A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance. Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known.  - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability.  - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.  - The Focke - Wulf Project II was a design study for a single seat jet fighter carried out in Germany during World War II.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Total war is warfare that includes any and all civilian-associated resources and infrastructure as legitimate military targets, mobilizes all of the resources of society to fight the war, and gives priority to warfare over non-combatant needs. The American-English Dictionary defines total war as \\"war that is unrestricted in terms of the weapons used, the territory or combatants involved, or the objectives pursued, especially one in which the laws of war are disregarded.\\"  - A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own.

Q: Countess Nicolette de Gobignon pressed a wet cloth tothe King's brow. Though he lay there helpless, still she found him an awesome figure, like a fallen cathedral tower. Only two other men are as tall, she thought. Amalric and Orlando. She felt a pang of guilt. How could she be thinking about the troubadour here where her royal master lay slowly dying? She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat. But she knew that this northern chateau, Pontoise-les-Noyons, a day's ride from Paris, had had to be built to withstand cold, its walls thick and its windows tiny ? so totally unlike the bright, airy Languedoc manor she had grown up in. Sweat trickled down her brow and stung her eyes. Her breath was coming in little gasps. She felt as if she would faint if she couldn't go outside soon. Dozens of people, the King's family and courtiers, had packed themselves uselessly into the room, making it even more suffocating. Their whispers, like the buzzing of mosquitoes, irritated Nicolette. Almost all of them, she was sure, worried more about their own welfare than about the King's. And even Louis's wife and mother, though they grieved for him, were too distracted to do much to alleviate his suffering. She saw the King's lips quiver, and quickly she bent close to him.

He puts himself in the other person's place, and he tries to think of ways to be helpful. He is also a good listener. At the same time, however, a good friend is honest. He does not look for faults  in others. He notices their good points. In short, a friend will try to understand me and accept me. Another quality of a friend is reliability. I can always depend on a good friend. If he tells me he will meet me somewhere at a certain time, I can be sure that he will be there. If I need a favor, he will do his best to help me. If I am in trouble, he will not run away from me. There is a fourth quality that makes a friend special. A special friend is someone with whom we can have fun.

U.S. lawmakers grilled Trump administration officials Tuesday about the war in Afghanistan, saying the new White House strategy was inconsistent and was not producing results. The comments made at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing reflected growing frustration in Congress about the U.S.-led war, which is entering its 17th year. ​As recently as November, General John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, acknowledged that the conflict remained a stalemate. Since then, a wave of high-profile insurgent attacks have rocked the capital, Kabul. The Taliban now controls or contests almost half the country, according to latest U.S. estimates. Despite the setbacks, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, who is helping oversee the new White House strategy, gave a positive assessment of the conflict. \\"The president's South Asia strategy is showing some signs of progress,\\" Sullivan said. \\"On the battlefield, we are seeing the Taliban's momentum begin to slow.\\" But lawmakers from both parties expressed skepticism. \\"Something is clearly not working,\\" said Senator Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat and longtime Afghan war critic. \\"By any standard, the current security situation is grim.\\" Some lawmakers took aim at President Donald Trump, who last week said he didn't want to talk with the Taliban — a statement that seemingly contradicted his own strategy. After Sullivan and a top Pentagon official told the lawmakers that the U.S. was in fact still open to negotiations with the Taliban, lawmakers pressed for more details. \\"You can see that the world and those involved in the peace process may be pretty confused about what the U.S. position is. What is it?\\" asked Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat. Sullivan said he thought Trump was expressing a reaction to last month's terrorist attacks, and was pointing out that \\"significant elements of the Taliban are not prepared to negotiate.\\" \\"And it may take a long time before they are willing to negotiate,\\" he added.

Title: Disappointment and Boredom in 'The Tiring Tale' Step 1: Introduction I will begin by introducing the movie that I will be reviewing negatively.  \\"The Tiring Tale\\", directed by John Doe, had the potential to be a gripping and immersive experience but, unfortunately, fell utterly short on all accounts.  Step 2: Analyze the plot Now I will analyze the movie's plot and explain why it failed to captivate the audience. The movie's ambitious plot centers around a mysterious island with a dark secret, but the slow pace, lack of suspense, and poor storytelling leave the audience uninvested in its unravelling. The story seems to lose focus frequently and fails to effectively tie multiple subplots together, resulting in a disjointed narrative. Step 3: Discuss the characters I will now assess the characters and explain why they did not enrich the film. Major characters were one-dimensional, their motivations were unclear, and character development was virtually non-existent. The movie's protagonist, played by Jane Smith, lacked the charisma and on-screen presence necessary to engage viewers. The supporting characters, too, were forgettable and failed to leave any lasting impact. Step 4: Evaluate the technical aspects I will evaluate different technical elements of the movie, such as the direction, cinematography, and music. The cinematography and editing seemed amateurish, with abrupt scene transitions and odd camera angles adding to the viewer's disillusionment. The score was intrusive and rarely complemented the film's emotional beats, sometimes even taking away from crucial moments. Step 5: Provide a final verdict and conclusion I will now summarize my thoughts and provide a final verdict. Overall, 'The Tiring Tale' is a disappointing and lackluster film that wastes its promising premise. Its tedious pacing, uninspired storytelling, weak character development, and subpar technical execution contribute to a forgettable experience. I cannot recommend investing time and money into this movie; instead, consider exploring other, more worthwhile, cinematic projects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process in making coffee using a coffee maker involves pouring water into the machine at the back. This step is crucial as it supplies the necessary water required to brew the coffee. The amount of water added depends on the desired number of cups or servings of coffee. Typically, there are markings on the water reservoir or a separate measuring container provided with the coffee maker to help users pour the correct amount of water. Before starting the coffee-making process, it is essential to prepare all the required materials, such as the coffee maker itself, coffee beans, a grinder, a filter, and, optionally, a small amount of salt. Additionally, the coffee maker should be properly cleaned and assembled. Once everything is set, you can start the first step by pouring the water into the designated compartment or reservoir located at the back of the machine. It is usually accessible through a removable lid or a pivoting compartment. Ensure that the water you use is clean and preferably filtered or distilled to maintain the best taste and to prevent any potential buildup of minerals within the coffee maker. By pouring water into the machine, you initiate the brewing process that eventually creates the perfect cup of coffee. The water will heat up and pass through the grounds, extracting the flavor and aroma from the coffee beans, resulting in a delicious, freshly brewed coffee. Remember, it is essential to follow the subsequent steps, such as grinding the beans, placing a filter, adding ground coffee (and salt if desired), closing the top, and turning the power on to achieve the best possible outcome."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At London's Royal Free hospital, scientists are growing noses, ears and blood vessels in the laboratory in a bold attempt to make body parts using stem cells. It is among several labs around the world, including in the U.S., that are working on the futuristic idea of growing custom-made organs in the lab. Only a handful of patients have received the British lab-made organs so far - including tear ducts, blood vessels and windpipes. But researchers hope they will soon be able to transplant more types of body parts into patients, including what would be the world's first nose made partly from stem cells. Scroll down for video. Last year Professor Alexander Seifalian (pictured) made a nose for a man who lost his to cancer. Scientists added a solution to the mould of the nose to mimic the sponge-like texture of the real thing. Stem cells were taken from the patient's fat and grown in the lab for two weeks before being used to cover the scaffold. 'It's like making a cake,' said Professor Alexander Seifalian at University College London, the scientist leading the effort. 'We just use a different kind of oven.' During a recent visit to his lab, Professor Seifalian showed off a sophisticated machine used to make moulds from a polymer material for various organs. Last year, he and his team made a nose for a British man who lost his to cancer. Scientists added a salt and sugar solution to the mould of the nose to mimic the somewhat sponge-like texture of the real thing. Stem cells were taken from the patient's fat and grown in the lab for two weeks before being used to cover the nose scaffold. Later, the nose was implanted into the man's forearm so that skin would grow to cover it. Dr Michelle Griffin (pictured) said ears are harder to make than noses because you have to get all the contours right and the skin is pulled tight so you see its entire structure. She is a plastic surgeon who has made dozens of ears and noses in Professor Seifalian's lab. Professor Seifalian said he and his team are waiting for approval from regulatory authorities to transfer the nose onto the patient's face but couldn't say when that might happen. The potential applications of lab-made organs appear so promising even the City of London is getting involved: Professor Seifalian's work is being showcased on Tuesday as Mayor Boris Johnson announces a new initiative to attract investment to Britain's health and science sectors. A British businessman who lost his nose to cancer is growing a new one – in his arm. If all goes well it will eventually be removed and sewn on to his face, with experts at University College London hoping he will have feeling and a sense of smell. The new nose, the first in the world to be grown from scratch, will also look just like the 56-year-old man’s old one – slightly crooked. UCL scientist Professor Alexander Seifalian, who is behind the pioneering treatment, said: ‘His nose was a little bit bent to the left and we asked if he wanted it straight but he said no, he wanted it exactly the same.’ The new nose began as a glass mould, based on the original, which was sprayed with a synthetic honeycomb-like material to create a framework for stem cells to cling to. The mould was then removed and the honey- comb covered with millions of these ‘blank cells’ which, with the right nutrients, can turn into the cartilage of the nose – a process which took place at UCL in a rotating jar called a bioreactor. Meanwhile, the skin on the man’s arm was gradually stretched by a small balloon placed under the surface and inflated until it was loose enough to accommodate the nose. Professor Alex Seifalian hopes to eventually grow a whole face in the lab and says procedure could help car crash victims and wounded soldiers. A synthetic polymer nose, left, and ear are shown at a research facility in the Royal Free Hospital in London. The polymer material used for his organ scaffolds has been patented and Professor Seifalian has also applied for patents for their blood vessels, tear ducts and windpipe. He and his team are creating other organs including coronary arteries and ears. Later this year, a trial is scheduled to start in India and London to test lab-made ears for people born without them. 'Ears are harder to make than noses because you have to get all the contours right and the skin is pulled tight so you see its entire structure,' said Dr Michelle Griffin, a plastic surgeon who has made dozens of ears and noses in Professor Seifalian's lab. Dr Michelle Griffin, a plastic research fellow, demonstrates seeding stem cells onto a synthetic polymer ear. Professor Alexander Seifalian described the process by saying: 'It's like making a cake. We just use a different kind of oven.' here he is pictured with the advanced 'oven' with an artificial windpipe inside it. The. new body part begins as a glass mould, based on the original, which is. sprayed with a synthetic honeycomb-like material to create a framework. for stem cells to cling to. The. mould is then removed and the honey- comb covered with millions of ‘blank cells’ which, with the right nutrients, can turn into the. cartilage of the organ. Meanwhile,. the skin on another area of the body is gradually stretched by a small balloon. placed under the surface and inflated until it is loose enough to. accommodate the organ. After several months, the body part is taken out from under the skin and sewn into the right place. 'At the moment, children who need new ears have to go through a really invasive procedure involving taking cartilage from their ribs,' Dr Griffin said. She added that taking fat cells from patients' abdomens to add to a lab-made ear scaffold would be far easier than the multiple procedures often necessary to carve an ear from their ribs. Dr Griffin said they plan to eventually create an entirely synthetic face but must first prove their polymer scaffolds won't accidentally burst out of the skin. 'Scientists have to get things like noses and ears right before we can move onto something like a kidney, lungs or a liver, which is much more complicated,' said Eileen Gentleman, a stem cell expert at King's College London, who is not involved in Seifalian's research. Professor Alexander Seifalian in his office at his research facility in the Royal Free Hospital in north London. 'Where Seifalian has led is in showing us maybe we don't need to have the absolutely perfect tissue for a (lab-made) organ to work,' she said. 'What he has created is the correct structure and the fact that it's good enough for his patients to have a functional (windpipe), tear duct, etc. is pretty amazing.' Some scientists predicted certain lab-made organs will soon cease to be experimental. 'I'm convinced engineered organs are going to be on the market soon,' said Suchitra Sumitran-Holgersson, a professor of transplantation biology at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. She has transferred lab-made blood vessels into a handful of patients and plans to offer them more widely by 2016, pending regulatory approval. Still, she acknowledged doctors will have to watch closely for any long-term side effects, including the possibility of a higher cancer risk. Professor Seifalian estimated about £10 million (16 million) has gone into his research since 2005 but said he hoped lab-made organs would one day be available for a few hundred dollars. 'If people are not that fussy, we could manufacture different sizes of noses so the surgeon could choose a size and tailor it for patients before implanting it,' he said. 'People think your nose is very individual and personal but this is something that we could mass produce like in a factory one day.'

The parents of a 14-year-old Utah girl who vanished on her way to school Monday morning are breathing a sigh of relief today after learning that she has been found safe. Sarah ‘Charice’ Beaumont, of Provo, was last seen at 8.30am as she left home on her way to Dixon Middle School. The teen never made it to class. Police were notified about her disappearance at around 3.30pm when the girl's parents, Brian and Jennifer Beaumont, discovered that she was not home. Found: Sarah Charice Beaumont (left and right), 14, was found safe more than 10 miles from home a day after she went missing on her way to school. Just before noon Tuesday, her family posted a message on a Facebook page that was created to help in the search letting everyone know that she has been found safe and sound. Provo police confirmed this information to MailOnline over the phone. The station KSL reported that the 14-year-old was located in Pleasant Grove over 10 miles away from her home. Police told the Daily Herald that when Sarah left for school, the teen rode her bike to Pleasant Grove and spent the night in a local church. This morning, the 14-year-old knocked on the door of a nearby home, asked to use a phone and called her mother. Provo police alerted Pleasant Grove police about the call, who dispatched officers to the church. The news comes after multiple search parties spent hours scouring Provo neighborhoods Monday night handing out pictures in an effort to find Sarah. Runaway: Police say instead of heading to school, Sarah rode her bike to a nearby town and spent the night there in a church. Desperate search: Volunteers spent hours scouring Provo handing out fliers in a bid to find the missing girl.

Q:Today, many academics feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. They’re under huge pressure to write and publish but an ever-growing mountain of teaching and admin is stopping them doing just that. Our research finds that whilst nobody is immune to these pressures, some academics cope better than others – and that’s because over the years, they’ve developed personal “systems” to help them write. We recently carried out in-depth interviews with 23 scholars across the UK, Europe and the US. We deliberately chose a diverse group so as to not make any assumptions based on age, seniority, or research background. Academic experience ranged from six months to 27 years and subject fields ranged from social sciences, economics, business, and arts. We did this as part of our user research to inform the development of Prolifiko – a digital coaching tool for writers. Whilst every academic had developed a writing productivity system personal to them, we found there were six common “habits” that the most prolific (and generally least stressed) academics tended to use. 1. They “time-block” their writing in advance Scheduling – booking in time to write in advance – was the single most common habit of our writers. It didn’t appear to matter what type of time-blocking method a scholar chose to use or how lengthy a writing session was. Some blocked out long periods of time on sabbatical, whilst others preferred to block out short, regular times throughout the day or across a week. What seemed to matter far more was the act of planning, as this mentally prepared the individual for writing – and so made the process easier and less stressful. “When I need to write I block out time. I’m lucky in that I can work from home – I block out a couple of straight days to do the writing and I plan it in beforehand. I couldn’t really write in any other way than blocking out that time.” How long had the academics surveyed been teaching?  A. 100 years  B. several years  C. 10 minutes  D. not enough information A:","output":"D. Not enough information The passage mentions that the academic experience of the scholars interviewed ranged from six months to 27 years, but it does not provide the exact duration of teaching experience for each academic surveyed.

There was interest in his ideas but they remained untested; this changed with the outbreak of the 1688-1697 Nine Years War which placed great emphasis on manoeuvre and siege warfare. Van Coehoorn was present at the capture of Kaiserswerth and Bonn in 1690; his exact role is unclear but Frederick of Prussia was impressed enough to offer him a position as Major-General in his army. He refused and in 1691 William appointed him commander of Namur where he was finally able to implement his ideas on defensive strategy. Namur was divided into the 'City' on the flat northern bank of the River Sambre and the Citadel on high ground to the south controlling access to the Sambre and Meuse rivers. Van Coehoorn strengthened the 'inner' Citadel with new outworks at Fort William and La Casotte but did not have time to do the same for the 'outer' City area. His garrison of 5,000  was also too small for the active defence he had planned, many being poorly-trained Spanish troops with little interest in fighting for the Dutch.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person that is asked to compose a melody? from the following article ?  During a choir practice two days before Christmas, village organist Franz Gruber is worried to hear unusual sounds from the church organ and suspects the bellows. One of Gruber's sons discovers mice in the pipes of the organ and the mice have chewed up parts of the organ. Without the organ the church choir cannot perform the rehearsed Bach piece because the music was written to be performed with an organ. Accompanied by both his sons, Gruber travels to Salzburg, hoping to buy spare parts and then mend the organ when returning to the village. The party is caught in a snow storm and the spare part is lost on the way home but pastor Joseph Mohr is simply thankful they are unharmed. Pastor Mohr (with a little help from the bell-ringer Otto) writes the lyrics for a song and the next morning he brings it to Gruber, asking him to compose a melody for the lyrics.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Tourists' selfie breaks statue from 1700 The main square in Cremona, Italy. (iStock) Hercules is no match for the dreaded selfie, apparently. A 300-year-old statue of the figure was busted in Cremona, Italy, by tourists trying to snap a selfie on Friday. The two visitors were reportedly climbing on the \\"Statue of the Two Hercules\\" at the historic Loggia dei Militi building when the large crown atop the marble sculpture broke off and fell to the ground, Italy's Corriere della Sera paper reports, per the Local. Experts were expected to assess the damage to the statue yesterday and determine what repairs are necessary, reports the Telegraph, which offers a before-and-after comparison. Police managed to track down the perpetrators on Sunday, though it isn't yet clear if they'll face any charges. The blow to this particular statue is especially painful for the city as the statue is considered a symbol of Cremona and once sat on top of the city's gates. Created in 1700, the sculpture depicts two forms of Hercules—who founded the city, according to legend, the Independent reports—holding the city's emblem, a large kind of shield. It was moved to Loggia dei Militi on Piazza del Comune, a square in the center of the city, in 1962. (A selfie-taking student broke a leg off an Italian statue last year.)

Write an article with the title: \\"Newt Gingrich signs border fence pledge during Iowa swing\\" Article:","output":"Title: Newt Gingrich signs border fence pledge during Iowa swing Introduction In a bid to strengthen his stance on border control, Republican presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich signed a border fence pledge during his campaign tour across the state of Iowa. While immigration policies have traditionally been a contentious topic in American politics, Gingrich's pledge reaffirms his commitment to securing the United States' borders amidst growing concerns over national security and economic uncertainty. Gingrich's Stance on Border Control Gingrich has long been vocal about his views on the importance of securing America's borders, particularly along the US-Mexico border. The former House speaker Washington, D.C., insider has positioned himself as a strong advocate of building a fence along the border, which he believes will significantly curb illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and potential terrorist threats. During his recent campaign swing in Iowa, Gingrich took the opportunity to amplify his commitment to border security by signing a border fence pledge - an official promise to prioritize the construction of a physically secure fence in the southern border region to deter illegal crossings. The pledge was organized by the We Build the Wall, a non-profit organization that focuses on raising funds for border wall construction. His decision to sign the pledge projects a clear message to his supporters and other political rivals. With border control being a top concern for many American voters, Gingrich's pledge is a strategic move to emphasize his dedication to protecting the nation's interests. Border Control Strategies Gingrich's border fence pledge outlines several strategies he would employ to complete the fence project, including: 1. Appointing a Border Security Czar: Statutorily endowed with the necessary authority and resources, this individual would be responsible for overseeing and expediting the construction of the fence and controlling illegal border crossings. 2. Utilizing Technology: Gingrich proposes employing high-tech and innovative methods, such as infrared cameras, drones, and virtual fencing, to facilitate a comprehensive approach to border security. 3. Engaging the National Guard: In addition to leveraging technology, Gingrich seeks to mobilize National Guard troops with an intended role of supporting border patrol agents in their mission to secure the borders. 4. Punishing Sanctuary Cities: To further deter illegal immigration, Gingrich proposes cutting federal funds for cities that harbor and aid undocumented immigrants. 5. Fast-tracking Legal Immigration: Gingrich acknowledges the need for a modernized legal immigration system and proposes a streamlined process to welcome highly-skilled and talented immigrants into the country. Conclusion Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's border fence pledge during his Iowa swing reaffirms his commitment to securing America's borders and restoring a sense of safety and security for the nation's citizens. By outlining a multi-pronged strategy involving technology, the National Guard, and targeted punitive measures against sanctuary cities, Gingrich demonstrates his dedication to solving the complex problem of illegal immigration. Although immigration remains a deeply divisive issue in American politics, Gingrich's pledge positions him as a candidate willing to fight for the protection of the country and its citizens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Grass and small plants grow in an area - These plants die - The soil gains organic material - The soil becomes more fertile - Larger plants are able to be supported - Trees eventually grow.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose soil becomes less fertile happens, how will it affect LESS forest formation.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The process you've described is an example of ecological succession, specifically primary succession, in which life colonizes and transforms an area over time. This process eventually leads to a stable, mature ecosystem, such as a forest, which is characterized by a rich diversity of plant, animal, and microbial communities. In the scenario you've mentioned, the following steps occur: 1. Grass and small plants grow in an area. 2. These plants die. 3. The soil gains organic material. 4. The soil becomes more fertile. 5. Larger plants are able to be supported. 6. Trees eventually grow. Now, let us examine the perturbation hypothesis: \\"Suppose soil becomes less fertile, how will it affect LESS forest formation?\\" In this hypothetical scenario, a decrease in soil fertility would have both direct and indirect effects on the process of ecological succession and thus on forest formation. The direct effects of reduced soil fertility would primarily involve the growth and survival of plant species in the affected area. Lower soil fertility typically leads to slower plant growth and reduced productivity, as there would be fewer nutrients available for plants to take up and utilize. In turn, this could lead to a decrease in overall biomass accumulation in the area, as the plants' limited nutrient resources would negatively impact their ability to grow and reproduce effectively. As a result, the development of a lush, established plant community would be greatly hampered, delaying the formation of a mature forest ecosystem. Indirectly, reduced soil fertility could also affect various ecological processes and factors associated with the proposed process of succession. For instance, the lower plant productivity and diversity could have cascading effects on the local food web, limiting the availability of resources for herbivores and consequently impacting the entire community structure. Additionally, slower plant growth would also mean that the rate at which the soil gains organic material would decrease, further exacerbating the problem of low fertility. Furthermore, the reduced plant growth and community development could leave the area more susceptible to various disturbances, such as erosion, invasive species, or even human activities. These disturbances could potentially set back the progression of ecological succession, delaying or even reversing the process in some cases. In conclusion, the perturbation in soil fertility would have both direct and indirect effects on the process of ecological succession, leading to less forest formation. Direct effects would involve reduced plant growth and productivity, while indirect effects would encompass changes to the local food web, susceptibility to disturbances, and slowed soil enrichment. These combined effects would negatively impact the overall progression of succession and hinder the development of a mature forest ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A decision is made to have Oliver sold into service. Bumble parades Oliver through the snow, trying to sell him to the highest bidder (\\"Boy for Sale\\"). Oliver is sold to an undertaker named Mr. Sowerberry, who intends to use him as a mourner for children's funerals. After his first funeral, Noah Claypole, Sowerberry's apprentice, insults Oliver's mother. Oliver attacks Noah in fury and Sowerberry forces him into a coffin while Noah fetches Bumble. Oliver is too angry to be intimidated by Bumble, who places the blame on not keeping Oliver on a diet of gruel, instead of meat, which made him strong.

Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: How do Dr. Marvin and Carol celebrate? going to their favorite beach The answer is:","output":"Title: Waves of Celebration Genre: Romantic Comedy-Drama Plot: Dr. Marvin Jenkins, a renowned marine biologist, and his wife Carol, a passionate marine conservationist, have just reached their milestone 25th wedding anniversary. They both work for the Ocean Preservation, an organization dedicated to researching and conserving marine ecosystems, and they share a deep love for each other and the ocean. The movie starts with Dr. Marvin finishing a breakthrough project at work alongside his team. He successfully develops a new method to rehabilitate and replenish coral reefs, which have been in decline due to climate change. As a result, he gets massive recognition from the scientific community. On the other hand, Carol has been leading a campaign to reduce plastic waste and its impact on marine life. Recently, she managed to convince multiple corporations to phase out single-use plastic from their products, thus having a significant impact on plastic waste reduction. As they face challenges and triumphs in their respective careers, they decide to celebrate their silver anniversary and their love for each other by going back to their favorite spot, Cape Paradise Beach, where they met and fell in love while working on a marine conservation project. The beach has a sentimental value to them, and they wanted to reminisce their early days, adventures, and everlasting love. Upon reaching the beach, they find it in a dire state, suffering from the impacts of pollution and negligence. It has become a reflection of the challenges the marine ecosystem has faced in recent years. This strikes a chord with them, and instead of letting this dampen their spirits, they see the opportunity to bring together their knowledge, skills, and passion to restore the beauty of Cape Paradise Beach. They organize a huge clean-up event, inviting volunteers – young and old, locals – including their friends, and even some of their students and colleagues. They turn the clean-up event into a festive occasion, with food, music, workshops, and interactive wildlife education sessions. As they work to clean the beach, they also work on their relationship by rekindling the spark that has begun to fade over time. They rediscover the joy of sharing their dreams, appreciating each other's accomplishments, and understanding the challenges they face every day to protect the ocean and its inhabitants. During the clean-up event, they encounter a young couple, Jack and Emma, who are marine biologists overlooked by the current generation's fast-paced life, and they mentor and inspire them to fight for the marine ecosystem together. Dr. Marvin and Carol see themselves in Jack and Emma, reminding them of the early days of their love story. As the beach gradually transforms into its former glory, Dr. Marvin and Carol decide to initiate a project together that combines his expertise in coral reef rehabilitation and her experience in marine waste reduction. At Cape Paradise Beach, they establish a marine research and conservation center dedicated to preserving the ocean and the beautiful memories they've created. After weeks of hard work, they finally celebrate their anniversary, surrounded by newfound friends and the shimmering sea. They organize a beautiful sunset ceremony in which they renew their vows of love and partnership, not only to each other but also to the ocean and its inhabitants. As the movie ends, we see Jack and Emma step into roles as new rising stars in marine conservation, guided by their mentors, Dr. Marvin and Carol. The beach had not only served as the location for their celebrations, but it had also reminded them of their commitment to make a lasting impact on the environment. The film closes with a beautiful scene of the couple walking hand in hand along the beach, leaving footprints behind on the pristine sand, a symbol of their everlasting love for each other and the ocean."},{"instruction":"Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write highlights for this article: By. Catherine Townsend. PUBLISHED:. 16:09 EST, 26 March 2013. |. UPDATED:. 09:08 EST, 27 March 2013. There's an old saying that claims behind. every great man is a great woman. According to Xerox CEO Ursula Burns,. the reverse is also true. In fact, she says the 'secret' of her success. was marrying a man 20 years older than her. Burns's husband Lloyd Bean also worked for Xerox as a scientist and researcher, but she was the real star. The engineering. hotshot started as a summer intern at Xerox and rose rapidly through. the ranks to become the first African-American female CEO. Behind every great woman... Xerox CEO Ursula Burns, who was named Forbes' 14th most powerful woman in the world in 2009, says she owes her success to her older husband. In 2009,. Forbes magazine called her the 14th most powerful woman in the world,. and she's credited with helping bring the company back from the dead. But it. seems that Burns, who was known for challenging conventional wisdom at. work, wasn't afraid to do the same in her personal life. She saw her. husband's age as an advantage instead of an obstacle because, according. to The Wall Street Journal, he 'had already gone through this 'growing. up' stuff. Often, stories. about massive age gaps feature pictures of Ronnie Wood or Hugh Hefner. holding hands with women young enough to be their daughters. But Burns. isn't the only ambitious women to discover out that an older man's. assets go way beyond the size of his wallet. Older men are biologically wired to be more nurturing. As someone raised by a single mom in a Lower East Side housing project, this was undoubtedly an important quality to Burns. Her mother ironed shirts and ran a day care center - making only 4,400 in her best year - to raise the funds to send her girls to a private Catholic school. Power couple: Catherine Townsend, pictured with her husband Peter Katsis on their wedding day, agrees that older men are more supportive to an ambitious woman. When Burns began studying engineering at Columbia University, her goal was to eventually support her mother. As her career and travel schedule became more demanding, her husband was able to retire and help raise their children (Burns has a daughter and a stepson). Older men are also more emotionally bonded to their partners because testosterone begins to decrease after 40, while levels of the 'cuddle' chemical oxytocin stays steady. This is why the ruthless CEO who was out the door at 35 wants to spoon after sex once he hits 50. It's also why first families get so annoyed when the man who was MIA becomes a doting husband and father the second time around. I'm not in the same league as Burns when it comes to my career, but I did marry a man 20 years older than me. As a writer who climbed the ranks from intern to newspaper columnist and later author, having a supportive partner has been crucial to my continued success. It wasn't always this way: In the past, my love life and career success seemed to be inversely proportional. I was attracted to successful, charismatic, ambitious men whom I considered my peers and went through dozens of 'Mr. Bigs'. But the ones I would consider setting up home with often didn't consider me wife material. The men I dated either became competitive professionally or expected me to have a more traditional, stay-at-home role.One ex, a banker, offered to pay me the yearly equivalent of my biggest-ever salary if I relocated with him to Hong Kong to be there for him when he got home from work. 'Don't worry darling,' he said, 'you can still do your writing as a hobby.' Sadly, the assumption that my career should take a backseat to theirs wasn't uncommon. 'I was rooting for her. There's no way you could try to hold somebody like that back' Lloyd Bean, husband of Ursula Burns. Everything changed when I met Peter, a handsome and successful music manager 20 years older than me. At first, the age difference seemed. like the least obvious red flag. He had never been married, had a. reputation for partying like the rock stars he managed, and brought. several scantily-clad twenty-somethings to our first dinner date. But. after being hyper-focused on work and his next conquest throughout his. thirties and forties, he was now ready to ditch the entourage and focus. all of his attention on me. His age was a plus because, like. Burns's husband, he was ready to grow up. So I married him, and now I. have the best of both worlds: a man who is successful enough to. understand my ambition, while at the same time happy to let me have the. spotlight. Super women: Both Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman (left) and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg (right) have openly spoken of how their husbands' support has been crucial to their careers. Other high-profile females have spoken out about the importance of choosing the right partner. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg has openly praised her husband's willingness to split childcare and housework. And for some power couples like Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman, whose neurosurgeon husband Griffith Harsh IV moved from Harvard to California when she became CEO of eBay, the secret seems to be prioritizing and compromise. So for ambitious women, it seems that the most important factor isn't a partner's age. It's his attitude. 'I was rooting for her,' Bean told CNN when asked how he felt about his wife's career eclipsing his own. 'There's no way you could try to hold somebody like that back.' Most successful people have learned the importance of picking the right person on the job. But since relationships can build us up or tear us down every day, the most important member of the team is the one waiting for us at home.

Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. Question: What is most probably the case regarding why Trump did not make payment to the adult star directly? === The answer to the above question is Available choices: [a]. the payment was made without his knowledge.

Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, and dancer. Dubbed the \\"King of Pop\\", he is widely regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century and one of the greatest entertainers of all time. He was also known for his unorthodox lifestyle, residing in a private amusement park he called Neverland Ranch, and often becoming the focus of tabloid scrutiny. Jackson's contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades.  The eighth child of the Jackson family, Michael made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5. He began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records, and in the early 1980s, became a dominant figure in popular music. His music videos, including those for \\"Beat It\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", and \\"Thriller\\" from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool.

Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

Soon after his arrival, strange things start to happen:01 - Animals follow Evan without any apparent reason. 02 - He grows a beard that is restored wholly every time he shaves. 03 - Eight vacant lots in Evan's neighborhood are purchased in his name. 04 - Ancient tools and wood are sent to his house. 05 - The number \\"614\\" appears everywhere he goes.Evan soon learns that the number indicates a verse in the book of Genesis, in which God instructs Noah to build an ark. Later, God (Morgan Freeman) appears and commands Evan to build a replica of Noah's Ark in preparation for a deluge. His family initially believe that he is having an extraordinary mid-life crisis; later, his sons suspect that something greater is occurring and assist him in the construction of the ark, although his wife Joan (Lauren Graham) does not. Reappearing, God tells Evan the flood will come at noon on September 22.Animals later follow Evan to Congress. When he explains the reason for this, Chuck Long suspends him. Upon Evan's departure, some birds poop on Chuck. Joan, upon seeing a news report that features the Ark, takes their three sons to her mother's house, thinking to abandon Evan. Evan then builds the Ark alone, gaining international notice. Some time after Joan leaves Evan, God appears to her as a waiter at a diner, wearing a name tag displaying \\"Al Mighty\\" (a play on \\"almighty\\"). In this guise, He tells her that God does not give things, but only the opportunity by which to obtain things, citing togetherness of families as one of these things. Seeing His meaning, Joan returns to Evan to finish the ark together. Meanwhile, word reaches Evan that Chuck Long has commissioned a dam and has cut corners in doing so.On September 22, Evan loads hundreds of animals onto the newly finished ark in front of live news crews and nearby citizens. Minutes pass wherein is no sign of rain, provoking the spectators' scorn. When a rainstorm is briefly present, Evan takes this as a sign of the coming deluge, but is proven wrong. Joan tells Evan to leave the ark; Evan, however, remembers Congressman Long's dam, which he fears may burst. As he thinks on this, the dam does burst, flooding the streets. At this, all spectators and policeman board the ark, which sails down the streets of Washington D.C. on the floodwaters of the lake until it eventually lands touching the front of the Capitol. Evan then tells Long that the flood was caused by his poor design of the dam, which incites the other congressmen present to turn against Long.As investigations on Chuck Long are occurring, Evan and his family later go on a hiking trip, during which God reappears to Evan, telling him that the way to change the world is by doing one Act of Random Kindness (\\"ARK\\") at a time.

Examples of bromates include sodium bromate,, and potassium bromate,.  - An oxoacid is an acid that contains oxygen. Specifically, it is a compound that contains hydrogen, oxygen, and at least one other element, with at least one hydrogen atom bound to oxygen that can dissociate to produce the H cation and the anion of the acid.  - Bromic acid, also known as hydrogen bromate, is an oxoacid with the molecular formula HBrO. It only exists in aqueous solution. It is a colorless solution that turns yellow at room temperature as it decomposes to bromine. Bromic acid and bromates are powerful oxidizing agents and are common ingredients in Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions. Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions are a classic example of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.  - Calcium bromate , Ca ( BrO3 ) 2 , is a salt of bromic acid and lime . It may be prepared by the anodic oxidation of calcium bromide . It is used as a flour improver ( E number E924b ) in some countries .  - Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with physical systems that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium but can adequately be described in terms of variables (non-equilibrium state variables) that represent an extrapolation of the variables used to specify the system in thermodynamic equilibrium. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is concerned with transport processes and with the rates of chemical reactions. It relies on what may be thought of as more or less nearness to thermodynamic equilibrium. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a work in progress, not an established edifice. This article will try to sketch some approaches to it and some concepts important for it.  - Bromine is a chemical element with symbol Br and atomic number 35. It is the third-lightest halogen, and is a fuming red-brown liquid at room temperature that evaporates readily to form a similarly coloured gas. Its properties are thus intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine. Isolated independently by two chemists, Carl Jacob Löwig (in 1825) and Antoine Jérôme Balard (in 1826), its name was derived from the Ancient Greek \\"\\" \\"stench\\", referencing its sharp and disagreeable smell.  - An aqueous solution is a solution in which the solvent is water. It is usually shown in chemical equations by appending (aq) to the relevant chemical formula. For example, a solution of table salt, or sodium chloride (NaCl), in water would be represented as Na(aq) + Cl(aq). The word \\"aqueous\\" means pertaining to, related to, similar to, or dissolved in water. As water is an excellent solvent and is also naturally abundant, it is a ubiquitous solvent in chemistry.

Sporting leagues also hope that the expansion of their competition will grow the popularity of the sport generally. The term is most commonly used in reference to the North American major professional sports leagues but is applied to sports leagues in other countries with a closed franchise system of league membership. The term comes from the expansion of the sport into new areas. That sometimes results in the payment of an expansion fee to the league by the new team and an expansion draft to populate the new roster.  - The Calgary Tigers, often nicknamed the \\"Bengals\\", were an ice hockey team based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada from 1920 until 1927 as members of the Big Four League, Western Canada Hockey League and Prairie Hockey League.

The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game.

Options are: A). yes; B). it is not possible to tell; C). no;","output":"A). Yes It logically follows that \\"an old man is skateboarding\\". This conclusion is drawn from the details provided in the initial statement: \\"A senior citizen man in a jogging suit is skateboarding.\\" Here's a breakdown of why it logically follows: 1. \\"Senior citizen\\" refers to elderly or old individuals. The term \\"senior citizen\\" is culturally and socially accepted to denote people who are in their golden or twilight years. Generally, these are individuals who are retired or past the usual age of retirement, commonly over the age of 60, depending on different countries' definitions. 2. \\"Man\\" confirms the given gender of the individual involved in the activity. This signals that the senior citizen we are talking about is male. 3. The fact that the senior citizen is in a \\"jogging suit\\" and \\"skateboarding\\" indicates the action this person is doing. It indicates his clothing but it does not change the fact that he is an old or senior man. Therefore, the statement \\"A senior citizen man in a jogging suit is skateboarding\\" can be logically simplified to \\"an old man is skateboarding,\\" because the person in question is indeed male, elderly (based on the reference to him as a \\"senior citizen\\"), and is participating in the act of skateboarding. All the extra information like him wearing a jogging suit is not contradictory but merely descriptive, and does not affect the accuracy of the core assertion that an old man is skateboarding."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: The ripped Russian weightlifter who looks like a doll but can bench-press 120kg THIS stunning self-confessed Muscle Barbie would leave even Ken red-faced at the squat rack. Russian fitness star Julia Vins has 325,000 followers on Instagram thanks to her cute, doll-like face and extraordinary, muscle-popping body. The 20-year-old has already broken records at the World Powerlifting Congress – squatting 215kg, bench pressing 120kg, and dead-lifting 190kg – all with a pink bow in her hair. Julia, who is from Engels in the Saratov region, said: “I was going to the gym just to get fit for a year when I turned 15, but I didn’t know anything about weights so I just found the biggest guy in the gym and repeated exercises after him. “For me it’s very cool to be a role model. Many young girls in Russia make a big mistake and use steroids, which changes their voice and face. “I’m proof to everyone that you can be cute and lift big weights at the same time without using steroids.” She says her boyfriend of four years, who coaches Julia, is very supportive – but not all blokes have been as encouraging about her profession. She added: “My boyfriend is my coach and it is because of him that I have achieved significant success in powerlifting already. “We met when I was 16 and I was at the initial stage of my career, and together we have come to what I have now. “Some men can be intimidated by me and there are many people who wonder around me at the gym when I lift such heavy weights. \\"I don't show my strength on the street though. Many men say to me, 'With your face you could be a model, why have you disfigured your body?' \\"But often these comments are made by men who are not happy with their lives and own achievements so I don't care about their opinion. \\"I guess that society's view of women will not change in Russia anytime soon. There are a lot of people who still think that the only function of the woman is cooking and cleaning the house. \\"When I have travelled in Europe and Asia, I have noticed that people are more respectful to me and even if they don't like what I do, they still respect my choice. \\"I know a lot of women with a feminine body, but they behave disgustingly and it doesn't attract men at all.” Thanks to Julia’s Barbie doll image, complete with pigtails and buns, she has also landed modelling jobs in the video gaming industry. The pro-powerlifter said it has been far from easy to reject society’s expectations of her and become fully independent as an athlete so young. While many Russians live with their parents until they are 30, Julia moved out ‘a long time’ ago. She said: \\"In Russia there are a lot of stereotypes, such as everyone should have a degree, but I left my university for the sake of my career and I'm very happy that I did. \\"My parents did not support my idea but sometimes, in order to build a happy life, you need to sacrifice all that you have. \\"Besides, I need to keep my daily regimen and diet, it's much easier to do it while living apart from my parents.\\" It is hardly surprising Julia boasts the muscular frame she does given her commitment to the weights room and diet. She added: \\"I have training seven times per week and I never take a break. Even when I travel I continue to go to the gym because I feel bad when I'm not being active, this is my way of life. \\"I live in a small town in Russia, so I don't have a vast choice of food, my diet just consists of buckwheat, rice, oatmeal, eggs, chicken, beef and vegetables. \\"In the summer we have a lot of vegetables, but in winter it is often frozen broccoli and green beans, I also take a lot of sport nutrition supplements.” She may love protein shakes but Julia blasts claims that she owes her hulking muscles to steroid abuse and is happy for doubters to challenge her claim. Julia said: \\"I know many do not believe it, but I'm always open to talk about it, and anyone can come to me for training. \\"Also, I always suggest to people who do not believe that they pay me for doping control but for some reason they always refus \\"My family are proud of me for what I've achieved in powerlifting and my mum has helped me throughout my life which I'm really grateful to her for. \\"I don't really talk to many of my old friends because I don't like their attitude to life and I do not think that communication with them is meaningful. \\"Now my entourage consists of intelligent and successful people who I've learned a lot from. \\"Building muscle wasn't my main goal at all – I even thought that it would be impossible, I just liked to lift heavy weights, which is why I still do it. \\"I get thousands of interesting comments from people from around the world.” Summary:","output":"Russian fitness star and powerlifter Julia Vins, dubbed \\"Muscle Barbie\\", boasts 325,000 followers on Instagram thanks to her unique combination of a doll-like face and muscular body.

If you can stomach the idea, try to be completely true to yourself from the very get-go through all the stages of a relationship: asking someone out, going on your first few dates, getting to know each other more closely, committing to each other, and beyond! By doing this, you give your partner the chance to fall in love with the real you, rather than forcing them to \\"hold on\\" until you're comfortable being yourself. The path to finding your life partner can seem like a perilous one. It can seem like there's almost no hope you'll find someone who's right for you, especially if you've recently had to deal with romantic setbacks. No matter what you do, don't ever give up hope or give in to the fear that you won't find someone. People all over the world struggle with the same sorts of romantic difficulties that you may be going through right now. Everyone periodically has personal setbacks. There's no single \\"right way\\"  to find your life partner, so don't judge yourself against other people or couples. Don't let negative thoughts derail your quest to find a life partner. Confidence, fearlessness, and persistence are key to finding the right person for you! As an added bonus, confidence is generally considered quite sexy! Fearless confidence is a self-reinforcing trait that makes you much more attractive to potential partners: the more confidently you approach dating situations, the more relaxed you'll be during them, the better time you'll have, and the more confident you'll be when you approach the next situation.","output":"The article underlines the importance of proactive effort in finding a life partner, advocating socializing in new environments, exploring shared interests, being authentic from the outset of relationships, maintaining hope and confidence despite setbacks, and as it ultimately aids in attracting potential partners."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Well, apparently, our general happiness. Psychologists say that what we are called has a direct connection with our well-being  .       Those called Judy and Joshua are the happiest, while Lynn or Ben is likely to be the unhappiest, according to research. Psychologist Dr David Holmes found that this might due to the association that others made with the name. Hearing the name Judy may make them think of actress Judi Dench or TV presenter Judy Finnigan, people who are seen as good natured and happy. On the other hand, people think Paulines are unhappy because of the character Pauline Fowler from the TV programme East Enders. The research claims that this association influences the person with the name and so their personality becomes shaped to fit it. Dr David Holmes said, \\"This also has some relation with the original meaning of the name. For example, the original meaning of Judy is 'praised'.\\"      Certain names also work well in certain aspects of life. In the workplace Richard and Judy are happiest, while those called Ruth and Carly are happiest in relationships. At the other end of the scale the unhappiest workers are Stuart and Liz, with the unhappiest in relationships being Frank and Harriet.         Dr Holmes said, \\"The relation we have with certain names, particularly important namesakes , also shapes how we see ourselves and so may have an effect on our confidence. Names are like product brands in having a powerful effect on attitudes and should therefore be chosen with care.\\"       \\"Other names are connected with being brave, outgoing or serious. Therefore, many celebrities change their names to ones which reflect these characteristics. This, in turn, influences parents when they choose names for their babies,\\" said Dr Holmes, \\"however, names connected with ordinary people are seldom chosen for their babies\\". Question: What's the main idea of this passage? Options: A: How to choose a good name for babies. B: How to achieve success by changing a good name. C: The relation between names and success.

We have the equation: 868 * x = 467 * x + 802 We want to find the value of \\"x\\" that makes this equation true.

The coffee that Michael makes is usually weaker than that of Logan because  Pick your answer from: (1). Michael uses more grounds.. (2). Logan uses more grounds..","output":"(2). Logan uses more grounds. The coffee that Michael makes is usually weaker than that of Logan because Logan uses more grounds. Logan's love for the rich and bold flavor of coffee has led him to experiment with various coffee beans and brewing techniques over the years. His passion and experience gave him a particular edge over Michael, who tended to rely on basic recipes and coffee-making methods. Logan's choice of using more grounds per cup of water directly impacted the flavor of the coffee he brewed. With a deeper understanding of the perfect coffee-to-water ratio, he discovered that using more grounds produced a stronger and more flavorful cup. This methodology made his coffee taste fuller and more robust than Michael's, who often underestimates the importance of the coffee grounds and their effect on the final result. Being an enthusiastic coffee connoisseur, Logan also appreciated the value of high-quality beans. He made sure to purchase beans from reputable sources and roast them just before grinding them to a precise consistency. Michael, on the other hand, wasn't as particular about his choice of beans. He would typically buy pre-ground coffee from the supermarket, which did not hold the same freshness or flavor as Logan's freshly ground beans. Moreover, Logan had a knack for finding the best brewing method for each type of coffee bean. He was continually refining his techniques to draw out the unique flavors and nuances of different varieties. Michael, on the other hand, always used a basic drip coffee maker. While it was convenient and straightforward, it could not compete with the results of Logan's more hands-on techniques, such as the pour-over or French press method. When it came down to it, Michael's coffee was not terrible by any means. However, it was always lighter and more watery than Logan's, which boasted an unmistakable intensity and rich flavor. Their friends certainly noticed the difference when they were invited over for a cup and would often tease Michael about his inferior brew. Eventually, Michael became curious about Logan's methods and decided to ask him for some pointers. Surprised that he had taken such an interest, Logan agreed to teach Michael the art of making the perfect cup of coffee. They spent many afternoons together, perfecting Michael's technique and searching for the ideal coffee-to-water ratio. In time, Michael began to appreciate the intricacies of coffee making and started to develop a genuine passion for the craft. With Logan's guidance, he explored new beans, experimented with different grinding consistencies, and even invested in a better coffee maker. As Michael continued to improve his skills, the friendly competition between him and Logan only grew stronger. They would often host coffee-tasting parties, where friends would come to sample their latest brews and vote on their favorite. Though Logan's coffee still reigned supreme, Michael's newfound expertise gradually narrowed the gap separating their brews. In the end, the two friends bonded over their mutual love for coffee, sharing tips and techniques while perfecting their craft. Michael's days of weaker coffee were behind him, and even though Logan's brew remained the crowd favorite, Michael was now able to serve a cup of coffee he was proud of. Their friendly rivalry not only enhanced their knowledge and enjoyment of coffee but also deepened their friendship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Excessive focus on unimportant details: The reviewer notes that the author spends too much time describing minor aspects such as food and pets, which could be seen as unnecessary and make the narrative feel tedious. 4. Unlikable secondary characters: The reviewer expresses their dislike for other characters in the book, contributing to an overall negative experience. 5.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  The director of the musical.  for the following movie plot:  In 1927, silent film star George Valentin is posing for pictures outside the premiere of his latest hit film when a young woman, Peppy Miller, accidentally bumps into him. Valentin reacts with humor to the accident and shows off with Peppy for the cameras. The next day, Peppy finds herself on the front page of Variety with the headline \\"Who's That Girl?\\" Later, Peppy auditions as a dancer and is spotted by Valentin, who insists that she have a part in Kinograph Studios' next production, despite objections from the studio boss, Al Zimmer. While performing a scene in which they dance together, Valentin and Peppy show great chemistry, despite her being merely an extra. With a little guidance from Valentin (he draws a beauty spot on her, which will eventually be her trademark, after finding her in his dressing room), Peppy slowly rises through the industry, earning more prominent starring roles. Two years later, Zimmer announces the end of production of silent films at Kinograph Studios, but Valentin is dismissive, insisting that sound is just a fad. In a dream, Valentin begins hearing sounds from his environment (as does the audience), but cannot speak himself, then wakes up in a sweat. He decides to produce and direct his own silent film, financing it himself. The film opens on the same day as Peppy's new sound film as well as the 1929 Stock Market Crash. Now Valentin's only chance of avoiding bankruptcy is for his film to be a hit. Unfortunately audiences flock to Peppy's film instead and Valentin is ruined. His wife, Doris, kicks him out, and he moves into an apartment with his valet/chauffeur, Clifton, and his dog. Peppy goes on to become a major Hollywood star. Later, the bankrupt Valentin is forced to auction off all of his personal effects, and after realizing he has not paid loyal Clifton in over a year, gives him the car and fires him, telling him to get another job.

Subsequent negotiations led by Jesuit papal legate Antonio Possevino resulted in the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski between Russia and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. This was a humiliation for the Tsar, in part because he requested the truce. Under the agreement Russia would surrender all areas in Livonia it still held and the city of Dorpat to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, while Polotsk would remain under Commonwealth control. Any captured Swedish territory—specifically Narva—could be retained by the Russians and Velike Luki would be returned from Batory's control to Russia. Possevino made a half-hearted attempt to get John III's wishes taken into consideration, but this was vetoed by the Tsar, probably in collusion with Batory. The armistice, which fell short of a full peace arrangement, was to last ten years and was renewed twice, in 1591 and 1601. Batory failed in his attempts to pressure Sweden into relinquishing its gains in Livonia, particularly Narva. Following a decision by John, the war with Russia ended when the Tsar concluded the Truce of Plussa  with Sweden on 10 August 1583. Russia relinquished most of Ingria but left Narva and Ivangorod under Swedish control. Originally scheduled to last three years, the Russo-Swedish truce was later extended until 1590.

In 2015 which London museum rejected the Thatcher family’s offer to display memorabilia belonging to the former Prime Minister?","output":"In 2015, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London rejected the Thatcher family's offer to display memorabilia belonging to the former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The offer included a collection of more than 350 items linked to the late Prime Minister's life, career, and personal wardrobe. These items encompassed her clothing, jewelry, awards, ceremonial gowns, and accessories, as well as significant historical documents and photographs that represent her time in office. The Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) is a well-known cultural institution in London that showcases an extensive range of applied arts, including fashion, ceramics, sculpture, photography, and textiles. Despite the collection's relevance to these disciplines, the V&A issued a statement declining the offer. The museum clarified that their decision was based on the substantial volume of political memorabilia associated with Margaret Thatcher, more than the textiles and clothing pieces that would fit into their collection. Their statement read, \\"The V&A politely declined the offer of Baroness Thatcher's clothes, feeling that these records of Britain's political history were best suited to another collection which would focus on their intrinsic social historical value. The museum is responsible for chronicling fashionable dress and maintains a collection of 20th-century model political figures who are known for their style – such as Joan, Viscountess of Dalziel, wife of a Conservative MP in the 1930s.” However, some perceived the refusal as a political snub, considering Margaret Thatcher’s controversial legacy. The public opinion about her tenure was divided, as she implemented significant economic and policy reforms during her time in office. The one silver lining for the Thatcher family came later in 2015 when the former Prime Minister's personal items were sold through an auction at Christie's, fetching over £4.5 million, much higher than the estimated value. Some of these items were eventually purchased by the UK government, with plans to save them for the nation and to be displayed in several institutions and museums such as the Churchill Archives Centre located in Cambridge and The Bowes Museum located in County Durham."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

(HLNtv.com) -- The father of two Southern California children who went missing after their mother was killed pleaded Tuesday for their suspected abductor to release his daughter.  A massive manhunt is under way for James DiMaggio, whom law enforcement authorities describe as a friend of the mother, Christina Anderson.  The whereabouts of Anderson's children, Hannah, 16, and Ethan, 8, are unknown. Investigators believe they may be with DiMaggio, 40, the owner and sole resident of the burned home where Anderson's body was found, along with the unidentified remains of a child.  \\"Jim, I can't fathom what you were thinking.

Question: Question: \\"How are the seasons between the Northern and Southern hemisphere different?\\"  Context: \\"Beginning and ending dates are roughly the reverse in the southern hemisphere. For example, mainland Chile observed DST from the second Saturday in October to the second Saturday in March, with transitions at 24:00 local time. The time difference between the United Kingdom and mainland Chile could therefore be five hours during the Northern summer, three hours during the Southern summer and four hours a few weeks per year because of mismatch of changing dates.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The seasons between the Northern and Southern hemispheres are different primarily due to the Earth's axial tilt and its orbit around the Sun. This results in each hemisphere experiencing a contrasting pattern of sunlight intensity and duration throughout the year, leading to variations in temperature, weather, and daylight hours. The beginning and ending dates of the seasons are roughly the reverse in the Southern hemisphere compared to the Northern hemisphere. Let's dive deeper into the differences between the Northern and Southern hemisphere seasons: 1. Seasonal Dates: In the Northern hemisphere, the winter solstice (shortest day of the year) occurs around December 21, while the summer solstice (longest day of the year) takes place around June 21. The opposite is true for the Southern hemisphere, with the winter solstice happening around June 21 and the summer solstice around December 21. 2. Climate and Weather: The Northern hemisphere experiences cold winters with snow, ice, and freezing temperatures in many regions. This is due to the reduced amount of sunlight received during this period. The Southern hemisphere, on the other hand, is generally warmer during its winter season, especially near the equator. In the Northern hemisphere, summers are marked by warm temperatures, longer daylight hours, and increased humidity, whereas in the Southern hemisphere, summers can be incredibly hot with intense sunlight. 3. Daylight Hours: As the Earth revolves around the Sun, the axial tilt causes daylight hours to vary for both hemispheres. The Northern hemisphere typically experiences longer days during the summer months, while the Southern hemisphere, by contrast, has longer days during its winter months. 4. Time Difference: The differences in daylight saving time practices cause varying time differences between countries located in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. For example, the time difference between the United Kingdom (located in the Northern hemisphere) and mainland Chile (located in the Southern hemisphere) can be five hours during the Northern summer, three hours during the Southern summer, and four hours during certain weeks of the year due to variations in date changes for daylight saving time. This means that countries in the Southern hemisphere observe daylight saving time at different times than those in the Northern hemisphere, leading to a mismatch of time zones throughout the year. 5. Flora and Fauna: The difference in seasons between the Northern and Southern hemispheres affects the growth cycles of plants, as well as the reproductive and migration patterns of animals. Many plants and animals have adapted to the changes in temperature and daylight hours in their respective hemispheres. This results in unique ecosystems and biodiversity found in different geographic locations around the world. In conclusion, the differences in seasons between the Northern and Southern hemispheres arise from the Earth's axial tilt and orbit around the Sun. This leads to varying patterns of sunlight, temperatures, weather, and daylight hours, ultimately shaping the unique climates, ecosystems, and time differences between the two hemispheres."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The paragraph states that modern phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) is indeed typically time-resolved, giving it the ability to demonstrate flow velocities and functionally serve as a method of Magnetic Resonance Velocimetry. However, the paragraph refers to it as 4D imaging, not 3D imaging, as stated in the hypothesis. The key distinction here is the inclusion of time as a factor. The term 4D imaging refers to the three spatial dimensions (length, width, and height) combined with time as the fourth dimension. The time-resolved nature of modern PC-MRI allows for the observation of changes and movement within the three spatial dimensions over time. Thus, it provides a comprehensive and dynamic view of the anatomical or physiological processes being imaged. In contrast, 3D imaging only considers the three spatial dimensions without accounting for the time factor. While it can offer detailed information on the structure and volume of a certain region, it does not provide insights into how the imaged structures change or function over time. To conclude, the hypothesis is partially correct: modern PC-MRI is typically time-resolved. However, it should instead be referred to as 4D imaging, as it includes both three spatial dimensions and the temporal dimension, rather than 3D imaging, which encompasses only the three spatial dimensions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve this math problem Solve 358*n + 524*n - 62510 = 166*n - 614*n for n.","output":"To solve the equation 358*n + 524*n - 62510 = 166*n - 614*n for n, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on each side of the equation. On the left side of the equation, we have two terms with the variable n: 358*n and 524*n. We can combine these by adding their coefficients: (358 + 524)*n = 882*n On the right side of the equation, we have two terms with the variable n: 166*n and -614*n. We can combine these by adding their coefficients: (166 + -614)*n = -448*n So now our equation becomes: 882*n - 62510 = -448*n Step 2: Isolate the variable n by adding 448*n to both sides of the equation. To get all terms with n on one side of the equation, we need to add 448*n to both sides. This will cancel out the -448*n term on the right side: 882*n + 448*n - 62510 = -448*n + 448*n On the left side, the combined result is (882 + 448)*n = 1330*n, so the equation becomes: 1330*n - 62510 = 0 Step 3: Isolate the constant term by adding 62510 to both sides of the equation. Now we move the constant term to the right side of the equation by adding 62510 to both sides: 1330*n - 62510 + 62510 = 0 + 62510 This simplifies to: 1330*n = 62510 Step 4: Solve for n by dividing both sides of the equation by 1330. To find the value of n, divide both sides by 1330: n = 62510 / 1330 Dividing 62510 by 1330 gives: n ≈ 47 So the solution to the equation is n ≈ 47."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Whose conversation does a passenger overhear that makes him want to help?  The SS Claridon is an old ship that is scheduled to be scrapped after just a few more voyages. Cliff and Laurie Henderson and their daughter, Jill, are relocating to Tokyo and decide to sail there on board the ship. A fire in the boiler room is extinguished, but not before a boiler fuel supply valve is fused open. Before Chief Engineer Pringle can manually open a steam relief valve, a huge explosion rips through the boiler room and the many decks situated above it, killing him and some of the passengers and trapping Laurie under a steel beam in their state room, in addition to opening a huge hole in the side of the ship. Cliff runs back to their state room and can't get Laurie out alone. He then finds Jill trapped on the other side of the room. He tries to use a shattered piece of the bed to get to the other side, but it falls through the huge hole made by the explosion. Third Officer Osborne believes that the crew should start loading the passengers into the lifeboats, but Captain Robert Adams is reluctant, as he never lost a ship. Cliff rescues Jill by using a board to have her crawl across the hole on. Down in the boiler room, Second Engineer Walsh reports to Captain Adams that a seam to the bulkhead has broken away. Cliff tries to get  a steward's help, but to no avail. A passenger states that he overheard his conversation, and wants to help. Osborne reports that the boiler room is now half full. The ship then begins to transmit an SOS, on orders of Captain Adams. Cliff and a few other men return to his state room to try to help free Laurie, but find that they need a torch. The carpenter reports to the crew that the boiler room is now two thirds full. Captain Adams makes an announcement to the passengers to put on their life jackets. They then begin loading and launching the lifeboats.

Hoping to beat the defending Super Bowl champs, the Ravens returned home. New Orleans struck first with an 18-yard pass from Drew Brees to Jimmy Graham, but Baltimore quickly answered with Flacco throwing a 34-yard pass to Ed Dickson. The Ravens then followed with two touchdowns, both by Ray Rice, one rushing (10&#160;yards) and one passing (17&#160;yards), to bring the score up 21-7. At the close of the half, the Saints scored on a 1-yard pass to Graham to bring the halftime score to 21-14. The Saints kicked a field goal to enter the third quarter to make it 21-17, but the Ravens quickly answered that with a field goal to make it 24-17. The Saints tied it in the fourth quarter on a 15-yard touchdown pass to Lance Moore in the corner of the end zone, a play that was challenged by Baltimore but not overturned. The Ravens managed to get ahead with a Billy Cundiff field goal with 10:03 remaining 27-24.The Saints had the ball in the final minutes backed up near their own end zone when Drew Brees threw an interception to Cory Redding to give Baltimore a chance to run off the clock.

Watch breaking news report      According to St. John the Baptist Parish representative Paige Falgoust, the amoeba was detected in Water District 1. The water system serves 12,577 people in the towns of Reserve, Garyville and Mt. Airy.      \\"The water system was sampled as part of DHH's surveillance program that just launched earlier this month. During the ameba testing, DHH discovered the system was not in compliance with the State's emergency rule, which requires water systems to maintain a minimum disinfectant residual level of 0.5 milligrams per liter throughout all of their distribution lines. This 0.5 mg/L level is known to control the Naegleria fowleri ameba,\\" the parish said in a news release.      While residents can consume the water, the parish said there is a risk is an amoeba enters the nasal passage.      Beginning at 7 a.m. Thursday, the Department of Health and Hospitals will begin a chlorine burn that will last for 60 days.      During the chlorine burn, residents may notice a change in the smell and taste of the water, officials said.      \\"Families can take simple steps to protect themselves from exposure to this amoeba, the most important being to avoid allowing water to go up your nose while bathing or swimming in a pool,\\" said Louisiana State Health Officer Jimmy Guidry. \\"It is important to remember that the water is safe to drink; the amoeba cannot infect an individual through the stomach.\\"      PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES FOR FAMILIES      According to the CDC, personal actions to reduce the risk of Naegleria fowleri infection should focus on limiting the amount of water going up a person's nose and lowering the chances that Naegleria fowleri may be in the water. Preventative measures recommended by the CDC include the following:      * DO NOT allow water to go up your nose or sniff water into your nose when bathing, showering, washing your face, or swimming in small hard plastic/blow-up pools.      * DO NOT jump into or put your head under bathing water (bathtubs, small hard plastic/blow-up pools) - walk or lower yourself in.DO NOT allow children to play unsupervised with hoses or sprinklers, as they may accidentally squirt water up their nose. Avoid slip-n-slides or other activities where it is difficult to prevent water going up the nose.      * DO run bath and shower taps and hoses for five minutes before use to flush out the pipes. This is most important the first time you use the tap after the water utility raises the disinfectant level.      * DO keep small hard plastic/blow-up pools clean by emptying, scrubbing, and allowing them to dry after each use.      * DO use only boiled and cooled, distilled or sterile water for making sinus rinse solutions for neti pots or performing ritual ablutions.      * DO keep your swimming pool adequately disinfected before and during use. Adequate disinfection means:      * Pools: free chlorine at 1-3 parts per million (ppm) and pH 7.2-7.8, and      * Hot tubs/spas: free chlorine 2-4 parts per million (ppm) or free bromine 4-6 ppm and pH 7.2-7.8.      * If you need to top off the water in your swimming pool with tap water, place the hose directly into the skimmer box and ensure that the filter is running. Do not top off by placing the hose in the body of the pool.

It can cause a rare** and devastating infection of the brain called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). The ameba is commonly found in warm freshwater (e.g. lakes, rivers, and hot springs) and soil. Naegleria fowleri usually infects people when contaminated water enters the body through the nose. Once the ameba enters the nose, it travels to the brain where it causes PAM, which is usually fatal. Infection typically occurs when people go swimming or diving in warm freshwater places, like lakes and rivers. In very rare instances, Naegleria infections may also occur when contaminated water from other sources (such as inadequately chlorinated swimming pool water or heated and contaminated tap water) enters the nose 1-4. You cannot get infected from swallowing water contaminated with Naegleria.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many percent of people were not non-affiliated believers?","output":"Title: Unraveling the Percentage of Non-Affiliated Believers in Society Introduction One of the most profound ways we make sense of the world around us is through our belief systems. Among the diverse spectrum of beliefs, a particular group stands out: non-affiliated believers. These individuals often hold personal spiritual or religious beliefs without necessarily aligning themselves with any formal religious institution. But what percentage of people fall into this category? This article delves into available data and discusses the prevalence of non-affiliated believers in society. Defining Non-Affiliated Believers Before we tackle the percentage of non-affiliated believers, it is essential first to define the term. Non-affiliated believers are those who maintain spiritual or religious beliefs but do not identify with any specific religious organization or sect. This group may include agnostics (those unsure about the existence of a higher power), atheists (who don't believe in a higher power), spiritual but not religious individuals, and those who follow the teachings of multiple religions or spiritual paths. Sources of Data To examine the percentage of non-affiliated believers, it's crucial to consider the following sources of data: 1. Pew Research Center: As a globally recognized research institution, the Pew Research Center frequently conducts surveys and studies that focus on religious beliefs and practices. 2. World Values Survey: This international data set examines the shifting values and beliefs of citizens in various countries, often incorporating religious and spiritual affiliations. 3. National censuses and surveys: Many nations periodically conduct census surveys that may include questions related to religion and spirituality. Methodology: Analyzing Available Data Using the data from global and national sources, we can determine the percentage of non-affiliated believers in society. The most recent reports indicate the following percentages: 1. According to the Pew Research Center's Global Religious Landscape report (2012), approximately 16.3% of the global population is religiously unaffiliated. 2. The World Values Survey Wave 7 (2017-2020) indicated that around 19.2% of respondents across 48 participating countries identified as non-affiliated believers. Calculating the Percentage of Non-Affiliated Believers Based on the information above, it is important to note that the percentage of non-affiliated believers is not equivalent to the percentage of people who did not claim to be non-affiliated believers. To calculate the percentage of people who were not non-affiliated believers, we must determine the remaining percentage of the population after accounting for the non-affiliated believers.  Using the data from each source, we can calculate the percentage of people who were not non-affiliated believers: 1. Pew Research Center: 100% - 16.3% (non-affiliated believers) = 83.7% 2. World Values Survey: 100% - 19.2% (non-affiliated believers) = 80.8% Conclusion The percentage of people who were not non-affiliated believers varies slightly depending on the data source. Based on the Pew Research Center's report, approximately 83.7% of the global population is not non-affiliated believers, while the World Values Survey data suggests that this figure stands closer to 80.8%. Though the detailed statistics may vary, it is essential to recognize that these percentages underscore the ubiquity of religious and spiritual affiliations across diverse societies. As our world continues to evolve, our understanding of spiritual and religious beliefs will remain in flux, warranting the ongoing analysis of such data."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

In week 9, the Lions traveled to Seattle, Washington to take on the Seattle Seahawks. The Lions took an early lead in the first quarter, scoring 17 unanswered points. First came 2 TD's: a Brandon Pettigrew 7-yard catch, then a Bryant Johnson 29-yard catch, and afterward was a 41-yard field goal. The Seahawks responded in the second quarter with a TD and 2 field goals. First the TD, a 3-yard run by Julius Jones. The field goals by Olindo Mare were both from 37 yards out. In the 3rd quarter came another Seattle field goal, from 24 yards out. Then a Seahawks TD to give them the lead, a 2-yard TD catch by T.J. Houshmandzadeh. However, the fake field goal for a 2-point conversion was no good. The Lions' only score of the second half was a 50-yard field goal. The Seahawks sealed their win with a 61-yard interception for a TD by Josh Wilson. Answer this question based on the article: How many yards more was the 61-yard interception than the shortest field goal?","output":"To answer this question, we need to find the shortest field goal in the game and then compare it to the 61-yard interception.

Step 2: Find the shortest field goal Of these distances, the shortest field goal is the one from 24 yards out. Step 3: Compare the interception yards to the shortest field goal The interception was 61 yards, so we need to find the difference between 61 yards and 24 yards.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Cover-Up Issue Is Seen as Focus in Leak Inquiry WASHINGTON, Oct. 20 - As he weighs whether to bring criminal charges in the C.I.A. leak case, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the special counsel, is focusing on whether Karl Rove, the senior White House adviser, and I. Lewis Libby Jr., chief of staff for Vice President Dick Cheney, sought to conceal their actions and mislead prosecutors, lawyers involved in the case said Thursday. Among the charges that Mr. Fitzgerald is considering are perjury, obstruction of justice and false statement - counts that suggest the prosecutor may believe the evidence presented in a 22-month grand jury inquiry shows that the two White House aides sought to cover up their actions, the lawyers said.

Shawn Thew/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images I. Lewis Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, testifying before a House committee in 2001. Mr. Rove and Mr. Libby have been advised that they may be in serious legal jeopardy, the lawyers said, but only this week has Mr. Fitzgerald begun to narrow the possible charges. The prosecutor has said he will not make up his mind about any charges until next week, government officials say. With the term of the grand jury expiring in one week, though, some lawyers in the case said they were persuaded that Mr. Fitzgerald had all but made up his mind to seek indictments. None of the lawyers would speak on the record, citing the prosecutor's requests not to talk about the case. Associates of Mr. Rove and Mr. Libby continued to express hope that the prosecutor would conclude that the evidence was too fragmentary and that it would be difficult to prove Mr. Rove or Mr. Libby had a clear-cut intention to misinform the grand jury. Lawyers for the two men declined to comment on their legal status. The case has cast a cloud over the White House, as has the Congressional criticism over the Supreme Court nomination of Harriet E. Miers. On Thursday, responding to a reporter's question, Mr. Bush said: \\"There's some background noise here, a lot of chatter, a lot of speculation and opining. But the American people expect me to do my job, and I'm going to.\\" The possible violations under consideration by Mr. Fitzgerald are peripheral to the issue he was appointed in December 2003 to investigate: whether anyone in the administration broke a federal law that makes it a crime, under certain circumstances, to reveal the identity of a covert intelligence officer. But Mr. Rove and Mr. Libby may not be the only people at risk. There may be others in the government who could be charged for violations of the disclosure law or of other statutes, like the espionage act, which makes it a crime to transmit classified information to people not authorized to receive it. It is still not publicly known who first told the columnist Robert D. Novak the identity of the C.I.A. officer, Valerie Wilson. Mr. Novak identified her in a column on July 14, 2003, using her maiden name, Valerie Plame. Mr. Fitzgerald knows the identity of this source, a person who is not believed to work at the White House, the lawyers said. The accounts given by Mr. Rove and Mr. Libby about their conversations with reporters have been under investigation almost from the start. According to lawyers in the case, the prosecutor has examined how each man learned of Ms. Wilson, and questioned them in grand jury appearances about their conversations with reporters, how they learned Ms. Wilson's name and her C.I.A. employment and whether the discussions were part of an effort to undermine the credibility of her husband, a former ambassador, Joseph C. Wilson IV. Mr. Wilson had become an irritant to the administration in the late spring and early summer of 2003 even before he went public as a critic of the war in Iraq by writing a July 6, 2003 Op-Ed article in The New York Times. In that article he wrote that he had traveled to Africa in 2002 to explore the accuracy of intelligence reports that suggested Iraq might have tried to purchase uranium ore from Niger. Mr. Wilson said that he had been sent on the trip by the C.I.A. after Mr. Cheney's office raised questions about one such report, but that he found it unlikely that any sale had taken place. In Mr. Rove's case, the prosecutor appears to have focused on two conversations with reporters. The first was a July 9, 2003, discussion with Mr. Novak in which, Mr. Rove has said, he first heard Ms. Wilson's name. The second conversation took place on July 11, 2003 with a Time magazine reporter, Matthew Cooper, who later wrote that Mr. Rove had not named Ms. Wilson but had told him that she worked at the C.I.A. and that she had been responsible for her husband being sent to Africa. Mr. Rove did not tell the grand jury about his phone conversation with Mr. Cooper until months into the leak investigation, long after he had testified about his conversation with Mr. Novak, the lawyers said. Later, Mr. Rove said he had not recalled the conversation with Mr. Cooper until the discovery of an e-mail message about it that he sent to Stephen J. Hadley, then the deputy national security adviser. But Mr. Fitzgerald has remained skeptical about the omission, the lawyers said. In Mr. Libby's case, Mr. Fitzgerald has focused on his statements about how he first learned of Ms. Wilson's identity, the lawyers said. Mr. Libby has said that he learned of Ms. Wilson from reporters. But Mr. Fitzgerald may have doubts about his account because the journalists who have been publicly identified as having talked to Mr. Libby have said that they did not provide the name, that they could not recall what had been said or that they had discussed unrelated subjects.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   CHAPTER SUMMARY 31.1 Nutritional Requirements of Plants Plants can absorb inorganic nutrients and water through their root system, and carbon dioxide from the environment. The combination of organic compounds, along with water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight, produce the energy that allows plants to grow. Inorganic compounds form the majority of the soil solution. Plants access water though the soil. Water is absorbed by the plant root, transports nutrients throughout the plant, and maintains the structure of the plant. Essential elements are indispensable elements for plant growth. They are divided into macronutrients and micronutrients. The macronutrients plants require are carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. Important micronutrients include iron, manganese, boron, molybdenum, copper, zinc, chlorine, nickel, cobalt, silicon and sodium.   Q: Plants can absorb inorganic nutrients and water through their root system, and what gas from the environment?   A: Answer:","output":"Plants can absorb inorganic nutrients and water through their root system, and carbon dioxide (CO2) from the environment. This gas plays a crucial role in the process of photosynthesis, wherein plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce glucose and oxygen. The glucose provides energy and acts as building blocks for plant growth, while the oxygen is released back into the environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Theravadin Buddhists believe that personal effort is required to realize rebirth. Monks follow the vinaya: meditating, teaching and serving their lay communities. Laypersons can perform good actions, producing merit.\\"? Answer:","output":"Based on the passage provided, a good question to assess the students' comprehension of the content would be: Question: What are the key beliefs and practices of Theravadin Buddhists, and how do they differ for monks and laypersons? In order to answer this question, students would need to carefully read the passage and identify the primary beliefs and practices mentioned. A detailed and long response could look like this: Answer: According to the passage, Theravadin Buddhists believe in the importance of personal effort to achieve rebirth. The practices of monks and laypersons within the Theravadin tradition vary, as they undertake different actions to realize this goal.  Monks, who play a crucial role in the Theravadin community, adhere to the \\"vinaya,\\" which governs their conduct and specifies the behavioral rules for their spiritual journey. To facilitate rebirth, they focus on three main activities: meditation, teaching, and serving their lay communities. Meditation allows them to cultivate mindfulness, concentration, and insight, helping them attain higher states of consciousness and eventually, Nirvana. Teaching, on the other hand, enables them to share their knowledge of Buddhist principles and practices with others, ensuring that the teachings are propagated and preserved for future generations. Finally, by serving their lay communities, monks foster a supportive environment for spiritual growth while also nurturing mutually beneficial relationships with laypersons who, in turn, support the monastic community with material requisites such as food, clothing, and shelter. In contrast, laypersons - who generally live outside the monastic setting and engage in more secular activities - are encouraged to perform good actions to produce merit. Merit is believed to contribute to a better rebirth and bring the individual closer to enlightenment. The concept of merit allows laypersons to participate actively in the process of spiritual development. They accumulate merit by engaging in acts of generosity, observing ethical precepts, and cultivating mental qualities such as loving-kindness and compassion. Additionally, laypersons support the monastic community by offering material requisites, which also contributes to their store of merit. In summary, the passage highlights the importance of personal effort to achieve rebirth in the Theravadin Buddhist tradition. While the practices of monks and laypersons differ, both groups contribute to the spiritual growth of the community, as well as their own progress on the path to enlightenment. Monks follow the vinaya by meditating, teaching, and serving, while laypersons perform good actions to produce merit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Originally developed by the Royal Navy, it since has been adopted by many navies for smaller carriers.

This allows heavily loaded and fueled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight. Without a skijump launching fully loaded and fueled aircraft such as the Harrier would not be possible on a smaller flat deck ship before either stalling out or crashing directly into the sea.","output":"The ski-jump ramp helps the aircraft launch and take off at higher weights than is possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks by converting some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity and partially aiming the jet thrust downwards.

This happens when a substance moves from an area where it is less concentrated to an area where it is more concentrated. This is the opposite of diffusion. The substance moves up, instead of down, the concentration gradient. Like rolling a ball uphill, this requires an input of energy. The energy comes from the molecule named ATP (adenosine triphosphate). The energy allows special transport proteins called pumps to move substances to areas of higher concentration. An example is the sodiumpotassium pump. and the situation: John is trying to figure out how substance passes through the cell membrane. He noticed two different cases, case A and case B.

Hint: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kineticmolecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode.

The water gets frozen into bottle shapes at 13below zero, and the bottles have a rubber band that drinkers use to hold them. They melt into nothing when the drink is gone, but ABC News reports that critics aren't wowed by the seemingly green product—because of all the extra refrigeration required.","output":"Coca-Cola is taking a big step in innovation by introducing a bottle that is made entirely out of ice, according to the Atlanta Morning Call. The new product is currently available only in Colombia, where it's reportedly a hit with beach-goers. Made by freezing water at temperatures of 13-below zero, the new Coca-Cola bottle is a green-friendly way of serving drinks. However, critics raise concerns about additional energy consumption required for keeping the bottles below freezing. The new Coca-Cola bottle is entirely made up of ice and moulded to keep any drink cold for long hours. The company is proud of its innovation, which is a part of its commitment to environmental safety. The bottle is made by pouring the water into moulds and freezing it at 13-below zero, then a rubber band is used as a holder when using the bottle. The ice bottle melts away alongside the drink when finished. Coke tried and tested the new bottle in Colombia and it is reported to have been popular with beach-goers. Due to the positive feedback received, the innovative idea may be rolled out in more locations. It is hoped that the ice bottle will be a popular alternative to other drinks packaging options and contribute to reducing plastic waste. Despite the innovative and seemingly green solution, critics are concerned about the product's overall environmental effect from the additional energy required. The new bottle needs to be kept below freezing throughout production, delivery, and sale. Hence, some suggest it may still not be environmental-friendly as it reportedly uses more energy compared to traditional beverage bottles. As it stands, Coke is yet to release any data with regards to the exact carbon footprint of the new ice bottle production. Ultimately, Coca-Cola's ice bottle may become a game-changer in the beverage packaging industry. It offers an innovative and natural solution to plastic waste while providing a fun, unique drinking experience. This eco-friendly initiative may encourage other companies to think outside the box and come up with innovative ways to reduce packaging waste."},{"instruction":"Given the following passage The Ottoman economic mind was closely related to the basic concepts of state and society in the Middle East in which the ultimate goal of a state was consolidation and extension of the ruler's power, and the way to reach it was to get rich resources of revenues by making the productive classes prosperous.

Pompeo was supposed to travel to Sydney and Canberra for a bilateral strategic dialogue with his Australian counterpart, Marise Payne. The visit was expected to deepen the alliance between the two nations and strengthen their diplomatic and security ties. Pompeo was also set to participate in the annual Australia-United States Ministerial Consultations (AUSMIN) forum with Defense Secretary Mark Esper and other officials. The postponement is disappointing news for Australia, which had been preparing for Pompeo's visit for months. The agenda for the visit included discussions on several key issues, including regional security, economic cooperation, and the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Australian officials have expressed their understanding of the situation, but have also made it clear that they look forward to rescheduling the visit as soon as possible. The U.S.-Australia alliance has always been a crucial part of American foreign policy, and both countries have a strong commitment to maintaining close cooperation and communication. In Pompeo's absence, the U.S. mission in Australia has assured officials that the relationship between the two countries remains strong and active. The U.S. Ambassador to Australia, Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr., has emphasized the importance of continuing to work together to address the challenges facing the region. The delay in Pompeo's visit comes at a time of growing tension between the United States and China, with Australia increasingly caught in the middle. The Australian government has been closely aligned with the U.S. on issues such as trade and national security, but has also sought to maintain a constructive relationship with China, Australia's largest trading partner. The postponement of Pompeo's visit is likely to be seen as a setback in the effort to strengthen the U.S.-Australia alliance.

Hint: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to shortcycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion.

It is a combination of an exhaustdriven turbocharger and an enginedriven supercharger, each mitigating the weaknesses of the other. A beltdriven or shaftdriven supercharger offers exceptional response and lowrpm performance as it has no lag time between the application of throttle and pressurization of the manifold (assuming that it is a positivedisplacement supercharger such as a Roots type or twinscrew and not a Centrifugal compressor supercharger, which does not provide boost until the engine has reached higher RPMs). When combined with a large turbocharger if the \`\`turbo'' was used by itself, it would offer unacceptable lag and poor response in the lowrpm range the proper combination of the two can offer a zerolag powerband with high torque at lower engine speeds and increased power at the higher end. Twincharging is therefore desirable for smalldisplacement motors (such as VW's 1.4TSI), especially those with a large operating rpm, since they can take advantage of an artificially broad torque band over a large speed range.
