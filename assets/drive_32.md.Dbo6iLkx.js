Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him.  Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week.  The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey.  The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles.  Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book.  Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump... Why did the Republican National Committee set up the website lyincomey.com? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - not enough information - To track progress on the Russia investigation - To help Comey sell his book - To showcase democrats' criticisms of Comey and fact check his book Answer:","output":"The Republican National Committee set up the website lyincomey.com to showcase Democrats' criticisms of Comey and fact-check his book.

Send a message regarding the item. Constantly bring it up.","output":"Title: The Art of Reclaiming Your Borrowed Possessions Introduction Lending personal belongings such as books, clothes, or electronic gadgets to friends and family is a common practice. It's a sign of trust and goodwill, and can even strengthen bonds. However, it's not unusual for these borrowed items to take an extended vacation and be forgotten in the borrower's home. No one wants to come across as rude or petty, so reclaiming your possessions can sometimes be a daunting task. In this article, we will discuss a few effective ways to be forward about asking for your belongings back without damaging relationships. 1. Be Forward about Asking for Your Belongings The first and most critical step in recovering your loaned items is to be direct and honest. Express your need for the specific item and explain its importance to you. For instance, if a friend borrowed your favorite book, you can say, \\"Hey, since I want to read that book again, could I please have it back by next week?\\" Being upfront may feel uncomfortable initially, but it shows maturity and integrity and helps to avoid misunderstandings. 2. Ask a Question about the Item When asking for your possessions back, doing so in the form of a question can be a more subtle approach. If you've lent your favorite jacket to a friend, instead of bluntly saying you want it returned, ask how they like using it or if they've had a chance to wear it. For example, \\"Hey, how did that jacket work out for you on your hiking trip?\\" Such a question prompts the borrower to think about the item and remember that it belongs to you. It is a gentle reminder that you might need it back sooner than later. 3. Send a Message Regarding the Item Sometimes, talking face-to-face can be awkward or not feasible. In those cases, sending a text message or email can be a diplomatic alternative for asking for your belongings back. A carefully composed message can convey your feelings without sounding confrontational. For example, \\"Hey, I hope you're enjoying the camera I lent you last month. But I was wondering if you were finished with it since I have a family event coming up that I'd like to use it for?\\" This not only reminds the borrower but also indicates that you have a genuine need for it, encouraging them to return it promptly. 4. Constantly Bring It Up If your previous attempts at reclaiming your borrowed possessions have been unsuccessful, you may need to be more persistent. You can bring up the topic casually during conversations or when spending time with the borrower in person. However, be careful not to seem overly aggressive or pushy. An example of this method could be mentioning an upcoming event where you will need the borrowed item, or even suggesting a get-together to exchange items you've both borrowed from one another. 5. Seek Assistance from Mutual Friends If it's getting increasingly difficult to receive your borrowed belongings, enlisting help from mutual friends could be beneficial. These friends can remind your friend on your behalf or even offer to pick up the item for you in a casual manner. It's essential to choose a close and reliable friend for this role, as you want to avoid any further complications or misunderstandings. Conclusion In conclusion, asking for your loaned items back can be a delicate situation. However, by following the above tips, you can confidently establish open communication and regain your belongings without causing a rift in your relationships. Remember to be sincere and considerate while being proactive, and always ensure the borrower understands how much you value your possessions. Maintaining healthy boundaries and honest conversations about your belongings will ultimately lead to stronger and more trustworthy connections with your friends and family."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The phrases \\"a pleasant distraction\\" and \\"a Friday night diversion\\" suggest that the movie might not be a cinematic masterpiece or a thought-provoking film, but rather an enjoyable way to spend time and have some entertainment. The use of the word \\"pleasant\\" implies that the movie has a feel-good element, is easy to watch, and generally provides a good experience for the viewer. In the context of a Friday night, when people typically look forward to winding down and having some amusement after a long week, the term \\"diversion\\" indicates that the movie serves to offer a temporary escape from daily stresses or concerns. However, it is important to note that this review does not necessarily imply that the movie is outstanding or exceptional. The critic may view the film as average or satisfactory at best, serving its purpose as a light form of amusement. Consequently, the review suggests that the movie falls into the category of an acceptable and passable form of entertainment, rather than being considered a must-watch or highly acclaimed production.

This groundbreaking device was designed to help anticipate tidal patterns, which was essential for navigation purposes. By utilizing a system of gears, pulleys, and wires, the machine was able to make predictions about tide levels at specific locations and time intervals with high accuracy. Sir William Thomson was a Scottish physicist and mathematician who made significant contributions to various scientific fields, including thermodynamics, electricity, and magnetism. His invention of the tide-predicting machine was just one of his many accomplishments, which also include the development of the absolute temperature scale, now known as the Kelvin scale. In the late 19th century, the tide-predicting machine played a critical role in maritime navigation, shipping, and the construction of coastal infrastructure. By providing advance knowledge of tide levels, it enabled ships to avoid hazards like shallow waters and contributed to more efficient maritime operations. Over the years, the design and mechanism of the tide-predicting machine were improved upon by various engineers and inventors.

Julia Roberts' portrayal of the fearless and tenacious Erin Brockovich garnered widespread critical acclaim for her unwavering dedication to the role and her ability to embody the real-life character's spirit. Not only did Roberts' performance earn her the coveted Oscar, but she also received a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama for her role. Throughout her illustrious career, Julia Roberts has also starred in numerous box-office hits and memorable films, including \\"Pretty Woman\\" (1990), \\"My Best Friend's Wedding\\" (1997), \\"Notting Hill\\" (1999), \\"Runaway Bride\\" (1999), \\"Ocean's Eleven\\" (2001), and \\"Eat Pray Love\\" (2010), among many others. She has been nominated for Oscars in various categories three other times, for her roles in \\"Steel Magnolias\\" (1990), \\"Pretty Woman\\" (1991), and \\"August: Osage County\\" (2014). Despite her multiple nominations, it was her powerful performance in \\"Erin Brockovich\\" that earned her the prestigious Academy Award, further cementing her status as one of Hollywood's most talented and beloved actresses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Some trees can survive a long time without water. Think of trees that grow in the desert. But other trees may need more moisture  than they can get from rainfall or from the air . Trees and other plants can look thirsty. Leaves can become weak and hang downward. They can also turn yellow. Yellowing can be a sign of too much water. But it can also be a warning sign of too little water. With a newly planted tree, the roots have not yet spread out from the root ball. The root ball can become dry faster than the dirt around it. So put water on the area of the root ball and the surrounding soil until the roots become established. Once a tree is well established, water deeply instead of watering often. The amount of water needed depends on the tree and the soil. Clay  soils hold water for longer periods while sandy soil holds less water. During the hottest season, a deep watering may satisfy a tree for anywhere from ten days to four weeks. Ted Swiecki is a plant scientist . He says people should not water established trees at the base of the trunk . This can harm the tree. Too much water in the soil at the base of a tree can lead to the growth of fungi . If the area is too wet, harmful organisms have a better chance to invade the tree and cause disease. Mr. Swiecki says this is true especially in Mediterranean and semi-dry climates. Many trees in these climates have adapted to having a dry area near their base during the hottest season. He said, \\"Water displaces (,)air in the soil. And roots are aerobic ; they require oxygen for the soil to function properly. So if you keep the soil completely wet and there's no air there, then the roots are starving for oxygen.\\" Question: Which of the following situations requires the most watering?

York-born William Etty (1787–1849) had originally been an apprentice printer in Hull, but on completing his apprenticeship at the age of 18 moved to London to become an artist. Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, he became famous for painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. While many of his peers greatly admired him and elected him a full Royal Academician in 1828, others condemned the content of his work as indecent.Throughout his early career Etty was highly regarded by wealthy lawyer Thomas Myers, who had been educated at Eton College and thus had a good knowledge of classical mythology. From 1832 onwards Myers regularly wrote to Etty to suggest potential subjects for paintings. Myers was convinced that there was a significant market for very large paintings, and encouraged Etty to make such works. In 1834, he suggested the theme of Ulysses (\\"Odysseus\\" in the original Greek) encountering the Sirens, a scene from the Odyssey in which a ship's crew sails past the island home of the Sirens. The Sirens were famous for the beauty of their singing, which would lure sailors to their deaths. Ulysses wanted to hear their song, so had his crew lash him to the ship's mast under strict orders not to untie him, after which they blocked their ears until they were safely out of range of the island.The topic of Ulysses encountering the Sirens was well suited to Etty's taste; as he wrote at the time, \\"My aim in all my great pictures has been to paint some great moral on the heart ... the importance of resisting SENSUAL DELIGHTS\\". In his depiction of the scene, he probably worked from Alexander Pope's translation, \\"Their song is death, and makes destruction please. / Unblest the man whom music wins to stay / Nigh the curs'd shore, and listen to the lay ... In verdant meads they sport, and wide around / Lie human bones that whiten all the ground. / The ground polluted floats with human gore / And human carnage taints the dreadful shore.\\" A:","output":"The last name of the person who was strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens is Etty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fourteen hours later, four perfectly dressed Japanese gentlemen greeted her at Narita Airport. Smiling and bowing low, they handed her their business cards. With her bag in one hand, Geri took their cards with the other. She thanked them, glanced briefly at the cards, and put them into her jeans pocket quickly. When the five of them arrived at the hotel, they invited Geri to tea in the lobby  . While sipping tea, the gentlemen presented her with a small gift which she eagerly opened. She was thrilled with the gift and shouted excitedly, \\"Oh, it's beautiful!\\" At this point, the four Japanese gentlemen stood up and, bowing only very slightly, said \\"Sayonara\\" and left immediately. Poor Geri was left astonished. What did she do wrong? Everything! Her jeans were the first gaffe. Even if you're coming off a bicycle in Japan, you do not meet c1ients   casually dressed. The second mistake was Geri's handling of their business cards rudely. In Japan, the business card is one of the most important communicative tools. It is always presented and accepted respectfully with both hands. However, Geri put their cards away much too quickly. In Japan, people use business cards as a conversation starter. You chat about each other's cards and work and do not put theirs away until they gently and respectfully place yours in safekeeping. Putting it carelessly into her jeans pocket was the ultimate disrespect. Then, the fourth horror of horrors was that Geri should not have opened the gift in front of her clients. In a land where saving face is critical, it would be embarrassing to discover the gift they gave was not as nice as the one they received. What is worse, Geri hadn't even given them a gift!

Today we are going to talk about a big adventure: finding a house that you can afford. Just like when you save your pocket money to buy a toy, grown-ups have to save money to buy a house. Let's learn how they do it! 1. Knowing How Much to Spend First, grown-ups need to find out how much money they can spend on a house. They do this by looking at how much money they make and what other things they need to pay for, like food, clothes, and fun activities. This helps them know how much they can save for a house. 2. Make a Savings Plan Next, they make a plan to save money. Just like you put coins in your piggy bank, grown-ups put money in a special place called a savings account. They decide how much to save each month, and they keep track of it. With a good plan, they can save enough money to buy the house they want. 3. Find a House in Your Budget Now comes the fun part! Grown-ups look for a house that is just right for their budget. This means they can pay for it without running out of money. They visit different houses and pick the one that meets their needs and is not too expensive. 4. Don't Forget Extra Costs When you buy a toy, there might be extras like batteries not included. It's the same for houses! Grown-ups also have to think about extra costs like taxes, insurance, and fixing things that might be broken. They need to make sure they can pay for these costs too. 5. Get Help from Friends Finding a house you can afford can be difficult. Grown-ups get help from friends called \\"real estate agents\\" who know a lot about houses and can help them find the right one. These friends make sure the grown-ups find a house that is safe, cozy, and fits in their budget. So little ones, that's how grown-ups find a house they can afford. Just like you, they need to be patient, save their money, and make smart choices. And when they find the perfect house, they can be happy and proud of what they have accomplished!"},{"instruction":"Which  song on MTV Unplugged 1993 live album was originally written by Bruce Springsteen and Patti Smith in 1978?","output":"The song \\"Because the Night\\" was originally written by Bruce Springsteen and Patti Smith in 1978."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However a large portion of those walls remain.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The walls referred to in the context are the medieval walls surrounding the city. There are still walls remaining for several reasons: 1. Historical significance: The medieval walls are part of the city's rich history, and preserving them serves as a way to remember and honor the city's past. These walls are an integral part of the architectural landscape and contribute to the city's identity. 2. Incomplete demolition: The partial demolition of the walls in 1932 and 1938 may have left some sections intact due to various factors, such as resource constraints, changing priorities, or opposition from citizens who valued the walls' historical and cultural significance. 3. Protection and preservation efforts: Over time, people began to fully appreciate the historical and cultural importance of the remaining walls. This led to increased efforts to protect and preserve them. Government bodies, heritage organizations, and local communities have worked together to ensure the surviving walls are restored and maintained for future generations. 4. Architectural resilience: The walls may have survived due in part to their construction, which was designed to withstand attacks and resist natural disasters. The resilience of these structures allowed them to endure over centuries, even as the world around them changed dramatically. In conclusion, the remaining walls can be attributed to various factors, such as historical significance, incomplete demolition, protection and preservation efforts, and the walls' architectural resilience.

News article: As college students across the country stream onto campuses this week, Duke University’s The Chronicle reports that “some” members of the Class of 2019 were refusing to read a book assigned to them this summer as part of the elite school’s Common Experience Summer Reading program.      Many colleges have similar programs. In preparation for my first year of college in 1989, I myself read Jonathan Kozol’s Rachel and Her Children: Homeless Families in America and Nadine Gordimer’s Something Out There. I can still remember my new classmates’ passionate arguments about South Africa’s apartheid regime and chronic homelessness in New York. This summer the first-years at the college where I now teach are reading Piper Kerman’s Orange is the New Black. At least they better be.      We can disagree with the authors of the books we read, but we have to read them first. It’s unclear how many of Duke’s 1,750 incoming students skipped Alison Bechdel’s highly-acclaimed 2006 graphic-novel style memoir Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic. That anyone admitted to a top university would purposely ignore their first assignment is, first and foremost, sad. These students have denied themselves a great read. The book, beautifully written and illustrated, won numerous literary awards and inspired a Broadway musical that swept the Tonys this spring. It’s a bittersweet story detailing Bechdel’s life growing up with a closeted gay father “who killed himself a few months after I came out to my parents as a lesbian.” Heavy stuff, for sure, but higher education is about examining the heavy stuff. Through her unique lens, Bechdel explores the themes of family, growing up and self-acceptance; themes we all can relate to.      What’s really disappointing, however, are the reasons students have given for refusing to read the book. According to The Chronicle, they think it’s pornographic. When I heard that, I grabbed my copy off the shelf to find the porn I apparently missed the first time around. I’m not sure how one labels a book pornographic without actually reading it, of course. Maybe it’s a new twist on the Stewart test: I know it when I don’t see it? Either way, it represents the antithesis of education, which requires both the opening of books and the opening of minds.      It’s true that a few panels of grey-scale drawings in the 232-page book do depict partial adult nudity and consensual sexuality. Certainly no one is exploited or objectified, making these examples far less offensive than your average love scene—both in popular culture and in classic literature. Which leads me to the conclusion that it’s not really the illustrations that have caused this most recent controversy, but rather the queer-identitifed people depicted in them.      Do these students think that four panels depicting partial nudity or sex between women will make them gay or skew their sense of self? Do these students think that four panels depicting partial nudity or sex between women will make them gay? Do they think that exposure to such drawings will skew their sense of self? Or deep down do they fear that their homophobia will become hard to justify once they’ve been confronted with it in such an honest and empathetic setting. College students are adults and should be able read about sex and sexuality. They should be able to read about the lives of all kinds of people, because the reality is people identify across a wide spectrum of sexual identities. All of our stories matter.      Education—especially higher education—obliges us to read, hear, and see things that we might not otherwise encounter. Anyone committed to learning must therefore engage with people, perspectives, ideas, and experiences that may at first seem strange, confusing, or problematic. Learning means we attempt to understand—it doesn’t mean we have to like everything we’re exposed to. We can disagree with the authors of the books we read, but we have to read them first. Worthwhile ideas and values can withstand exposure to other ideas and values. But those seeking a university education should be prepared to have the worldview and perspectives they developed at 18 challenged and expanded. If not, why go to college? Or read? Or think?      If we aren’t being challenged, we aren’t learning. If we don’t do the work, we fail. The Duke students who refused to read Fun Home have already failed. Willfully. Perhaps Duke should dismiss them, as they’re unwilling to take on college-level study. Let them reapply when they are ready to face the danger presented by a comic book.      We welcome your comments at ideas@qz.com. |||||       Duke Chapel on the campus of Duke University in Durham, N.C. (Jim R. Bounds/Bloomberg)      As a Christian, I knew that my beliefs and identity would be challenged at a progressive university like Duke.      My first challenge came well before I arrived on campus, when I learned that all first years were assigned “Fun Home,” a graphic novel by Alison Bechdel. The book includes cartoon drawings of a woman masturbating and multiple women engaging in oral sex.      After researching the book’s content and reading a portion of it, I chose to opt out of the assignment. My choice had nothing to do with the ideas presented. I’m not opposed to reading memoirs written by LGBTQ individuals or stories containing suicide. I’m not even opposed to reading Freud, Marx or Darwin. I know that I’ll have to grapple with ideas I don’t agree with, even ideas that I find immoral.      But in the Bible, Jesus forbids his followers from exposing themselves to anything pornographic. “But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart,” he says in Matthew 5:28-29. “If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away.” This theme is reiterated by Paul who warns, “flee from sexual immorality.”      I think there is an important distinction between images and written words. If the book explored the same themes without sexual images or erotic language, I would have read it. But viewing pictures of sexual acts, regardless of the genders of the people involved, conflict with the inherent sacredness of sex. My beliefs extend to pop culture and even Renaissance art depicting sex.      I’m well aware that my ethics make me an anomaly on campus, in contemporary culture and even among many professing Christians. However, my principles come primarily from my understanding of the Bible, which I have read multiple times, studied weekly in community for the last seven years, and consider to be the Word of God.      I don’t believe my position will limit my exposure to essential lessons in history, philosophy or literature. I assume that having to view graphic images of sex for a class will be rare. If it does happen, I will avoid any titillating content and encourage like-minded students to do the same. And I believe professors should warn me about such material, not because I might consider them offensive or discomforting, but because I consider it immoral.      Still, if my academic experience at Duke is full of thought-provoking stimuli other than pictures of sexual acts, it’s hard for me to believe that it will be incomplete.      I decided to post about my decision on the Duke Class of 2019 Facebook page to comfort those with similar beliefs. I knew that my decision wouldn’t be well-received. How could it in a country where, according to one study, more than three-quarters of American men between 18 and 24 years old have viewed pornography within the past month.      But though many students denounced my decision publicly, almost 20 people privately messaged me, thanking me for my post. I received many messages from Christians, but a message from a Muslim man stood out. The man, currently a sophomore at Duke, wrote, “I’ve seen a lot of people who just throw away their identity in college in the name of secularism, open-mindedness, or liberalism.” Is this really what Duke wants?      Cultural pluralism will lose its value if students aren’t allowed to follow their beliefs, even if they are conservative. Without genuine diversity, intellectual dialogue and growth are stifled.      I recognize, of course, that Christians on campus and throughout the country have an important responsibility, too. We need to learn how to dialogue across differences. Over the past couple of days, I have received many encouraging messages from a new friend, who considers herself bisexual and a Buddhist. She and I became friends after she saw my Facebook post. Instead of criticizing me, she asked me to explain my beliefs. I, in turn, asked her to explain the Buddhist perspective on sexuality. This is how diversity is supposed to work. We each shared our perspective, and walked away from the conversation with a deeper understanding and compassion for each other. That is what college is really about. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Many college students are assigned books to read as part of a summer reading program, and it is not uncommon for incoming students to have opinions and disagreements about the content. At Duke University, some members of the Class of 2019 refused to read Alison Bechdel's graphic-novel memoir \\"Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic\\" for their Common Experience Summer Reading program. While it is unclear how many students did not read the book, the reasons given for their refusal included the belief that the book is pornographic. These claims are based on a few panels depicting partial adult nudity and consensual sexuality in the book. However, the real issue for these students may not be the illustrations themselves, but the fact that they depict queer-identified people. College should be a place where students engage with new ideas and perspectives, even if they may not agree with them. By refusing to read the book, these students have chosen not to engage in college-level study and learn from different experiences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This month, the federal Violence Against Women Office awarded a two-year, 350,000 grant to the Women's Haven of Tarrant County. The money will allow the shelter to add a second full-time attorney to its staff and contract with the law school clinic at Texas Wesleyan University for pro bono and student services. Most important, the funds will help fill a frustrating gap. The Women's Haven, which provides shelter and outreach to domestic-violence victims, already has a full-time attorney. But that person is prohibited (by funding parameters) from representing women in matters of divorce or child custody. That's not a problem for most of the shelter's indigent residents, who can access free legal aid locally from West Texas Legal Services. But many of the clients served by the Women's Haven outreach programs are the working poor, who don't qualify for free legal services. Divorces and custody battles are simply out of their financial reach. \\"They can't begin to save up enough money for a divorce, so they're stuck,\\" says Sonyia Hartwell, the Women's Haven's associate director. \\"They're completely shut out of the civil-law system.\\" In Texas, unlike in some other states, women who aren't divorced can't gain full control over their portion of assets. And they can't obtain child support. The grant will also provide law students with valuable experience working these types of cases. \\"They can't go to court, but they can interview clients and do all the initial intake work that needs to be done\\" as well as investigative work, says Hartwell. And there's no shortage of abuse victims who need this kind of help. \\"Within 60 days of hanging out her or his shingle,\\" says Hartwell of the yet unhired new attorney, \\"we'll have an active caseload of 20 or more.\\"  Question: \\"Legal assistance is now a little easier for battered women to find in what county?\\" Answer: \\"Porter county\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, the answer is not correct.

Wait: This word indicates the action being performed by the cars. It tells the reader that the vehicles in question are not currently moving but are instead stationary in anticipation of something. 3. Corner: This word provides important information about the location of the waiting cars. It establishes that the cars are not waiting just anywhere, but specifically at the corner, which implies an intersection or a point where two roads meet. 4.

Knowing it acts like a magnet is one thing. Knowing why it acts like a magnet is more difficult. In fact, finding out why is a fairly recent discovery. To find out why required new technology. It was the seismograph that made it possible to learn why the Earth acted like a magnet. Seismograph are used to study earthquakes. By studying earthquake waves they were able to learn about Earths interior. They discovered that Earth has an inner and outer core. The outer core consists of liquid metals, mainly iron and nickel. Scientists think that Earths magnetic field is generated here. It is caused by the motion of this liquid metal. The liquid metal moves as Earth spins on its axis.

Make a loop about 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the free end of the yarn. The free end should hang behind your loop. Insert your crochet hook through the loop and hook the free end before pulling it back through the loop and onto the hook. Remember not to count your first stitch towards the 60 chains. To make one chain stitch, you'll want to hold the hook in you right hand and loop the working yarn over your left index finger. Hold the end of the slipknot between the thumb and middle finger of your left hand. Then, bring the yarn from back to front around the shaft of the hook, drawing it through the loop on the hook. Repeat this to make the first row, or foundation chain. Add 3 chains onto the 60 that you already have. This will maintain the height when you start crocheting the following rows. This will effectively count as turning your work, so just continue crocheting the row. To double chain, insert your hook into the fourth chain. Yarn over and pull the yarn through the chain. At this point, you should have three loops on your hook. Yarn over again and pull through two loops on your hook. You should now have one loop on your hook. Make sure to insert your hook into the chain and not the gap closer to your hook. To double crochet into your chain, insert your hook and yarn over. Pull up a loop, yarn over, pull through two, yarn over and pull through two. Continue doing this across the length of the chain. Check to make sure you have 60 stitches once you complete the row. Turning your work simply means rotating it so that the last stitch you worked becomes the beginning of the next row. skip one stitch and double crochet 6 times into the next stitch. Repeat this all the way across. To double crochet, yarn over insert your hook under both of your loops, yarn over, and pull up. You should now have three loops on your hook. Yarn over, pull through two, yarn over and pull through two. skip one stitch and single crochet into the next stitch. Repeat this all the way across. To single crochet, insert your hook from front to back in the center of the second chain from the hook. At this point, you should have 2 loops on your hook. Yarn over, or twist the yarn from front to back around the hook, and pull the yarn through the chain. Again, you should have 2 loops on your hook. Yarn over again and draw through the 2 loops. You'll now have single crochet stitches.  Cut the working yarn, then wrap the tail around your hook and pull it completely through your loop. Wrap and roll your scalloped piece so the scalloped edges face out like petals. Make sure to keep the straight edges lined up as you roll since you'll need to secure them later. Wrapping the scalloped piece tightly will create a smaller ruffled rose, as compared to one that's looser and larger. Play with wrapping until you create a shape you like. Thread a darning or embroidery needle using the tail from your scalloped piece. Insert your needle into the next row over. Pull through to tighten the end of your scalloped piece. Using your threaded needle, continue working back and forth through the bottom or base of the row. Make sure to pass through all of the rose's layers. Keep working the thread back and forth until the rose feels secure. Trim the remaining thread and use your rose. Summary:","output":"1. Create a 6-inch loop with the free end of the yarn hanging behind the loop. 2. Insert crochet hook through the loop, hook the free end, and pull it through. 3. Make a slipknot (do not count as the first stitch). 4. Hold the hook in your right hand, and loop the working yarn over your left index finger. 5.

A startup company (startup or start-up) is an entrepreneurial venture which is typically a newly emerged, fast-growing business that aims to meet a marketplace need by developing a viable business model around an innovative product, service, process or a platform. A startup is usually a company designed to effectively develop and validate a scalable business model. Can we draw the following conclusion? A start-up validates a scalable business model.","output":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that a start-up validates a scalable business model. However, it is essential to further analyze various aspects of a start-up to fully comprehend this statement. Start-ups are typically created to bring innovation and transformation to different industries and markets. Innovations can be in the form of new products, services, processes, or platforms. To determine the sustainability and success of these innovative ideas and concepts, start-ups must validate their business models. A scalable business model is one that has the potential to deliver increased revenue and growth as the company invests time, resources, and money. It allows the start-up to cater to an ever-growing customer base without compromising on its performance or quality. For a start-up to be considered successful and have the potential to become a strong market competitor, the business model must be scalable. In the process of validating the scalability of their business model, start-ups often go through the following steps: 1. Market research: Start-ups conduct extensive market research to understand the existing market situation, customer needs, and opportunities for growth. Market research helps start-ups discover the potential and desirability for their innovative product, service, process, or platform. 2. Idea validation: The start-up must test its innovative concepts and product feasibility to ensure that the idea resonates with potential customers and satisfies their needs effectively. 3. Business plan development: A comprehensive business plan is developed, which outlines the start-up's mission, objectives, target market, strategies, and financial projections. The business plan helps streamline the company's efforts and serves as a blueprint for its growth and development. 4. Financial model validation: Start-ups need to create a scalable financial model that demonstrates the potential growth of the company. This includes assessing investment needs, revenue streams, and potential profit margins. 5. Prototype, Minimum Viable Product (MVP), and testing: To validate the business model, start-ups often develop a prototype or MVP. This is a basic version of the product or service that can be tested and iterated with real users to receive feedback, refine the offering, and improve its value proposition. 6. Iteration and improvement: Start-ups continuously iterate their products, services, or platform to incorporate user feedback and improve its attractiveness to consumers. 7. Scaling the business: Once the business model has been validated and the start-up demonstrates its scalability, the company will focus on marketing and sales strategies to increase its market share and generate larger revenues. In conclusion, validating a scalable business model is crucial to the success of a start-up. This process helps start-ups identify and optimize the factors that will ultimately lead to their sustainable growth and increased profits. Furthermore, it underscores the importance of adaptability, flexibility, and market understanding when launching a new venture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Booststhemetabolism(throughnumerouscertainprocedures) Please segment the words.","output":"Boosts the metabolism (through numerous certain procedures) Metabolism is a crucial process that occurs within the body to maintain life. It involves various chemical reactions that break down substances to produce energy and build up other essential molecules. Several procedures can influence metabolism rates, which can help improve overall health, promote weight loss, and increase energy levels. Here is a detailed explanation of several approaches to boost metabolism: 1. Regular Exercise: Physical activity stimulates the metabolism by increasing the body's demand for energy. Engaging in both aerobic and resistance exercises, such as walking, jogging, swimming, and weight lifting, can enhance metabolic rates even when at rest. 2. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT): This form of exercise involves alternating between short periods of intense physical activity and periods of recovery. HIIT has been shown to boost metabolism significantly and lead to greater calorie burning. 3. Eating Protein-rich Foods: Consuming foods high in protein can help boost metabolism since the body uses more energy to digest proteins compared to carbohydrates or fats. Incorporating lean meats, fish, eggs, nuts, and legumes into your diet can stimulate the metabolic process. 4. Drinking Green Tea: Green tea contains epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), an antioxidant that can increase metabolism by promoting a process called thermogenesis – the production of heat in the body. 5. Consuming Caffeine: Caffeine, found in coffee and some teas, can stimulate the central nervous system and boost metabolism in the short term. However, excessive consumption may lead to adverse effects on health. 6. Drinking Cold Water: Drinking cold water has been shown to increase metabolism temporarily since the body needs to expend energy to warm the water to body temperature. 7. Adequate Sleep: Insufficient sleep can negatively affect metabolism, making it essential to get a good night's rest to maintain a healthy metabolic rate. 8. Eating Smaller, Frequent Meals: Consuming smaller meals throughout the day can help regulate blood sugar levels and prevent overeating, both of which can contribute to a stable metabolism. 9. Spices in the Diet: Some spices, such as cayenne pepper, contain compounds that can stimulate metabolism by increasing thermogenesis. 10. Building Muscle Mass: Because muscle tissue requires more energy to maintain than fat, increasing muscle mass through strength training can lead to a higher metabolic rate. 11. Managing Stress: Stress can lead to the release of hormones like cortisol, which can negatively impact metabolism. Using stress management techniques such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, and spending time in nature can help reduce stress and maintain a healthy metabolism. In conclusion, boosting metabolism can be achieved through various procedures involving exercise, diet adjustments, maintaining proper hydration, ensuring adequate sleep, stress management, and building muscle mass. Implementing a combination of these strategies can help improve overall health, weight management, and energy levels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Natives are led by William \\"Bill the Butcher\\" Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis), an American Protestant nativist, with an open hatred of recent immigrants. The leader of the immigrant Irish, the \\"Dead Rabbits\\", is Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson), who has a young son, Amsterdam (played as a child by Cian McCormack). Cutting and Vallon meet with their respective gangs in a horrific and bloody battle, concluding when Bill kills Priest Vallon, which Amsterdam witnesses.

Context: Patch's mother was named Silver, because high summer sun made her fur shine that colour. She had a marvellous drey high up a spruce tree, carved out long ago by a woodpecker, and since extended into a two-chambered home full of bright things. The journey along the sky-road to her drey did not take long. When Patch looked inside, he saw a hundred colours glittering in the sunlight, shining from bits of metal and glass set into Silver's walls and floor. But his mother was not there. He could tell by the faintness of her smell that no squirrel had been here in some time. There were two faint traces of scent, several days old; that of Silver, and that of another squirrel, a musky scent that Patch did not recognize. A scent that made his tail stiffen as if danger was near. Patch stared into his mother's empty drey for a moment. It wasn't normal for a squirrel to abandon her drey for days, not in the middle of winter. And he hadn't seen Silver for three days. Not since all the acorns had disappeared from the earth. Patch ran back to his own tree, and then to the maple tree next door, to his brother Tuft's drey. He ran very fast. He was hungrier than ever, and he was beginning to be very worried. He was relieved when he looked into Tuft's drey and found it occupied. Tuft himself was not present, but Brighteyes was, and their babies, and it was clear from the smells that Tuft had only just departed. \\"Hello, Patch,\\" Brighteyes said weakly. \\"Would you like to come in?\\" Patch entered. Brighteyes was curled up with her babies in the drey's deepest, warmest corner. The last time Patch had visited, a week ago, this had been a den of noise and chaos, with all Brighteyes' four babies running and jumping and playfighting. Today they lay weakly beside Brighteyes, and the once-shining eyes from which their mother had taken her name were dim and clouded. Question: Where did Patch go after checking his mother's drey?

She wanted to have an abortion but as a christian I felt that this was against my beliefs (btw I’m not pro-life, I feel like the option to abort should be there for people that don’t believe what I do but this is what I thought was right for my child). I was graduating that year and already had a pretty well-paying job lined up so I felt that I could provide for my kid. In the end me and my girlfriend came to the agreement that the baby be born but that I would be a single parent since she did not want to have a baby this young. That fall the baby was born and after that she moved back to her home state (she went out of state for college) and I got my son. At the time me and my girlfriend were 21. Fast forward two years and I just feel so tired and secluded from the world. My only friend is my son, between work and him I have no free time. All I do on my free time is go to the park with him, watch kids shows etc. My mom live kinda far away but she visits every few months and lets me have some alone time but it’s not enough. Also I basically have the same job I had when I graduated college with a slight salary increase, I have not been able to take any initiatives at work to qualify me for a promotion due to my parent responsibilities and a lot of people that started after me outrank me now. And I can’t date, like who wants a 23 year old guy with a kid. I just feel unfulfilled and alone and it has started to take it’s form in a little bit of animosity against my son and I never want that to happen. I want to be a great dad that loves his kid but I don’t think I can be that, I’ve tried for two years. You always hear about this undying love you’ll have for your kid but I just never had that. So WIBTA for putting my son up for adoption? I would have to make sure he actually get’s adopted into a stable family like I grew up in and not into a foster home  (don’t know how I would go about that though). The thing that makes me think that I am an asshole is that he has started to form an attachment to me and that it would be unfair on him to leave him and unfair on his grandmother that also has a good connection with him. But what makes me think I’m not an asshole is that I think that his childhood would just get worse the more lonely and unfulfilled I feel and that he’s better off with a more stable family. Please give me your perspective. TLDR: I am a single dad that feels like he’s personal life is interfering with his ability to be a father, WIBTA to put up my two year old for adoption? A:","output":"It is a complex situation, but AUTHOR may be wrong for considering putting his son up for adoption without exploring other options first. He should seek support from family, friends, and community resources to help ease the burden and try to find a balance between his personal life, work, and parenting. Additionally, he could benefit from seeking therapy to cope with his feelings of isolation and unfulfillment. Putting his son up for adoption should be a last resort, after exhausting all other possible solutions. Answer: Yes"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

CHAPTER VIII  AN INFORMAL COURT  One morning, soon after Fuller and his daughter had gone home, Dick stood at a table in the testing house behind the mixing sheds. The small, galvanized iron building shook with the throb of engines and rattle of machinery, and now and then a shower of cinders pattered upon the roof; for the big mill that ground up the concrete was working across the road. The lattice shutters were closed, for the sake of privacy, and kept out the glare, though they could not keep out the heat, which soaked through the thin, iron walls, and Dick's face was wet with perspiration as he arranged a number of small concrete blocks. Some of these were broken, and some partly crushed. Delicate scales and glass measures occupied a neighboring shelf, and a big steel apparatus that looked rather like a lever weighing machine stood in the shadow.  Where the draught that came through the lattices flowed across the room, Bethune lounged in a canvas chair, and another man, with a quiet, sunburned face, sat behind him. This was Stuyvesant, whose authority was only second to Fuller's.  \\"Brandon seems to have taken a good deal of trouble, but this kind of investigation needs the strictest accuracy, and we haven't the best of testing apparatus,\\" Bethune remarked. \\"I expect he'll allow that the results he has got may be to some extent misleading, and I doubt if it's worth while to go on with the matter.

The film begins 4 years after the events of the first one, with George Banks telling the audience he is ready for the empty nest he'll shortly receive with all of his children grown up. Shortly thereafter, Annie tells the family that she's pregnant, and George begins to mildly panic, insisting he is too young to be a grandfather. He has his assistant make a list of people who are older than him, dyes his hair brown, and decides he and Nina should sell the home their children have grown up in if one more thing goes wrong with it. Termites strike the house two weeks later. George puts the house on the market without telling Nina, and sells it to the Habibs. At dinner, after a discussion on whether the baby's last name will be hyphenated or not, George reveals the house has been sold. Nina is livid, as she and George have to be out in 10 days and have no place to go. Having no place to go, the Banks stay at the mansion owned by Bryan's parents. As the MacKenzies are on a cruise in the Caribbean, the Banks have to deal with their vicious Dobermans, much to the chagrin of George, who is still obviously paranoid from a previous mishap with them. Nina begins experiencing symptoms that bring up the concern of menopause. After visiting the doctor the following day, they are given the opposite news: Nina is pregnant, too.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Elizabeth Warren's Birther Moment If you are 1/32 Cherokee and your grandfather has high cheekbones, does that make you Native American? It depends. Last Friday, Republicans in Massachusetts questioned the racial ancestry of Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic Senate candidate. Her opponent, Senator Scott Brown, has accused her of using minority status as an American Indian to advance her career as a law professor at Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Texas. The Brown campaign calls her ties to the Cherokee and Delaware nations a “hypocritical sham.” In a press conference on Wednesday, Warren defended herself, saying, “Native American has been a part of my story, I guess since the day I was born, I don’t know any other way to describe it.” Despite her personal belief in her origins, her opponents have seized this moment in an unnecessary fire drill that guarantees media attention and forestalls real debate. This tactic is straight from the Republican cookbook of fake controversy. First, you need a rarefied elected office typically occupied by a certain breed of privileged men. Both the Presidency and the Senate fit this bill. Second, add a bit of interracial intrigue. It could be Kenyan economists eloping with Midwestern anthropologists, or white frontiersmen pairing with indigenous women. Third, throw in some suspicion about their qualifications and ambitions. Last but not least, demand documentation of ancestry and be dissatisfied upon its receipt. Voila! You have a genuine birther movement. The Republican approach to race is to feign that it is irrelevant — until it becomes politically advantageous to bring it up. Birthers question Obama’s state of origin (and implicitly his multiracial heritage) in efforts to disqualify him from the presidency. They characterize him as “other.” For Warren, Massachusetts Republicans place doubts on her racial claims to portray her as an opportunistic academic seeking special treatment. In both birther camps, opponents look to ancestral origins as the smoking gun, and ride the ambiguity for the duration. Proving Native American ancestry is a complex, bureaucratic process. It’s more than showing up at the tribal enrollment office with a family bible and some black and white pictures. Many people are rejected, even when family lore tells them otherwise. Tribal citizenship depends on descent from an enrolled ancestor, and every tribe has its own requirements. In the Cherokee Nation, there is no minimum blood requirement, which would allow someone with as little as 1/128 Cherokee blood to enroll (that would be a great-great-great-great-great grandparent). Finding that remote relative is not conclusive, however. The ancestor may not have enrolled himself. Or he could have favored assimilation and counted himself as white. Or her application was rejected or she became ineligible for citizenship. Like Elizabeth Warren, I am a law professor who was born in Oklahoma. I am enrolled as a member of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, which, along with the Cherokee Nation, has recently experienced great strife in defining what it means to be Native. In the past year, the arguments have escalated nationwide. Some members say that tribes should be composed only of members with high degrees of Indian blood. Others say it should be geographically based. And some others say citizenship should be based on history and culture, regardless of blood or residence. In my personal opinion, it’s whether you have a fry bread chef-lady as a relative. (In my family, I’m that “lady.”) Even within Indian Country, the meaning of race and citizenship is contested. And now the Brown campaign wants to dictate Warren’s own belief in her identity. According to the Brown campaign, Warren could not be Indian because she is blonde, rich and most of all, a Harvard law professor. Her 1/32 Cherokee ancestry, sufficient for tribal citizenship, is not enough for the Republican party. To most people, she appears as white as, well, Betty White, but to the Scott Brown campaign, she is just Dancing With Wolves. The Brown campaign asserts that Warren knowingly classified herself as Native American in the 1990s when Harvard weathered sharp criticism for its lack of faculty diversity. During this time, they argue, Warren relied upon this classification to enhance her employment opportunities and to improve Harvard’s numbers. Her faculty mentors at Harvard deny this and assert that the law school hired Warren without any knowledge of her ancestry. Admittedly, news of Elizabeth Warren’s Cherokee and Delaware ancestry comes as a surprise. There simply are not enough places in legal academia for Native American professors to hide. The community is tight and small. It’s like “Peyton Place,” but with academic arguments over subject matter jurisdiction. According to the Association of American Law Schools, Native law professors are only .5% of all law faculty — about fifty people out of 11,000. Native faculty are familiar with “box checkers”: those students and faculty who become Native for the temporary moment of admissions or employment. As soon as the application is mailed or the interview completed, the candidate returns to life as usual. The Cherokee Princess Grandmother served her purpose, and her memory is revived at convenient times. This merits a reexamination of the difficult question of what it means to be Native. Does that make the Chickasaw kid from Buckhead in Atlanta any less Native than the Navajo faculty candidate from Windy Gap? What does a Native even look like? It’s more than long black hair, feathers and beads. At the same time, it is more than checking a box. Someone’s subjective opinion about her heritage may conflict with tribal requirements for membership. The standards are not constant, and they may change with new tribal governments. This happened in my tribe in 2002, when the new chief decided that some members were not “Indian enough.” Even at home, the tribal government falls into stereotypes. For the Cherokee Nation, Warren is “Indian enough”; she has the same blood quantum as Cherokee Nation Chief Bill John Baker. For non-Natives, this may be surprising. They expect to see “high cheekbones,” as Warren described her grandfather as having, or tan skin. They want to know of pow wows, dusty reservations, sweat lodges, peyote and cheap cigarettes. When outsiders look at these ostensibly white people as members of Native America, they don’t see minorities. As a result, Warren feels she must satisfy these new birthers and justify her existence. Looked at from the inside, however, the Warren controversy is all new. When the Brown campaign accused Elizabeth Warren of touting herself as American Indian to advance her career, this was news to Native law professors. We have a good eye for welcoming faculty to the community and identifying promising scholars. We know where people teach, what they have published and we honor them when they die. Harvard Law School named its first Native American tenured professor? Really? In our small indigenous faculty town, we would have heard about it already. Kevin Noble Maillard is a law professor at Syracuse University and a member of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma. He is the co-editor of “Loving v. Virginia in a Post Racial World: Rethinking Race, Sex, and Marriage,” which will be published later this month. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses a controversy about Elizabeth Warren, an American politician, who claims to have Native American ancestry. Some people, especially her political opponents, questioned this claim. They suggested that she might be using her alleged Native American status to gain advantages in her career. Warren defended her claim, saying Native American heritage is part of her family story.  But this situation has sparked a larger debate about what it means to be Native American. Some people think you must have a certain amount of Native American 'blood', while others believe it’s about being related to certain families or living in certain places.  So, generally speaking, this article is about the tricky subject of how we define who is a member of a particular race or group, who gets to decide, and what happens when there’s a disagreement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: What coffin did the group first find? Title: Buried Movie plot: On October 23, 2006, Paul Conroy, an American civilian truck driver working in Iraq, wakes up and finds himself buried alive in a wooden coffin, bound and gagged, with only a Zippo lighter and a BlackBerry phone at hand. Although he initially has no idea how he got there, he starts to piece together what has happened to him. He remembers that his and several other trucks were ambushed by terrorists, who killed his colleagues; he was hit by a rock and passed out. He receives a call from his kidnapper, Jabir, demanding that he pay a ransom of 5 million by 9PM or he will be left in the coffin to die. Conroy calls the State Department, which tells him that due to the government policy of not negotiating with terrorists, it will not pay the ransom but will try to rescue him. They connect him with Dan Brenner, head of the Hostage Working Group, who tells Conroy they are doing their best to find him. His kidnapper calls Conroy and demands he make a ransom video, threatening to execute one of his colleagues who survived the attack. Conroy insists that no one will pay 5 million, so the kidnapper drops the amount to 1 million. Despite his compliance in making a video, the kidnappers execute his colleague and send him the recording of it, which he watches in horror. Shortly afterwards, distant explosions shake the area, damaging his coffin, which begins to slowly fill with sand. Conroy continues sporadic phone calls with Brenner, skeptical of the man's promises of help. To reaffirm his wholehearted intentions, Brenner tells Conroy about a 26-year-old named Mark White who was rescued from a similar situation three weeks previously, telling him that the kid is home with his family and happy. Later on, Conroy receives a phone call from his employers, who inform him that he was fired from his job due to an alleged prohibited relationship with a colleague (the one who was executed), and thus he and his family will not be entitled to any benefits or pension he earned during his time with the company.

Han dynasty: The Partisan Prohibitions were repealed during the Yellow Turban Rebellion and Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion in 184 AD, largely because the court did not want to continue to alienate a significant portion of the gentry class who might otherwise join the rebellions. The Yellow Turbans and Five-Pecks-of-Rice adherents belonged to two different hierarchical Daoist religious societies led by faith healers Zhang Jue (d. 184 AD) and Zhang Lu (d. 216 AD), respectively. Zhang Lu's rebellion, in modern northern Sichuan and southern Shaanxi, was not quelled until 215 AD. Zhang Jue's massive rebellion across eight provinces was annihilated by Han forces within a year, however the following decades saw much smaller recurrent uprisings.

Since -12 is multiplied by \\"s\\", we need to do the opposite. The opposite of multiplying is dividing.

According to the radar reconstruction, American 77 reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar scopes at 9:05, east of its last known position. The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C. By 9:25, FAA's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center. They knew American 77 was lost.

Article: Beijing's broadened ban on smoking in public places took effect Thursday, adding force to the effort to hold a smoke-free Olympics. The new rules extend existing anti-smoking regulations to more places, including fitness centers, cultural relic sites, offices, meeting rooms, dining halls, toilets and lifts. Restaurants, Internet cafes, parks, and waiting halls at airports, railway stations and coach stations are required to set up smoking areas. Hotels will have to offer smoke-free rooms or floors, but the regulations do not specify a proportion. However, some restaurant owners have complained that it would be difficult to have a separate smoking room as required by the new regulations. \\"We plan to issue specific rules to solve this problem as soon as possible,\\" Rao Yingsheng, vice-director of the Beijing Committee for Patriotic Public Health Campaign, was quoted by the Beijing News as saying Thursday. He said small restaurants without a separate room should set aside at least 70 percent of their area for non-smokers. He also said customers and restaurant owners would be asked for their thoughts on the new rule. Local authorities dispatched about 100,000 inspectors to make sure the ban was being enforced Thursday. Everyone has the right to dissuade people from smoking in public places, Liu Zejun, who works for the Beijing committee, said. \\"Citizens are encouraged to expose those who refuse to obey the rule by calling the free telephone line 12320,\\" Liu said. People caught smoking in forbidden areas will be fined 10 yuan (1.40), while enterprises and institutions that violate  the ban will face fines of between 1,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan. Smoking was forbidden in hospitals, kindergartens, schools, museums, sports venues and other places before the new regulations took effect. From Oct 1 last year, the city also banned smoking in its 66,000 cabs, and imposed fines of 100 yuan to 200 yuan on drivers caught smoking in taxis.

Title: Interstate 60 Movie plot: The story begins in a bar, where two men are discussing a thesis statement for an upcoming paper. One of them asserts that out of all the different realms of the world, America has no mythological character that grants wishes. Their conversation is interrupted by a man (Wayne Robson) who claims that they are wrong, and that such a character does exist. The man goes on to explain that this character is a man named O.W. Grant, the son of a Leprechaun and a Cheyenne Indian. The man explains that O.W. is more so apt to play tricks on people, but that every so often, he takes a shine to some of them. When the two men ask this stranger just what O.W. Grant looks like, the fellow replies that he wears a red bow tie, and smokes a pipe carved in the shape of a monkey-head. As the man leaves the two, he mentions that O.W. can be found along Interstate 60. The two men go to a nearby map, and after looking over the roadways, think the guy they were talking to must have been pulling there leg, as there is no Interstate 60.The scene then cuts to real-as-life O.W. Grant (Gary Oldman), wearing a red bow tie, and smoking a pipe carved in the shape of monkey-head (just as the guy described). Going down a street, a guy in a parked car to his right opens the driver's side door, not realizing O.W. is about to pass alongside. O.W. falls from his bike, breaking the jaw on his monkey-head pipe. As the man apologizes and attempts to help him up, a truck comes along, running over Grant's bike, and destroying the man's cellular phone. The destruction of the cellphone causes the man to break into a fury, cursing how he wishes the incident had never happened. Grant asks if the man means the wish, and when the angered fellow replies positively, Grant places his pipe in his mouth, and green smoke envelopes the two of them.The scene begins again, with Grant riding along the same path (though his monkey-head pipe is now broken). Just before Grant reaches the car, he stops. The man on the phone inside, gets out of the car... and steps right... The answer to this question is:","output":"The old man at the bar said that O.W.

Q:Information:  - Acanthostega (meaning \\"spiny roof\\") is an extinct genus of stem-tetrapod, among the first vertebrate animals to have recognizable limbs. It appeared in the late Devonian period (Famennian age) about 365 million years ago, and was anatomically intermediate between lobe-finned fishes and those that were fully capable of coming onto land.  - The Carboniferous is a geologic period and system that spans 60 million years from the end of the Devonian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Permian Period, Mya. The name \\"Carboniferous\\" means \\"coal-bearing\\" and derives from the Latin words \\"carb\\" (\\"coal\\") and \\"fer\\" (\\"I bear, I carry\\"), and was coined by geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822. Based on a study of the British rock succession, it was the first of the modern 'system' names to be employed, and reflects the fact that many coal beds were formed globally during that time. The Carboniferous is often treated in North America as two geological periods, the earlier Mississippian and the later Pennsylvanian.  - Eogyrinus attheyi ( from Greek eos , meaning \`\` dawn '' , and gyrinos , meaning \`\` tadpole '' ) was one of the largest Carboniferous tetrapods , and perhaps one of the largest of its family , Eogyrinidae , at 4.6 metres ( 15 ft ) in length . Eogyrinus appears to have been a powerful swimmer that moved quickly through the water by swishing its long tail from side to side . It may have been a predator , lying in wait for prey in much the same way as a modern crocodile . It was a lightly built animal , weighing around 560 kilograms ( 1,230 lb ) . Although probably better at hunting in the water , Eogyrinus could probably have also made a grab for prey passing close by on land . Fossils of Eogyrinus are known from northern England . Recent studies by Jennifer A. Clack suggest that the amphibian Pholiderpeton described by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1869 is the same animal as Eogyrinus . If this is so , then Pholiderpeton 's name takes priority .  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present.  - Eogyrinidae is an extinct family of large, long-bodied tetrapods that lived in the rivers of the Late Carboniferous period.

Draw your line.\\" Article:","output":"Title: The Magical World of Drawing Lines with the y=mx+b Formula Hey there, little explorers! Today, we're going on an adventure into the land of shapes, colors, and lines. Our magical tool for the day is the y=mx+b formula. Now you may be wondering, \\"What on earth is the y=mx+b formula?\\" Well, it's a magical way to help us draw straight lines.  Remember when you played with your crayons and tried to draw a straight line? Sometimes it was tricky, right? But, with the help of the y=mx+b formula, we can draw beautiful straight lines every time. Let's learn how to use this amazing tool. Step 1: Understand what the formula means. The y=mx+b formula looks like a funny little code, doesn't it? But don't worry, it's not that hard. Let's break it down into smaller pieces. - y and x are like two friends who help us to find a cool spot on the paper to draw the line. - m is like a slide that tells us how steep the line we're going to draw should be. - b is our special buddy who shows us where to start drawing our line on the paper. Step 2: Find your line's y-intercept (b). The y-intercept (b) is where your line will cross the vertical line on your graph paper called the y-axis. It's your starting point for drawing the line. So we first need to find that spot (the y-intercept). Your teacher or parent might give you the number for 'b', or you'll find it in a math problem. Step 3: Find the slope (m). Next, we'll need to know the slope (m). This number tells us how steep the line is going to be, like how steep a slide is at the playground. If the slope is a big number, the line will be super steep, and if it's a small number, it will be more like a gentle hill. Your teacher or parent might give you this number too, or you'll find it in your math problem. Step 4: Draw your graph. Now, it's time for the fun part - drawing! Grab your graph paper, some colored pencils, or crayons. Start by drawing two perpendicular lines called the x-axis (horizontal line) and the y-axis (vertical line). These lines are like roads that help us find the perfect spot to draw our line. Step 5: Draw your line. Here comes the exciting part! First, find the y-intercept (b) on the y-axis – this is where our line will begin. Then, use the slope (m) to guide you as you draw the line. You'll need to go up or down the y-axis as directed by the slope, and then move to the left or right on the x-axis. It's like a fun dance move! And ta-da! You've now drawn a beautiful straight line using the y=mx+b formula. You're like an artist and a math wizard all at once! Now that you know how to use the magical y=mx+b formula, you can draw straight lines with ease, impress your friends, and make your drawings and graphs look amazing!"},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

A Better Way to Keep Patients Safe Not long ago, a few colleagues and I were discussing the challenges of improving health care quality and patient safety. We debated the merits of clinical benchmarks that payers and regulatory groups now require, crude proxies of quality care like giving antibiotics at certain times, ordering specific tests at set intervals or permitting our results to be reported publicly. One colleague, a devoted and highly respected clinician in his department, admitted that he found this growing list of directives from others exasperating. “I’m all for taking great care of patients,” he said, the muscles along his jaw tightening. “But how can some insurance bureaucrat or policy wonk who’s not in the clinical trenches know more about taking good care of real patients than someone like me?” Since 1999, when a national panel of experts released a landmark report on the high number of medical errors, insurers, policy makers and regulatory groups have been piling onto the quality-improvement wagon with ever increasing gusto. As a result of their enthusiastic efforts, hospital accreditation procedures and standards have become more rigorous, physician duty hours have been trimmed, hand-sanitizing gel dispensers in hospitals have multiplied and physician reimbursement has been linked increasingly with quality goals and less with the number of CT scans ordered. But few of these quality enthusiasts are actually caring for patients. And when a study in The New England Journal of Medicine last fall reported that despite all the efforts and new financial incentives, there was no significant decrease in patient injuries, these same enthusiasts were quick to point to the inertia and intractable attitudes of the medical “culture.” They noted that less than 2 percent of hospitals had installed comprehensive electronic medical records systems, doctors and nurses were routinely working in excess of limits on duty hours and few were paying attention to even simple hand-washing recommendations. It would take nothing short of an all-out legislative, financial and regulatory assault to change the system, many of them concluded. But what these “experts” failed to take into account was the same thing that has led to the downfall of countless other groups’ efforts to create sustainable change: They ignored the contributions of the people within the system. There have been a handful of grassroots endeavors, but most have focused on specific clinical dilemmas. Now that may be changing. Last week, nearly 1,000 surgeons, nurses and hospital administrators from across the country convened in Boston to discuss what is quickly becoming one of the most far-reaching of such efforts, the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from the American College of Surgeons, the largest professional organization of surgeons. With the average American undergoing nine operations in his or her lifetime, the implications of a program that can improve how patients do after surgery are enormous. Based on an initiative in the 1990s that sharply decreased surgical complication rates in the Veterans Health Administration, the program was offered to all hospitals beginning in 2004 and is now used by surgeons at more than 400 institutions. Unlike most other quality programs, which gather data from insurance claims and coding data, it relies on information from patients’ hospital charts and follows patients for 30 days. A detailed analysis, along with statistics comparing results with those of all other participating hospitals, is then sent back to participating hospitals. “When you feed back data that clinicians can believe and tell them that there is room to improve, most will work to get better,” said Dr. Clifford Y. Ko, who has directed the program for the last five years. Surgeons and hospitals that discover, for example, that their rate of wound infections after surgery is higher than other participating hospitals have convened forums to discuss the issue, established electronic checklists to remind staff to administer timely prophylactic antibiotics and instituted mandatory training courses to improve how doctors and nurses care for patients’ incision sites before, during and after an operation. The efforts pay off. Within two years of adopting the program, almost 70 percent of hospitals decrease their mortality rates, and over 80 percent decrease their complication rates. Costs also decrease. Surgeons at Baptist Hospital in Miami, for example, reduced their rate of surgical incision infections to less than 2 percent from 4.5 percent and saved 4 million each year. Surgeons at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit ended up saving their institution 2 million annually by decreasing their patients’ average hospital stays by almost two days. “If a surgeon is doing several hundred operations a year and the department is doing several thousand, it’s difficult to keep track of all the urinary tract infections that patients might be having,” said Dr. Fabrizio Michelassi, surgeon in chief at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, which has been a part of the surgical improvement program for several years. “NSQIP has the power to let us examine complications and outcomes on a large scale, drill down and make systemwide changes, then see their effects.” The program has also slowly transformed the traditional hierarchy of surgery. Nurses are crucial members of the surgical quality improvement team at each site, and employees from administration, pharmacy and central processing and sterilization are sometimes included on review teams. “There isn’t anyone who isn’t a part of this process,” said Jennifer Ritz, a nurse who has helped to run NSQIP at Henry Ford Hospital since 2006. But not all hospitals have adopted the program. Many are already overwhelmed with the administrative demands of existing quality improvement programs, and the cost — a yearly fee of 10,000 to 24,000, plus the training and support of at least one full-time nurse — can be prohibitive. There’s also no immediate return on investment. “If you buy some high-tech surgical robot, more patients and surgeons are going to come to your hospital,” said Dr. Dennis Begos, chairman of surgery at Winchester Hospital, a 250-bed community hospital north of Boston that participates in the program. The American College of Surgeons hopes eventually to collaborate with regulatory and federal agencies so that more hospitals, and patients, might be able to benefit. And it’s working with participating hospitals to further refine the program. “We all know that it’s hard to move the quality improvement dial,” Dr. Ko said. “But NSQIP has shown us that it is really possible to change care and give our patients better outcomes. “And that quality improvement is local.” What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses the challenges of improving health care quality and patient safety and focuses on the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) as a potential solution.

It meanders through a maze of underdeveloped subplots, never quite settling long enough to allow the audience to grow interested in any of them. Honestly, it seems as though the scriptwriter penned the gobbledygook whilst battling a persistent case of amnesia, continually forgetting where they were in the story, and haphazardly cramming in contrived twists and turns to piece arcane fragments together. The dialogue blindly stumbles through clichés and tired, overused tropes, with a plethora of cringe-worthy attempts to mimic pop culture references ironically dating the film rather than making it relevant. This dismal script does no favors for an already hopeless cast as they try to breathe life into their one-dimensional characters. The acting, if one can call it that, is woefully inadequate, reminiscent of a poorly rehearsed high school theater production. Each performance is either ludicrously over-the-top or lifeless, with actors seemingly unable to escape the gravitational pull of mediocrity. It's evident that the director failed to communicate their artistic vision, allowing the lead actors to clash in style, resulting in a cacophony of painful performances devoid of any semblance of chemistry. The soundtrack is a confusing, disjointed mess that only adds to the perplexity of the film. The mixing is nothing short of amateurish, with unsuitable choices of songs that not only overshadow the on-screen action but also induce auditory whiplash. It's as if the music supervisor took three random CDs from a dusty bargain bin and used the selections indiscriminately, without a whisper of thought for tone or ambiance. As for the cinematography, it is mind-boggling how it alternates between nausea-inducing shaky cam and seemingly random pans and zooms. Scenes feel like they have been plucked from dubious YouTube video tutorials on how to wield a camera. Adding insult to injury, the editing is choppy and jarring, rendering entire sequences incomprehensible as the viewer can do little more than squint in a futile attempt to make some sense of the chaos unfolding before their eyes. Visual effects, for the most part, are virtually non-existent. However, the few times they are employed, they scream of budget deficits and an uncreative reliance on outdated technology. It's genuinely astounding how the visual effects here manage to be both minimalistic and garish, leaving the eyes assaulted and begging for respite. In conclusion, \\"Blundering Beyond\\" is a testament to film-making gone horribly awry. It's a painful and mind-numbing experience, leaving the viewer with a dizzying sense of disconnectedness from reality. Avoiding this film is not only a recommendation but an appeal for the preservation of one's sanity and any remaining faith in the sacred art of cinema."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Answer the following question: Information:  - The IBM Personal Computer, commonly known as the IBM PC, is the original version and progenitor of the IBM PC compatible hardware platform. It is IBM model number 5150, and was introduced on August 12, 1981. It was created by a team of engineers and designers under the direction of Don Estridge of the IBM Entry Systems Division in Boca Raton, Florida.  - IBM PC compatible computers are those similar to the original IBM PC, XT, and AT, able to run the same software and support the same expansion cards as those. Such computers used to be referred to as PC clones, or IBM clones. They duplicate almost exactly all the significant features of the PC architecture, facilitated by IBM's choice of commodity hardware components and various manufacturers' ability to reverse engineer the BIOS firmware using a \\"clean room design\\" technique. Columbia Data Products built the first clone of the IBM personal computer by a clean room implementation of its BIOS.  - The expansion card (also expansion board, adapter card or accessory card) in computing is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an electrical connector, or expansion slot on a computer motherboard, backplane or riser card to add functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus.  - Columbia Data Products (CDP) is a company that produced some of the first IBM PC clones. It faltered in that market after only a few years, and later reinvented itself as a software development company.  - Clean room design (also known as the Chinese wall technique) is the method of copying a design by reverse engineering and then recreating it without infringing any of the copyrights associated with the original design. Clean room design is useful as a defense against copyright infringement because it relies on independent invention. However, because independent invention is not a defense against patents, clean room designs typically cannot be used to circumvent patent restrictions.  - The dot-com bubble (also known as the dot-com boom, the tech bubble, the Internet bubble, the dot-com collapse, and the information technology bubble) was a historic speculative bubble covering roughly 19952001 during which stock markets in industrialized nations saw their equity value rise rapidly from growth in the Internet sector and related fields. While the latter part was a boom and bust cycle, the Internet boom is sometimes meant to refer to the steady commercial growth of the Internet with the advent of the World Wide Web, as exemplified by the first release of the Mosaic web browser in 1993, and continuing through the 1990s.  - The BIOS (an acronym for Basic Input/Output System and also known as the System BIOS, ROM BIOS or PC BIOS) is a type of firmware used to perform hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on startup) on IBM PC compatible computers, and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs. The BIOS firmware is built into personal computers (PCs), and it is the first software they run when powered on. The name itself originates from the Basic Input/Output System used in the CP/M operating system in 1975. Originally proprietary to the IBM PC, the BIOS has been reverse engineered by companies looking to create compatible systems and the interface of that original system serves as a \\"de facto\\" standard.  - A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose electronic computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. PCs are intended to be operated directly by a person using a graphical user interface such as Windows. The versatility of a personal computer is greatly enhanced by the use of peripheral devices such as a keyboard, monitor, printer, mouse, speakers, and an external hard drive.  - The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland.  - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing.  - Compaq Computer Corporation was a company founded in 1982 that developed , sold , and supported computers and related products and services . Compaq produced some of the first IBM PC compatible computers , being the first company to legally reverse engineer the IBM Personal Computer . It rose to become the largest supplier of PC systems during the 1990s before being overtaken by HP in 2001 . Struggling in the aftermath of the dot - com bubble bust , Compaq was acquired for US  25 billion by HP in 2002 . The Compaq brand remained in use by HP for lower - end systems until 2013 when , without warning , the Compaq name was quietly discontinued . The company was formed by Rod Canion , Jim Harris and Bill Murto -- former Texas Instruments senior managers . Murto ( SVP of Sales ) departed Compaq in 1987 , while Canion ( President and CEO ) and Harris ( SVP of Engineering ) left under a shakeup in 1991 , which saw Eckhard Pfeiffer appointed President and CEO . Pfeiffer served through the 1990s . Ben Rosen provided the venture capital financing for the fledgling company and served as chairman of the board for 18 years from 1983 until September 28 , 2000 , when he retired and was succeeded by Michael Capellas , who served as the last Chairman and CEO until its merger with HP. Prior to its takeover the company was headquartered in a facility in northwest unincorporated Harris County , Texas , that now continues as HP 's largest United States facility .

Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Epidemiologic studies suggest that ovarian hormones contribute to the development of breast cancer at all stages. Early menopause and premenopausal obesity reduces the risk while postmenopausal obesity and menopausal estrogen replacement therapy increases the risk. Combined oral contraceptives and Depo-Provera do not reduce the risk. It appears that estrogens and progestogens act through and with proto-oncogenes and growth factors to affect breast cell proliferation and breast cancer etiology. Animal studies suggest that estrogen causes interlobular ductal cell division and progesterone causes increased terminal duct lobular unit cell division in the luteal phase. Most breast carcinomas originate from terminal duct lobular unit cells. During pregnancy, these cells fully multiply. Their reproduction is also increased during the luteal phase. Yet, there is considerable interpersonal variation. No studies examining breast cell division have compared cell division rates with serum hormone concentrations, however. The peak of mitosis occurs about 3 days before breast cell death in the late luteal and very early follicular phases. Other research suggests that breast stem cell proliferation is linked to breast cancer development. Endocrine therapy reduces mitotic activity, indicating the estrogen and progesterone receptor content of breast cancers. Hormone-dependent breast cancer cell lines are all estrogen-dependent. Progesterone can block the estrogen-dependent cell lines which act like endometrial cells. The results of the various breast cell proliferation studies in relation to breast cancer are unclear and research identifying a molecular explanation would help in understanding the different findings.

It was an aircraft that in fact had not been hijacked at all. After the second World Trade Center crash, Boston Center managers recognized that both aircraft were transcontinental 767 jetliners that had departed Logan Airport. Remembering the \\"we have some planes\\" remark, Boston Center guessed that Delta 1989 might also be hijacked. Boston Center called NEADS at 9:41 and identified Delta 1989, a 767 jet that had left Logan Airport for Las Vegas, as a possible hijack. NEADS warned the FAA's Cleveland Center to watch Delta 1989. The Command Center and FAA headquarters watched it too. During the course of the morning, there were multiple erroneous reports of hijacked aircraft. The report of American 11 heading south was the first; Delta 1989 was the second. NEADS never lost track of Delta 1989, and even ordered fighter aircraft from Ohio and Michigan to intercept it. The flight never turned off its transponder. NEADS soon learned that the aircraft was not hijacked, and tracked Delta 1989 as it reversed course over Toledo, headed east, and landed in Cleveland.

Movie title: The Witches of Eastwick Movie plot: Alexandra Medford (Cher), Jane Spofford (Susan Sarandon), and Sukie Ridgemont (Michelle Pfeiffer) are three dissatisfied women living in the picturesque town of Eastwick, Rhode Island. Alex is a sculptor and single mother of one daughter; Jane is a newly divorced music teacher unable to have children; while Sukie has six daughters and works as a columnist for the Eastwick Word, the local newspaper. The three friends all have lost their husbands (Alex's died, Jane's divorced her, and Sukie's abandoned her). Unaware that they are witches, the women unwittingly form a coven where they have weekly get-togethers and share their fantasies about ideal men. A mysterious man (Jack Nicholson) arrives in town and stirs up trouble by buying the town's landmark property: the Lennox Mansion. The arrival of this enigmatic stranger fascinates the townsfolk, all except for Felicia Alden (Veronica Cartwright), the devoutly religious wife of newspaper editor Clyde Alden (Richard Jenkins), Sukie's boss. Felicia senses that this man (whose name is easily forgotten) is up to no good. One night, at one of Jane's music recitals, the strange man appears and makes a spectacle of himself, which leads to more gossip. After the recital, Jane receives a bouquet of flowers with the initial D written on it. This sparks Sukie's memory, finally revealing the man's name as Daryl Van Horne. However, as chaos over the name spreads through the crowd, Sukie's bead necklace inexplicably breaks and falls to the floor, causing Felicia (who had mocked Daryl's name) to trip down a large staircase and break her leg. The following day, Daryl sets out to seduce Alex. As he converses with her, he says insensitive, disgusting, and rude things every time he speaks. Appalled, she tells him off, refuses his amorous advances, and begins to walk out. Before she opens the door, he speaks to her, manipulating her emotions until she eventually agrees. The next morning, Daryl visits the shy and insecure Jane.

Still hungry for their first road win of the season, the Steelers traveled to LP Field to take on longtime and former divisional rivals the Tennessee Titans.  Scoring began early in the first quarter as the Titans took a 3-0 lead after Rob Bironas's 22-yard field goal.  The Steelers responded with Suisham's 29-yard field goal to tie the game 3-3.  The Steelers took the lead after Roethlisberger connected with Mike Wallace for an 82-yard touchdown pass to take a 10-3 lead.  The Titans drew closer with Bironas's 38-yard field goal to shorten the lead 10-6.  In the 2nd quarter, the Titans retook the lead with Jamie Harper's 1-yard touchdown run to make the score 13-10.  They would increase their lead with yet another Bironas field goal from 47 yards out to increase their lead 16-10 at halftime.  The Steelers moved down the field in spite of a 28-yard field goal to make the score 16-13 for the only score of the 3rd quarter.  In the fourth quarter, the Steelers retook the lead with Baron Batch's 1-yard TD run to make the score 20-16 and then increased their lead with Suisham's 52-yard field goal for a 23-16 lead.  After thinking all was lost, the Titans drove down the field for a comeback attempt.  Matt Hasselbeck threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Kenny Britt to tie the game at 23-23.  After Suisham missed a game-winning 54-yard field goal, the Titans again drove down the field and ended the game with Bironas's 40-yard field goal to make the final score 26-23.  The loss to the Titans was the first for the Steelers since their 31-14 loss against them in 2008 which was also in Tennessee.

Given the question: Q: What debated therapy offers a potential method for replacing neurons lost to injury or disease?    Choices:  - cell production therapy  - stem cell reduction  - cell duplication  - stem cell therapy  A: The answer is:","output":"Stem cell therapy. Stem cell therapy is a debated therapy that offers a potential method for replacing neurons lost to injury or disease. This approach involves using stem cells, which are unique cells that can develop into multiple types of specialized cells. In the case of neuronal damage, the goal is to introduce stem cells that can then differentiate into the needed neural cells, allowing for the replacement of damaged or lost neurons. The debate surrounding stem cell therapy is due to ethical concerns, particularly in the case of embryonic stem cells (which are derived from human embryos). Some people argue that the use of these cells is morally unacceptable, whereas others believe that the potential benefits in terms of treating neurological disorders and injuries outweigh the ethical concerns. Alternative sources of stem cells – such as adult stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (which are adult cells reprogrammed to resemble embryonic stem cells) – have been identified and may help to address some of these ethical issues. Nevertheless, stem cell therapy has shown promise in preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials for treating various neurological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injuries. Ongoing research is being conducted to optimize the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapies for these and other diseases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Estonia Perhaps the most famous raid by Oeselian pirates occurred in 1187, with the attack on the Swedish town of Sigtuna by Finnic raiders from Couronia and Oesel. Among the casualties of this raid was the Swedish archbishop Johannes. The city remained occupied for some time, contributing to its decline as a center of commerce in the 13th century and the rise of Uppsala, Visby, Kalmar and Stockholm. The Livonian Chronicle describes the Oeselians as using two kinds of ships, the piratica and the liburna. The former was a warship, the latter mainly a merchant ship. A piratica could carry approximately 30 men and had a high prow shaped like a dragon or a snakehead and a rectangular sail. Viking-age treasures from Estonia mostly contain silver coins and bars. Saaremaa has the richest finds of Viking treasures after Gotland in Sweden. This strongly suggests that Estonia was an important transit country during the Viking era.

Here is a news article: The Trump administration called on the U.S. Supreme Court to let bakers and potentially other wedding vendors to refuse on free-speech grounds to provide services for same-sex ceremonies.      Taking a side in one of the most hotly contested cases of the upcoming term, the administration urged the court to scale back Colorado’s equal-access law so that baker Jack Phillips isn’t forced to \\"create expression\\" against his will and his religious beliefs. The brief argues that his free-speech rights outweigh the state’s interest in preventing discrimination in commercial transactions. The court is set to hear arguments, probably in late November or early December. ||||| House and Senate Republicans are throwing their support behind the owner of a Colorado cake shop who refused to make a cake for a same-sex wedding in a case headed to the Supreme Court.      GOP lawmakers announced plans Thursday to send an amicus brief on behalf of Jack Phillips, the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop.      Phillips is challenging whether the state can force him to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding under its public accommodations law, arguing that his constitutional rights to freedom of speech and the free exercise of religion are violated if he is required to make a wedding cake for Charlie Craig and David Mullins's marriage.      The amicus brief, which has 86 signatures so far, will be filed with the court in the coming days.

The government cannot force you to speak where you would choose to remain silent. It cannot make a statement with which you firmly fundamentally disagree. These are foundational pillars of the American legal system and our Constitution.”      Phillips, who will appear before the Supreme Court later this term, said he has lost 40 percent of his business and most of his staff for standing up for what he believes.      His attorney, Kristen Waggoner, senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom, said Phillips should be able to retain his right to disagree and live consistent with his convictions.      “We know tolerance is a two-way street and dignity cuts both ways,” she said. “We need to protect the right of all Americans to live and work consistent with their religious beliefs and not force creative professions to create visual art that violates who they are.”      The Colorado Civil Rights Division, which is named in the suit along with the couple that was denied the cake, said in briefs there was no discussion between Phillips and the couple about what the cake should actually look like.      “Petitioners acted not based on the design of the requested cake or the message it might have conveyed, but based on a blanket policy of refusing to sell a wedding cake of any kind to any same-sex couple,” it said. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"In this news article, it talks about a man named Jack Phillips who has a cake shop.

At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity.

During the new year, the Nixon administration took what it called a \\"strategic counter-measure\\" against Lennon's anti-war and anti-Nixon propaganda. The administration embarked on what would be a four-year attempt to deport him. Lennon was embroiled in a continuing legal battle with the immigration authorities, and he was denied permanent residency in the US; the issue would not be resolved until 1976.Some Time in New York City was recorded as a collaboration with Ono and was released in 1972 with backing from the New York band Elephant's Memory. A double LP, it contained songs about women's rights, race relations, Britain's role in Northern Ireland and Lennon's difficulties in obtaining a green card. The album was a commercial failure and was maligned by critics, who found its political sloganeering heavy-handed and relentless. The NME's review took the form of an open letter in which Tony Tyler derided Lennon as a \\"pathetic, ageing revolutionary\\". In the US, \\"Woman Is the Nigger of the World\\" was released as a single from the album and was televised on 11 May, on The Dick Cavett Show.

Article: There is a popular belief among parents that schools are no longer interested in spelling. No school I have ever taught in has ever ignored spelling or considered it unimportant as a basic skill. There are, however, different ideas about how to teach it, or how much priority   it must be given over general language development and writing ability. The problem is how to encourage a child to express himself freely and confidently in writing without holding him back with the complexities   of spelling. If spelling becomes the only focal   point of his teacher's interest, clearly a bright child will be likely to \\"play safe\\". He will tend to write only words within his spelling range, choosing to avoid adventurous language. That's why teachers often encourage the early use of dictionaries and pay attention to content rather than technical ability. I was once shocked to read on the bottom of a sensitive piece of writing about a personal experience: \\"This work is terrible! There are far too many spelling errors and your writing is terrible.\\" It may have been a sharp criticism of the pupil's technical abilities in writing, but it was also a sad reflection on the teacher who had omitted to read the essay, which contained some beautiful expressions of the child's deep feelings. The teacher was not wrong to draw attention to the errors, but if his priorities had centered on the child's ideas, an expression of his disappointment with the presentation would have given the pupil more motivation   to seek improvement.

In contrast, polycrystalline materials do not generally transmit visible light. The individual crystallites may be transparent, but their facets (grain boundaries) reflect or scatter light resulting in diffuse reflection. Glass does not contain the internal subdivisions associated with grain boundaries in polycrystals and hence does not scatter light in the same manner as a polycrystalline material. The surface of a glass is often smooth since during glass formation the molecules of the supercooled liquid are not forced to dispose in rigid crystal geometries and can follow surface tension, which imposes a microscopically smooth surface. These properties, which give glass its clearness, can be retained even if glass is partially light-absorbing—i.e., colored. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". What does glass lack, allowing it to be polycrystalline?","output":"Glass is a special material that we can see through.

Computer Chess: Hollywood needs a new gambit when it comes to chess Throw a rock at the sports genre and you'll hit a film about baseball or football, or hockey, or racing. Odds are, you won't strike a film about chess. Chess isn't generally considered a stadium filler (although it can be). It's perceived as a game for eccentric intellectuals and elderly historians. It doesn't have the glamour or sex appeal of more sedentary sports, such as pool, as demonstrated by Paul Newman in The Hustler. Chess won't even fit snugly in to other genre films, where the banality of cards, for example, naturally lends itself to a seedy, gambling gangster underworld (Rounders), the exotic highlife of a casino (Casino Royale), or even more piquant, a combo of the two (Ocean's Eleven). But chess? It's just too uncool, and Computer Chess only serves to compound that. In cinemas this week, Computer Chess is the latest feature from mumblecore pioneer, director Andrew Bujalski, his first since Beeswax, in 2009. It's a fly on the wall, almost mockumentary-style dry comedy, following a computer chess tournament as it unfolds over a weekend. It could have been a proud starring role for the game, a film for the Magnus Carlsen era (the young prodigy and new World Champion described as the Harry Potter of the sport). Alas, neither the game nor the players are shown in a particularly endearing light. Sadly, this seems to be the fate of chess throughout the course of cinema. Reading on mobile? Click here to view video Chess doesn't lend itself to the physicality of the movies, least of all blockbusters. On the seldom occasions it makes an appearance, it is usually merely a prop to emphasise intellect or cunning, or as a material analogy to illustrate a scheming mind. Take the classic example of Blade Runner, in which a battle of wits between Roy Batty and Dr Eldon Tyrell plays out by remote across a chessboard. It's a pivotal scene, and the moment Tyrell succumbs to defeat by unintentionally welcoming Batty in to his private quarters. But how does it translate to film? \\"Queen to bishop six, check,\\" is the initial attack. \\"Knight takes queen,\\" the retort. The final blow: \\"Bishop to king seven. Checkmate.\\" As Tyrell himself articulates: \\"Nonsense.\\" And sadly, to the vast majority of viewers, it most likely is. Chess enthusiasts might correctly identify this sequence from the Immortal Game, played by Anderssen v Kieseritzky in London in 1851. Similarly, Guy Ritchie weaves a nail-biting game of chess into the climax of Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, an on-the-nose metaphor for the action taking place, although Moriarty does offer some exposition for any audience members still confused by the moves: \\"May I remind you this is blitz chess – a single miscalculation will cost you the game.\\" Reading on mobile?

To the uninitiated, an early castling by Crown probably looks foolish, but the chess is merely a backdrop for the sultry Vicki Anderson to flash a little side cleavage and raise the temperature. Indeed, Thomas Crown is shown to be distinctly hot under the collar, and ultimately the game ends off the board, with checkmate between the sheets … (Incidentally, this scene is hilariously parodied in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me) One of the difficulties for directors is to convey on film the momentous significance of movements on the board. Even for amateurs, but especially for the layman, easily visualising a chessboard is a rare ability, and a failure to visualise – let alone comprehend and interpret the positional strengths of the pieces – means any subtle shift in the power play is lost. In most other sports, a simple cutaway to the scoreboard telegraphs the balance of the game; and the actions of the players (netting goals, batting sixes or whatever) demonstrates the strength of one team or player over the other. The inability to portray chess in the same tangible fashion is doubtless one reason it's so often shirked by film-makers. Perhaps this is why one of the most successful integrations of chess within film is actually in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, where JK Rowling placed the characters on a giant board, and where a wrong move results in destruction and sacrifice. It is concrete, visceral and accessible – not to mention wonderfully realised by director Chris Columbus. Reading on mobile?

Back in 1925, the silent Soviet Union short comedy Chess Fever starred the chess world champion José Raúl Capablanca, among cameos from other famed players, and in 1957, Bergman's The Seventh Seal saw the ultimate chess game as a man plays the grim reaper. Switzerland has comedy Ivory Tower (2010), France has The Chess Player (1927) and Dangerous Moves (1984). The Netherlands produced Long Live the Queen (1995), a beautifully poignant fairy tale, while Germany crafted Three Moves to Freedom (1960). In English language cinema, however, chess films are few and far between and, for the most part, woefully underwhelming. Probably the most successful and certainly the most straightforward sports drama, Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993), is excellent, touching and well acted, charting the development of chess whizz Josh Waitzkin from anonymity to acclaim. It's an anomaly in film – a triumphant display, easily rivaling other sport biopics, where chess really is the centrepiece. A year later and a few rungs down the ladder hangs Fresh, in which a drug runner and prodigy chess player apply the game's tactics to find an edge in the real world. It's an enthralling movie, and the inclusion of chess is certainly more than perfunctory, but it nonetheless takes a backseat to drug dealing. And would a real chess film make the grievous error of messing up the gameplay? Escaping a check with another check is an invalid move! In addition to Searching and Fresh, the 90s saw a spate of substandard crime thrillers, each seeking to portray a sinister side to chess. Knight Moves (not to be confused with the decent 1975 Gene Hackman crime thriller, Night Moves) arrived in 1992, and was an overly sincere attempt to entwine the game with a serial killer noir. Unsurprisingly, sauciness and chess isn't confined to The Thomas Crown Affair. Indeed, sex and chess seems to be a persistent theme, the former being the one reliable antidote to all things deemed too dull for audience viewing. Between passionate bouts of intercourse, Knight Moves explores the egos behind chess, suggesting high intelligence and mentally deranged psychopaths are par for the course. In doing so, it strips aside the significance of the game's setting, and ultimately draws on the same box of tricks as every other psycho-killer thriller. Perhaps taking cues from the latter, director Jim McBride unleashed Uncovered, a film that makes every effort to prove that chess goes hand in hand with crime and intrigue, where the chess pieces are the clues to murder and are taken entirely literally, knight for knight, castle for castle. Release in 1994, it's unbelievably bad, but speaks volumes of the attempts to sex up chess for public consumption. An utterly bizarre sexual undercurrent throughout, way beyond ordinary 90s smut, includes one memorable scene in which lead actress Kate Beckinsale, 19 at the time, is reflected fully naked in the chessboard, her breasts literally overlaid upon the pieces. It doesn't get any more obvious than that: chess can be sexy! It's vexing because it could have been good, but Knight Moves is stylistically closer to an X-rated episode of Miss Marple than Se7en. Then there was The Luzhin Defence, in 2000, a chess romance and adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's The Defense, a novel loosely based on German chess master Curt von Bardeleben. The film is less to do with chess than with social distinctions and improprieties, with John Turturro's character, Aleksandr Luzhin, socially dysfunctional, scruffy and stammering. He's practically damaged by his genius, deliberately painted as an oddity. By association, chess is tarred with the same brush, as the domain of weirdos. More than a decade on and despite tackling a different genre, Computer Chess, unfortunately, isn't really any different, mumblecore or nay. The comic basis for the film is the social awkwardness and idiosyncracies of chess and programming enthusiasts. I'm not convinced that the mockery of these nerdy individuals is affectionate, or if it further reinforces the misplaced perception that chess is just the horseplay of freaks and geeks. In fact, that unfamiliar, oddball environment appears to be precisely the attraction for the director: \\"Given the nature of the story in Computer Chess and what we were trying to do, there was no imperative at all to be tasteful,\\" Bujalski told the New Statesman. \\"We could be as absurd as we liked and call as much attention to ourselves as we liked.\\" Oh, and it also features full frontal nudity (albeit in a uniquely surreal fashion). Films like Computer Chess don't do the game any favours, appealing to a niche within a niche and further estranging those who were already skeptical or disinterested. If chess is ever to reach a wider audience and greater popularity, it'll need something considerably more compelling to stack the board in its favour. Maybe it's true that board games really aren't spectator sports, but I can't help but think that we can do better than this. There's a better endgame out there. • Peter Bradshaw's review of Computer Chess• Computer Chess: watch the trailer Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Chess has struggled to find a strong presence in film, often relegated to a prop to emphasize intellect or cunning, or as an analogy for a scheming mind.

A friend asked me to answer this question: Who is committed to the mental hospital?, using the article: On a beautiful morning in 1923, Clarissa Dalloway sets out from her large house in Westminster to choose the flowers for a party she is holding that evening. Her teenage daughter Elizabeth is unsympathetic, preferring the company of the evangelical Miss Kilman. A passionate old suitor, Peter Walsh, turns up and does not disguise the mess he has made of his career and his love life. For Clarissa this confirms her choice in preferring the unexciting but affectionate and dependable Richard Dalloway.

Question: What features do some flightless birds have that make them similar to birds that can fly? Context: Most birds can fly, which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes. Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil. Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators. Though flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to \\"fly\\" through the water, as do auks, shearwaters and dippers.

The U.S. Supreme Court signaled Wednesday it may be open to new limits on the government's ability to track someone's movements by accessing data on that person's cellphone.  A case before the high court could result in a landmark decision in the ongoing debate over civil liberties protections in an era of rapid technological change.  At issue is whether law enforcement will be able to access cellphone data that can reveal a person's whereabouts without having to first obtain a court-issued search warrant.  The case stems from the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. On Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information.  They also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  \\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \\"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\\"  Some of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age.  \\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said.

The answer is:","output":"\\"Fast food restaurant\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly relates to the context and nature of KFC as an establishment. KFC, which stands for Kentucky Fried Chicken, is a well-known international fast food chain that primarily serves chicken dishes. By understanding this background information about KFC, it becomes clear why \\"fast food restaurant\\" is the most appropriate and common-sense answer among the given options. Let's analyze the other possible answers to further understand why \\"fast food restaurant\\" prevails as an answer that aligns with human common sense: 1. Plate: While a plate is indeed a dish or surface used for serving and eating food, this answer is too narrow and specific to provide a comprehensive understanding of KFC's overall purpose. It does not convey the concept that KFC is an establishment where chicken dishes are prepared and served. 2. Bowl: Similar to the \\"plate\\" answer, the term \\"bowl\\" refers to a container in which one can serve or eat food. However, it does not encompass the broad nature of KFC as a fast-food chain that serves a variety of chicken-based meals, not just those served in a bowl. 3. Freezer: A freezer is an appliance used to store food at low temperatures to preserve its freshness. Although KFC may use freezers to store ingredients and pre-prepared meals, the term does not convey KFC's overall function as a restaurant. Therefore, it is not an answer aligned with human common sense in this context. 4. Oven: An oven is a crucial appliance for cooking various types of food, and it is most likely used in KFC's cooking process, especially when it comes to preparing their signature fried chicken. Nevertheless, the term \\"oven\\" does not fully capture the essence of KFC as a fast-food restaurant, making this option less aligned with human common sense in comparison to \\"fast food restaurant.\\" In conclusion, \\"fast food restaurant\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it accurately depicts the primary function and nature of KFC. Other options, such as plate, bowl, freezer, and oven, may be related to the food industry but do not appropriately represent KFC's role as a fast-food chain serving chicken dishes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Do Americans have morals  ? That's a good question. Many people insist that ideas about right and wrong are merely personal opinions. Some voices, though, are calling Americans back to traditional moral values. William J. Bennett, former U.S. Secretary of Education, edited the Book of Virtues in 1993 to do just that. Bennett suggests that great moral stories can build character. The success of Bennett ' s book shows that many Americans still believe in moral values. But what are they?     One of the most basic moral values for Americans is honesty. The well-known legend about George Washington and the cherry tree tells this value clearly. Little George cut down his father's favorite cherry tree while trying out his new axe. When his father asked him about it, George said honestly, \\"I can not tell a lie. I did it with my axe.\\" Instead of punishment, George received his father's praise for telling the truth.  Sometimes American honesty-being open and direct-can offend people.  But Americans still believe that \\"honesty is the best policy.\\"      Another virtue Americans respect is perseverance. Remember Aesop's fable( )about the rabbit and the turtle that had a race? The rabbit thought he could win easily, so he took a nap. But the turtle finally won because he didn't give up.      Sympathy may be the queen of American virtues. The story of \\"The Good Samaritan\\" from the Bible describes a man who showed sympathy. On his way to a certain city, a Samaritan man found a poor traveler lying on the road. The traveler had been beaten and robbed. The kind Samaritan, instead of just passing by, stopped to help this person in need.      In no way can these brief descriptions cover all the moral values honored by Americans. Responsibility, loyalty, courage, gratitude and many others could be discussed. In fact, Bennett's bestseller-over 800 pages-highlights just 10 virtues. Even Bennett admits that he has only covered the surface. But no matter how long or short the list is, moral values are invaluable, they are the... Question: The story about a Samaritan suggests that - an American should show sympathy to others. - American ancestors are Samaritans. - travelers are so poor as to be helped. - help is the foundation of American culture.

Title: Gee Whiz-z-z-z-z-z-z Movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (June 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Introduction: The title card is shown as a billboard behind which Wile E. Coyote is hiding, ready to chase the Road Runner. He starts the chase, until he runs into a large truck. Wile E. runs the other way, and the truck shows the credit. The chase ends in a win for the truck, and the Coyote emerges battered. A box with director Chuck Jones' credit then squashes him. The Coyote throws the box away, and the shot freezes: COYOTE - Eatius Birdius. He resumes the chase, which freezes to show the Road Runner: Delicius-Delicius. The chase continues down the road until the Road Runner makes a U-turn. The Coyote turns around, then stops. The Road Runner completes the circuit around, meanwhile, and beeps as the Coyote turns around, causing him to leap back. The Road Runner starts off down the road and loosens it from its hinge briefly. Wile E. points worriedly and displays an \\"EGAD\\" sign, then an \\"!!\\" sign. He drops them and thinks of his new plan. 1. Wile E. hides in a manhole, and as the Road Runner passes over him, he pops out and fires a rifle. The bullet and the Road Runner are shown in slow time, with the bullet closing to within a half-body length of the bird. Then the Road Runner turns to notice the threat, lets out a beep and gears into super speed. The bullet then brakes in puzzlement and falls to the ground. Wile E. picks it up, and then it detonates. Behind another rock face (in completely different desert scenery), Wile E. paces until he comes up with a new plan. 2. Wile E. leaps out into the road with \\"1 sheet ACME Triple Strength BATTLESHIP STEEL ARMOR PLATE\\" in front of him; even this cannot stop the Road Runner from barreling through it. The Coyote stares in puzzlement at the resulting hole, which shows only the scenery behind him where parts of his body should logically be, then walks...

I know that the answer to the question \\"What were the examples of locales that picked up a lot of the Hellenic culture?\\" is in \\"Throughout the Hellenistic world, these Greco-Macedonian colonists considered themselves by and large superior to the native \\"barbarians\\" and excluded most non-Greeks from the upper echelons of courtly and government life. Most of the native population was not Hellenized, had little access to Greek culture and often found themselves discriminated against by their Hellenic overlords. Gymnasiums and their Greek education, for example, were for Greeks only. Greek cities and colonies may have exported Greek art and architecture as far as the Indus, but these were mostly enclaves of Greek culture for the transplanted Greek elite. The degree of influence that Greek culture had throughout the Hellenistic kingdoms was therefore highly localized and based mostly on a few great cities like Alexandria and Antioch. Some natives did learn Greek and adopt Greek ways, but this was mostly limited to a few local elites who were allowed to retain their posts by the Diadochi and also to a small number of mid-level administrators who acted as intermediaries between the Greek speaking upper class and their subjects.

În ceea ce priveşte situaţia din Malaysia, doresc în primul rând să spun că suntem foarte îngrijoraţi în legătură cu atacurile asupra bisericilor dintr-o ţară cunoscută ca fiind tolerantă şi moderată. Translate to English English:","output":"Regarding the situation in Malaysia, I would like to say first and foremost that we are very concerned about the attacks on churches in a country known for being tolerant and moderate. In relation to the situation in Malaysia, our primary concern is the ongoing attacks on churches that have been occurring. Malaysia, as a country, has historically been considered a place of tolerance and moderation. These recent incidents have led to growing unease regarding the safety and security of religious establishments, fostering an overall atmosphere of apprehension. It is crucial to examine the underlying causes that have contributed to this concerning phenomenon. Several factors might have contributed to these attacks, including religious intolerance, political issues, and a general rise in global extremism. It is essential to address these possible concerns in order to find a solution and prevent further conflict. In Malaysia, one issue that may have caused tension is the country's multireligious and multicultural nature. While most of the population is Muslim, significant minority populations of Christians, Buddhists, and Hindus also coexist. This diversity has historically been a source of strength for Malaysia, but it can also lead to conflicts or misunderstandings between different religious or ethnic groups. Political issues might have also contributed to the rise in attacks on churches. In some cases, politicians in Malaysia have used religion as a tool to gain support from particular religious groups, which could exacerbate religious tensions. Additionally, external influences, such as extremist ideologies from other countries, might have seeped into Malaysia and contributed to the radicalization of certain individuals or groups. To address these issues and help mitigate further conflict, there are several steps that must be taken. First, there must be a greater emphasis on promoting tolerance and interfaith dialogue between different religious communities. This can involve organizing events that bring together members of different faiths to discuss common values and promote understanding and mutual respect. Secondly, it is crucial that there is a focus on effective law enforcement and protection of religious establishments. Ensuring that perpetrators of religious violence are brought to justice will not only help protect places of worship but also send a strong message that such criminal acts will not be tolerated. Finally, there must be an emphasis on education and awareness about the importance of religious freedom and tolerance. Schools, religious institutions, and community organizations should work together to create and promote educational programs that celebrate Malaysia's religious diversity and promote understanding among all citizens. In conclusion, the situation in Malaysia regarding the attacks on churches is a cause for concern, but it is crucial to examine the potential underlying issues that have led to these events in order to effectively address them. By fostering a sense of tolerance and understanding and ensuring the protection of religious establishments, we can work towards a safer and more harmonious society in Malaysia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This week could turn out to be pivotal for the Trump White House as both major parties get ready for midterm congressional elections in November. President Donald Trump’s decision to reverse a policy of separating families coming across the U.S. southern border came in the wake of a political firestorm that fired up opposition Democrats and alarmed even some Republicans. At the very least, it likely set the stage for immigration to be a key issue in November. Trump was in combat mode Wednesday during a political rally in Duluth, Minnesota, where he vowed to make immigration a central focus in the upcoming congressional campaign. “If you want to create a humane, lawful system of immigration then you need to retire the Democrats and elect Republicans to finally secure our borders,” Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd, some chanting, “Build the wall!” Just hours earlier, the president reversed his controversial policy of separating children from their parents by signing an executive order in the White House. “We are going to have strong, very strong, borders. But we are going to keep the families together,” he said. Trump decided to back away from the controversial policy of separating families after an outcry from around the country that included protests in several states, including Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Also driving the outrage was a recording of children crying out for their parents released by the investigative journalist group ProPublica. The separation policy drew condemnation from Republicans including former first lady Laura Bush and a host of Democrats. “We should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view,” said Maryland Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings. “What country is that? This is the United States of America!” Advocates for a tough border policy sided with the president including Art Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies. He cited a recent upsurge in attempted border crossings. Question: Where is Elijah Cummings a Congressman from? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"Elijah Cummings was a Congressman from Maryland. He represented Maryland's 7th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served from April 1996 until his death in October 2019. He played a crucial role in standing up against the policy of separating families at the U.S. southern border and was vocal about keeping kids out of child internment camps. As a prominent Democrat, Cummings consistently advocated for a more humane approach to immigration policy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Answer: In the states of Kentucky and Tennessee , the electric chair has been retired except for those whose capital crimes were committed prior to legislated dates in 1998 (Kentucky: March 31, 1998; Tennessee: December 31, 1998) and who chose electrocution. Question: what states has the electric chair Answer:","output":"The electric chair has been used as a method of execution in several states across the United States since its inception in 1890. However, its usage has declined over the years, with many states opting for lethal injection as the predominant method of execution. As of now, a few states still maintain electrocution as a secondary option under specific circumstances. Here is a list of states that have had or currently have the electric chair as a method of execution: 1. Alabama: The state allows inmates to choose between electrocution and lethal injection. 2. Arkansas: The primary method is lethal injection, but inmates sentenced before July 4, 1983, can choose electrocution. 3. Florida: Since 2000, the primary method is lethal injection, but inmates who committed capital crimes before June 30, 1999, can choose electrocution. 4. Georgia: Lethal injection is the primary method, but those sentenced prior to May 1, 2000, can choose the electric chair. 5. Illinois: The state abolished the death penalty in 2011, but prior to that, it had used the electric chair until 1990. 6. Indiana: The state stopped using the electric chair in 1995 and switched to lethal injection. 7. Kentucky: While the electric chair is now retired, those whose capital crimes were committed prior to March 31, 1998, can still choose electrocution. 8. Louisiana: The last execution via electric chair was in 1991; the state switched to lethal injection in 1993. 9. Mississippi: Electrocuting is an option if lethal injection is deemed unconstitutional or unavailable. 10. Nebraska: The state changed its primary execution method from the electric chair to lethal injection in 2009. 11. New Jersey: The electric chair was used until 1963; however, the death penalty was abolished completely in 2007. 12. New York: The last electrocution took place in 1963, and the state stopped using the electric chair in 1995. It now has a moratorium on executions. 13. North Carolina: The electric chair was used until 1994 when the state switched to lethal injection. 14. Ohio: The state switched from the electric chair to lethal injection in 2001. 15. Oklahoma: Lethal injection is the primary method, but the electric chair remains a backup option if lethal injection is found to be unconstitutional or becomes unavailable. 16. Pennsylvania: The state used the electric chair until 1990, before switching to lethal injection. 17. South Carolina: The primary method is lethal injection, but inmates can choose electrocution. 18. Tennessee: The electric chair has been retired except for those whose capital crimes were committed prior to December 31, 1998, and who chose electrocution. 19. Texas: The state stopped using the electric chair in 1982 and switched to lethal injection. 20. Virginia: Lethal injection is the primary method, but inmates sentenced prior to January 1, 1995, can choose electrocution. 21. West Virginia: The state abolished the death penalty in 1965 but had used the electric chair until then. It is important to note that methods of execution and applicable laws can change over time. However, as of now, the electric chair is either not in use or only a secondary option in most states. Lethal injection has become the primary method of execution in many jurisdictions across the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Suggested answer: Grecian Formula is a men's hair coloring product in the United States. Should I validate this answer? The answer is:","output":"While the suggested answer provides a brief introduction to Grecian Formula, it does not comprehensively explain how it works. Below is a more detailed and long answer to help you understand how Grecian Formula works and expands on its use as a hair coloring product: Grecian Formula, a popular men's hair coloring product primarily in the United States, is designed to gradually restore natural color to graying hair. Unlike most hair dyes that provide an immediate and intense color change, Grecian Formula works progressively over time, allowing users to have more control over the desired shade and avoid a sudden, dramatic shift in hair color. The key ingredient in Grecian Formula is lead acetate, although some newer versions use bismuth citrate as an alternative due to safety concerns with lead. These ingredients function as color restorers by reacting with sulfur in hair keratin, which is a fibrous protein that forms the structural foundation of hair. As hair naturally contains sulfur, these ingredients can selectively interact with the sulfur atoms in gray or colorless hair strands, forming colored lead or bismuth sulfide complexes in the process. Grecian Formula works best when applied daily to clean, dry hair. Each day of application results in a minor color change that, when accumulated over a period of several weeks, ultimately restores hair to its original, natural hue. The formula is designed to target only gray strands, so it blends with the user's natural color effectively. To maintain the desired shade, subsequent applications can be reduced to once or twice a week, depending on the individual's preference and hair growth rate. A significant advantage of Grecian Formula over traditional hair dyes is that it does not leave a visible demarcation line between the colored and new hair growth, as the color is restored gradually. Despite its popularity and effectiveness, Grecian Formula has faced some controversy due to the presence of lead acetate, which is a known toxic compound. Prolonged exposure to lead has been associated with neurological, cardiovascular, and reproductive health issues. However, the amount of lead acetate present in Grecian Formula is relatively small, and the risk of harmful exposure through skin contact is considered low. Nevertheless, the European Union has banned the use of lead acetate in cosmetic products, which has resulted in the utilization of alternative ingredients like bismuth citrate in some versions of the Grecian Formula. In conclusion, Grecian Formula is a hair coloring product that functions by gradually restoring the natural color of graying hair through the formation of colored complexes within hair keratin. Its progressive action allows for increased control, reduces the risk of an unnatural appearance, and avoids a sudden, dramatic color change that some people may find undesirable. However, the use of lead acetate has raised some safety concerns, prompting the development of alternative ingredients in other versions of the product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sources differ on the precise year of Crazy Horse's birth, but most agree he was born between 1840 and 1845. According to a close friend, he and Crazy Horse \\"were both born in the same year at the same season of the year,\\" which census records and other interviews place in 1842. Encouraging Bear, an Oglala medicine man and spiritual adviser to the Oglala war leader, reported that Crazy Horse was born \\"in the year in which the band to which he belonged, the Oglala, stole One Hundred Horses, and in the fall of the year,\\" a reference to the annual Lakota calendar or winter count. Among the Oglala winter counts, the stealing of 100 horses is noted by Cloud Shield, and possibly by American Horse and Red Horse owner, as equivalent to the year 1840-41. Crazy Horse is commemorated by the incomplete Crazy Horse Memorial in the Black Hills of South Dakota, near the town of Berne. Like the nearby Mount Rushmore National Memorial, it is a monument carved out of a mountainside. The sculpture was begun by Polish-American sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski, who had worked under Gutzon Borglum on Mount Rushmore, in 1948. Plans call for the completed monument to be 641 feet (195 m) wide and 563 feet (172 m) high.  Ziolkowski was inspired to create the Crazy Horse Memorial after receiving a letter from native Lakota chief Henry Standing Bear, who asked if Ziolkowski would be interested in creating a monument for the native North Americans to show that the Indian nations also have their heroes. The Native Americans consider Thunderhead Mountain, where the monument is being carved, to be sacred ground. Thunderhead Mountain is situated between Custer and Hill City. Upon completion, the head of Crazy Horse will be the world's largest sculpture of the human head, measuring approximately 87 feet (27 m) tall, more than 27 feet taller than the 60-foot faces of the U.S. Presidents depicted on Mount Rushmore, and the Crazy Horse Memorial as a whole will be the largest sculpture in the world.  The memorial is funded entirely by private donations, with no assistance from the U.S. federal government. There is no target completion date at this time; however, in 1998, the face of Crazy Horse was completed and dedicated. The Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation regularly takes the lead in cultural, social and educational events, including the Volksmarch, the occasion on which the public is allowed into the actual monument grounds. The foundation generates most of its funds from visitor fees, with visitors numbering more than one million annually.  The monument has been the subject of controversy. In Ziolkowski's vision, the sculpted likeness of Crazy Horse is dedicated to the spirit of Crazy Horse and all Native Americans. It is well-known that Crazy Horse did not want to be photographed during his lifetime and is reportedly buried in an undisclosed location. While Lakota chief Henry Standing Bear believed in the sincerity of the motives, many Native Americans still oppose the intended meaning of the memorial. Opponents of the monument have likened it to pollution and desecration of the landscape and environment of the Black Hills, and of the ideals of Crazy Horse himself.  Aside from the monumental sculpture, Crazy Horse has also been honored by having two highways named after him, both called the Crazy Horse Memorial Highway. In South Dakota, the designation has been applied to a portion of US 16/US 385 between Custer and Hill City, which passes by the Crazy Horse Memorial. In November 2010, Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman approved designating US 20 from Hay Springs to Fort Robinson in honor of Crazy Horse, capping a year-long effort by citizens of Chadron. The designation may extend east another 100 miles through Cherry County to Valentine.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I’ve been on because everything is new,” said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer.

The 5-4 decision comes nine months after Democrats had celebrated lower court rulings that invalidated parts of Texas' electoral maps and a revised voter ID law. But the voter ID law was also restored in April, and Texas Republicans now have another key victory in long-running battles over voting rights in a state with a booming Hispanic population.      \\"Our legislative maps are legal. Democrats lost their redistricting & Voter ID claims,\\" Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted.      The decision also dampened Democrats' case that Texas should once again need federal approval before changing voting laws, a requirement the Supreme Court eliminated in 2013 when it gutted the heart of the federal Voting Rights Act.      In August, a federal court in San Antonio agreed with Democrats and voting rights groups that current electoral districts in Texas were tainted by earlier and intentionally discriminatory map lines first approved by the GOP-controlled Legislature in 2011.      But Justice Samuel Alito said for the court's conservative majority that the lower court made a mistake by striking down two congressional and seven state house districts. The high court struck down one safe Democratic House district in Fort Worth because the state relied too heavily on race when it increased the district's Latino population.      \\"We now hold that the three-judge court committed a fundamental legal error,\\" Alito wrote. The lower court ignored evidence showing that the legislature adopted districting plans in 2013 primarily to try to end the litigation over the districts, Alito said.      The court's liberal justices dissented.      \\"The court today does great damage to that right of equal opportunity,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote. She said her colleagues had blinded themselves \\"to the overwhelming factual record below. It does all of this to allow Texas to use electoral maps that, in design and effect, burden the rights of minority voters.\\"      Democrats are outnumbered nearly 2-1 in the Texas Legislature and have long contended that unfair maps have accelerated that imbalance. In 2009, Republicans had only a slim two-seat majority in the Texas House.      \\"The rules were changed today,\\" said Democratic state Rep. Rafael Anchia, chairman of the Mexican American Legislative Caucus.      Texas' congressional and legislative districting plans have been embroiled in court action for years, beginning in 2011.      After the state's original maps were tossed out as probably unconstitutional, a three-judge federal court produced interim districting plans that were used in the 2012 elections.      In 2013, Republicans who control the state government rushed to permanently adopt those maps to use for the rest of the decade, until a new round of redistricting after the 2020 census. But opponents criticized the adopted maps as a quick fix that didn't purge all districts of the impermissible use of race.      \\"This is a huge win for the Constitution, Texas, and the democratic process. Once again, Texans have the power to govern themselves,\\" Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said.      ___      Weber reported from Austin, Texas. ||||| Summary:","output":"The Supreme Court in the United States made a decision about voting maps in Texas. They said that most of the maps are okay and can stay as they are. This is good news for the Republican Party in Texas and not so good for the Democratic Party. Some people think the maps are not fair because they make it harder for certain groups of people, like Hispanic people, to have their votes count properly.

Sir Robert Eric Mortimer Wheeler (10 September 1890 – 22 July 1976) was a British archaeologist and officer in the British Army. Over the course of his career, he served as Director of both the National Museum of Wales and London Museum, Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, and the founder and Honorary Director of the Institute of Archaeology in London, in addition to writing twenty-four books on archaeological subjects. Born in Glasgow to a middle-class family, Wheeler was raised largely in Yorkshire before relocating to London in his teenage years. After studying classics at University College London (UCL), he began working professionally in archaeology, specialising in the Romano-British period. During World War I he volunteered for service in the Royal Artillery, being stationed on the Western Front, where he rose to the rank of major and was awarded the Military Cross. Returning to Britain, he obtained his doctorate from UCL before taking on a position at the National Museum of Wales, first as Keeper of Archaeology and then as Director, during which time he oversaw excavation at the Roman forts of Segontium, Y Gaer, and Isca Augusta with the aid of his first wife, Tessa Wheeler. Influenced by the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers, Wheeler argued that excavation and the recording of stratigraphic context required an increasingly scientific and methodical approach, developing the \\"Wheeler method\\". In 1926, he was appointed Keeper of the London Museum; there, he oversaw a reorganisation of the collection, successfully lobbied for increased funding, and began lecturing at UCL.

The leather shoes were found in rubbish pits along with some pottery and bottles, the National Trust said. Further pieces of leather were recovered, and experts believe this shows the Quarry Bank gardener had moonlighted as a cobbler. The Upper Gardens project reopens next month. Initially it was thought the shoes could have belonged to young mill apprentices nearby. However, pottery and glass pieces found with them were identified as late Victorian or Edwardian, suggesting the shoes were made after the apprentice system had ended. Another theory was the shoes came from children who kept the garden wall stoves burning through the night. But the moonlighting gardener theory seems most likely, experts said. \\"We think one of the gardeners might have been supplementing his income fixing shoes for people from Styal village,\\" said Jamie Lund, an archaeologist with the National Trust.

Generate a 4-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.google.android.gms.","output":"Title: Almost Perfect - 4 Stars In reviewing the app \\"com.google.android.gms,\\" otherwise known as Google Play Services, there is an abundance to appreciate. Google Play Services plays a critical role in ensuring that all your apps are always up-to-date, enhancing your app usage and overall device performance. Sporting a seamless interface, it operates under the hood, staying almost invisible, which contributes to the clean, minimalistic appeal of Google's architecture. Perhaps one of its best features is the automatic updating of Google apps. It takes a lot of tedious manual labor out of the process, thus ensuring you always have the latest updates and security patches to Google's apps. Google Play Services also helps in authenticating Google services, synchronizing contacts, and providing users with the latest privacy settings for every other app on your device. The location-based services it integrates can help you use location data without draining your battery.  However, this application comes with some minor drawbacks that prevent a full 5-star review. On some occasions, Google Play Services tends to consume more battery life than necessary. For users with limited battery capacity, this can arise as an issue. Also, as a core system app, it occasionally triggers unprompted errors that can affect the smooth operation of other applications. Despite these setbacks, the pros of Google Play Services considerably outweigh its cons. Taking into account the app's integral role in managing other apps, these minor issues are easily forgivable. Therefore, a solid 4 out of 5 stars is a justifiable rating for this application. A few tweakings, particularly on resource management, could propel it towards a perfect 5-star rating. Nonetheless, Google Play Services remains a must-have for any Android user."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot. If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: Vanucci concocts a scheme to pose as which movie director? Title: After the Fox Movie plot: The story begins in Cairo where Okra (Akim Tamiroff), using a bikini-clad accomplice (Maria Grazia Buccella) as a distraction, hijacks 3 million in gold bullion. The thieves need a way to smuggle the two tons of gold bars into Europe. There are only four master criminals considered able to smuggle the gold: a Frenchman, so crippled he can barely move his wheelchair; an Irishman, so nearsighted that he is arrested after trying to hold up a police station instead of a bank; a German, so fat he can barely get through a door â and Aldo Vanucci (Peter Sellers), also known as The Fox, a master criminal with a talent for disguise. Vanucci is in prison. He knows about the smuggling contract, but is reluctant to accept it, because he does not want to disgrace his mother and young sister, Gina (Britt Ekland). However, when his three sidekicks inform him that Gina has grown up and does not always come home after school, an enraged, over-protective Vanucci vows to escape. He succeeds by impersonating the prison doctor and convincing the guards that Vanucci has tied him up and escaped. The guards capture the real doctor and bring him face to face with Vanucci, who flees with the aid of his gang. Vanucci returns home where his mother tells him that Gina is working on the Via Veneto. Vanucci takes this to mean that Gina is a prostitute. Disguised as a priest, Aldo sees Gina, who is provocatively dressed, flirting and kissing a fat, middle-aged man. Aldo attacks the man, but it turns out that Gina, who aspires to be a movie star, is merely acting in a low-budget film. Aldoâs actions cost her the role, but he realizes that the smuggling job will make his familyâs life better. He makes contact with Okra and agrees to smuggle the gold into Italy for half of the take.

The key phrases indicating the negative nature of the review include \\"not particularly impressive\\" when discussing the steak, and \\"real disappointment\\" in reference to the scallops. The author also set their expectations based on the reputation and class of the establishment, and was let down when their meal failed to meet those expectations. Furthermore, the author seems unsatisfied with the value provided by the dish, as they suggest that the 40 per plate price tag is too high given the level of quality. In summary, while the reviewer does acknowledge a few positive elements in the dish, the overall message is one of disappointment with the meal's quality and value, which labels it as a negative review.

Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Tea bag drinking is most Westerners' favorite way of drinking tea. Do you know how it came about? The tea bag was invented in 1908 by Thomas Sullivan, an American tea seller. He was sending out free tea in silk bags for people to try. People put the bags together with the tea leaves into the cup and added  hot water. The tea tasted good, and people thought it was easy to clean the cup. They were not happy when Sullivan started sending them loose   tea again. Sullivan realized that he had a hot new thing in his hands, and he built a machine to pack the bags. As tea bags became popular, they were changed from silk to gauze   and later paper. In 1952, Lipton Tea made the tea bag even more popular with its invention of the four-sided tea bag. Tea bags were soon a hit in the UK, and today 85%of the tea in the UK is packed in paper bags. However, many people still prefer loose-leaf tea.  This is because some tea companies put not very good tea in their tea bags. But for most drinkers, tea bags are still the easy and tasly way to go.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. There are tons of different areas or niches for mediation work. There is no one single way to become a generalized mediator. What you learn, where you look, who you network with are all going to be dependent on what type of mediating you decide to do.  For example, if you wanted to go into family mediation (dealing with children, with divorce, domestic violence, and so on) you would need to be certified in behavioral or social sciences as well as in child development. Mediating workplace disputes would require knowledge specific to the workplace and to the laws and practices therein. It's even better if you have experience dealing with matters particular to that specific workplace, or type of workplace (for example, dealing specifically with factory issues, or mining litigation). Other types of mediation niches include: environmental, art, education, malpractice, criminal justice, landlord/tenant, gay/lesbian, and so on. The best way to get a feel for what is required of a mediator is to talk to someone who is or has done it. It's especially good to find someone in your specific area. While talking to someone who mediates art disputes could be informative, it won't have the same information needed if you're looking to go into workplace disputes.  Go to conferences. There are tons of conferences devoted to mediation all around the world. Check and see if there are any in your area (for the U.S., for example, Chicago, New York, and various parts of California hold large mediation conferences yearly).  Get a feel for how the system works. When you do meet with someone who is a mediator, you'll want to find out how the system works so you can be as effective as you possibly can. This includes finding out what the work environment is like, what their advice is for getting established, and who decides which mediators are established. Get a feel for what you need to know. Ask them about the types of laws, and rules you'll need to know, and education background that you'll need to have. Depending on the niche you decided to work in you may not need a master's degree, but it can definitely help your credentials. Proving that you have experience with the topic is important if you want to be successful as a mediator.  Remember that if you wanted to mediate in Family Law, you would need a background (preferably a master's or a PhD) in behavioral or social sciences as well as family and child development. It's also not a bad idea to get a degree in conflict resolution, as universities and colleges are increasingly offering this opportunity, If you decided to be a civil, general equity, or probate mediator you would need to have at least five years of professional experience in your field of expertise as well as an advanced degree and a minimum of two successfully mediated cases within the last year, or an undergraduate degree and a minimum of ten successfully mediated cases within the last five years. Often if you get your PhD in your chosen subject the courts waive your need to have a certain number of successfully mediated case. Either that or the reduce the amount of successfully mediated cases you need to have. Mediation doesn't require any specific qualifications (except in Florida which has qualification requirements). There are certain qualification classes you can take, but usually these only give you the qualification that you completed the course, without guaranteeing that you are actually a certified mediator.  You should go to school in your chosen field (art mediation, or law mediation, environmental mediation) and get a degree that shows you know that area well. Having a law degree can be incredibly useful, because it shows that you know and understand law, especially laws in a particular area. To get listed as a professional you typically have to have several years of experience with mediation (internship, community mediation volunteer, etc.).

Article: The natural instinct of your horse should be to move away from where pressure is applied - the same instinct humans have. Test this reaction in your horse by bumping them with an open palm near the girth where you would bump them with your calf. They should move away from your hand, possibly already in a side pass.  Continue bumping your horse near the girth with added pressure if they do not respond to you. As soon as they take a step away, release pressure and reward them. Practice this until your horse needs only a single bump, or no bump at all (just pushing energy with your hand towards their girth), in order to move away from you. Put your horse on a lead rope, and if necessary grab a crop. Stand so that your body is positioned slightly behind the barrel of your horse’s body, and gesture with your arm or crop towards their shoulder. If they do not respond to this, then apply pressure on their shoulder. The goal is to get them to move away from your pressure by rotating their body around their back legs.  If your horse turns away or simply walks in the opposite direction rather than crossing their front legs in a turn, grab the lead rope and hold them straight ahead. As soon as your horse crosses their front legs in a turn on the haunch, release pressure, drop your eyes, and reward them for doing what you asked. Continue practicing a turn on the haunch on the ground, so that your horse will respond to the same cues when riding. Similar to a turn on the haunch, a turn on the forehand is done when your horse rotates their entire body around their front legs by crossing their back legs. Accomplish this by standing near the shoulder (to block shoulder/forward movement) and gesturing towards the haunch with your crop or open hands. If they don’t respond without pressure, add a bit by pushing against the haunch with your open hands, or tapping them with the crop.  Don’t remove pressure if your horse simply backs away or turns to the side. Straighten them out if necessary, but continue bumping with pressure until they take at least one step by crossing their legs. As soon as your horse achieves a single step in a turn on the forehand, release pressure and reward them for following your cues. Practice this over and over until your horse requires a  minimal amount of pressure to accomplish a turn on the forehand. Stand next to your horse near the barrel of their body, using a crop if necessary. Bump the girth of the horse to tell them to move away; if they don’t move how you want, give them the cues for a turn on the haunch and a turn on the forehand. Continue working back and forth between your cues until your horse clues in and does at least a single successful step in a side pass.  Reward your horse and release pressure as soon as they take even a single step in the form of a side pass. Continue doing this until they don’t need to be cued for a turn on the forehand and a turn on the haunch in order to recreate a side pass. Eventually they should only need to be bumped on their side near the girth. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article provides a detailed guide on training a horse to respond to pressure cues for various movements, particularly focusing on the side pass, turn on the haunch, and turn on the forehand.

So far, 25 surgeries across England have been granted approval by NHS bosses to shrink their catchment areas as they cannot cope. Some practices have already removed as many as 1,500 patients from their lists, including elderly widows, amputees, young mothers and – in one case – all the residents of a care home. So far, 25 surgeries across England have been granted approval by NHS bosses to shrink their catchment areas as they cannot cope (File photo) A further ten surgeries have applied this year to cut their registers and are awaiting approval. GPs say they are in the grip of a recruitment crisis and cannot provide safe care for the rising numbers of people moving to their areas. Some of the worst-affected surgeries are where the population is soaring due to migrants and elderly couples who need many appointments. On top of this, many GPs are retiring, moving overseas or quitting altogether and there is a shortage of new doctors entering the profession. Figures from NHS England – obtained by GP trade magazine Pulse – show that 15 practices were granted approval to shrink their catchment areas in 2013/14 and another ten so far this year since April. Officials would not identify individual surgeries but they are in areas including Surrey, Sussex, Greater Manchester, Leicester, Lincolnshire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire. Dr Peter Swinyard is the chairman of the Family Doctor Association, which represents GPs. Dr Maureen Baker, the chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said: ‘This is an extremely distressing situation for patients and for GPs. Every patient should be able to see their family doctor when they need to, and GPs want to provide the best possible access and care for all their patients. ‘No surgery wants to de-register patients. This is still extremely rare and only takes place as a very last resort. Unfortunately, what we are seeing now is a sad consequence of the desperate shortage of GPs, with many practices finding it difficult to replace doctors who are retiring.’ So far this year, 15 requests had been rejected and six withdrawn. Patients who are struck off usually receive an apologetic letter from the surgery telling them they will have to register elsewhere. But there is no guarantee they will easily find another GP to take them on, especially in rural areas. Some of those removed by a practice in Watton, in Norfolk, now have to make 16-mile round trips to the next town to see a doctor. Dr Peter Swinyard, chairman of the Family Doctor Association, which represents GPs, said: ‘This is people just basically saying, “We are not coping.” They are completely overstretched and struggling to find the medical staff to look after the patients.’ Katherine Murphy, the chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘The shrinking of GP lists is unacceptable. We must protect GP services and achieve real choice for patients. ‘Patients have no control over when they are going to be sick and therefore they must have access to a GP.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The NHS has approved 25 surgeries in England to shrink their catchment areas due to overstretched GPs.

The other involves the political and military leaders trying to contain the epidemic. Set in the small town of Evans City, Pennsylvania, the central characters are firefighter David (Will McMillan), his girlfriend, nurse Judy (Lane Carroll), and firefighter Clank (Harold Wayne Jones). David was a Green Beret and Clank an infantryman, both having served in Vietnam. The town has seen a number of violent events, including arson at a local farm by a demented farmer. Judy and David are very concerned, since Judy is pregnant. Meanwhile, heavily armed U.S. troops in NBC suits and gas masks, arrive in town, led by Major Ryder (Harry Spillman), who takes over the doctor's office where Judy works.

Article: The refrigerator’s dark, temperature-regulated conditions make it the perfect means of preserving freshly-opened flaxseed. Inside, the grains will be protected from heat and light, both of which can cause them to spoil prematurely. Best of all, almost any type of storage container can easily go into the fridge, provided it’s the right size.  Whenever possible, the refrigerator should be your first choice for putting away flaxseed. Refrigerated flaxseed has the potential to last 6 whole months longer than flaxseed stored at room temperature. If refrigerator space is limited, just look a few feet higher. Stashing your flaxseed in the freezer is a wise move if you know you’re not going to get around to using it for a while, or you prefer to buy it in bulk. It will stay good for a year or longer past its listed expiration date, since the surrounding temperature is so low. There’s no need to thaw frozen flaxseed prior to grinding it or adding it to food. Hold off on processing your whole flaxseed until you’re ready to sprinkle some into a green smoothie or bowl or oats. Then, measure out the desired amount and return the rest to the pantry or refrigerator. It may be a little tedious, but it will greatly increase the lifespan of your supply. Freezing ground flaxseed may keep it fresh for as long as 3 months. Even so, the sooner you put it to use, the better. Anytime you’re grinding flaxseed, add it to your food or transfer it to its intended storage container without delay. The longer it remains out, the more likely it is to take on moisture. Even relatively dry air can kick off oxidation and lead to spoilage.  Avoid grinding or opening a container of ground flaxseed in a steamy kitchen. Always reseal your storage container and return it to the refrigerator or freezer as soon as you’re finished portioning. When flaxseed spoils, the fatty acids deteriorate, causing it to take on a rancid odor. Open up the container and give the flaxseed a whiff to make sure it’s okay to eat. If it smells questionable, it’s probably best to throw it away and spring for a new batch.  By contrast, fresh flaxseed will have a mild, nutty scent. Consuming spoiled flaxseed isn’t dangerous, but it may have an unpleasant taste or cause minor digestive issues. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article discusses the importance of preserving flaxseed in order to maintain its freshness and prolong its shelf life. It recommends storing freshly-opened flaxseed in a refrigerator or freezer to protect it from heat and light, which can cause spoilage. Refrigerated flaxseed can last up to 6 months longer than when stored at room temperature, while frozen flaxseed can stay good for a year or longer. It is advised to grind flaxseed only when needed, store it in a sealed container, and avoid exposing it to moisture. The freshness of flaxseed can be determined by its mild, nutty scent, while a rancid odor indicates spoilage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The \\"Facebookgeneration gap\\" has been highlighted in a new piece of research which shows that the average 22 year-old claims to have 1,000 or more friends on sites like Facebook. People in their twenties have more than 50 times as many digital friends as those who are over 50 years old, despite the popularity of sites like Facebook with the older generations, says a study conducted by consumer research group Intersperience. The news comes during the same week Facebook's second-in command, Sheryl Sandberg, is visiting the UK to deliver a speech at the London School of Economics. Facebook's chief operating officer is going to speak about how the social web has transformed people's friendships and relationships. The survey found that there was a clear link between people's age and the number of online friends they have.The researchers found that those aged 13 to 16, have an average of 450 friends on social networks, with girls having slightly more friends that boys.People in their thirties tend to have between 100 and 200 friends, while those in their forties have between 50 and 100. However, those using sites such as Facebook over the age of 50, tended to have 20 or less friends.The oldest person surveyed was 70 years old. Paul Hudson, Intersperience's chief executive, said: \\"Our research underlines fundamental  changes taking place in British society as a result of finally entering the digital age.Half of the UK population are on Facebook now.In a social media context, a 'friend' means something different to a 20 year old than to a 50 year old.\\" He added: \\"Social networking activity is just one example of how different groups are adapting to the digital age at different paces.In this case, age is the determining factor - however in other instances it is not.\\" Answer:","output":"Based on the article, which of the following statements is true about the number of online friends people have on sites like Facebook? A) People in their twenties have about the same number of online friends as those in their fifties. B) The average 22-year-old has around 1,000 online friends.

Step 2: Mention the three featured cocktails – Death in the Afternoon, Absinthe Sazerac, and Kalashnikov Shot. The world of cocktails is vast, colorful, and full of surprises. From the well-known classics like Martini and Margarita to more unconventional concoctions, the possibilities are limitless. Among the countless drink recipes, some daring mixtures stand out for their unique ingredients and striking flavors. In this article, we will explore three such bold and intoxicating creations - Death in the Afternoon, Absinthe Sazerac, and Kalashnikov Shot. Death in the Afternoon: Step 3: Introduce the Death in the Afternoon cocktail and explain the origin of its name. Step 4: Describe its taste and ingredients. Death in the Afternoon is a champagne-based cocktail with a hint of absinthe – a potent combination that delivers a refreshing, slightly bitter taste. This unusual drink, named after Ernest Hemingway's book about bullfighting, is known for its distinct flavor profile and captivating green hue. To make it, simply pour a jigger of absinthe into a glass filled with champagne, and let the mingling of flavors transport you to another dimension of cocktail enjoyment. Absinthe Sazerac: Step 5: Introduce the Absinthe Sazerac cocktail and mention its relation to the classic Sazerac. Step 6: Describe the ingredients and steps needed for making the drink. If you're a fan of the traditional Sazerac, you'll love the Absinthe Sazerac. This New Orleans-inspired drink puts a twist on the classic Sazerac recipe, substituting absinthe for the usual rye whiskey. To prepare this captivating concoction, first, rinse a chilled glass with absinthe and discard the excess liquor. Combine sugar, Peychaud's bitters, and a splash of water in the same glass. Finally, add ice cubes and stir until well-blended. The result is an aromatic, licorice-flavored delight with a touch of sweetness. Kalashnikov Shot: Step 7: Introduce the Kalashnikov Shot and explain its origin. Step 8: Describe the taste, ingredients, and method of preparation. The Kalashnikov Shot, inspired by the iconic Russian firearm, is a powerful cocktail that packs a punch. This intriguing drink combines vodka, Chambord (a raspberry-flavored liqueur), and the distinct taste of Galliano (an Italian herbal liqueur). To make the Kalashnikov shot, pour equal parts of vodka, Chambord, and Galliano into a shaker filled with ice. Give it a thorough shake and strain the mixture into a shot glass. The fusion of flavors creates an unforgettable experience, leaving you wanting more. Conclusion: Step 9: Encourage readers to explore the world of unusual cocktails and embrace the adventure. Stepping out of your comfort zone and trying unconventional cocktails like the Death in the Afternoon, Absinthe Sazerac, and Kalashnikov Shot can lead to exciting discoveries and perhaps even become your new favorites.

Your sins have been forgiven and you have a clean slate to work with. You're that much closer to God. Can you feel it? Now what are you going to do with your fresh start? If you forgot a sin you wished to mention, don't fret. God knows of your intentions and it has been forgiven along with the others. However, you may want to mention it next time. Or it could fester and turn into some unnecessary guilt! Many often choose to return to their pew and resume prayer, offering a silent thanks to God. And if your penance was a select number of certain prayers, there's no better time than now to channel God. So feel free to return to your seat and bookend your reconciliation with prayer. Many reflect on their experiences and how they can avoid the sins in the future. When's the next time you plan on confessing? What can you do in the meantime to find inspiration to live in His image?

What happens if a tourist can't pay the bill of giving birth in the USA and Canada? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"In what ways does the global healthcare marketplace influence the United States healthcare marketplace? The global healthcare marketplace influences the United States healthcare marketplace in various ways, including the following: 1. Cost and pricing: Global competition and pricing can impact the cost of healthcare goods and services in the United States. This may include the prices of medications, medical devices, and even services provided by healthcare professionals. Competition can drive down prices or lead to innovations that enable more cost-effective solutions. 2. Medical tourism: With an increasing number of patients seeking care abroad, the US healthcare industry is pushed to deliver high-quality services at a competitive price. Medical tourism is a result of global healthcare marketplace competition, and in return, it forces the US market to improve to retain domestic utilization of healthcare services. 3. Regulatory environment: Global standards and policy initiatives can influence the US healthcare system. This may manifest in the form of adopting guidelines from international regulating bodies, such as the World Health Organization, or through global agreements that may impact the availability of certain healthcare products and services. 4. Research and innovation: The global healthcare marketplace drives research and development in the medical field, as countries compete to be at the forefront of healthcare innovation. This can lead to collaborations between research institutions in the United States and other countries, potentially accelerating the development of new treatments or technologies. 5. Public health: As the world becomes more connected, the effects of a public health crisis in one country can quickly spill over into another. This can influence the allocation of resources within the United States healthcare system, as the country may need to address global outbreaks or prepare for potential pandemics. 6. Workforce issues: The global healthcare marketplace can impact the healthcare workforce in the United States, in terms of both supply and demand. The US relies on foreign-trained healthcare professionals to fill workforce gaps, and global competition for these professionals may impact the availability of providers in the United States. Additionally, healthcare professionals from the US may seek opportunities abroad for professional development or financial reasons. What happens if a tourist can't pay the bill of giving birth in the USA and Canada? In the event a tourist is unable to pay the bill for giving birth in the United States or Canada, various consequences may arise: 1. Negotiation: Hospitals may work with the patient to negotiate a payment plan, which allows the patient to pay off the bill gradually over an extended period instead of paying the full amount upfront. 2. Charity care: Some hospitals may offer charity care or financial assistance programs to help cover the expenses of uninsured or underinsured patients, based on specific eligibility criteria. 3. Debt collection: Hospitals may resort to debt collection measures, such as engaging a collection agency, filing a lawsuit, or placing a lien on any property owned by the patient in the United States. This may negatively impact the patient's credit rating and ability to travel in the future. 4. Impact on immigration: Unpaid medical bills can result in negative consequences for the individual's immigration status, such as being denied entry to the country in the future, or having difficulty obtaining visas or permanent residency. However, it is essential to note that the exact steps taken will differ depending on the hospital's policies, the patient's individual circumstances, and the severity of the unpaid bill. Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? These two questions are not inquiring about the same information. The first question is about the ways the global healthcare marketplace can impact the United States healthcare marketplace, whereas the second question is about the consequences of a tourist being unable to pay the bill for childbirth in the United States or Canada. The second question does touch on the aspect of medical tourism and healthcare financing, but they have distinct areas of focus."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Next question: when was call of duty advanced warfare released?","output":"Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare is a first-person shooter video game, developed by Sledgehammer Games and published by Activision. It is the eleventh major entry in the Call of Duty series and the first game in the franchise to be developed primarily by Sledgehammer Games. Advanced Warfare takes place in a futuristic setting, with advanced technology and focuses on the events of a Private Military Corporation (PMC) named Atlas. The game was released on November 4th, 2014 for various platforms, including PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. The release of Advanced Warfare was met with generally positive reviews from critics, with praise directed towards its gameplay, graphics, campaign, and multiplayer components. The game's innovative movement system, featuring exoskeletons that allowed players to boost jump, slide, and dash, helped bring a fresh, new dynamic to the series. In addition to this, the game's storyline, which was penned by comic book writer and screenwriter John Macaluso, starred Academy Award-winning actor Kevin Spacey as the main antagonist, adding a touch of prestige and added depth to the narrative. Advanced Warfare also introduced a new game mode called \\"Exo Survival,\\" a cooperative multiplayer mode where players must work together to survive waves of enemy soldiers and drones. This mode added a new layer of strategy to the game, as players had to rely on their exoskeletons to maximize their potential in combat situations. The game's DLC content, which was released post-launch, expanded upon the content available in the base game, offering new maps, weapons, and modes for players to experience. The addition of the \\"Exo Zombies\\" co-op mode proved to be particularly popular, offering a unique twist on the classic Call of Duty Zombies formula by integrating advanced technology and exoskeleton-enhanced zombies into the gameplay. Overall, the release of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare on November 4th, 2014 marked a shift in the franchise, pushing the series into a more futuristic and technologically advanced setting, while still maintaining the core gameplay mechanics that fans had come to expect.

Please answer the following question: What is the name of the character who has lost the will to live?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The film starts off with a scene from the novel Moby Dick, with a whaler on a stormy sea in the 19th century, chasing \\"the white whale\\". It turns out that the scene comes from the imagination of Dot, while she is sitting with the book. She goes out to play with Nelson the dolphin in his pool, and he teaches her how to stay underwater for long periods of time and to communicate underwater, as well as the history and evolution of sea creatures. While they play together, Nelson hears the wail of a beached whale named \\"Tonga\\" from the local coast, and jumps out of his pool, over the cliff beside, and dives into the ocean on the other side, to check what is going on, with Dot coming along. Dot walks up on land to talk with Tonga, but becomes upset as two boys, Alex and Owen, stand and throw sand on the whale. The boys say that they only want to push the whale back to the sea. Together, they try to push Tonga back to the water, but fail. They decide to gather as many kids as possible, in order to help the whale as much as they can. While Alex and Owen start to gather help, Dot sits beside Tonga, trying to converse. Tonga explains that her family has been killed by whalers, and she is the only survivor, but has lost the will to live.

Given those answer options, answer the question: I heard that Remy bought a shock collar and taught the pet to think before acting.  And I was wondering Why did Remy do this? A:","output":"A: Remy likely decided to use a shock collar to train their pet in an attempt to correct unwanted behaviors and establish a sense of discipline and control over the pet's actions. Before diving deeper into Remy's reasoning, it is important to understand the primary intent behind using such a training tool.  Shock collars, also known as electronic collars or e-collars, are designed to deliver a mild electric shock to an animal when they exhibit undesirable behavior. The aim is to create an association between the behavior and a negative stimulus, ultimately reducing or eliminating the occurrence of that behavior. Some pet owners choose to use shock collars as a means of managing their pets' excessive barking, jumping, irritability, or aggressive tendencies. It is worth noting that this method is considered controversial, with animal welfare organizations advocating for positive reinforcement training techniques.  Returning to Remy's decision to utilize a shock collar, they may have adopted this method for a number of reasons: 1) Fast results: In comparison to alternative training techniques, shock collars can yield immediate results. Remy may be looking to expedite their pet's learning process, ensuring the animal adopts acceptable behavior in a relatively short time span. 2) Control and safety: Remy may have concerns about their pet's behavior when they are not around, and using a shock collar can potentially offer greater control in managing such behaviors. This is particularly useful if Remy fears their pet may pose a danger to themselves, other animals, or humans. 3) Easily adjustable: Shock collars typically have a range of settings that enable the pet owner to fine-tune the intensity of the shock. Remy may appreciate the customizability of this device, allowing them to adjust the training experience to suit their pet's specific needs. 4) Last resort: It is possible that Remy has tried other training methods, such as positive reinforcement, but found them to be inadequate or ineffective in addressing their pet's behavioral issues. In this case, the shock collar may represent a last resort for Remy to establish the desired level of control and discipline. 5) Trainer recommendation: Remy might have consulted with a professional trainer who, based on their evaluation of the pet and its behavioral problems, suggested using a shock collar as part of a training program. Overall, it seems that Remy has chosen to use a shock collar to train their pet to think before acting due to the potential for immediate results, increased control and safety, adjustability of the device, and possible recommendations from a professional trainer. However, Remy should also be aware of the controversy surrounding shock collars and consider alternative, positive reinforcement-based training methods, as they may prove to be equally effective and are generally more humane."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Article: High heels were first worn in the 1500s, and were popular with both women and men. Today, high heels are strictly a female fashion that is easily found in stores. High heels are the hit items featured on the runway and are widely worn by celebrities. For instance, in the popular TV drama, Sex and the City, the main character, Carrie, is a lover of high heels that in almost every episode, she purchases a pair of gorgeous 4-inch high heels. Carrie loves the heels so much that she even sets her email address as \\"shoe girl\\". This clearly shows how much modern women love high heels. Even though high heels are popular, they are not the most comfortable shoes to wear. In many ways, high heels have already changed the shape of people's lives. Doctors have warned that continuous wear can cause back pain and serious damage to the knees. Though it is yet to be proven, some psychological reports suggest that high heels can lead to mental disorder, as it is stressful to the people who wear high heels, in the sense that they have to bear the pain in every step. According to Mayann Los Russo, chief editor of Footwear News, high heels are desirable because they make people appear taller. She says, \\"I think it goes back to the idea of pain before beauty.\\" Indeed, some people feel that they always need to look appealing in front of their peers. Still, Dr. Casey Kerrigan, a professor at Harvard Medical School, warns, \\"It takes a long time to feel the effects. And once you do, it's too late.\\" Despite the damage high heels can do to the feet and legs, they remain popular. Most women accept the pain because they like how they look wearing high heels.

Both albums feature contributions from live-band member Alessandro Cortini.  Since the release of Ghosts I–IV, a 25-date tour was announced in several North American cities.  Cortini and Freese returned as members from the previous tour, while Robin Finck rejoined the band.  The lineup was initially to include Rich Fownes, but before any scheduled performances it was revealed that Justin Meldal-Johnsen would instead be contributing on bass guitar. Supporting acts for the tour include Deerhunter, Crystal Castles, Does It Offend You, Yeah?, Ghostland Observatory, A Place to Bury Strangers, and White Williams. In early June, a tour EP was released for free on the Nine Inch Nails website featuring four songs from the supporting artists and one from Nine Inch Nails.  The files are DRM-free MP3s that are fully tagged, and included with the download are desktop wallpapers and a printable tour poster. The band headlined the 2008 Lollapalooza festival, the 2008 Virgin Festival, and the first Pemberton Music Festival.

Answer:","output":"Natalia Ginzburg and Hart Crane were both accomplished literary figures who contributed significantly to the world of literature. However, while Hart Crane was primarily known as a poet, Natalia Ginzburg was not strictly a poet, but rather a novelist, essayist, and playwright. To best understand their roles and impact on literature, it is essential to analyze their individual careers and works. Natalia Ginzburg (1916-1991) was an Italian author known for her captivating novels, autobiographical narratives, essays, and plays that captured the essence of everyday life, relationships, and emotions. Born in Palermo, Italy, Ginzburg was raised in a family with a rich intellectual and political background. Throughout her life, she remained an active participant in Italian political and social issues. Though not a poet by profession, some of her works did incorporate poetic elements. She authored several novels, including \\"The Road to the City\\" (1942), \\"Family Lexicon\\" (1963), and \\"All Our Yesterdays\\" (1952), alongside numerous essays and plays. Her writing style was often characterized as simple, elegant, and intimate, reflecting her keen observation of human nature. Hart Crane (1899-1932) was an American poet whose writing primarily revolved around the experiences of modern life, love, and disillusionment. Born in Garrettsville, Ohio, he was deeply inspired by the works of other well-known poets, such as T.S. Eliot and Walt Whitman. Crane's poetry is infused with rich symbolism, powerful imagery, and a lyrical quality that garnered him a reputation as one of the most influential poets during the early 20th century. Some of his notable works include his debut collection \\"White Buildings\\" (1926) and his masterpiece, \\"The Bridge\\" (1930). Unfortunately, Crane's life was marred by personal struggles with alcoholism, depression, and tumultuous relationships, which ultimately led to his untimely death at the age of 32. In conclusion, while both Natalia Ginzburg and Hart Crane made significant contributions to literature, they were not both poets in the traditional sense. Ginzburg was primarily a novelist, essayist, and playwright who occasionally infused poetic elements into her works, whereas Hart Crane's primary focus was on poetry. Nonetheless, their unique literary styles and dedication to their craft have earned them a prestigious place in the annals of literary history."},{"instruction":"Information:  - An empire is defined as \\"an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government, usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, as the former British Empire, French Empire, Brazilian Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire or Roman Empire.\\" An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire.  - The Spanish Empire was one of the largest empires in history.

It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City, both part of Metro Manila. Bounded by the South China Sea on the west, the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest, the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Vietnam to the west, Palau to the east and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south.  - The phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" has been used with variations to describe certain global empires that were so extensive that there was always at least one part of their territory that was in daylight.  - The Cry of Pugad Lawin ( Filipino : Sigaw ng Pugad Lawin ) , alternately and originally referred to as the Cry of Balintawak ( Filipino : Sigaw ng Balíntawak , Spanish : Grito de Balíntawak ) , was the beginning of the Philippine Revolution against the Spanish Empire . At the close of August 1896 , members of the Katipunan secret society ( Katipuneros ) led by Andrés Bonifacio rose up in revolt somewhere in an area referred to as Kalookan , wider than the jurisdiction of present - day Caloocan City which may have overlapped into present - day Quezon City . Originally the term \`\` Cry '' referred to the first clash between the Katipuneros and the Civil Guards ( Guardia Civil ) . The cry could also refer to the tearing up of community tax certificates ( cédulas personales ) in defiance of their allegiance to Spain . This was literally accompanied by patriotic shouts . Because of competing accounts and ambiguity of the place where this event took place , the exact date and place of the Cry is in contention . From 1908 until 1963 , the official stance was that the Cry occurred on August 26 in Balintawak . In 1963 the Philippine government declared a shift to August 23 in Pugad Lawin , Quezon City .  - The House of Bourbon is a European royal house of French origin, a branch of the Capetian dynasty. Bourbon kings first ruled France and Navarre in the 16th century. By the 18th century, members of the Bourbon dynasty also held thrones in Spain, Naples, Sicily, and Parma. Spain and Luxembourg currently have Bourbon monarchs.    After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'cry of pugad lawin' with the relationship of 'instance of'.

The most suitable option for the next step in the remodel, which is to shop for new flooring, is Home Depot. Home Depot is a well-known home improvement store that offers a wide variety of flooring materials and options to choose from. This makes it an ideal location to head out for shopping, considering the remodel requirements. At Home Depot, customers can find an extensive selection of flooring types, such as hardwood, laminate, vinyl, tile, and carpet, providing the opportunity to choose based on the intended style and functionality for the remodeled space. In addition to boasting an array of materials, Home Depot also offers various brands, colors, patterns, and price ranges, catering to different budgets and design preferences. Shopping at Home Depot for new flooring offers several advantages. For instance, they often have in-store promotions or discounts that can help customers save money on their purchases. Their knowledgeable staff can provide guidance and answer any questions about the different flooring options. They can also give helpful tips on installation and maintenance. Furthermore, Home Depot offers professional installation services for those who may require assistance. On the other hand, the other available options are not as suitable for the task at hand as Home Depot. Loft refers to a room or space directly under the roof, and it doesn't specifically relate to shopping for flooring. House, as a term, represents a residential building and does not correspond to a place to shop for flooring materials. Bundle, in general, refers to a package or collection of items, and it doesn't imply a venue for shopping. Lastly, kitchen is a specific room type within a residence rather than a place to buy flooring. In conclusion, when the next step in a remodel project is new flooring, the most suitable option where they can head out to shop is Home Depot.

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years.

The painting was too large for Martin's house, and in 1831 he sold it on to the Royal Scottish Academy. It was transferred in 1910 to the nearby National Gallery of Scotland where it remains. One of Etty's major works, it was exhibited at numerous major exhibitions including the seminal Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857, before Etty fell out of fashion in the second half of the 19th century. Throughout his life, The Combat continued to be considered one of Etty's most powerful paintings. In 1845, Etty took a smaller 89 by 118 cm (35 by 46 in) copy of The Combat, which had been painted by an unknown Edinburgh artist, and completely reworked it to serve as the basis for an engraving by George Thomas Doo. The engraving was published three years later, and the painting used as its model passed through the hands of several collectors in subsequent years, before entering the collection of the Ringling Museum in 1934. A number of sketches attributed to Etty, under the name of A Study for Mercy Interceding for the Vanquished, are also in circulation.After the success of The Combat, Etty continued with his preferred theme of history paintings containing nudity; of the 15 pictures he exhibited at the Royal Academy during the 1820s (including Cleopatra, Pandora and The Combat) all but one contained a nude figure. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, at that time the most prestigious honour available to an artist. The Combat was the first very large work attempted by Etty, and its success prompted him to produce further works on a similar scale over the rest of his career; he produced nine very large paintings illustrating moral themes throughout his career. As time went by his canvases came to be increasingly dominated by nude women.The 1832 exhibition of Youth on the Prow, and..., what would be the answer ?

The statement is too vague, and several possible interpretations and scenarios might fit the given description. Let's consider some alternative scenarios: 1. Kids participating in a talent show: The children might be lining up and surrounded by their families, friends, and teachers who are eagerly waiting to watch their performances. 2. Children receiving awards or prizes: They could be lining up to receive certificates, medals, or other tokens of appreciation for their achievements in academics, sports, or arts, while parents and educators cheer them on. 3. Students getting ready for a class photo: The kids might be lining up in an orderly manner while teachers and staff help to get them into position for a group shot. 4.

Questions: The mascot gathered the children around the campfire, he then began to what them? Options: - go to movies - read to - imagine - eat smores - play games The answer to this question is:","output":"The answer to this question is: read to. This option is most in line with common sense, as it creates a fitting scenario wherein the mascot gathers children around the campfire to engage in a storytelling session. In this context, it makes the most sense for the mascot to read to the children, as it creates an appropriate setting and atmosphere for sharing stories. A campfire setting is often associated with storytelling and creating a sense of camaraderie and bonding among the attendees. The mascot, in this case, serves as the main storyteller, who brings the children together to share knowledge, teach them valuable lessons, or ignite their imaginations through the power of narrative. The other options, while potentially feasible in different settings, do not fit as well in the context of gathering around a campfire. Going to the movies would require a different setting, like a movie theater or a home with a television, and is therefore not suitable for a campfire gathering. Similarly, having the children engage in imaginative play might not best utilize the mascot's role as an entertainer or teacher. While eating s'mores and playing games could be fitting activities to engage in around a campfire, they are not directly related to the mascot's primary role of entertaining or educating the children. Thus, a long and detailed answer to the question would be: The mascot gathers the children around the campfire in order to read to them, either from a book or by sharing oral stories from memory, in a setting that fosters a sense of bonding, learning, and imagination among the attendees. This experience allows the children to connect with the mascot on a deeper level, learn important life lessons, and leave the event with lasting memories that enrich their personal and social development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When writing or reading a court case's name, the plaintiff is typically listed first, followed by the \\"v\\" abbreviation, and then the defendant. For example, in the well-known United States court case Brown v. Board of Education, Brown (the plaintiff) brought a lawsuit against the Board of Education (the defendant) regarding racial segregation in public schools. Within different jurisdictions and legal systems, the format of case citations and the usage of \\"v\\" can differ slightly. For instance, in the UK and other Commonwealth nations, it has become customary to use \\"and\\" or \\"&\\" instead of \\"v\\" in criminal cases. The \\"v\\" remains in use for civil lawsuits. However, in the US, \\"v\\" is used consistently in both civil and criminal cases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - The liver removes toxins from the blood - Liver also cleans blood that has just been enriched with vitamins and minerals during digestion - Liver processes the good stuff into forms that the rest of the body can use - Waste or stuff your body doesn't need can be carried by bile back into the intestine or into the kidneys - The liver also produces a digestive juice called bile that helps the body absorb fat into the bloodstream - The liver also stores extra carbohydrates as glycogen for the body to use as fuel when needed.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less toxins removed from the blood happens, how will it affect the liver having to work SOFTER.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the proposed perturbation - less toxins being removed from the blood - can have both direct and indirect effects on the liver and its processes. Step 1: Less toxins removed from the blood When the liver removes fewer toxins from the blood, the blood may contain higher levels of harmful substances. This can lead to an accumulation of toxins, potentially damaging the liver cells and other parts of the body. Step 2: Effects on blood cleansing and nutrient processing With the liver working less efficiently in toxin removal, it may also have negative impacts on its other functions, including blood cleansing, nutrient processing, and waste removal. The liver might not be able to optimally filter the blood, which may affect the overall health and functioning of the body. Step 3: Effects on bile production and absorption of fats The liver is responsible for producing bile, which helps in absorbing fats into the bloodstream. If the liver is functioning at a reduced capacity, it might produce less bile or less effective bile. This can result in decreased fat absorption, potentially leading to deficiencies in essential fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins. Step 4: Effects on glycogen storage The liver also stores extra carbohydrates as glycogen to be used as fuel when needed. A liver working less optimally due to decreased toxin removal might store less glycogen or have a more difficult time releasing glycogen as fuel. This can lead to issues with maintaining steady blood sugar levels and energy levels in the body. Overall, the proposed perturbation of the liver removing fewer toxins from the blood can have direct and indirect effects on the liver's functioning. These effects may include reduced blood cleansing, nutrient processing, bile production, and glycogen storage, impacting overall health and vital processes within the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: The port was the point of departure for the Pilgrim Fathers aboard Mayflower in 1620.  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Answer: The famous ship that left Southampton's port carrying the Pilgrim Fathers was none other than the Mayflower. This historic voyage embarked from the port of Southampton, England, in August 1620 with the aim to transport a group of English separatists, later known as the Pilgrim Fathers, to the New World. The Pilgrim Fathers were a group of religious people who sought religious freedom and were fleeing persecution from the Church of England. They believed in attaining a pure state of Christianity and wanted to separate themselves from the Anglican Church, whose practices they disagreed with. The initial plan for the journey was for two ships to sail together from Southampton, with the Mayflower being accompanied by another ship called the Speedwell. However, due to the Speedwell experiencing leaks during the journey, both ships had to return to England twice. Eventually, it was decided that the Mayflower would continue the journey alone, leaving behind some passengers and transporting approximately 102 passengers and roughly 30 crew members. On September 6, 1620, the Mayflower finally departed from Plymouth, England, and set sail on its arduous and momentous journey across the Atlantic Ocean. It took the Mayflower 66 days to cross the treacherous waters of the North Atlantic before arriving at Cape Cod, Massachusetts, on November 9, 1620. Upon their arrival, the Pilgrim Fathers drafted the Mayflower Compact, an agreement signed by 41 adult males on board that laid the foundation for the governance and laws in the new Plymouth colony. This document represented the first practical example of democracy and self-government in the English colonies of the New World. The journey and establishment of the Plymouth colony by the Pilgrim Fathers were significant as it marked the beginning of the British colonization of the Americas. The story of the Mayflower and the Pilgrim Fathers also occupies an important place in American history and is often commemorated during the annual Thanksgiving Day celebration. In conclusion, the famous ship that left Southampton's port carrying the Pilgrim Fathers in 1620 was the Mayflower, a vessel that played a critical role in the establishment of the Plymouth colony and showcased the determination of its passengers in seeking religious freedom and a new life in the New World."},{"instruction":"Fact 1: Scraping oneself on a contaminated object may cause infection.

Process:  - The bird picks a tree - The bird collects twigs and other refuse - The bird makes a flat base with twigs - The bird makes sides with twigs and other things - The bird adds softer material to the inside - The nest is done.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are more trees chopped down happens, how will it affect MORE/LARGER nests.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The process of nest building by birds is greatly influenced by the availability of suitable trees and other resources. It is an important part of the overall survival and reproductive success of birds. If we consider a scenario where more trees are chopped down, this perturbation can significantly affect the birds' nesting behavior and the construction of MORE/LARGER nests. The potential direct or indirect effects of this perturbation on the process can be analyzed as follows: Direct Effects: 1. Reduced availability of nesting sites: Since the very first step of the process is the bird selecting a tree, the chopping down of trees will directly impact their ability to choose suitable nesting sites. This can force birds to build nests in less desirable locations, which may not provide adequate support, shelter, or protection. 2. Scarcity of building materials: The chopping down of trees also affects the availability of resources like twigs and leaves needed for nest construction. This could lead to birds struggling to find the necessary materials, making it difficult for them to build larger and more elaborate nests. 3. Increased competition for resources: The reduction in available trees and nesting materials can lead to increased competition among birds for these resources. This competitive environment can make it more challenging for birds to secure enough materials to build larger nests, potentially affecting their reproductive success. Indirect Effects: 1. Changes in species distribution and behaviors: The loss of trees can lead to changes in the distribution of bird species and their behaviors. Birds that rely heavily on specific trees for nesting may be forced to use alternative nesting sites, which could potentially lead to more inter-species interaction and competition for resources. 2. Impacts on other ecosystem components: The chopping down of trees can have ripple effects throughout the ecosystem. As trees provide shelter and resources for other organisms, their removal can create imbalances in food chains and ecological interactions. Consequently, this could indirectly affect the availability of food and nesting materials for birds. 3. Altered environmental factors: The removal of trees can significantly alter microclimates, exposing birds to harsher environmental conditions. This could make it more challenging for birds to build nests that can withstand these conditions, leading to the construction of smaller or less sturdy nests. Overall, both the direct and indirect effects of the perturbation (chopping down trees) have the potential to considerably impact the process of nest-building by birds. The reduction in suitable nesting sites, scarcity of building materials, and harsher environmental conditions can pose challenges for birds to construct larger and more elaborate nests. Furthermore, these conditions can also influence reproductive success and survival rates, highlighting the vital importance of preserving tree populations for the well-being and sustenance of birds and other organisms that rely on them."},{"instruction":"Q: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I read the comments for these speakers before I bought them.

Though these questions do not have the same meaning, they are closely related. I will address each question separately and explain their connections. 1. Why did the Indian government demolish ₹500 and ₹1000 notes? There were multiple key objectives behind the Indian government's decision to demonetize ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes in November 2016: a) Tackling black money: The move was aimed at curbing the circulation of black money (undisclosed and unaccounted income) and counterfeit currency. A significant portion of black money was held in the form of ₹500 and ₹1000 notes, and by invalidating these denominations overnight, the government intended to bring this illicit wealth under the purview of the formal economy. b) Digitization and financial inclusion: By banning high-value currency notes, the government sought to encourage the adoption of digital payment methods and promote financial inclusion. The temporary cash crunch that followed demonetization compelled people to explore alternative payment methods like bank transfers and mobile wallets, thereby boosting their overall usage. c) Counter-terrorism efforts: Banning high-denomination notes was also an attempt to disrupt financing channels for illegal activities and terrorist organizations. The government aimed at restricting the cash flow to these organizations by eliminating counterfeit currency from the financial system. 2. If the Indian government has decided to demonetize ₹500 and ₹1000 notes, why are they bringing back new ₹500 and ₹2000 notes? Although the government banned the older ₹500 and ₹1000 notes, it introduced new ₹500 and ₹2000 currency notes for several reasons: a) Maintaining cash liquidity: Completely abolishing high-denomination notes would have drastically impacted daily economic activities. Reintroducing ₹500 and an even higher denomination (₹2000) helped the government maintain liquidity in the system while they took steps to promote financial inclusion and digitization. b) Improved security features: The new ₹500 and ₹2000 notes were equipped with enhanced security features to curb counterfeiting. Some of these features include color-changing ink, intaglio printing, see-through registration marks, and micro-lettering. c) Boosting public confidence: Introducing new currency notes served as a measure to restore public confidence in the banking system and the economy. It demonstrated that the government was committed to addressing critical issues like black money and that they were undertaking steps to stabilize the cash flow in the country. In summary, while the question on why the Indian government demolished ₹500 and ₹1000 notes is related to the objectives of demonetization, the question about the introduction of new ₹500 and ₹2000 notes pertains to the government's strategy and efforts to continue addressing the aforementioned objectives while ensuring the stability and functionality of the economy."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer:","output":"The last step of the mushroom life cycle is the formation of a new fruiting body, known as a mushroom or toadstool, which emerges from the soil or growing medium. This occurs after the mycelium, a network of thread-like structures formed by the germinating spores, has successfully colonized the substrate and absorbed necessary nutrients. The mycelium forms a dense mass called a primordium, which then develops into a fully mature fruiting body. During the maturation of the fruiting body, cells differentiate into various structures such as the cap, gills, or pores, and the stalk. Once the mushroom reaches an appropriate size and stage of development, it releases its spores through the process of sporulation, which are then dispersed into the environment, carried by the wind or other means. This helps ensure the continuation of the mushroom's life cycle and the propagation of the species. This entire process is influenced by various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and availability of nutrients. The fruiting bodies will continue to grow and develop until they have depleted available resources or are no longer viable due to external conditions. After this point, the mushroom will either decay or be consumed by other organisms, returning nutrients to the environment and ultimately allowing for the growth of new generations of mushrooms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: What substances, which are distinct from acids and bases, form when ions form ionic bonds?   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Salts Recall that salts are formed when ions form ionic bonds. In these reactions, one atom gives up one or more electrons, and thus becomes positively charged, whereas the other accepts one or more electrons and becomes negatively charged. You can now define a salt as a substance that, when dissolved in water, dissociates into ions other than H+ or OH–. This fact is important in distinguishing salts from acids and bases, discussed next. A typical salt, NaCl, dissociates completely in water (Figure 2.15). The positive and negative regions on the water molecule (the hydrogen and oxygen ends respectively) attract the negative chloride and positive sodium ions, pulling them away from each other. Again, whereas nonpolar and polar covalently bonded compounds break apart into molecules in solution, salts dissociate into ions. These ions are electrolytes; they are capable of conducting an electrical current in solution. This property is critical to the function of ions in transmitting nerve impulses and prompting muscle contraction.   Choices:  - oils  - vitamins  - water molecules  - salts   A: The answer to this question is:","output":"- salts The paragraph describes how salts are formed when ions form ionic bonds and how they dissociate into ions other than H+ or OH– when dissolved in water, distinguishing them from acids and bases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The music hall and cabaret are famous Paris institutions. The Moulin Rouge was opened in 1889. It was highly visible because of its large red imitation windmill on its roof, and became the birthplace of the dance known as the French Cancan. It helped make famous the singers Mistinguett and Édith Piaf and the painter Toulouse-Lautrec, who made posters for the venue. In 1911, the dance hall Olympia Paris invented the grand staircase as a settling for its shows, competing with its great rival, the Folies Bergère, Its stars in the 1920s included the American singer and dancer Josephine Baker. The Casino de Paris presented many famous French singers, including Mistinguett, Maurice Chevalier, and Tino Rossi. Other famous Paris music halls include Le Lido, on the Champs-Élysées, opened in 1946; and the Crazy Horse Saloon, featuring strip-tease, dance and magic, opened in 1951. The Olympia Paris has presented Edith Piaf, Marlene Dietrich, Miles Davis, Judy Garland, and the Grateful Dead. A half dozen music halls exist today in Paris, attended mostly visitors to the city.

In this context, it appears that their personal experience allows them to relate to others who might find themselves in the same situation. This understanding comes from having firsthand experience of what it's like to be the only caregiver present and having to attend to the needs and desires of the children. The concept of being \\"down to one friend\\" who holds a certain position might be a separate issue that the speaker is addressing. It could signify the potential change in their social circle or the priorities they hold as they navigate through life, given that they now have the responsibility of taking care of children. These kinds of experiences can lead people to reassess their relationships and develop a deeper understanding of their own needs and values. On the other hand, it could also imply that the speaker has lost touch with other friends who might have been in the same situation earlier. This could be because their friends' circumstances have changed, or due to the natural ebb and flow of friendships as people go through various stages of life. The speaker also appears to be commenting on the fact that they are currently the only adult at home with the children. This can be an overwhelming situation at times, as it involves being the sole decision-maker and caretaker in the household without the help of another adult. This might be one of the reasons why the speaker can empathize with others who are experiencing similar situations, as they have had firsthand experience with the challenges that it brings in terms of balancing the various responsibilities and demands placed on them. In conclusion, the statement \\"I understand what that's like because I'm home alone with kids who are clamoring for my attention\\" suggests that personal experience has offered the speaker insight into the feelings and challenges faced by individuals in similar circumstances. By being the only adult in the household tasked with managing the care and well-being of the children, the speaker has learned to empathize and understand what others in such situations must be going through."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: What is the first name of the person who transitioned from commercial art towards his own original style of painting?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Upon returning to Toronto, Jackson published an article about his and Thomson's experience in the Park in the Toronto Sunday World, included in which were several illustrations. After this initial experience, Thomson and another colleague, William Broadhead, went on a two-month expedition, going up the Spanish River and into Mississagi Forest Reserve (today Mississagi Provincial Park). Thomson's transition from commercial art towards his own original style of painting became apparent around this time. Much of his artwork from this trip, mainly oil sketches and photographs, was lost during two canoe spills; the first was on Green Lake in a rain squall and the second in a series of rapids.In fall 1912, Albert Robson, Grip's art director, moved to the design firm Rous & Mann. A month after returning to Toronto, Thomson followed Robson and left Grip to join Rous & Mann too. They were soon joined by Varley, Carmichael and Lismer. Robson later spoke favourably of Thomson's loyalty, calling him \\"a most diligent, reliable and capable craftsman\\". Robson's success in attracting great talent was well understood. Employee Leonard Rossell believed that the key to Robson's success \\"was that the artists felt that he was interested in them personally and did all he could to further their progress.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis, in this case, is referring to the supposition that in industrialized areas, humans are killing more rats and mice. If this occurs, it may have both direct and indirect effects on the hunting process of owls. Direct effects: 1. Reduced prey availability: As humans kill more rats and mice in industrialized areas, the number of potential prey for owls is reduced. Consequently, it becomes more challenging for owls to find and hunt their preferred food sources, resulting in the need for them to broaden their hunting range or adapt to new prey species. 2. Changes in hunting habits: The reduction in small mammal populations may force owls to change their hunting habits in response to the availability of prey. For instance, they might need to spend more time and energy searching for prey, or they could start hunting more frequently during certain times of the day or year when the prey is more abundant. Indirect effects: 1. Changes in prey behavior and distribution: As humans kill rats and mice, the behavior and distribution of these prey species may change. This could lead to a shift in where owls are likely to find prey and a change in the preferred hunting grounds. 2. Ecological interactions: The loss of rats and mice in industrialized areas can have cascading effects on the local ecosystem. For example, it may lead to an increase in the populations of other prey species, which could, in turn, impact the owls' hunting process and prey selection. 3. Environmental factors: Industrialized areas might have other factors that influence the owls' hunting process. For instance, higher levels of pollution, more artificial light, or habitat fragmentation could affect the owls' ability to efficiently hunt for their prey. Overall, the supposed perturbation of increased rat and mouse fatalities in industrialized areas could have both direct and indirect effects on the hunting process of owls. They may need to adapt their hunting strategies and techniques accordingly or face challenges in finding sufficient prey to maintain their populations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"The term includes cosmic , geologic , and organic history , but is often generically implied to mean human history .\\" be a reasonable answer? Pick from: (a). No (b). Yes Answer:","output":"(a). No The proposed answer erroneously ties the reasons for historical change primarily to natural factors like cosmic, geologic, and organic history. While these elements can indeed influence the course of history, they're not the crux of what drives historical change, especially in the context of human history. The reasons for historical change are far more intricate and multifaceted, encompassing various social, political, technological, economical, and cultural factors among others. Social changes, such as shifts in societal structures, population dynamics, and cultural norms, play a significant role in driving historical change. For instance, the abolition of slavery in many regions came about due to societal changes in attitudes towards equality and human rights.  Political changes too have their repercussions. The rise and fall of different regimes, wars, and revolutions have led to significant redirections in history. For instance, the French Revolution in the late 18th century not only transformed France, but also had profound effects on the course of modern history, spreading the ideals of liberty and democracy. Technological advancement is another reason for historical change. From the shift from hunter-gatherer societies to agricultural ones enabled by advancements in farming technology, to the Industrial Revolution driven by mechanisation, technology has historically been a potent driver of change. Economic factors also play a crucial part in shaping history. Economic depressions, growth, and recessions, the development of trade routes, and the discovery of new resources can drastically alter societal structures and drive history in new directions. The discovery of the New World, for example, redirected the economic focus of Europe and brought about significant historical change. Ultimately, the reasons for historical change are inextricably interconnected, with changes in one area often triggering changes in others. Hence, while cosmic, geologic, and organic history can influence human history, they do not encompass the complexity of reasons behind historical change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

From turning professional in 1977 until his retirement in 1994, he won nine monument classics, and 193 professional races in total. He won Paris- Kelly returned in April to the 1988 Vuelta a Espana which started on the rugged mountainous island of Tenerife where his team struggled in the second stage, losing the influential rider Thomas Wegmuller to dysentery and losing further time in the time-trial around Las Palmas. However, on the Spanish mainland, Kelly concentrated on winning sprint time bonuses, battling with sprinter Jorge Dominguez, the BH teammate of leader, Laudelino Cubino.  After regaining a minute in four days, the race reached the mountains where Kelly relied on help from Robert Millar of team Fagor-MBK to stay within two minutes of Cubino after the mountain trial to Alto Oviedo. He then finished fourth behind stage-winner Fabio Parra and Anselmo Fuerte on stage 13 to the ski-station at Cerler, cutting a minute and a half into Cubino's lead.

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   If the potential energy between charge A and charge B decreases, are they closer or farther?  David is interested in how electricity works. One day he had two electric charges to investigate, charge A and charge B - both of the charges were negative. He also had two electric fields, field C and field D. He noticed that electric charges were moving from field C to field D.  Hint: Electric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges actually move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where they have lower potential energy. This is like water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity. A:","output":"Given the information in the paragraph, if the potential energy between charge A and charge B decreases, they are likely farther apart. Step 1: Identify the charges and their interactions. In this case, both charge A and charge B are negative charges. Negative charges repel each other. Step 2: Understand the relationship between potential energy and the position of charged particles. When two negatively charged particles are close together, they have a higher potential energy due to the repulsion between them. Step 3: Apply the hint about the decrease in potential energy. If the potential energy between charge A and charge B decreases, it means they are moving into a position where they have lower potential energy. Step 4: Conclude the relationship between distance and potential energy. Since the potential energy decreases, this indicates that the two charges have moved apart, making them farther from each other. This corresponds to the natural tendency of electric charges to move from a position of higher potential energy to a position of lower potential energy, such as in the example of water falling over a dam due to gravity."},{"instruction":"Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who invited Sönam Gyatso to meet him in the Amdo? ?  During the reign of the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–1567), the native Chinese ideology of Daoism was fully sponsored at the Ming court, while Tibetan Vajrayana and even Chinese Buddhism were ignored or suppressed. Even the History of Ming states that the Tibetan lamas discontinued their trips to Ming China and its court at this point. Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe under Jiajing was determined to break the eunuch influence at court which typified the Zhengde era, an example being the costly escort of the eunuch Liu Yun as described above in his failed mission to Tibet. The court eunuchs were in favor of expanding and building new commercial ties with foreign countries such as Portugal, which Zhengde deemed permissible since he had an affinity for foreign and exotic people.With the death of Zhengde and ascension of Jiajing, the politics at court shifted in favor of the Neo-Confucian establishment which not only rejected the Portuguese embassy of Fernão Pires de Andrade (d. 1523), but had a predisposed animosity towards Tibetan Buddhism and lamas. Evelyn S. Rawski, a professor in the Department of History of the University of Pittsburgh, writes that the Ming's unique relationship with Tibetan prelates essentially ended with Jiajing's reign while Ming influence in the Amdo region was supplanted by the Mongols.The Chinese Ming dynasty also deliberately helped to propagate Tibetan Buddhism instead of Chinese Buddhism among the Mongols. The Ming assisted Altan Khan, King of the Tümed Mongols, when he requested aid in propagating Lamaism.Meanwhile, the Tumed Mongols began moving into the Kokonor region (modern Qinghai), raiding the Ming Chinese frontier and even as far as the suburbs of Beijing under Altan Khan (1507–1582). Klieger writes that Altan Khan's presence in the west effectively reduced Ming influence and contact with Tibet.

Information:  - The 14 British Overseas Territories (BOT) are territories under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United Kingdom. They are those parts of the former British Empire that have not chosen independence or have voted to remain British territories. Most of the inhabited territories are internally self-governing, with the UK retaining responsibility for defence and foreign relations. The rest are either uninhabited or have a transitory population of military or scientific personnel. They share the British monarch (Elizabeth II) as head of state.  - Acts of Parliament, also called primary legislation, are statutes passed by a parliament (legislature). Act of the Oireachtas is an equivalent term used in the Republic of Ireland where the legislature is commonly known by its Irish name, . It is also comparable to an Act of Congress in the United States.  - In England and Wales, a magistrates' court is a lower court, where almost all criminal proceedings start. Some civil matters are also decided here, notably family proceedings. They have been streamlined to deliver justice swiftly. In 2015 there were roughly 330 magistrates' courts in England and Wales, though the Government was considering closing up to 57 of these. The jurisdiction of magistrates' courts and rules governing them are set out in the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980.  - The Architects Act 1997 ( c. 22 ) is the consolidating Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for the keeping and publishing of the statutory Register of Architects by the Architects Registration Board . It has the long title : An Act to consolidate the enactments relating to architects . It consolidated two Acts of the 1930s as later amended both by primary legislation and by Orders in Council implementing the EC directive on architects providing for the recognition of architects qualified in other EC states , and the changes which had been made by Part III of the Housing Grants , Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 .  - The Parliament of the United Kingdom, commonly known as the UK Parliament or British Parliament, is the supreme legislative body in the United Kingdom, British Crown dependencies and British overseas territories. It alone possesses legislative supremacy and thereby ultimate power over all other political bodies in the UK and its territories. Its head is the Sovereign of the United Kingdom (currently Queen Elizabeth II) and its seat is the Palace of Westminster in the City of Westminster, London.  - The City of Westminster is an Inner London borough which also holds city status. It occupies much of the central area of Greater London including most of the West End. It is to the west of and adjoining the ancient City of London, directly to the east of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, and its southern boundary is the River Thames. It was created with the 1965 establishment of Greater London. Upon creation, Westminster was awarded city status, which had been previously held by the smaller Metropolitan Borough of Westminster.  - Under an Act passed by the UK Parliament in 1931, there was established an Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom (ARCUK), referred to in the Act as \\"the Council\\". The constitution of the Council was prescribed by the First Schedule to the Act. The Act made the Council a body corporate by the name Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom. It was habitually referred to colloquially by the acronym ARCUK.  - The Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom. Its long title shows that it is a piece of omnibus legislation:  - The Architects Registration Board (ARB) is the statutory body for the registration of architects in the United Kingdom. It operates under the Architects Act 1997 as , a consolidating Act. It began under the Architects (Registration) Act, 1931 which gave it the name the Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom (ARCUK). It prescribes architectural qualifications, maintains the Register of Architects and for registered persons has certain responsibilities for standards of professional conduct and competence. Its main source of income is fees payable under Part II of the Act by persons on their becoming registered or for their retention on the Register. The Board is required to pay into the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom any sum paid under a penalty order which its Professional Conduct Committee has made under Part III of the Act (in conduct cases). Fines imposed by Magistrates' Court (England and Wales) (or similar in Scotland or Northern Ireland) under Part IV of the Act (in misuse of title cases) are not payable to the Board.  - From 1932 there has been a statutory Register of Architects under legislation of the United Kingdom Parliament originally enacted in 1931. The originating Act contained ancillary provisions for entering an architects name in the register and removing a name from it which later legislation has amended.

Article: A lot of management training each year for Circle K Corporation, a national chain of convenience stores. Among the topics we address in our course is the retention  of quality employees-a real challenge to managers when you consider the pay scale in the service industry. During these discussions, I ask the participants , \\"What has caused you to stay long enough to become a manager?\\" Some time back a new manager took the question and slowly, with her voice almost breaking, said, \\"It was a 19 baseball glove.\\" Cynthia told the group that she originally took a Circle K clerk job as an interim  position while she looked for something better. On her second or third day behind the counter, she received a phone call from her nine-year-old son, Jessie. He needed a baseball glove for Little League. She explained that as a single mother, money was very tight, and her first check would have to go for paying bills. Perhaps she could buy his baseball glove with her second or third check. When Cynthia arrived for work the next morning, Patricia, the store manager, asked her to come to the small room in the back of the store that served as an office. Cynthia wondered if she had done something wrong or left some part of her job incomplete from the day before. She was concerned and confused. Patricia handed her a box. \\"I overheard you talking to your son yesterday,\\" she said, \\"and I know that it is hard to explain things to kids. This is a baseball glove for Jessie because he may not understand how important he is, even though you have to pay bills before you can buy gloves. You know we can't pay good people like you as much as we would like to; but we do care, and I want you to know you are important to us.\\" The thoughtfulness, empathy and love of this convenience store manager demonstrates vividly that people remember more how much an employer cares than how much the employer pays.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart?, using the article: After a textual montage summarizing Edgar Allan Poe's life, the film begins in late September 1849 with Poe awakening from a hallucination where he is buried alive.  He prepares to take a trip to New York City via a ferry steamboat from Richmond, Virginia, to Baltimore, and from there, another ferry to New York City itself.  He discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster with a stranger taking the same steamboat, who suggests that he meet with a few potential investors for his planned magazine The Stylus.  Though Poe had intended only to pass through Baltimore, he agrees to meet the investors who, one by one, turn down his request for funding.  Poe is depicted as having some type of memory loss, which is first evident when he offers to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore, he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended.  One night, he chooses to dine in a local tavern rather than at the hotel.  There, he meets an old friend from his days at West Point.  In desperation, he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine, saying proudly he has already raised 1,000.  Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his prospectus for the magazine.  His classmate follows him and beats him up to steal the 1,000 he had collected. An injured and delirious Poe is then found by organizers of a cooping ring.

Fact 2: An insulated cup with a cover is great for keeping beverages warm.  Given the two facts above, how do you keep a cup hot? A:","output":"Given the information provided, one can deduce several ways to keep a cup hot using the principles of insulation and heat retention. 1. Choosing the Right Cup: Start with an insulated cup. These cups are often double-walled, meaning there is an inner and outer layer. The space between these layers is vacuum-sealed which reduces the rate of heat transfer, as there is no matter in a vacuum that would carry the heat away. This works on a principle of physics where heat transfer happens from a region of high temperature to a region of low temperature. Insulated cups reduce the rate of this transfer, keeping your beverage hotter for longer. 2. Using a Cup Cover: Using a cover on your cup further enhances the insulation effect. The primary role of the lid is to reduce heat loss through convection. Convection occurs when heat is carried away by the movement of fluids, such as air in this case. By blocking the surface of the hot beverage with a lid, we limit the exposure to cooler air and prevent the escape of the steam, which carries away heat from the beverage. This reduces heat loss and keeps the beverage warmer.  3. Preheating the Cup: Another technique often used to ensure that the beverage stays hotter for longer is preheating the insulated cup before pouring the hot beverage into it. This means pouring hot water into the cup, then dumping it out before filling the cup with the beverage. This process raises the initial temperature of the cup to prevent immediate heat loss when the hot beverage is poured. 4. Avoid Repeated Opening: The more times the cup is opened, the more opportunities for heat to escape. Try to avoid removing the lid too often or for too long - each time you do, you let steam (i.e., heat) escape and let cold air in. 5. Size of the Cup: Smaller cups or thermoses have a smaller surface area for heat loss and often, leads to the hot beverages staying warmer for longer. Larger volumes and surfaces areas tend to lose heat faster. 6. Using a Cup Sleeve or Cozy: If the cup becomes too hot to handle, that's a sign of heat escape. Cup sleeves or cozies insulate the outside of the cup, retain more heat within the beverage and protect the hands from the heat. 7. Cup Material: The cup material matters as well. Stainless steel cups are often the best at heat retention, but porcelain and ceramic are also good choices.  By using these methods and principles, you can effectively help to keep a cup hot for longer periods of time."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

A sigma (σ) orbital (bonding) or a sigma star (σ*) orbital(antibonding) is symmetrical about the internuclear axis. Hence all cross-sections perpendicular to that axis are circular. Both a pi (π) orbital (bonding) and a pi star (π*) orbital (antibonding) possess a nodal plane that contains the nuclei, with electron density localized on both sides of the plane. The energies of the molecular orbitals versus those of the parent atomic orbitals can be shown schematically in an energy-level diagram. The electron configuration of a molecule is shown by placing the correct number of electrons in the appropriate energy-level diagram, starting with the lowest-energy orbital and obeying the Pauli principle; that is, placing only two electrons with opposite spin in each orbital. From the completed energy-level diagram, we can calculate thebond order, defined as one-half the net number of bonding electrons. In bond orders, electrons in antibonding molecular orbitals cancel electrons in bonding molecular orbitals, while electrons in nonbonding orbitals have no effect and are not counted. Bond orders of 1, 2, and 3 correspond to single, double, and triple bonds, respectively. Molecules with predicted bond orders of 0 are generally less stable than the isolated atoms and do not normally exist. Molecular orbital energy-level diagrams for diatomic molecules can be created if the electron configuration of the parent atoms is known, following a few simple rules. Most important, the number of molecular orbitals in a molecule is the same as the number of atomic orbitals that interact. The difference between bonding and antibonding molecular orbital combinations is proportional to the overlap of the parent orbitals and decreases as the energy difference between the parent atomic...

Step 1: Read and Analyze the Text Before I begin completing the text, I need to read and analyze the provided text to understand the context and setting. From the given text, it can be inferred that the main character is in a small, claustrophobic hallway in a mobile home and is being asked by Jake to enter a tiny bathroom. Step 2: Continue the Story Now that I understand the context, I will continue the story in a way that maintains the overall mood and style whilst providing a coherent narrative. Jake looked at me, a reassuring smile playing on his lips. \\"Don't worry,\\" he said softly, noticing my unease. \\"It'll only take a moment, and I promise it won't be that bad.\\" Step 3: Describe the Actions In order to build suspense and engage the reader, I will describe the character's movements and actions in detail.

As his car slid downtown on Tuesday morning the mind of Arnold Thorndike was occupied with such details of daily routine as the purchase of a railroad, the Japanese loan, the new wing to his art gallery, and an attack that morning, in his own newspaper, upon his pet trust. But his busy mind was not too occupied to return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him. Or, by some genius of memory, to recall the fact that it was on this morning young Spear was to be sentenced for theft. It was a charming morning. The spring was at full tide, and the air was sweet and clean. Mr. Thorndike considered whimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding a year to his sentence. He regretted he had not given the probation officer a stronger letter. He remembered the young man now, and favorably. A shy, silent youth, deft in work, and at other times conscious and embarrassed. But that, on the part of a stenographer, in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street, was not unnatural. On occasions, Mr. Thorndike had put even royalty— frayed, impecunious royalty, on the lookout for a loan—at its ease. The hood of the car was down, and the taste of the air, warmed by the sun, was grateful. It was at this time, a year before, that young Spear picked the spring flowers to take to his mother. A year from now where would young Spear be? It was characteristic of the great man to act quickly, so quickly that his friends declared he was a slave to impulse. It was these same impulses, leading so invariably to success, that made his enemies call him the Wisest Man.

A word, a personal word from him to the district attorney, or the judge, would be enough.

Explanation: Mr. Thorndike, as per the given passage, intends to interfere on behalf of young Spear, who was to be sentenced for theft on this day. For this purpose, he gives the order to his chauffeur to halt at the Court of General Sessions. The passage implies that Mr. Thorndike, a man of influence, plans to have a word with the district attorney or the judge to possibly affect the outcome of young Spear's sentencing. Therefore, the answer to the question \\"What did Mr. Thorndike want to do at the Court of General Sessions?\\" is \\"Speak with the district attorney or judge personally\\".

Manchester has a notable place in the history of Marxism and left-wing politics; being the subject of Friedrich Engels' work The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844; Engels spent much of his life in and around Manchester, and when Karl Marx visited Manchester, they met at Chetham's Library. The economics books Marx was reading at the time can be seen in the library, as can the window seat where Marx and Engels would meet. The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from 2 to 6 June 1868. Manchester was an important cradle of the Labour Party and the Suffragette Movement.At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen—new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the Manchester School, promoting free trade and laissez-faire), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: \\"What Manchester does today, the rest of the world does tomorrow.\\" Manchester's golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the 19th century. Many of the great public buildings (including Manchester Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the Hallé Orchestra. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a county borough with even greater autonomy. Although the Industrial Revolution brought wealth to the city, it also brought poverty and squalor to a large part of the population. Historian Simon Schama noted that \\"Manchester was the very best and the very worst taken to terrifying extremes, a new kind of city in the world; the chimneys of industrial suburbs greeting you with columns of smoke\\". An American visitor taken to Manchester's blackspots saw \\"wretched, defrauded, oppressed, crushed human nature, lying and bleeding fragments\\".The number of cotton mills in Manchester itself...

There were new ways of thinking being promoted, specifically the Manchester School which centered around free trade and laissez-faire economics. 3. New classes or groups were emerging in society. 4.

Lila's brother (and Ann's college friend) Buddy (Hugh Dancy) introduces her to Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson), a young doctor and the son of a former family servant. Buddy tells Ann his sister always has adored Harris, and expresses his concern that she's marrying another man out of a sense of duty rather than love. Inebriated, Buddy passes out, and as Ann and Harris chat they find themselves bonding. On Lila's wedding day, she confesses to Ann that she confronted Harris with her feelings for him and he rebuffed her, so she goes along with the ceremony as planned and marries Karl.

Movie title: Return to Oz Context: In October 1899, six months after returning home from the Land of Oz, Dorothy Gale is melancholic. Her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry take her to Dr. Worley, known for his electrotherapy treatments, and leave her under the care of Nurse Wilson. During a thunderstorm, the lab suffers a blackout and Dorothy is saved by a mysterious girl. They escape with Nurse Wilson in pursuit, and fall into a river. Dorothy clambers aboard a chicken coop, but the other girl appears to have vanished underwater. Upon awakening, Dorothy finds herself back in Oz with her chicken Billina, who can now talk. They find the Emerald City in ruins and its citizens (including the Tin Woodman and Cowardly Lion) turned to stone. Pursued by Wheelers (humans who have wheels instead of hands and feet), Dorothy and Billina hide in a room accessed by a glyph key Billina earlier had found. They meet a mechanical man, Tik-Tok, who explains that King Scarecrow has been captured by the Nome King, who is responsible for the Emerald City's destruction. The three visit princess Mombi in hopes of getting more information, but she is working with the Nome King and imprisons them. Dorothy, Billina, and Tik-Tok meet Jack Pumpkinhead, who explains he was brought to life via Mombi's Powder of Life. Dorothy uses the Powder of Life to vivify the Gump, the head of a moose-like animal whose body they put together using two sofas, palm leaves, a broom, and rope. Using the Gump as transport, the group escapes and flies across the Deadly Desert to reach the Nome King's mountain. In his underground domain, the Nome King tells Dorothy that the Scarecrow stole the emeralds from him to build the Emerald City, and should be punished. He does not listen when Dorothy protests that the emeralds preceded the Scarecrow at the city.

Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Return to Oz,\\" the Scarecrow was turned into an ornament by the Nome King. The Nome King accused Scarecrow of stealing emeralds from him to build the Emerald City and punished him by transforming him into an ornament. Dorothy and her friends were given three guesses each to identify which ornament the Scarecrow had become, or else they too would be turned into ornaments. The Gump, Jack Pumpkinhead, and Tik-Tok all failed in their attempts, ultimately being turned into ornaments themselves. The Nome King then gave Dorothy an extra chance to guess correctly but used this as an opportunity to deceive her by making the Scarecrow's ornament form seemingly more challenging to discern. Despite the Nome King's deception, Dorothy successfully identified the Scarecrow's ornament form by recognizing a faint emerald glow as a hint to his presence. Upon correctly guessing the ornament, the Scarecrow was transformed back into his original form, allowing Dorothy, the Scarecrow, and their friends to continue their quest to save the Land of Oz from the Nome King's clutches and restore the Emerald City to its former glory."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. The French have always wanted to know what it means to be a French­man. Their history has been a constant quest for national identity: a conflict between strong regional loyalties and central authority. In about 2000 b.c. Celtic tribes — probably from eastern Europe — came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Bur­gundy. At the same time, migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south. The first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Mar­seilles) around 600 b.c. , followed by other ports at Hyères, Antibes, and Nice. But the Greeks developed few contacts with the interior beyond a little commerce in olives and wine with the Celts of Burgundy. When their position was threatened by Ligurian pirates at sea and warlike tribes from inland, the merchants of Marseilles called on Rome for help. From Gaul to France In 125 b.c. , the Romans came in force, conquered the \\"Gallic barbarians,\\" and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence). They took advantage of this new stronghold to create Provincia (now Provence), stretching from the Alps to the Pyrénées, in order to guarantee communications between Italy and Spain. When this province was endangered by fresh attacks from the north, Julius Caesar himself took charge, conquering practically the whole of Gaul by 50 b.c. Caesar drew Gaul's northeastern frontier at the Rhine, taking in present-day Belgium, and warned that the Ger­man­ic tribes across the river — the Franks (after whom France is named), Alamans, and Saxons — would always threaten the security of the frontier. The Romanization of Gaul sent the most energetic warriors to defend the outposts of the empire while their families settled down to work the land or build towns such as Lyon, Orange, Arles, and Nîmes, and the first great highways between them. At the same time, merchants built up a thriving trade with the rest of the Roman Empire. The pattern for the peasantry and bourgeoisie of France was thus established. Christianity was introduced into Gaul in the first century a.d.  Question: \\"In what year did the Romans travel from Gual to France?\\" Answer: \\"125 BC\\" Is this answer to the question correct?

What is the answer to this question? what is the verse form used in sir gawain called?","output":"The verse form used in \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight” is known as Alliterative Revival. This refers to a method of writing that arrived around the 14th century, which took influence from Old English styles of alliteration. The poem itself is written in stanzas of unequal length- all ending in a short bob and wheel. To explain further, Alliterative Revival is a form of poetry that uses alliteration as the main structural element of a line, along with a particular rhythm. 'Alliteration' refers to the repetition of initial consonant sounds in neighbouring words or stressed syllables, which generates a natural rhythm on the page and in reading aloud. As for the 'bob and wheel', it's a subset of Alliterative Revival, but unique to Middle English alliterative verse and became highly prominent in \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight”. The stanza ends with this compact chunk known as the 'bob and wheel': the bob is simply a very short line, often only two or three syllables, followed by the wheel, which consists of four lines that rhyme together. The rhyme scheme for these lines is typically ABABA. For example, the first stanza ends: \\"But of deeds of arms and derring do In Vance the king greatly stood out.\\" Bob: \\"With a broad banner borne aloft,\\" Wheel: \\"Boldly he played his part, this bear, Killer of men in his cruel rage, Fierce and furious, never flinching.\\" This combination of alliteration and established rhyme scheme helps to build the rhythm and epic quality that the children of the Alliterative Revival, including \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,\\" are known for. Hence, that is an in-depth explanation for the verse-form for \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.\\" Not only does it have a unique structure, but it ties into the tradition of oral storytelling, where alliteration and rhyme helped storytellers to remember their lengthy tales."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Today we are going to learn about helping our doggy and kitty friends become the bestest buddies in the whole wide world! Sometimes cats and dogs may not like each other at first, but don't worry - with some patience and fun steps, we can help them become friends. Are you ready? Let's get started! Step 1: Let the cat (the kitty friend) set the pace. Our kitty friend is usually a bit more shy than our doggy friend. They might feel scared because they don't know the doggy well yet. So, we have to make sure that the cat feels safe and comfy while meeting the dog. Letting the kitty friend take their time to explore and move closer to the dog will make them feel secure. It's like how we make friends, we have to wait and get to know each other before we become best buddies. Step 2: Keep your dog (the doggy friend) on a loose leash. To help our doggy friend stay calm and give them the freedom to move, we'll use a long, loose leash. This will help the doggy feel happy while making sure they don't chase or scare the kitty friend. Remember, we want them to feel safe and be friends! Step 3: Be ready to react if your doggy tries to chase the kitty. Sometimes, our doggy friends get very excited and may want to play with the kitty right away. But they might play too rough! If you see your doggy friend moving too fast or trying to chase the kitty, gently hold the leash and guide the doggy to stop. This way, we can protect our kitty friend and continue with their nice and slow introduction. Step 4: Continue this practice for a few weeks. Becoming friends takes time! Just like how we make new friends at school, our doggy and kitty friends need time to get comfortable with each other. So, we'll keep practicing these steps every day for a few weeks, and they will learn that they can be friends without being scared or rough with each other. Step 5: When you feel absolutely confident, take your dog off the leash. After a few weeks of helping our doggy and kitty friends practice, we'll start to see that they are getting along better! When you're sure they are happy, safe, and calm together, we can let the doggy off the leash. Be sure to watch them carefully to make sure they continue to play gently and don't hurt our kitty friend. Now, you're all set! It's time to use these steps to help your doggy and kitty friends become the bestest buddies ever. And remember, always be kind and patient with them as they learn.

Wear protective clothing.","output":"Title: Defending Your Skin: Comprehensive Steps to Avoid Harmful UV Exposure Introduction: Ultraviolet (UV) radiation, a type of electromagnetic radiation emitted by the sun, poses serious health risks to human beings. Prolonged and unprotected exposure to UV radiation can cause skin cancer, wrinkles, sunburn, eye damage, and suppression of the immune system. With the rapid depletion of the ozone layer, the risk of harmful UV exposure has escalated. While sunlight plays a crucial role in nurturing our health and well-being, it is imperative to take appropriate measures to avoid the negative impacts of UV exposure. This article will discuss how to shield oneself from harmful UV rays by wearing sunscreen, using protective clothing, and adopting other preventive practices. 1. Wear Sunscreen: Sunscreen acts as the primary line of defense against the harmful effects of UV exposure. It is essential to choose a sunscreen with broad-spectrum protection, which shields the skin against both UVA and UVB radiation. UVA rays are known to trigger aging and may contribute to the development of skin cancers, while UVB rays are the primary cause of sunburn. (a) How to choose the right sunscreen: - Opt for a sunscreen with an SPF (Sun Protection Factor) of at least 30, which will block 97% of UVB radiation. - Look for the terms \\"broad-spectrum\\" or \\"UVA/UVB protection\\" on the label to ensure all-around protection from both UVA and UVB rays. - Consider water-resistant sunscreens if engaging in water-based activities or if excessive sweating is anticipated. (b) How to apply sunscreen correctly: - Apply sunscreen 15-30 minutes before stepping out into the sun. - Use generous amounts of sunscreen and cover all exposed areas, including the face, neck, ears, and top of the feet. - Reapply sunscreen every two hours or after swimming, sweating, or towel-drying. - Do not forget to apply lip balm with SPF for additional protection. 2. Wear Protective Clothing: UV-protective clothing is another essential component in the defense against harmful solar radiation. Incorporate the following into your outfits when venturing outdoors: (a) Long-sleeved shirts and pants: Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants to cover maximum skin area, minimizing direct UV exposure. Opt for tightly woven fabrics that prevent UV rays from penetrating the material and reaching the skin. (b) Hats with wide brims: A hat with a 3-inch or larger brim protects your face, neck, and ears from direct exposure. Select a hat made from a tightly woven material that does not allow sunlight to penetrate. (c) UV-protective sunglasses: Invest in UV-protective sunglasses that shield your eyes and the delicate skin surrounding them from UVA and UVB rays. Look for sunglasses that block 99-100% of UV radiation and meet the ANSI (American National Standards Institute) UV protection standards. (d) UPF clothing: UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) clothing is designed to block a significant percentage of the sun's rays. Choose clothing with a UPF rating of 30 or higher, which will block at least 96% of UV radiation. 3. Additional Strategies: (a) Seek shade: Whenever possible, seek shade under trees, umbrellas, or other structures providing a safe refuge from direct sunlight. (b) Avoid peak hours: Limit your sun exposure during peak hours (10 AM – 4 PM), as this is when UV radiation levels are at their highest. (c) Stay vigilant on cloudy days: Cloud cover does not provide complete protection from UV radiation, as about 80% of rays can penetrate through the clouds. Do not drop your guard and continue implementing the above precautions. Conclusion: Minimizing the risks of harmful UV exposure is critical for maintaining overall health, preventing skin damage and reducing the likelihood of skin cancer development. By conscientiously wearing sunscreen, protective clothing, and practicing additional preventive measures, it is possible to enjoy outdoor activities while safeguarding your skin and overall health from the harmful effects of UV radiation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The post seems to express some form of negativity or derision directed towards a person or group, but it does not openly express hate or encourages violence.  However, we are asked to classify the post into two cases: personal or non-personal. \\"Personal\\" usually refers to insults or derogatory remarks made directly against an individual. \\"Non-personal\\" would involve derogatory comments made towards a group or community.

Today, with respect to the increasing growth of demand to get credit from the customers of banks and finance and credit institutions, using an effective and efficient method to decrease the risk of non-repayment of credit given is very necessary. Assessment of customers' credit is one of the most important and the most essential duties of banks and institutions, and if an error occurs in this field, it would leads to the great losses for banks and institutions. Thus, using the predicting computer systems has been significantly progressed in recent decades. The data that are provided to the credit institutions' managers help them to make a straight decision for giving the credit or not-giving it. In this paper, we will assess the customer credit through a combined classification using artificial neural networks, genetics algorithm and Bayesian probabilities simultaneously, and the results obtained from three methods mentioned above would be used to achieve an appropriate and final result. We use the K_folds cross validation test in order to assess the method and finally, we compare the proposed method with the methods such as Clustering-Launched Classification (CLC), Support Vector Machine (SVM) as well as GA+SVM where the genetics algorithm has been used to improve them.

Here are possible answers to this question: - brightness - sunny delight - direct sunlight - bright light - tanning  I believe the correct choice is \\"direct sunlight\\", here's why:","output":"The plant that suffered in the shade likely needed more sunlight than it was receiving. This means the correct place to plant it would be in direct sunlight.  The term 'direct sunlight' refers to areas that receive full, unobstructed sunlight for at least 6 hours a day. This condition is ideal for many types of plants that require a lot of sunlight to perform photosynthesis effectively.  Depending on the type of plant, it's possible that it could have also thrived under 'bright light.' Typically, a spot with bright light is near a south- or southwest-facing window that receives direct sunlight for a part of the day but is not in the sun's path the entire day.  The terms 'brightness,' 'sunny delight,' and 'tanning' are not standard gardening terms used to describe the sun conditions needed for plants. Therefore, they are not suitable answers for this question, making 'direct sunlight' the ideal choice. Keep in mind, though, that different plants have different sunlight and shade requirements. Some may thrive in partial shade or indirect light, while others need a few hours of direct sunlight each day. Always research the individual needs of each plant to ensure it's placed in an ideal location. In conclusion, \\"direct sunlight\\" is the correct term because it refers to the specific condition in gardening where a plant receives unobstructed sunlight for a significant part of the day, which is ultimately what the shaded plant in your question is lacking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both sentences communicate that Tarde was born in Sarlat, which is in the province of Dordogne, and that he studied law in Toulouse and Paris.

The coronation of Charlemagne as emperor on Christmas Day 800 is regarded as a turning point in medieval history, marking a return of the Western Roman Empire, since the new emperor ruled over much of the area previously controlled by the western emperors. It also marks a change in Charlemagne's relationship with the Byzantine Empire, as the assumption of the imperial title by the Carolingians asserted their equivalence to the Byzantine state. There were several differences between the newly established Carolingian Empire and both the older Western Roman Empire and the concurrent Byzantine Empire. The Frankish lands were rural in character, with only a few small cities. Most of the people were peasants settled on small farms. Little trade existed and much of that was with the British Isles and Scandinavia, in contrast to the older Roman Empire with its trading networks centred on the Mediterranean. The empire was administered by an itinerant court that travelled with the emperor, as well as approximately 300 imperial officials called counts, who administered the counties the empire had been divided into.

In Rome the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century, when the word began to mean “principal,” “eminent,” or \\"superior.\\" The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the \\"title\\" churches (the parish churches) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city. By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy. They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy. By decree of a synod of 769, only a cardinal was eligible to become pope. In 1059, during the pontificate of Nicholas II, cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under the Papal Bull In nomine Domini. For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops, but the Third Lateran Council in 1179 gave back the right to the whole body of cardinals.

It had outstanding acting on the parts of Stone, Douglas and all the supporting actors to the tiniest role. It had marvelous photography, music and the noirest noir script ever. All of it adding up to a film that is as good as it will ever get! This sequel is the exact opposite, it cannot possibly get worse, bad acting and a lame script, combined with totally inept direction, this is really bad, boring, annoying. The only thing that somewhat keeps you concentrated is the relatively short wait for the next scene that is an exact re-enacted copy of the original. These copies are so bad they make you laugh and I laughed a lot in spite of myself, because it was like watching the demolishing of a shining monument. The only thing that is good in this horrible mess are the excerpts of the Jerry Goldsmith score of BI1. Michael Caton-Jones and the half-wit responsible for the script even included the \\"There is no smoking in this room\\" dialog in the interrogation scene and yes she sends her attorney (who is now a solicitor) away!  I am sorry I have seen this awful film that should have never been made! It does damage to the original, so bad is it. The only redeeming value is the realization that cosmetic surgery (and I am sure Ms Stone afforded the best surgeon money can buy) can do a good job but can obviously not restore the perfection of the original. And what concerns the human body applies to film-making, too. There should be a law: Don't ever make a sequel to a perfect film!

Article: Women consistently lie on social networking sites such as Facebook or Twitter to make their lives appear more exciting, a survey has found. The survey was asked to carried out by Pencourage, a new anonymous \\"diary-style\\" social media website. Researchers found that at least one in four women exaggerated or twisted what they are doing on social media once a month. The survey of 2000 women found they mostly pretended to be out on the town, when in fact they are home alone, and beautify about an exotic holiday or their job. The most common reasons for women to write _ included worrying their lives would seem \\" boring\\", jealousy at seeing other people's more exciting posts and wanting to impress their friends and acquaintances. Psychologists suggested that as people attempt to stay connected on social media, they can in fact be left more isolated. They also said that the more we try to make our lives seem perfect, the less perfect we feel. According to the OnePoll survey, one third of women surveyed admitted to dishonesty on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter at some stage. Almost one in four admitted to lying or exaggerating about key aspects of their life online between one and three times a month while almost one in 10 said they lied more than once a week. Nearly 30 percent of women lied about \\"doing something when I am home alone\\", almost a quarter overstated their alcohol consumption while one in five were not truthful about their holiday activities or their jobs. Almost one in five women even lied about their \\"relationship status\\". \\"We work very hard presenting ourselves to the world online, pretending and attempting to be happy all the time which is exhausting and ultimately unfulfilling,\\" said Dr Michael Sinclair, a leading British consultant psychologist. \\"Leaving out the less desirable imperfections of our lives from the conversations with our 'friends online leads to less opportunity to feel empathized with, resulting in a greater sense of disconnection from others. \\" Question: According to the passage, women tend to lie on social networking sites because  _  .

He's grown up hearing stories of the gallant Musketeers of the Guard - an elite military unit under the King's command - and dreams of joining their ranks and protecting the king and queen from threats, known and unknown. D'Artagnan hails from a lineage of skilled soldiers, and his father, a former Musketeer, instills in him the values of honor, courage, and allegiance. Trained in the art of combat and filled to the brim with patriotic fervor, he decides to leave his home and heads to the bustling streets of Paris, intending to join this esteemed brotherhood. On arriving in Paris, D'Artagnan soon realizes that the tales he grew up hearing were not entirely accurate. The bustling capital of France is rife with political intrigue, treachery, and deceit. The Musketeers, once the pinnacle of loyalty and valor, are now clouded by uncertainty, with their allegiance swaying between the reckless King Louis XIII and the manipulative Cardinal Richelieu.  Thrust into this world of plots and counterplots, D'Artagnan's idealistic perception of a Musketeer is greatly challenged. However, instead of being disheartened, he becomes determined to restore the glory of the Musketeers.

Article: He has lived through various dangers but time may be running out for the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. On September 11, Israel announced its decision to remove him, following several Palestinian suicide bomb attacks on Israel. \\"He should be punished for the killings,\\" an Israeli official said, \\"He has done nothing to stop the terrorist groups.\\" But the decision has angered many other countries. China said that Arafat is the true leader, elected by the Palestinian people, and removing him would harm the peace in the Middle East. Other governments share this idea. Arafat himself said: \\"They can kill me, but never get me out of my country.\\" He has spent most of his life in danger as the most important aim of Israel. But, just like a cat with nine lives, Arafat escaped every time. For years he has made a practice of sleeping in a different bed each night, thinking a moving person is harder to hit. In 1985, Israel sent fighter planes to kill Arafat. The wild bombing destroyed his office in Tunis but Arafat himself was unhurt. In 1992, the aircraft in which he was flying over North Africa broke in two during a crash landing. The pilot was killed but he managed to remain alive. What is so unbelievable is that he always remains calm in great danger. Israeli tanks and planes attacked his office building in Ram Allah in December 2001. When they saw the attackers coming, Arafat's bodyguards  _ his orders to stay still and carried him to safety underground. Seconds later, several bombs were dropped nearby. Though safe, his bodyguards were so frightened that they were wet in sweat. But, Arafat, with Israeli tanks only 200 meters away, showed no fear at all. He stayed in the damaged office, talking by phone with foreign leaders in hope of preventing further attacks from Israel.  All these experiences have made him a beloved leader to his people and an enemy to some others. But has he used up the last of his nine lives? Only time will tell. Question: What did the author mean by saying \\"just like a cat has nine lives\\" when he talked about Arafat? - Arafat is as clever as a cat. - Arafat can live as long as a cat. - Arafat can stay alive after accidents or disasters as if he has nine lives. - Arafat should have died for at least 8 times.

Article: TOKYO--Lonely astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) may soon be getting a robot friend from Japan. Japan's space agency is considering putting a talking humanoid  robot on the ISS to watch the work while astronauts are asleep, monitor their health and stress levels and communicate to Earth through the microblogging site Twitter. Japan's space agency JAXA announced this week that it is looking at a plan to send a humanoid robot to the space station in 2013 that could communicate with the ground through Twitter--primarily feeding photos, rather than original ideas --and provide astronauts with \\"comfort and companionship\\". Following up on US NASA's \\"Robonaut\\" R2 program, which is set for launch on the Discovery shuttle next week, the Japanese robot would be part of a larger effort to create and refine robots that can be used by the elderly, JAXA said in a statement. Japan is one of the leading countries in robotics and has a rapidly aging society with one of the world's longest life expectancies. Improving robot communication capabilities could help elderly people on Earth by providing a nonintrusive  means of monitoring the robot owner's health and vital signs and sending information to emergency responders if there is an abnormality, JAXA said. \\"We are thinking in terms of a very humanlike robot that would have facial expressions and be able to talk with the astronauts,\\" said JAXA's Satoshi Sano. The robot was being developed with the advertising and communications giant Dentsu Inc and a team at Tokyo University. The NASA project has a humanlike head, hands and arms and uses the same tools as station crew members. The \\"Robonaut\\" called R2 is intended to carry out maintenance tasks in the station's Destiny lab. NASA says it hopes that humanoid robots could one day stand in for astronauts during spacewalks or perform tasks too difficult or dangerous for humans. For now, the 2.5 million NASA robot is limited to activities within the lab. Question: According to the passage, a humanoid robot, put on the ISS, shall carry out the tasks except   _  . - keep in contact with Earth - get a friend for astronauts from Japan - take care of the ISS sometimes - keep an eye on the health of the astronauts Answer:","output":"get a friend for astronauts from Japan"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have the equation: 44*b - 5*b = 8*b - 42*b + 4088 First, let's simplify the equation by combining the \\"b\\" terms on both sides: On the left side, we have 44*b - 5*b. When we subtract 5*b from 44*b, we get 39*b. On the right side, we have 8*b - 42*b. When we subtract 42*b from 8*b, we get -34*b.  Now our equation looks like this: 39*b = -34*b + 4088 Next, let's move all the \\"b\\" terms to one side by adding 34*b to both sides: 39*b + 34*b = 4088 When we add 39*b and 34*b, we get 73*b. Our equation now looks like this: 73*b = 4088 Now, we just need to solve for \\"b\\". To do this, we need to divide both sides by 73: b = 4088 / 73 When we do the division, we find out that b = 56.

But that has yet to be implemented because a power-sharing Stormont executive does not exist to pass it. Victims have called on the parties to quickly agree a compensation process. Campaigner Margaret McGuckin said survivors of abuse are in desperate need of compensation, with many now in poor health. \\"So many of our people are mentally ill; emotionally ill; in care homes; on their death beds,\\" she said. \\"Now they're saying: 'Just give us the money to bury ourselves.'\\" Sir Anthony Hart, the retired judge who led the Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry, has written to political parties to urge a \\"speedy implementation\\" of his proposals. On Thursday, Sinn Féin's Stormont leader Michelle O'Neill set out her plan for setting up a compensation fund. It included a proposal that the parties agree to commit an initial amount of funding from the Northern Ireland budget and seek a \\"significant contribution\\" from the government and religious institutions.

Options are: a). yes b). it is not possible to tell c). no","output":"c). no The statement \\"He waited all day, and his Eufaula Connection never returned his call\\" does not hold true in this situation. According to the given information, the Eufaula Connection did, in fact, return his call half an hour later. The prompt does not mention anything about him waiting all day for the call to be returned. In this scenario, it appears that the individual was able to connect with the Eufaula Connection within a reasonably short amount of time (half an hour). As a result, waiting all day for a call that was never returned is not an accurate description of the events that took place. However, it is essential to remember that without more context, we can't make assumptions about other aspects of their communication. For example, we don't know if the Eufaula Connection provided any helpful information or if they made any agreements during their conversation. Also, we don't know if the individual had any other interactions with the Eufaula Connection later in the day. In conclusion, based on the provided details, the correct answer is c). no, as the Eufaula Connection did return the call half an hour later, and thus the statement \\"He waited all day, and his Eufaula Connection never returned his call\\" is not accurate in this case."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This person is called a \\"crime commissioner.\\" Just like how you might help pick up toys after playing, this person helps make sure the police do a good job.  But something might be wrong. There's a team that watches over the police, just like how parents watch their children. They are called the \\"police watchdog,\\" and they check if everything is fair and right. The police watchdog heard that the newly-elected crime commissioner might have made a mistake with the money they spent during the election.  Money is important in elections because people need to let others know about their ideas and plans. They use money to make signs, travel, and spread the word in newspapers, TV, and even the internet. Just like how we save money to buy something special, it's important to know how much money was spent during an election. The police watchdog wants to know if the new crime commissioner was honest about their election expenses. They check if the numbers match the actual money spent, like when you count how many coins you have in your piggy bank. Being honest is important because it helps people trust the person they chose to protect them from crime.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many more percentage points of people claim to be Protestant than Muslim?","output":"Title: Analyzing the Difference in Percentage Points Between Protestant and Muslim Populations Introduction: Religion has been a core component of human culture and society since the beginnings of recorded history. Two of the major world religions, Protestantism and Islam, have significantly impacted various aspects of society, including politics, economics, and social life. To gain a better understanding of the religious landscape and the distribution of these faiths across the globe, it is crucial to explore and examine the percentages of people who claim to be adherents of these religious beliefs. In this article, we will delve into the differences in percentage points between those who claim to be Protestant and those who claim to be Muslim worldwide. Global Distribution of Religions: According to the Pew Research Center, as of 2020, there are approximately 2.3 billion Christians, 1.9 billion Muslims, 1.2 billion people unaffiliated with any religion, and 1.1 billion Hindus making up the majority of the world's 7.8 billion people. Christianity is the largest religion, with Islam closely following behind as the second-largest religion in the world. Among Christians, there are varying denominations, with Protestantism being one of the most significant branches. Protestantism as a Branch of Christianity: Protestantism emerged during the 16th century as part of the Reformation movement led by Martin Luther and John Calvin. It is a diverse branch of Christianity that encompasses numerous denominations such as Lutheran, Calvinist, Anglican, Baptist, Methodist, and Pentecostal, among others. Estimates suggest that there are about 800 million to 1 billion Protestants worldwide, accounting for roughly 11% to 13% of the global population. Islam as a Major World Religion: Islam was founded in the 7th century by the Prophet Muhammad in what is currently Saudi Arabia. As a religion, Islam emphasizes the belief in one God, Allah, and teaches that Muhammad is his final prophet. Muslims adhere to the teachings of the Quran, their holy book, and observe the Five Pillars of Islam as central tenets of their faith. Islam has two major branches – Sunni and Shia, with Sunni Muslims making up the majority (about 85-90%) of the Muslim population. The overall number of Muslims accounts for nearly 24% to 25% of the global population. Comparing the Number of Protestants and Muslims Worldwide: To determine the difference in percentage points between people claiming to be Protestant and those claiming to be Muslim, we must compare the percentages of each religious population as part of the global population. As previously mentioned, Protestants account for approximately 11% to 13%, while Muslims make up around 24% to 25% of the global population. Calculating the Difference in Percentage Points: Using the estimated percentage points for both religious populations (13% for Protestants and 25% for Muslims), we can calculate the difference in percentage points as follows: Difference = Percentage of Muslims - Percentage of Protestants Difference = 25% - 13% Difference = 12% Conclusion: Based on our analysis, approximately 12 percentage points more people claim to be Muslim than Protestant worldwide. This number indicates the presence of a more significant Muslim population globally and highlights the importance of understanding diverse religious beliefs and practices across various societies. It should be noted, however, that religious demographics can change over time due to various factors like fertility rates, migration, and religious conversions. Therefore, regularly updated data can provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the demographics and distribution of religious populations around the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paradise Towers is the main setting of the 1987 Doctor Who television serial \\"Paradise Towers,\\" which is part of the show's 24th season. It is a story featuring the Seventh Doctor, portrayed by Sylvester McCoy, and his companion Mel, played by Bonnie Langford. The towers were supposed to be a luxurious, self-contained living space that would provide all the necessary amenities and recreational facilities for its residents, but they fell into disrepair and became a dystopian environment. Kroagnon was an architect who designed various impressive structures, including Paradise Towers, known for his extraordinary yet deadly creations. Each of these buildings had a fatal flaw that led to the deaths and suffering of their inhabitants. Consequently, the inhabitants of the towers rebelled against his designs and imprisoned him inside a sealed tank in the basement of Paradise Towers. Kroagnon's disembodied intelligence remained hidden there for centuries. The story unfolds when the Doctor and Mel arrive at the towers and discover the chaos within. The inhabitants have formed different gangs, including the cannibalistic Rezzies, anarchic Kangs, and authoritarian Caretakers. The Doctor and Mel work to restore peace within the towers and defeat Kroagnon, who attempts to regain control of his creation by transferring his mind into the body of the Chief Caretaker, played by Richard Briers. Ultimately, the Doctor and Mel, along with newfound friends Pex and companions from the various gangs, manage to foil Kroagnon's plans and restore some semblance of order to Paradise Towers. This particular villain highlights the dangers of unchecked ambition, as well as a disregard for the welfare of others in the pursuit of architectural excellence.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. tracy resigned their position because they were threatened by others to have a scandal revealed.  Given the question \\"What will Others want to do next?\\", is \\"believe the threat\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"Under the circumstances presented, the question \\"What will others want to do next?\\" requires a thorough analysis of the context, the people involved, and possible motivations behind their actions. The answer \\"believe the threat\\" can be seen as a valid response, but it does not provide an in-depth perspective on the situation.  Upon hearing that Tracy resigned from their position because of a threat to reveal a scandal, we must consider several factors and perspectives to understand what the people (\\"others\\") involved may want to do next.  1. The Person Threatening Tracy: The individual who threatened Tracy could potentially carry out their threat by revealing the scandal. Their motivations may include revenge, jealousy, or personal gain. On the other hand, this person may choose not to disclose the scandal, given that Tracy has complied with their demands. 2. Tracy's Colleagues: Tracy's coworkers may react to this news in various ways. Some may believe the threat, while others may question its validity or even offer support to Tracy. They may also want to conduct their own investigation into the perceived scandal, determine if and how it affects their work, or distance themselves from the situation. 3. Tracy's Friends and Family: People close to Tracy could be concerned about their well-being and may seek to offer emotional support or practical assistance. They may also wish to help Tracy fight the accusations if they believe they are unfounded or to encourage Tracy to come clean about the scandal if they believe there is truth to it. 4. Tracy's Superiors and the Organization: Depending on whether the organization believes the threat, they may undertake an internal investigation, consult with legal or human resources departments, or even reach out to Tracy for clarification. They may seek to preserve the organization's image by distancing themselves from Tracy or by attempting to minimize the impact of the scandal. 5. The Public: If the information about the threat becomes public knowledge, there may be various responses from the general public. Some may believe the threat, while others may not. They may become more curious about the scandal, request further information from both Tracy and the organization, and potentially take sides. In conclusion, \\"believe the threat\\" can be a valid answer to \\"What will others want to do next?\\" However, it only represents one facet of a complex situation encompassing the perspectives of several parties. It is essential to analyze all the stakeholders' potential actions and motivations to provide a more comprehensive understanding of what others may want to do following Tracy's resignation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Rebels in eastern Ukraine said the men were policemen from Ukraine's Luhansk region. Vitaliy Naida, Ukraine's security chief, told BBC World News he was \\"absolutely positive\\" the men were officers from the GRU, the foreign military intelligence branch of Russia's army. \\"We have battle dress uniform, we have automatic rifles that are produced only in the Russian Federation only for Special Forces' use,\\" he said. Mr Naida said the men were part of a group of 220 GRU officers deployed to Luhansk on 2 May. The others have now returned to Russia, he said. \\"We have already started a criminal case for a terrorist act,\\" Mr Naida said. In a video, one of the captured men said he was a sergeant from the central Russian city of Togliatti, where an elite intelligence unit for the Russian army is based. The video has not been independently verified. Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for Russia's ministry of defence, said the two men were not serving soldiers at the time they were detained. Mr Konashenkov said the two men had been mistreated by Ukrainian special forces who had \\"beat convenient testimony out of them\\". \\"We are counting on the Ukrainian leadership to show good sense,\\" he said, adding that he hoped the two men would be \\"released as soon as possible\\". The Ukrainian government, Western leaders and Nato say there is clear evidence that Russia is helping the rebels with heavy weapons and soldiers. Independent experts echo that accusation. Moscow denies the claims, but says that a number of Russian nationals are fighting with the separatists in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions as volunteers. Pavlo Klimkin, Ukraine's foreign minister, told reporters that Russian officers had tried to kill the two men as soon as they were detained. Mr Klimkin declined to give more details.

Me and Orson Welles is a 2008 British-American period drama film directed by Richard Linklater and starring Zac Efron, Christian McKay, and Claire Danes. Based on Robert Kaplow's novel of the same name, the story, set in 1937 New York, tells of a teenager hired to perform in Orson Welles's groundbreaking stage adaptation of William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. He becomes attracted to a career-driven production assistant. The film was shot in London and New York and on the Isle of Man in February, March and April 2008, and was released in the United States on November 25, 2009, and the United Kingdom on December 4, 2009. Holly Gent Palmo and Vincent Palmo Jr. adapted the film's screenplay from Robert Kaplow's novel of the same name about a teenager (in reality, the 15-year-old Arthur Anderson, who played Lucius in Welles' production) involved in the founding of Orson Welles' Mercury Theatre. After receiving funding from CinemaNX, a production company backed by the Isle of Man film fund, and an offer from Framestore Features to co-finance the film, Richard Linklater came on board to direct Me and Orson Welles. Zac Efron signed on as the lead in early January 2008, claiming he decided to take the role of Richard Samuels because \\"It's a completely different project than I've ever done before,\\" while Claire Danes joined the cast as the protagonist's love interest Sonja Jones in late January.  In the theatre, Christian McKay had portrayed Orson Welles in the one-man play Rosebud: The Lives of Orson Welles at a number of venues, including the Edinburgh Festival and King's Head (London). He reprised the role in the U.S. at the 2007 \\"Brits Off Broadway\\" festival, where Linklater saw his performance and then cast McKay as Welles, retaining him over the subsequent objections of the project's producer.  Me and Orson Welles underwent filming in the Isle of Man, Pinewood Studios, London and New York from February to April 2008. Filming in London commenced first in mid-February, before scenes in the Isle of Man were shot February 24-March 14, 2008, where filming locations included Gaiety Theatre and various other parts of Douglas. During filming in Douglas, Efron and Danes believe they sighted a ghost, or \\"supernatural\\" being, outside a window on set at Gaiety Theatre.  Filming in Britain resumed in late March for six weeks at Pinewood Studios. Other locations included Crystal Palace Park, where a facade of New York's Mercury Theatre was set up for a scene. Actor James Tupper claimed that the best replica of an old New York theater was in England, while many of the actors who filled the company were from the Royal Shakespeare Company. The production crew only briefly visited New York; photographs were taken and footage shot to be added into the film as digital effects.

What is the name of the person whose popularity declined markedly in the US after her marriage?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; this caused her popularity in the US to decline markedly. Conservatives came to regard her as a militant and an extremist, an image which alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite her efforts to portray her marriage as apolitical. White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government took an interest in her activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her under surveillance. While she and her husband were travelling in the Bahamas, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Touré. Makeba did not return to the US until 1987.Guinea remained Makeba's home for the next 15 years, and she and her husband became close to President Ahmed Sékou Touré and his wife, Andrée. Touré wanted to create a new style of African music, and all musicians received a minimum wage if they practised for several hours every day. Makeba later stated that \\"I've never seen a country that did what Sékou Touré did for artists.\\" After her rejection from the US she began to write music more directly critical of the US government's racial policies, recording and singing songs such as \\"Lumumba\\" in 1970, (referring to Patrice Lumumba, the assassinated Prime Minister of the Congo), and \\"Malcolm X\\" in 1974.","output":"The name of the person whose popularity declined markedly in the US after her marriage is Makeba.

Question: Question: Who did Oskar confide in? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close Context: Nine-year-old Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn), who suffers from Asperger syndrome, is the son of German American Thomas Schell (Tom Hanks).[5] Thomas would often send Oskar on missions to do something involving one of his riddles. The last riddle he ever gives Oskar is proof that New York City once possessed a Sixth Borough. In a flashback, Thomas and Oskar play a scavenger hunt to find objects throughout New York City. The game requires communication with other people and is not easy for the socially awkward Oskar who is told \\"If things were easy to find, they wouldn't be worth finding\\". On September 11, 2001, Oskar and his classmates are sent home from school early while his mother Linda (Sandra Bullock) is at work. When Oskar gets home, he finds five messages from his father on the answering machine saying he is in the World Trade Center. When Thomas calls for the sixth time, although Oskar is present to answer this call, he is too scared to answer. The machine records a sixth message which stops when the building collapses. Oskar knows his father has been killed and falls to the floor. He replaces the answering machine with a new one and hides the old one so his mother will never find out. A few weeks after what Oskar calls \\"the worst day,\\" he confides in his German grandmother and they become closer. Oskar's relationship with his mother worsens since she cannot explain why the World Trade Center was attacked and why his father died. Oskar tells his mother he wishes it had been her in the building, not his father, and she responds, \\"So do I\\". After, Oskar says he did not mean it, but his mother doesn't believe him. A year later, Oskar finds a vase in his father's closet with a key in an envelope with the word \\"Black\\" on it. He vows to find what the key fits.

Here is an article: Police officers stopped people on New York City’s streets more than 200,000 times during the first three months of 2012, putting the Bloomberg administration on course to shatter a record set last year for the highest annual tally of street stops. Data on the 203,500 street stops from January through March — up from 183,326 during the same quarter a year earlier — was sent to the City Council from 1 Police Plaza late on Friday under a legal requirement spawned by public outrage over the 1999 fatal police shooting in the Bronx of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed black street peddler. On Saturday, the department disclosed the information to reporters and credited the controversial topic known as “Stop, Question, Frisk” as one of several policies of engagement whose effectiveness was vindicated by a decline in homicides in New York. So far this year, 129 people have been murdered in New York through Friday, the 132nd day of the year, a number that put the city on track for a new low in annual homicides. The 471 murders logged by the Police Department in 2009 was the lowest annual tally for any previous 12-month period since reliable numbers were kept in the early 1960s. Still, the new street-stop numbers got a fresh round of criticism after a week that saw civil libertarians and prospective mayoral candidates debating the crime-suppression value of such stops and blaming the tactics for tearing at the fabric of city life, particularly in minority neighborhoods, during a period of historically low violence. On Wednesday, the New York Civil Liberties Union issued a study of last year’s stop data, arguing that far too many innocent people were suffering under the policy. The study said that while young black and Hispanic men made up 4.7 percent of the city’s population, those between the ages of 14 and 24 accounted for 41.6 percent of stops in 2011. On Saturday, the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, said the “dramatic increase” in stops underscored her calls for reform. “While the N.Y.P.D. should continue to have the ability to stop and frisk people where there is a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, I remain convinced that with better monitoring, supervision and accountability we can avoid the corrosive impact of a poorly targeted program,” Ms. Quinn said in a statement. “We cannot continue to stop, question and frisk nearly 700,000 New Yorkers in this way without doing harm to the relationship between police officers and the people they are protecting, particularly in communities of color.” And the city’s public advocate, Bill de Blasio, said that while the rise in stops seemed a product of a numbers-driven police culture, he proposed more routine use of the department’s own auditing of those statistics to track the outcomes for each stop-and-frisk episode, like whether someone is then arrested. “The record number of unwarranted stops is widening the rift between police and the communities whose cooperation we need to fight crime,” Mr. de Blasio said in a statement. “Make no mistake — this is the result of City Hall aggressively pushing precinct commanders to use stop and frisk beyond what is necessary and effective. It’s time to bring these numbers back to earth.” Both Ms. Quinn and Mr. de Blasio are expected to run for mayor. Peppered with questions at a news conference on Friday, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said that critics of the street-stop tactics “never have an answer” about how to tackle the disproportionate levels of crime in certain city neighborhoods. The department, by contrast, is always looking for answers to “slow down” crime. “I would submit that our strategies are saving lives,” Mr. Kelly said. He added: “You look at the numbers in this city; you look at the lives that we’re saving, and I would submit to you that the majority of those lives are minorities, and most of them are young men who are being killed for senseless reasons. We are saving those lives, and, quite frankly, we’re saving them at a much greater degree and extent than other cities are.” Last year, there were 685,724 stop-and-frisk encounters, the highest total in the 10 years the department has reported the data. The annual total has gradually increased, from a low of 97,296 in 2002, according to departmental statistics.

Since 1971, which US Federal holiday has held been on the second Monday in October?","output":"Since 1971, the United States federal holiday celebrated on the second Monday of October each year is Columbus Day. This holiday commemorates the arrival of Italian explorer Christopher Columbus to the Americas on October 12, 1492. It is a nationally recognized holiday, and various establishments such as schools, banks, and government offices are typically closed on this day. Columbus Day was initially celebrated on October 12, but it was later moved to the second Monday in October after the passage of the Uniform Monday Holiday Act in 1968. This federal law aimed to provide more three-day weekends for the American workforce by shifting the celebration of specific holidays to Mondays. The act took effect in 1971, and since then, Columbus Day has been celebrated on the second Monday of October. While Columbus Day is observed throughout the United States, the significance and celebration of the day have evolved over the years. Various states and cities have officially replaced Columbus Day with alternative holidays such as Indigenous Peoples' Day or Native American Day, which honor the contributions and history of the Native American populations who were impacted by the arrival of European explorers and settlers. These changes reflect the growing awareness of and sensitivity toward the controversial nature of Columbus's legacy and the adverse effects of European colonization on indigenous cultures in the Americas."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information:  - Philadelphia is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the fifth-most populous city in the United States, with an estimated population of 1,567,442 and more than 6 million in the seventh-largest metropolitan statistical area, .

With each stroke, he nurses the grass to reveal its lush green undertones, previously hidden beneath the autumnal palette. He maneuvers the blower with the grace of an artist and the precision of a surgeon, ensuring that each area of his yard is carefully and meticulously attended to. The man, now fully absorbed in his task, becomes one with the blower, maintaining a rhythm that showcases his experience and dedication to the art of landscaping. As the sun climbs higher, casting brilliant lights and shadows throughout the yard, the man pauses momentarily to assess his progress. The once disorganized heap of leaves has now transformed into an impressively arranged mosaic that flutters and rustles in the soft breeze. Alongside the peaceful melody of the wind blowing through the trees, one could almost hear the leaves whisper their appreciation to the artist who so skillfully orchestrated their final performance. Feeling satisfied, the man proceeds to his next task - the gathering and disposal of the vibrant foliage. With a rake and tarp now in hand, he gently ushers the leaves onto the tarp, taking care not to disturb the intricate arrangement that has formed. As he completes this task, the man takes a moment to reflect upon the transient beauty of the season, understanding that change is a necessary and intrinsic part of life's continuous cycle. Finally, as the man wraps up his work, he pats the push leaf blower affectionately, grateful for its unwavering assistance in this yearly ritual. Pausing to survey his artfully manicured yard one last time, the man catches a glimpse of a lone, golden leaf soaring through the air on an unseen breeze.

Please tell me if those questions are the same. Pick from: A. no. B. yes.","output":"A. no. While both questions involve communication through messaging platforms, they are different in terms of the platforms they are referring to and the core concern of the question. The first question pertains to Google and the storing and access of custom status messages on Google Talk (GTalk). On the other hand, the second question addresses the visibility of messages sent through Facebook and iMessage for non-friends. To elaborate further on both questions: 1. Google Talk, popularly known as GTalk, was an instant messaging service provided by Google. It was discontinued and replaced by Google Hangouts in 2013. Google Talk did allow users to set custom status messages, but it is ambiguous as to whether Google stored these messages and could be accessed even after being cleared locally. Since Google's privacy policy indicates that they may store certain data, it's possible that custom status messages could have been stored, but accessing those messages after clearing them locally might not be feasible. It would likely depend on your email service provider's data storage and retention policies. 2. Facebook and iMessage are two different messaging platforms developed by two different companies – Facebook and Apple, respectively. Sending a message to a person through Facebook and iMessage requires using their respective apps and services. If you send a message to someone using Facebook Messenger and you are not friends, the message will go to their Other/Message Request folder, and your recipient may or may not see it depending on their settings or if they check that folder. However, the recipient's ability to read that message has no connection with iMessage, as it operates on a completely separate platform. In conclusion, the two questions are not the same. They address two distinct concerns and involve separate messaging platforms and issues (Google and the storage of custom statuses on GTalk vs. Facebook and the readability of messages sent through Facebook and iMessage to non-friends)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Six weeks after arriving in the United States, Hassan Abduraheem takes a seat in the back pew of Tar Wallet Baptist Church. Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly.  Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light.

Q: Problem: a reduction of 10 % in the price of salt enables a lady to obtain 20 kgs more for rs . 400 , find the original price per kg ?  Options: a ) 2.0 , b ) 2.8 , c ) 2.2 , d ) 2.5 , e ) 3.0 A:","output":"To solve this problem, we will first set up an equation based on the given information and then solve for the original price per kg. Note that the original quantity of salt is not given, but we can use a variable to represent this value. Let x denote the original price per kg of the salt and y denote the original quantity of salt (in kgs) purchased by the lady for Rs. 400. The equation can be set up as follows: Original cost = Reduced cost x * y = (0.9 * x) * (y + 20) Here, 0.9 * x is the reduced price per kg (90% of the original price), and y + 20 is the increased quantity of salt purchased due to the 10 % reduction in price. Now, let's simplify the equation: x * y = (0.9 * x) * (y + 20) x * y = 0.9 * x * y + 0.9 * x * 20 x * y - 0.9 * x * y = 0.9 * x * 20 (1 - 0.9) * x * y = 0.9 * x * 20 0.1 * x * y = 18 * x As long as x is not zero, we can divide both sides by 0.1 * x: y = 18 * 10 y = 180 Now, to find the original price per kg (x), we use the original cost equation: x * y = 400 x * 180 = 400 x = 400 / 180 x = 20 / 9 x = 2.222 (rounded to 3 decimal places) From the given options, the closest value for x is 2.2, which corresponds to option c.

Question: \\"How did religion affect the ruler of the country?\\"  Context: \\"Towards the end of the Republic, religious and political offices became more closely intertwined; the office of pontifex maximus became a de facto consular prerogative. Augustus was personally vested with an extraordinary breadth of political, military and priestly powers; at first temporarily, then for his lifetime. He acquired or was granted an unprecedented number of Rome's major priesthoods, including that of pontifex maximus; as he invented none, he could claim them as traditional honours. His reforms were represented as adaptive, restorative and regulatory, rather than innovative; most notably his elevation (and membership) of the ancient Arvales, his timely promotion of the plebeian Compitalia shortly before his election and his patronage of the Vestals as a visible restoration of Roman morality. Augustus obtained the pax deorum, maintained it for the rest of his reign and adopted a successor to ensure its continuation. This remained a primary religious and social duty of emperors.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Religion significantly affected the ruler of the country, particularly towards the end of the Roman Republic, as it became more closely intertwined with political offices. This connection can be seen through the role of the pontifex maximus, which became largely associated with the highest political figures, like consuls. Augustus, the first Roman emperor, was vested with a vast range of political, military, and priestly powers. He acquired numerous major priesthoods in Rome, including that of pontifex maximus, which allowed him to showcase these roles as traditional honors. His religious power and influence were utilized to implement several reforms, which he presented as adaptive, restorative, and regulatory rather than innovative. Some notable examples of these reforms include the elevation of the ancient Arvales, the promotion of plebeian Compitalia, and the patronage of the Vestal Virgins as a means of restoring Roman morality. Augustus's religious authority enabled him to establish and maintain the pax deorum, or the peace of the gods, throughout his reign. He also took the responsibility of adopting a successor to ensure the continuation of this religious and social stability. In conclusion, religion played a substantial role in influencing and shaping the rule of the Roman Empire, particularly in the context of the ruler's duties and responsibilities. This influence can be seen through the religious reforms and practices implemented by Augustus, which not only solidified his power but also demonstrated the importance of religion in maintaining social order and stability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You need to add your softened room temperature butter to a large bowl, and add your powdered sugar. Then, you want to use a hand mixer or stand mixer to cream the two ingredients together....I think the answer is","output":"1. You need to add your softened room temperature butter to a large bowl, and add your sugar. Then, you want to use a hand mixer or stand mixer to cream the two ingredients together. The correct method for creaming butter and sugar when making chocolate bread is the first option. This is because the process involves beating together softened room temperature butter with granulated sugar (not powdered sugar) until the mixture becomes light, fluffy, and pale in color. This method helps to create a smooth consistency and incorporates air into the batter, resulting in a lighter texture for the finished bread. Option 2 is incorrect because it suggests using powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar. Powdered sugar, also known as confectioner's sugar or icing sugar, has a finer texture and is not typically used for creaming in baking recipes. It is more commonly used for icing, glazes, and other confectionery purposes. Using powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar in a creaming method may result in a denser, less airy texture in the final product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Scroll down for video. The group has largely focused on Iraq and is currently fighting for control of Kobane in Syria but there are fears they are spreading into North Africa. The head of US Africa Command told reporters at the Pentagon: 'They put training camps out there', referring to ISIS who have seized territory in Iraq and neighboring Syria this year in a brutal and swift offensive of beheadings and forced religious conversions. 'ISIS has begun its efforts over in the east out there to introduce some people over there. 'But we'll have to just continue to monitor and watch that carefully in the future to see what happens or whether it grows on unabated.' He described the IS activity in eastern Libya as 'very small' but added that there were 'around a couple hundred' militants present at the camps, with US forces continuing to track the area. The United States has been waging an air war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, but when asked if the training camps in Libya were a potential target for American forces, Mr Rodriguez replied: 'No, not right now.' The four-star general said it appeared the ISIS militants in Libya were not volunteers coming from outside the country but militia members who had shifted their loyalty to the jihadist group. His comments came after the US government and European allies voiced 'grave concern' over mounting violence and civil unrest in Libya. ISIS has already seized huge swathes of land in Iraq and Syria, including the town of Raqqa, pictured. Experts have warned that ISIS has gained a foothold in the eastern town of Derna, exploiting the chaos that has engulfed the North African state. Libya has been plagued by instability since the overthrow of autocratic leader Moamer Kadhafi in 2011, and ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi recently boasted of vows of allegiance from militants in the country.

ISIS, which aims to establish an Islamic caliphate across the region, is the prime target of the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria.

By Larisa Brown, Defence Reporter for The Daily Mail. More British troops will be sent to help the Iraqi security forces as part of a large-scale mission to defeat Islamic State jihadists. Military trainers will teach the Iraqi army how to counter deadly roadside bombs as the British Army steps up its role in the country, leading to claims of ‘mission creep’. They will join four large American training bases that will be established within weeks to train and advise the Iraqi army on a wider scale. Details are yet to be finalised but an announcement is expected in the coming days. Lieutenant General Gordon Messenger told the Defence Select Committee yesterday: ‘The training and support that we are providing has been requested by both the Kurds and central Iraqi Government. 'The Americans will see the establishment of four big training bases - one of which will be in Erbil. 'As part of that we see ourselves delivering niche specialist training in the area which is much needed, particular in IEDs. 'We are still scoping the exact nature of that but we hope to have some concrete proposals in the coming days.' He added: 'We are sending the reconnaissance forces out there to ensure that at the time when are training is needed we will be able to deliver it.’ In terms of numbers, they were still looking at both ‘light’ and ‘heavy’ options, he said. Islamist jihadists have started laying IEDs to take out Iraqi forces as part of a change in tactics after UK airstrikes blasted their vehicles and killed their fighters. British soldiers – who have learnt how to detect the deadly bombs after fighting against the Taliban in Afghanistan – have been asked to help by the Iraqi government due to their specialist knowledge. The deputy chief of defence staff said British forces were also looking at other training possibilities as part of the UK’s contribution to a ‘large scale venture’ in training anti- Islamic State forces. He added: 'I think importantly it is demand led… we are delivering the type of training that these forces have asked for and need.’ Hundreds of British forces will also be sent to join American troops in training thousands of Syrian moderates outside the country. Defence sources said both Saudi Arabia and Jordan could host the training grounds but details are yet to be finalised. Peter Watkins, Director General of Security Policy, denied the further deployment of UK forces to ‘advise and train’ Iraqi security forces was ‘mission creep’. He told MPs: ‘Whatever we do has to be guided by the objectives we set out at the first place. 'I think if we remain guided by the objectives we can avoid mission creep.’ Lt Gen Messenger said air strikes had helped demoralise Islamic State –but had forced the extremist fighters to change tactics. He said: ‘The effect on the morale of both those organisations has been significantly enhanced by those air strikes.’ There had been an ‘equivalent reduction’ in the morale of IS, who were now using guerrilla tactics such as improvised explosive devices (IEDs). ‘They were much more out in the open and even held military parades in certain areas’ Lt Gen Messenger said. ‘That has stopped. They are resorting to more asymmetric tactics, including the use of IEDs. They are using quite extensive countermeasures to avoid them being struck, moving at night, using the weather, avoiding grouping in big areas.’ Write highlights for this article.","output":"The Islamic State has set up terror training camps in Libya, as more than one hundred militants have gathered in the country.

It is the opposite of a diminutive.  - Random House is the largest general-interest paperback publisher in the world.  As of 2013, it is part of Penguin Random House, which is jointly owned by German media conglomerate Bertelsmann and British global education and publishing company Pearson PLC.  - A diminutive is a word which has been modified to convey a slighter degree of its root meaning, to convey the smallness of the object or quality named, or to convey a sense of intimacy or endearment. A (abbreviated ) is a word-formation device used to express such meanings; in many languages, such forms can be translated as \\"little\\" and diminutives can also be formed as multi-word constructions such as \\"Tiny Tim\\". Diminutives are used frequently when speaking to small children or when expressing extreme tenderness and intimacy to an adult. As such, they are often employed for nicknames and pet names. The opposite of the diminutive form is the augmentative.  - The Penguin Group is a trade book publisher, part of Penguin Random House. It is owned by Pearson PLC, the global education and publishing company, and Bertelsmann, the German media conglomerate. The new company was created by a merger that was finalized on 1 July 2013, with Bertelsmann owning 53% of the joint venture, and Pearson controlling the remaining 47%.  - Pearson PLC is a British multinational publishing and education company headquartered in London. It was founded as a construction business in the 1840s. It shut down its construction activities in the 1920s and switched to publishing. It is the largest education company and the largest book publisher in the world. Pearson has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange in the form of American Depository Receipts. History. Construction business: 1844 to the 1920s. The company was founded by Samuel Pearson in 1844 as a building and engineering concern operating in Yorkshire under the name \\"S. Pearson & Son\\". In 1880, control passed to his grandson Weetman Dickinson Pearson, an engineer, who in 1890 moved the business to London and turned it into one of the world's largest construction companies. Another of its prominent engineers was Ernest William Moir who, after working for Pearson on tunnels in New York City, became the contractor's agent on construction of the Blackwall Tunnel under the River Thames in London between 1892 and 1897. The company also built the Admiralty Harbour at Dover, the Halifax Dry Dock in Canada, the East River Railway Tunnels in New York City, the Mexican Grand Canal that drained Mexico City, the Tehuantepec Railway in Mexico, and railways and harbours around the world. In November 1915, the firm began construction of HM Factory, Gretna, the largest cordite factory in the UK during World War I.  - A joint venture (JV) is a business entity created by two or more parties, generally characterized by shared ownership, shared returns and risks, and shared governance. Most joint ventures are incorporated, although some, as in the oil and gas industry, are \\"unincorporated\\" joint ventures that mimic a corporate entity. Key elements of a joint venture's design include: 1) the number of parties; 2) the geographic, product, technology and value-chain scope within which the JV will operate; 3) the contributions of the parties; 4) the structural form (each country has specific options, e.g. in the U.S. the main options are a C Corporation or an LLC/partnership structure); 5) the valuation of initial contributions and ownership split among the parties; 6) the economic arrangements, post-deal (e.g. Is the joint venture intended to general profits vs. operate as a cost-sharing or production-sharing venture; if a for-profit entity, will the parties share profits in proportion to equity ownership, or some other way?); 7) governance and control; 8) Talent/HR model (will the Jv have its own staff on own payroll vs. second staff from the parent companies; 9) contractual arrangements with the parent companies for inputs, outputs or services; 10) exit and evolution provisions?  - Bertelsmann is a German multinational corporation based in Gütersloh, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

This contrasts deeply with a morpheme, which is the smallest unit of meaning but will not necessarily stand on its own. A word may consist of a single morpheme (for example: \\"oh!, rock, red, quick, run, expect\\"), or several (\\"rocks, redness, quickly, running, unexpected\\"), whereas a morpheme may not be able to stand on its own as a word (in the words just mentioned, these are \\"-s, -ness, -ly, -ing, un-, -ed\\"). A complex word will typically include a root and one or more affixes (\\"rock-s, red-ness, quick-ly, run-ning, un-expect-ed\\"), or more than one root in a compound (\\"black-board, rat-race\\"). Words can be put together to build larger elements of language, such as phrases (\\"a red rock\\"), clauses (\\"I threw a rock\\"), and sentences (\\"He threw a rock too, but he missed\\").  - Hamish Hamilton Limited was a British book publishing house , founded in 1931 eponymously by the half - Scot half - American Jamie Hamilton ( Hamish is the vocative form of the Gaelic ' Seamus ' ( meaning James ) , James the English form -- which was also his given name , and Jamie the diminutive form ) .

Veteran Labour MP Austin Mitchell was elected MP for Great Grimsby in 1977 but will step down at the next election. A veteran Labour MP has claimed the 'problem' with female politicians is that they care too much about issues which are relevant to ordinary people. Austin Mitchell, the Labour MP for Grimsby, said the increasing number of women in the Commons would be 'less inclined to discuss the big issues'. His remarks, on the BBC's Woman's Hour this morning, sparked fury and calls for the Labour leader Ed Miliband to make it clear he disagrees. It comes after Mr Mitchell this weekend claimed that the growing number of female MPs in the Labour party was making it too ‘gentle’ to wield power after the next election. Mr Mitchell, 79, said he was worried about the falling number of experienced men in the party because the party will be full of ‘amenable and leadable’ women obsessed with feminism. The Labour MP, who is stepping down at the next election, said Labour was becoming more ‘family-friendly, gentler’ but ‘less prepared for all-night shenanigans of the parliamentary kind’. Speaking today, Mr Mitchell attempted to explain his remarks. He said: 'I think the problem is simply this, that parliament with more women is going to be more anxious to discuss issues relevant to the people, that is to say family issues, social issues. 'And less inclined to discuss big issues like should we invade Iraq.' But Tory Defence Minister Anna Soubry dismissed the remarks. She said: 'Austin Mitchell’s at it again, talking nonsense and insulting women with his absurd theories. To say that women don’t care about the big issues is just not true. 'Ed Miliband should make it absolutely clear he doesn’t agree with Mitchell’s ridiculous remarks.' Mr Mitchell said the parliamentary Labour party was undergoing ‘the biggest process of feminisation and rejuvenation embarked on since fabulous pink Camay soap promised to make us look a little lovelier each day’. But he added: ‘Whatever the state of Labour’s policies for the next Election, there is little doubt that it will be fought by a younger, more attractive body of candidates. Almost half of Labour's cabinet are women and Ed Miliband is understood to want to hit 50 per cent by the next election - up from 44 per cent today. Labour's leading women, pictured here, from left back row: Caroline Flint, Angela Eagle, Maria Eagle, Rosie Winterton, Emily Thornberry, Margaret Curran, Baronness Royall. Front row: Rachel Reeves, Liz Kendal, Harriet Harman, Yvette Cooper, Mary Creagh and Tessa Jowell. Labour introduced all women shortlists in 1993 and has since seen a surge in the number of female MPs - 81 out of 257. But Mr Mitchell said all-women shortlists were being imposed on regions such as Yorkshire and the North as a form of punishment ‘for their earlier male chauvinism’. He said: ‘If Labour wins in 2015, how a family-friendly, gentler party, less prepared for all-night shenanigans of the parliamentary kind, will face up to Tory hooligans who feel they’ve been unjustly deprived of a power that’s their due, is a more worrying matter.’ Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

Q:Article: At dawn on Friday, May 19, 1780, farmers in New England stopped to wonder at the pink color of the sun. By noon the sky had darkened to midnight blackness, causing Americans, still in the painful struggle of a prolonged war of independence, to light candles and tremble at thoughts of the Last Judgment. As the birds quieted and no storm accompanied the darkness, men and women crowded into churches, where one minister commented that \\"The people were very attentive.\\" John Greenleaf Whittier later wrote that \\"Men prayed, and women wept; all ears grew sharp . . .\\" A recent study of researchers, led by Richard Guyette from the University of Missouri's Tree Ring Laboratory, has shown that vast forest fires in the Algonquin Highlands of southern Ontario and elsewhere in Canada brought this event upon New England. The scientists have discovered \\"fire scars\\" on the rings for that year, left when the heat of a wildfire has killed a part of a tree's cambium  . Evidence collected also points to a drought that year. An easterly wind and low barometric pressure   helped force smoke into the upper atmosphere. \\"The record fits pretty close,\\" says Guyette. \\"We had the right fuel, the drought. The conditions were all there.\\" Lacking the ability to communicate quickly over long distances, Americans in 1780 remained in the dark about the event, which had disappeared by the next day. Over the next several months, the papers carried heated debates about what brought the darkness. Some were the voices of angry prediction, such as one Massachusetts farmer who wrote, \\"Oh! Backsliding New-England, attend now to the things which belong to your peace before they are forever hid from your eyes.\\" Others gave different answers. One stated that a \\"flaming star\\" had passed between the earth and the sun. Ash, argued another commentator. The debate, carried on throughout New England, where there were no scientific journals or academies yet, reflected an unfolding culture of scientific enquiry already sweeping the Western world, a revolution...

If you are a woman and marry an Emirati citizen, you will not automatically become an Emirati citizen.  As a woman, you can get Emirati citizenship as a dependent of your husband, if your husband is an Emirati citizen. Women in the UAE are considered dependents either of their husbands or their fathers, regardless of whether they work or live independently. Women cannot pass on their Emirati citizenship. If you are a man and marry an Emirati woman, you will never be able to get Emirati citizenship as a result of being married to her, no matter how long the marriage lasts. Once you marry an Emirati citizen, you will generally have the right to reside in the UAE with your spouse. However, you will not have the benefits of being a citizen.  When you get married, go to the General Directorate of Residence and Foreign Affairs (GDRFA). Bring your marriage certificate and identification. Tell them that you want to become a national, and they will give you forms to complete. If you are a man and marry an Emirati woman, any children your wife gives birth to will not be Emirati citizens. They will have to wait until they are 18 to apply for citizenship, and in the meantime you will have to pay for education and healthcare for the child that Emirati citizens get for free. If you marry an Emirati citizen, you will not become eligible for Emirati citizenship until you have been married for 3 years from the date you expressed your intent to become a national. Keep in mind this rule only applies to women who marry men who are Emirati citizens. A man who marries an Emirati woman will not be eligible for citizenship by virtue of the marriage. The UAE does not recognize dual citizenship. If you want to become an Emirati citizen through marriage, you must be willing to revoke any citizenship you currently have. Contact the embassy or consulate of your country of origin to find out what you need to do to officially revoke your citizenship. To apply for citizenship, your husband must complete a form and supply documents to the GDRFA that prove your identity and indicate your desire to become a citizen of the UAE. You will have to pay a fee for the request to be processed. You must be present with your husband when he submits the form and documents. Summary:","output":"In the UAE, women and men don't have the same citizenship rights. If a woman marries a man from the UAE, she won't automatically become a citizen, but she can become a citizen if her husband is one. Women are considered dependents of their husbands or fathers.

Movie plot title: Because I Said So Movie plot: The movie focuses on Daphne (Diane Keaton), the loving but over-bearing mother of three girls, in particular Milly (Mandy Moore). Her other daughters Maggie (Lauren Graham) and Mae (Piper Perabo) are happily married but Milly has recently broken up with her boyfriend, and Daphne is concerned. Daphne fears that her daughter cannot find a good man on her own so she secretly places a personal ad for her daughter. She finds a potential candidate, Jason (Tom Everett Scott), and tries to orchestrate a chance meeting of the two. The plan seems flawless until Milly finds her own date, guitarist Johnny (Gabriel Macht), who happens to be a candidate Daphne rejected before. Milly is unaware of her mother's scheming and begins relationships with both Jason and Johnny at the same time, with neither aware of the other. Inevitably, this double-dating takes its toll and Milly becomes estranged from both Jason and Johnny. In Jason's case, it is because she discovers Daphne's scheming. Meanwhile, Daphne stumbles upon her own perfect match after being alone for many years and begins to challenge her search for the perfect match for Milly. Milly also realizes she has a choice to be the daughter her mother wants her to be, or to be the woman she wants herself to be. Choosing the latter, which comes with a row with her mother, leads her to reconcile with Johnny, a relationship Daphne has realized she should have tried to orchestrate in the first place.

The Shackleton–Rowett Expedition (1921–22) was Sir Ernest Shackleton's last Antarctic project, and the final episode in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. The venture, financed by John Quiller Rowett, is sometimes referred to as the Quest Expedition after its ship Quest, a converted Norwegian sealer. Shackleton had originally intended to go to the Arctic and explore the Beaufort Sea, but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support; Shackleton thereupon switched his attention to the Antarctic. Quest, smaller than any recent Antarctic exploration vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died on board the ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. The major part of the subsequent attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, Frank Wild. The shortcomings of Quest were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20°E, well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the pack ice. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting Elephant Island where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance, during Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier.

Article: SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - With no sign of Judgment Day arriving on Saturday as forecast by an 89 year-old California evangelical broadcaster, followers were faced with trying to make sense of his failed pronouncement.      Harold Camping, the former civil engineer who heads the      Family Radio Network of Christian stations, had been unwavering in his message that believers would be swept to heaven on May 21.      His Oakland, California-based network broadcasts over 66 U.S. stations and through international affiliates. With the help of supporters it posted at least 2,000 billboards around the United States warning of the Judgment Day.      In New York, retired transportation agency worker Robert Fitzpatrick was inspired by Camping's message to spend over 140,000 of his savings on subway posters and outdoor advertisements warning of the May 21 Judgment Day.      As he stood in Times Square in New York surrounded by onlookers, Fitzpatrick, 60, carried a Bible and handed out leaflets as he waited for Judgment Day to begin.      By his own reading of Bible, which was slightly different than Camping's, Fitzgerald expected the great worldwide event to begin at 6 p.m. Eastern Time.      When the hour came and went, he said: \\"I do not understand why ...,\\" as his speech broke off and he looked at his watch.      \\"I do not understand why nothing has happened.\\"      Camping, who previously made a failed prediction Jesus Christ would return to Earth in 1994, had said doomsday would begin at 6 p.m. in the various time zones around the globe.      NEW DAY COMES      That meant it would begin in Asia and Oceania, but with midnight local time having come and gone in those areas, taking them well into May 22, and no indication of an apocalypse, Camping seemed to have gone silent.      During the day, his Family Radio played recorded church music, devotionals and life advice unrelated to Judgment Day.      The headquarters of his network was shuttered on Friday and Saturday, with a sign in the door that read \\"This Office is Closed. Sorry we missed you!\\"      Camping, whose deep sonorous voice is frequently heard on his radio network expounding the Bible, could not be reached for comment.      The shades were drawn and no one answered the door at his house in Alameda, California.      Sheila Doan, 65, who has lived next door to Camping since 1971, said he is a good neighbor and she was concerned about Camping and his wife because of the attention his pronouncement has received.      \\"I'm concerned for them, that somebody would possibly do something stupid, you just don't know in this world what's going to happen,\\" she said.      Tom Evans, a spokesman for Camping, said earlier this week that at least several tens of thousands of people listen to Family Radio's message.      The network is heard in more than 30 languages through international affiliates, according to Family Radio.      In recent weeks, dozens of Camping's followers had crossed the United States in recreational vehicles emblazoned with the May 21 warning. Volunteers also handed out pamphlets as far away as the Philippines, telling people God had left clear signs the world was coming to an end.      In Camping's description of Judgment Day, the Earth would be wrenched in a great earthquake and many inhabitants would perish in the coming months, until the planet's total destruction on October 21.      On Saturday, some atheists in different parts of the country held celebrations and get-togethers to mark the failure of Camping's May 21 prediction to come true.      In Oakland, the same city where Camping's network is based, over 200 people gathered at an atheist convention where speakers joked about the Judgment Day pronouncement and a vendor sold jewelry with the words \\"Good without God.\\"      Cara Lee Hickey, 32, a Christian turned atheist, said Camping's prediction got people talking.      \\"I've heard a lot of name-calling, but most of it is from other Christians calling him a false prophet,\\" she said.      (Additional reporting by Erik Tavcar, Jonathan Allen and Noel Randewich; Writing by Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by Jerry Norton) ||||| Sue Espinoza was planted before the television, awaiting news of her father's now infamous prediction: cataclysmic earthquakes auguring the end of humanity.God's wrath was supposed to begin in New Zealand and then race across the globe, leaving millions of bodies wherever the clock struck 6 p.m. But the hours ticked by, and New Zealand survived. Time zone by time zone, the apocalypse failed to materialize.On Saturday morning, Espinoza, 60, received a phone call from her father, Harold Camping, the 89-year-old Oakland preacher who has spent some 100 million — and countless hours on his radio and TV show — announcing May 21 as Judgment Day. \\"He just said, 'I'm a little bewildered that it didn't happen, but it's still May 21 [in the United States],'\\" Espinoza said, standing in the doorway of her Alameda home. \\"It's going to be May 21 from now until midnight.\\"But to others who put stock in Camping's prophecy, disillusionment was already profound by late morning. To them, it was clear the world and its woes would make it through the weekend.Keith Bauer, a 38-year-old tractor-trailer driver from Westminster, Md., took last week off from work, packed his wife, young son and a relative in their SUV and crossed the country.If it was his last week on Earth, he wanted to see parts of it he'd always heard about but missed, such as the Grand Canyon. With maxed-out credit cards and a growing mountain of bills, he said, the rapture would have been a relief.On Saturday morning, Bauer was parked in front of the Oakland headquarters of Camping's Family Radio empire, half expecting to see an angry mob of disenchanted believers howling for the preacher's head. The office was closed, and the street was mostly deserted save for journalists.Bauer said he was not bitter. \\"Worst-case scenario for me, I got to see the country,\\" he said. \\"If I should be angry at anybody, it should be me.\\"Tom Evans, who acted as Camping's PR aide in recent months, took his family to Ohio to await the rapture. Early next week, he said, he would be returning to California.\\"You can imagine we're pretty disappointed, but the word of God is still true,\\" he said. \\"We obviously went too far, and that's something we need to learn from.\\"Despite the failure of Camping's prediction, however, he said he might continue working for him.\\"As bad as it appears—and there's no getting around it, it is bad, flat-out—I have not found anything close to the faithfulness of Family Radio,\\" he said.Others had risked a lot more on Camping's prediction, quitting jobs, abandoning relationships, volunteering months of their time to spread the word. Matt Tuter, the longtime producer of Camping's radio and television call-in show, said Saturday that he expected there to be \\"a lot of angry people\\" as reality proved Camping wrong.Tuter said Family Radio's AM station in Sacramento had been \\"severely vandalized\\" Friday night or Saturday morning, with air conditioning units yanked out and 25,000 worth of copper stripped from the equipment. He thinks it must have been an angry listener. He was off Saturday but planned to drive past the headquarters \\"and make sure nothing's burning.\\"Camping himself, who has given innumerable interviews in recent months, was staying out of sight Saturday. No one answered the door at his Alameda home, though neighbors said he was there.By late afternoon, a small crowd had gathered in front of Camping's Oakland headquarters. There were atheists blowing up balloons in human form, which were released into the sky just after 6 p.m. in a mockery of the rapture. Someone played a CD of \\"The End\\" by the Doors, amid much laughter.There were also Christians, like James Bynum, a 45-year-old deacon at Calvary Baptist Church in Milpitas, holding signs that declared Harold Camping a false prophet. He said he was there to comfort disillusioned believers.\\"Harold Camping will never hand out poisoned Kool-Aid,\\" Bynum said. \\"It's not that kind of a cult. But he has set up a system that will destroy some people's lives.\\" ||||| 'Judgment Day' came and went on Saturday, and John Ramsey hasn't been able to sleep.      The 25-year-old Harrison, N.J. resident had rearranged his life in recent months to devote himself to spreading a fringe California preacher's prediction that May 21 would bring worldwide earthquakes and usher in a five-month period of misery before the world's destruction.      Like many of those convinced of the Rapture was pending, Ramsey quit his job, donated \\"a couple thousand\\" to Harold Camping's Family Radio network and convinced family members to join him to spread news of the Rapture on Manhattan streets.      His family nervously huddled in their apartment living room Saturday, holding their Bibles open, switching between CNN, Facebook and Google for news of quakes in the Pacific.      They cried. They hugged. They argued. But mostly, they waited. Nothing happened.      On Sunday, a dejected Ramsey said he faces a \\"mixed bag.\\"      He has to find a new job. So does his mother. His 19-year-old brother, who had quit high school the year prior (\\"It's pointless to graduate,\\" the brother had said), is thinking of re-enrolling or finding employment.      His wife, Marcia Paladines, had come to accept that she might never meet her unborn baby, whom she and Ramsey had named John Moses. Now, she's praying for a healthy birth. The child is due as early as Friday.      \\"Life goes on,\\" Ramsey said Sunday. \\"I get to live. I get to be a dad.\\"      The May 21 prediction came from the Biblical numerology of Harold Camping, an 89-year-old televangelist who owns the Oakland, Calif.-based Christian Family Radio network. Camping had previously predicted a similar end-times scenario in 1994.      Several Camping followers previously interviewed by The Huffington Post did not return phone calls and emails Sunday. But a few did publicly declare their reactions.      WATCH:                  \\"I guess no man knows the day or the hour,\\" said Peter Lombardi, a 44-year-old from Jersey City, N.J. who had had taken an \\"indefinite break\\" from his job in April to preach about May 21.      He had fitted his Dodge minivan with stickers proclaiming the \\"awesome news\\" of Judgment Day and paraded with neon green Caravans through Manhattan's business districts to hand hundreds of fliers about the date. On Sunday, he was peeling the stickers off.      Lombardi said he is going back to work -- he owns a construction business -- and said he has \\"no regrets.\\" He added, \\"I'm not disappointed. I'm still living today.\\" He believes Camping and others must have read the Bible incorrectly.      Lombardi had donated 1,100 to Family Radio in recent months to help the organization purchase thousands of billboards and other ads throughout the country, but said he doesn't expect any of his money back.      \\"What can you do?\\" he said. \\"I don't think they were scamming me, but I am definitely waiting to see what they say Monday on the radio show.\\"      \\"It's not [Camping's] fault,\\" said Ramsey, who added he also won't ask for his money back. \\"Nobody held a gun to my head. I read the Bible. The math added up. I don't think anybody would do something like this without meaning it.\\"      Camping was mostly silent over the weekend, but he spoke briefly outside his Alameda, Calif. home on Sunday with a San Francisco Chronicle Reporter.      \\"It has been a really tough weekend,\\" he said, adding he was \\"flabbergasted\\" and \\"looking for answers.\\" Camping said he would make a detailed announcement on Monday.      The Family Radio web site has not been updated. A countdown on the site says there are zero days left to 'Judgment Day' and an image shows the numbers \\"2012\\" crossed out.      \\"Mr. Camping certainly won't shy away from this,\\" Family Radio spokesman Tom Evans told The Huffington Post on Sunday, adding \\"how that will happen will be forthcoming.\\"      Evans, who had spent 'Judgment Day' with his wife and kids, said he was happy that he gets more time to be with his family, but added that \\"a believer's highest hope is to be with the Lord forever.\\" As for his belief in the second coming, \\"nothing has changed other than the ramifications for Family Radio and Mr. Camping's credibility in the world.\\"      After Camping's failed Rapture prediction in 1994, Evans stayed with Family Radio, but he declined to say whether he would stay on the job this time.      WATCH:                  Camping, who told The Huffington Post last week that May 21 was \\"no laughing matter,\\" had refused to discuss what he would do with donations if the day passed without event. In recent months, followers have given generously to his company, which runs 66 radio stations in the U.S. and is worth at least 120 million.      On Sunday, Evans said Family Radio's assets \\"far outweigh its liabilities,\\" and that it will \\"certainly do everything it can to take care of people.\\" But he said that there has been no decision on giving money back to donors.      In 2009, the last year Family Radio publicly released a tax return, the group reported 18.4 million in income from contributions and 1 million from investments and other income. It spent 36.7 million and employed 348 people paid a total of more than 9 million in wages and benefits. Camping has said he has worked without pay for several years.      Articles have noted that the station's lease runs through 2023 and that several employees were planning last week to show up to work on Monday.      Followers like Ramsey and Lombardi said they had few hard feelings toward Camping and still agreed with some of the self-taught preacher's views, such as one that says all churches and denominations have been corrupted.      \\"I have learned to study the Bible really well. This guy has opened my eyes to a lot of truths,\\" said Lombardi.      \\"If he makes another prediction, I can't tell you what I am going to do,\\" said Ramsey. \\"But I've really taken an interest in the Bible. I know it's the word of God. And I've been reading into more parts today.\\"      He quoted Mark 13:22: \\"For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall [show] signs and wonders, to seduce, if [it were] possible, even the elect.\\" ||||| the end is near Long Island Firefighter’s Wait for the Rapture Goes Unfulfilled      “Wanna order a pizza?\\" Jeff asks. \\"I don’t know if we’ll have time to eat it, but we might as well get it.”            It is 4:48 p.m. on May 21, and earthquakes have not yet riven the Earth. “When the sky goes dark and you feel a rumbling, I’m going to ask you and the kids to step outside very quickly,\\" Jeff told me when I first arrived at his small ranch house in Hicksville, Long Island. \\"God willing, we’ll all be taken up in a whirlwind to Heaven. I know it might sound strange, but that’s my understanding of how it’s going to go.” His 6-year-old son was in the living room, playing a Star Wars game on the Wii. His 4-year-old daughter, wearing a Spider-Man bike helmet from a recent tricycle trip around the backyard, tapped me on the shoulder to show me a crayon drawing of a rainbow.            Jeff orders a large Sicilian pie for delivery. “And please put a rush on it,” he tells the person taking his order. “We’re — we’re in a rush here.”      Jeff is visibly nervous now, taking deep breaths. “And listen,” he says into the phone, “if you have a radio, put on 94.7. They’re talking about Judgment Day and telling everyone to ask God for mercy. It's important.” WFME 94.7 is the New York outlet for Family Radio, the station Jeff was listening to three years ago when he heard Harold Camping prophesying the End of Days. That's when Jeff left the Catholic Church and begin studying Biblical numerology. Thousands of Camping's followers fervently believe that the Rapture will occur on May 21, 2011; millions more know of the prophecy thanks to Family Radio billboards and newspaper ads.      Jeff, 44, is a muscular firefighter from Flushing with a square jawline. When the pizza arrives, Jeff calls his friend Ron, “One of the only true believers I know who will talk to me about this stuff,\\" and they reassure each other by speakerphone, parsing choice psalms and proverbs.            “So, from the Biblical evidence you’re finding,” Jeff asks Ron, “at what hour do we now think this earthquake is going to happen?” According to Harold Camping, the earthquakes were to start at 6 p.m. at the International Date Line — 2 a.m. Eastern Time — and spread eastward around the world. When Jeff woke up on Saturday and everything was still calm, he decided this was a potentially ominous sign: “This morning the sky was crystal clear, just like 9/11. I was a firefighter then, and I couldn’t believe that on such a beautiful day, such destruction could come.” With the Rapture seemingly running behind schedule, Jeff hypothesized then predicted the earthquakes would come between 3 and 5 p.m. ET, and would wreak destruction over all the world simultaneously. After three, his prediction changed again: “Six now looks more likely, but really it might be any time before midnight.” Ron, over the phone, refuses to predict the hour. “In all this time, I’ve always been blown away by the evidence pointing to the day, but never the exact hour.”            Rosana, Jeff’s wife, who had been out at a friend's birthday party, comes home a little after six. “What, nothing happened?” she asks with no small amount of contempt.      Jeff buries his head in his Bible. He and Ron debate the virtues of King Solomon for another hour, while Rosana loudly opens and closes cabinets. Jeff warms up another slice of pizza and pours Pepsi into a Miller Lite pint glass. Finally, he hangs up the phone. Rosana turns to face him.      “Jeff, starting at midnight tonight, I don’t want to hear any more of this crap, okay?”      “Look,” he says, “I told you I knew the day, but I never claimed to know the hour—“      “I don’t want to hear it, Jeff. I’m telling you, I can’t take it.”      Rosana gives me a helpless look, and she and I go into another room to chat. “I don’t know what happened to him,” she whispers to me. “He used to be normal. Now all he can talk about is the Bible and this May 21 stuff. He took all his vacation days in a row, so all he’s doing the last four weeks is sitting around reading the Bible and driving me nuts. Thank God he didn’t quit his job like some of them did.”      Meanwhile, Jeff is checking his text messages. “There are a bunch of friends here who are mocking me,” he says. “And that’s all right! I just put on my spiritual shield and endure.”      Ron calls again, and he and Jeff come up with a new interpretation: May 21 will not end, technically, until midnight in Hawaii. “There will be a lot of people mocking me after midnight tonight if nothing does happen,” Jeff says, breathing quickly again, “but what they don’t realize is that May 21 hasn’t been completed everywhere in the world yet. So we really can’t tell anything until six in the morning here. That’s when the truth will really be tested.” ||||| The hour of the apocalypse came quietly and went the same way _ leaving those who believed that Saturday evening would mark the world's end confused, or more faithful, or just philosophical.

(Associated Press)      Believers had spent months warning the world of the pending cataclysm. Some had given away earthly belongings. Others took long journeys to be with loved ones. And there were those who drained their savings accounts.      All were responding to the May 21 doomsday message by Harold Camping, an 89-year-old retired civil engineer who has built a multi-million-dollar Christian media empire that publicizes his apocalyptic prediction.      \\"I had some skepticism but I was trying to push the skepticism away because I believe in God,\\" said Keith Bauer _ who hopped in his minivan in Maryland and drove his family 3,000 miles (5,000 kilometers) to California for the Rapture.      He started his day in the bright morning sun outside Camping's gated Oakland headquarters of Family Radio International.      \\"I was hoping for it because I think heaven would be a lot better than this earth,\\" said Bauer, a tractor-trailer driver who began the voyage west last week, figuring that if he \\"worked last week, I wouldn't have gotten paid anyway, if the Rapture did happen.\\"      According to Camping, the destruction was likely to have begun its worldwide march as it became 6 p.m. in the various time zones, although some believers said Saturday the exact timing was never written in stone.      He had been projecting the apocalyptic prediction for years far and wide via broadcasts and websites.      In New York's Times Square, Robert Fitzpatrick, of Staten Island, said he was surprised when the six o'clock hour simply came and went. He had spent his own money to put up advertising about the end of the world.      \\"I can't tell you what I feel right now,\\" he said, surrounded by tourists. \\"Obviously, I haven't understood it correctly because we're still here.\\"      Many followers said the delay was a further test from God to persevere in their faith.      \\"It's still May 21 and God's going to bring it,\\" said Family Radio's special projects coordinator Michael Garcia, who spent Saturday morning praying and drinking two last cups of coffee with his wife at home in Alameda. \\"When you say something and it doesn't happen, your pride is what's hurt. But who needs pride? God said he resists the proud and gives grace to the humble.\\"      The Internet was alive with discussion, humorous or not, about the end of the world and its apparent failure to occur on cue. Many tweets declared Camping's prediction a dud or shared, tongue-in-cheek, their relief at not having to do weekend chores or take a shower.      The top trends on Twitter at midday included, at No. 1, \\"endofworldconfessions,\\" followed by \\"myraptureplaylist.\\"      As 6 p.m. approached in California, some 100 people gathered outside Family Radio International headquarters in Oakland, although it appeared none of the believers of the prophecy were among them. Camping's radio stations, TV channels, satellite broadcasts and website are controlled from a modest building sandwiched between an auto shop and a palm reader's business.      Christian leaders from across the spectrum widely dismissed the prophecy, and members of a local church concerned Camping's followers could slip into a deep depression come Sunday were part of the crowd outside Family Radio International. They held signs declaring Camping a false prophet as motorists drove by.      \\"The cold, hard reality is going to hit them that they did this, and it was false and they basically emptied out everything to follow a false teacher,\\" the Rev. Jacob Denys, of the Milpitas-based Calvary Bible Church, said earlier. \\"We're not all about doom and gloom. Our message is a message of salvation and of hope.\\"      About a dozen people in a partying mood were also outside Family Radio International, creating a carnival-like atmosphere as they strolled in a variety of costumes that portrayed monks, Jesus Christ and other figures.      \\"Am I relieved? Yeah. I've got a lot going on,\\" Peter Erwin, a student from Oakland, said, with a hint of sarcasm. \\"Trying to get specific about the end of the world is crazy.\\"      Revelers counted down the seconds before the anticipated hour, and people began dancing to music as the clock struck 6 p.m. Some released shoe-shaped helium balloons into the sky in an apparent reference to the Rapture.      Camping has preached that some 200 million people would be saved, and that those left behind would die in a series of scourges visiting Earth until the globe is consumed by a fireball on Oct. 21.      Family Radio International's message has been broadcast in 61 languages. He has said that his earlier apocalyptic prediction in 1994 didn't come true because of a mathematical error.      \\"I'm not embarrassed about it. It was just the fact that it was premature,\\" he told The Associated Press last month. But this time, he said, \\"there is ... no possibility that it will not happen.\\"      As Saturday drew nearer, followers reported that donations grew, allowing Family Radio to spend millions on more than 5,000 billboards and 20 RVs plastered with the doomsday message. In 2009, the nonprofit reported in IRS filings that it received 18.3 million in donations, and had assets of more than 104 million, including 34 million in stocks or other publicly traded securities.      Marie Exley, who helped put up apocalypse-themed billboards in Israel, Jordan and Lebanon, said the money allowed the nonprofit to reach as many souls as possible.      She said she and her husband, mother and brother read the Bible and stayed close to the television news on Friday night awaiting word of an earthquake in the southern hemisphere. When that did not happen, she said fellow believers began reaching out to reassure one another of their faith.      \\"Some people were saying it was going to be an earthquake at that specific time in New Zealand and be a rolling judgment, but God is keeping us in our place and saying you may know the day but you don't know the hour,\\" she said Saturday, speaking from Bozeman, Montana. \\"The day is not over, it's just the morning, and we have to endure until the end.\\"      Still, the world wasn't without its normal and sometimes dreadful disturbances Saturday. Among them: a tornado killed one person and damaged at least 20 homes in Kansas, a 6.1-magnitude quake stuck 600 miles (1,100 kilometers) off New Zealand with no reports of injury, a much smaller quake, 3.6, was felt my many people Saturday evening in the San Francisco Bay area, and Iceland's most active volcano started erupting.      Camping, who lives a few miles (kilometers) from his radio station, was not home late morning Saturday, and an additional attempt to seek comment from him late in the evening also was unsuccessful, with no one answering his front door.      Earlier in the day, Sheila Doan, 65, Camping's next-door-neighbor of 40 years, was outside gardening and said the worldwide spotlight on his May 21 forecast has attracted far more attention than the 1994 prediction.      Doan said she is a Christian and while she respects her neighbor, she doesn't share his views.      \\"I wouldn't consider Mr. Camping a close friend and wouldn't have him over for dinner or anything, but if he needs anything, we are there for him,\\" Doan said.      ___      Associated Press reporters Terry Chea in Oakland, Don Babwin in Chicago, Mike Householder in Detroit, Janet McConnaughey in New Orleans, David R. Martin in New York and video journalist Haven Daley in San Francisco contributed to this report.

His message, that believers would be swept to heaven on May 21, led many of his followers to give away their possessions, spend their savings, and make other significant life changes. When the day came and went without any cataclysmic events, these followers were left to make sense of the situation. Some theories emerged about potential miscalculations, and new predictions were made, but ultimately, the followers were left disillusioned and having to rebuild their lives after relying on the false prophecy. Harold Camping had previously made another failed prediction in 1994, and could not be reached for comment regarding his latest failed prediction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Process: - Acid rain is produced by chemicals that reach into the atmosphere - Falls onto the ground - The acid rain starts scouring rocks - Destroys vegetation - The lack of vegetation alters the surrounding environment.  Question: suppose less vegetation available happens, how will it affect LESS damage by acid rain.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"Less effect. To fully understand the implications of the supposed perturbation and its connection with the damage caused by acid rain, let us first delve into the process mentioned earlier: 1. Acid rain is produced by chemicals, such as sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and nitrogen oxide (NOx), which reach into the atmosphere. These chemicals are primarily released through the burning of fossil fuels, industrial processes, and vehicular emissions. 2. Upon reaching the atmosphere, these chemicals undergo numerous chemical reactions, turning into sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) and nitric acid (HNO₃). These acids then mix with rainwater, creating acid rain. 3. Acid rain falls onto the ground and can have detrimental effects on various aspects of the environment, such as soil, rock formations, and vegetation. 4. The acid rain starts to react with rocks, leading to a process known as chemical weathering. This weathering can cause rocks to break down and weaken, giving rise to the potential for erosion and environmental damage. 5. As mentioned, acid rain also destroys vegetation. Acid deposition in soils can lead to a decrease in vital nutrients and an increase in toxic elements, causing harm to plant life and impeding plant growth. 6. The lack of vegetation that results from acid rain leads to alterations in the surrounding environment, such as increased soil erosion and destabilization of ecosystems. Now, considering the question, if there is less vegetation available and this reduced vegetation coverage is assumed to be the outcome of some factor other than acid rain, it can be inferred that it would have a less effect on the damage caused by acid rain. This is primarily due to three reasons: 1. With fewer plants and vegetation in the affected areas, there would be fewer targets for acid rain to damage directly. As a result, the immediate impact of acid rain on the local vegetation and ecosystems would be reduced. 2. The reduced vegetation coverage can potentially lead to a decrease in transpiration, which in turn may affect the local water cycle. This alteration in the water cycle could result in a decreased frequency or intensity of precipitation events, meaning that less acid rain might fall in these areas. 3. Since the reduced vegetation coverage is not a direct result of acid rain, it implies that other factors such as land-use changes, deforestation, or climatic variations are responsible for this phenomenon. These factors often entail mitigation and management approaches that are different from those addressing acid rain. Therefore, the impact of acid rain must also be assessed and managed differently, considering its potential interactions with these other factors. However, it is essential to note that less damage from acid rain does not imply the overall environmental impact is reduced. The other factors responsible for decreased vegetation might have their consequences, making it necessary to continue exploring strategies that minimize acid rain emissions and monitor the long-term effects the perturbation may have."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Acids have pH values below 7. The lower the pH value, the more strongly acidic the substance.  You can find tables that show the pH value of different fruits and vegetables. The fruits such as apples are barely acidic so they have a pH value that is higher or lower? A:","output":"Apples have a pH value which is lower than 7, making them an acidic fruit. However, compared to other fruits, apples are considered to be mildly or barely acidic. This means that their pH value is not extremely low, but rather closer to 7, which is the neutral pH value. So, the pH value of apples is lower than the neutral pH value, but higher than the pH values of more strongly acidic fruits, such as lemons and oranges. To understand this better, let's review the pH scale briefly. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 0 being the most acidic, 14 being the most alkaline, and 7 being neutral. Substances with a pH value below 7 are considered acidic, while those with a pH value above 7 are considered alkaline or basic. Each unit on the scale represents a tenfold change in acidity or basicity. Now, the pH value of apples may vary slightly depending on the variety and ripeness of the fruit. Generally speaking, apples have a pH value that ranges from approximately 3.3 to 4.0. This makes apples acidic but not as acidic as other fruits like lemons, which have a pH value of around 2.0, or oranges, which have a pH value of around 3.0 to 4.0. In summary, the pH value of apples is lower than the neutral pH value of 7, indicating that they are acidic. However, apples are considered to be mildly or barely acidic compared to other fruits, as their pH value is higher than that of more strongly acidic fruits like lemons and oranges."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

As the round object rolls down the ramp it will what? - sound well - fly - become broken - gain speed - fall into hole  The best answer is Answer:","output":"As the round object rolls down the ramp, it will gain speed. This phenomenon can be explained by the principles of physics, specifically through concepts related to energy conservation and motion. When a round object is placed on an inclined ramp, it experiences a gravitational force pulling it towards the ground. This force acts as the driving force for the object's movement down the slope. At the same time, the combination of the ramp's angle and the object's weight and shape will determine the amount of friction and air resistance that the object will experience, which could slightly dampen its speed. Initially, the object has potential energy at the top of the ramp due to its elevated position. As it begins to roll down, this potential energy is gradually converted into kinetic energy, which is the energy associated with the object's motion. This conversion continues until the round object reaches the bottom of the ramp, at which point it would have maximized its kinetic energy and effectively gained speed throughout the descent. The other options mentioned: 1. Sound Well: The round object may produce a sound as it rolls, but this only depends on the specific object's material and the surface of the ramp. Therefore, this is not the best answer. 2. Fly: The round object will not fly unless there are external forces or special conditions in play, such as upward drafts of air or it reaching a high enough velocity to lift off the ground due to aerodynamics, which is not likely just from rolling down a ramp. 3. Become broken: The round object may or may not become broken as it rolls down the ramp. This would depend on factors such as material, durability, and the condition of the ramp. It is not guaranteed that the round object will break, so this is not the best answer. 4. Fall into a hole: There is no specific information provided about the presence of a hole at the bottom of the ramp or on the ramp itself. If a hole exists, it is circumstantial, and the object may fall into it, but this is not a universal outcome for all round objects rolling down ramps. Therefore, this is not the best answer. To summarize, the best answer is that the round object will gain speed as it rolls down the ramp due to the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy. This phenomenon is governed by fundamental principles of physics and is a generalizable outcome for round objects rolling down ramps, compared to the other options."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The boy shot the target more times than the tree because the  Select from: I. tree was farther away from him.; II. target was farther away from him.;","output":"The boy shot the target more times than the tree because the tree was farther away from him. This discrepancy in accuracy can be attributed to several factors, including the distance to the target, the size of the tree, the boy's experience, the visibility, and the weather conditions. I. Tree was farther away from him. 1. Distance to the target: The further away the tree was from the boy, the more difficult it would be for him to aim and accurately shoot at it. This is due to how projectiles, such as the arrow or bullet being used, follow a trajectory and are affected by external forces like gravity, wind, and air resistance. As the distance increases, the projectile's path will deviate more from its intended course, making it more challenging to accurately hit the tree. 2. Size of the tree: Depending on the size and shape of the tree, it might have been more challenging to shoot at compared to a specific target. The larger a target, the easier it is to hit. If the target were larger than the tree, it would be more natural for him to score hits on the target, even if it was at roughly the same distance as the tree. 3. The boy's experience: The boy could have had more practice shooting at targets set at a consistent distance, and consequently, was more accustomed to shooting at that range. He might have had difficulty adjusting his aim for the tree that was farther away because of his lack of experience with differing distances. 4. Visibility: The visibility of the target and the tree could have played a significant role in determining the boy's accuracy. The target may have been more visually distinct or easier to see due to color, contrast, or lighting. The tree, on the other hand, might have been partially obscured by leaves, branches, or shadows, making it more difficult to discern and aim at accurately. 5. Weather conditions: Wind, rain, and other meteorological factors could have affected the boy's ability to shoot the tree positioned farther away. Wind, in particular, can influence the projectile trajectory, causing it to deviate from the intended path if it must travel a greater distance. Moreover, poor weather conditions such as rain or fog can reduce visibility, hampering the boy's ability to see the tree clearly and aim correctly. In conclusion, the boy's greater success shooting the target compared to the tree can be mainly attributed to the tree being farther away from him. This distance amplified various challenging elements like the trajectory of the projectile, visibility, and weather conditions. Additionally, factors such as the target and tree sizes and the boy's experience could have played a role in his accuracy. A combination of these factors ultimately led to the boy hitting the target more times than the tree."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It is crucial to ask this question before you create your model or you may end up creating a model that does not meet your objective.  Do you want to predict something? Find out how to regulate something? Or do something else?  For example, imagine you want to know how much room you have in a storage unit to see how many boxes you can put into it. You will be creating a model to predict the amount of space that is in your storage unit. What data do you already have? Make a list of the data that has been given. As you list the data, decide what pieces are most relevant and which pieces are not relevant.  You should also list any information that can be assumed based on what you already know. Keep in mind that you may have to take measurements to find the data that you need. To find out how much room you have in your storage unit, you will need to measure the unit's height, width, and length. Do you need to consider factors like gravity, volume, time, etc.? Make a note of any factors that will need to be considered when you create the model.  To determine the amount of space that you have in your storage unit, you will need to find the volume. You also need to keep in mind that there will be some wasted space, since some objects may be irregular and that will make it difficult to use every inch of the storage unit. What equations and formulas will you need in order to find your answer? How will you apply these equations and formulas? Make sure that you have a clear understanding of how to plug the data that you have into the equation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I have never had an experience with a hotel as bad as the one I had this past weekend at the Stratosphere in Las Vegas.  This week is my 36th birthday; so to celebrate, I decided, on the spur of the moment, to make a trip to Vegas to go to one of my favorite clubs last weekend.  I mean, why not? This past year, I received a kidney transplant. No more dialysis, so now I could travel freely. I had the money.  No reason not to, right?  I originally wanted to just go and book whatever hotel room I could find while I was in Vegas itself, but at the urging of a close friend, I chose to go online and see if I could find a deal.  I used a third party website, and found a room at the Statosphere for 67 per night.  Since I was traveling late, and would not get there until after midnight, I booked it for Saturday, figuring I would stay overnight and come back to LA on Sunday. No problem, right?  Apparently, in Las Vegas, days do not begin at midnight like they do everywhere else in the U.S.  They begin at 3pm, which was naturally not indicated on my confirmation.  So when I got to the Statosphere, and tried to check in at midnight itself, I was told that I would have to buy two days, because this was still considered Friday. No attempt to make good, just to charge me more money, a pattern I would later learn was typical for the Stratosphere.  Across the street was a sleazy motel, so I figured I could just crash there for the night, and check into my room the next day. Since I did not have the much vaunted Statosphere for internet access, I searched for a wireless connection. As luck would have it, the city provides 5 wireless per day through Las Vegas.net. I bought two days, figured I would check in to the Statosphere the next day and all would be well.  When I got to there, I learned why my room had been such a \\"bargain\\": it came with a glorious view of some storage area where apparently the hotel keeps scrap metal. Two windows worth, no less.  But that wasn't as bad as learning that the Stratosphere BLOCKS wireless providers so you have to buy theirs... at 11 a day.  Flabbergasted that a ritzy (cough!) hotel would be this cheap, I realized that I would have to use the phone to make my plans for the night. Not a big deal, I have a phone card, and their phone's display said local calls were free, except that, well, they're not.  When I just got a rapid dialtone whenever I dialed nine, I tried calling the front desk for a solution. They put me on hold FOREVER.  I tried other numbers - the concierge, the operator, SOMETHING - to find out what was wrong with my phone so I didn;t have to sit on hold, but to no avail.  The Statosphere wanted me to hold on for five minutes, no matter what. So I did, only to learn that local calls are A DOLLAR each. What's on the phone, I guess, was put there by the manufacturer, because no one in their right mind would believe a luxury hotel would charge a buck each for LOCAL calls. But the Statosphere is not like other hotels.  It's far worse.  So I used the cell, got to where I needed to go, and got the Hell out of there, discovering my favorite thing about the Statosphere - check out is easy and fast. I'm sure they had to do that because they get so many.  Bottom line, unless you're part of the 1%, stay at Circus Circus if you're going to Las Vegas on a budget. And stay as far from the Statosphere as you can. The tower, I now believe, was put in to distract you from how horrible this place is. Never again. Choose the sentiment of this review?

Answer:","output":"The first step of the process is the colonization of an area by pioneer species, which are small, hardy plants and organisms that can grow in harsh environments with little to no soil. These pioneer species, such as lichens, mosses, and certain grasses, help break down rocks and organic material, contributing to the formation of the initial layer of soil. As these plants die and decompose, the soil gains organic material, leading to increasing fertility.

What was the situation and what did you do or say?” As senior members of a Boy Scout Troop, other adults and I had to instruct two younger member on how to recognize and control emotions in the context of conflict. These two guys had a history of conflicts and I knew people won’t always be present to control them. They had to grow up and be self-sufficient. On one camping trip they yet again had another heated argument over something trivial that kept escalating. Rather than jump in, I wanted to see how they deescalate the situation on their own. Suddenly, one of them pulls out a pocket knife and says “[insert demand here] or I’m gonna [insert some action with a knife to a person].” The situation has clearly escalated too far. Immediately I rushed in and yelled, “STOP! DROP IT, NOW!” He immediately dropped the knife, sat down, and began crying. What happens after that is irrelevant. Perhaps it’s due to my quiet nature and sudden outburst that produced the shock effect. But more importantly the use of straight-forward, succinct commands can control the situation because all parties involved are automatically in natural fight-flight mode where elaborate, long explanations aren’t going to be interpreted correctly by listeners for the purposes of deescalating the situation’s climax.

Given statement: \\"Young boys are walking in galoshes.\\" In this statement, we are provided with three main pieces of information: 1. The subjects are young boys. 2. The action they are performing is walking. 3. The additional information about their walking is that they are wearing galoshes. A brief analysis of this statement allows us to understand the situation. We know that there are young boys who are engaged in the action of walking. As they walk, they are wearing galoshes, which are a type of rubber or waterproof boot used to protect the feet from getting wet or dirty in puddles, rain, or muddy situations. Conclusion: \\"The boys are walking.\\" In the conclusion, we are concerned with two main ideas: 1. The subjects are boys (though the age descriptor \\"young\\" has been omitted). 2. The action they are performing is walking. Given the information presented in the initial statement, we can safely conclude that \\"The boys are walking\\" holds true. We have evidence of young boys involved in the act of walking, which directly correlates to the conclusion we want to draw. The descriptor \\"young\\" has been dropped from the conclusion, but this simplified statement still communicates the core idea.

We have an equation that looks like this: -624 * x + 21 = -627 * x. We want to find out what x is, so let's solve it together step by step. First, let's move all the terms with 'x' to one side. So, we want to add 627 * x to both sides: -624 * x + 21 + 627 * x = -627 * x + 627 * x That simplifies to: 3 * x + 21 = 0 Now, let's get rid of the 21 by subtracting 21 from both sides: 3 * x = -21 Finally, to find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = -21 / 3 So, x = -7 And there you have it!

But the Boston Globe dug up documents listing him as sole stockholder, chairman of the board, chief executive officer, and president. They also found filings from four different business entities identifying him as Bain's boss; some say he had managerial control over five Bain units formed in January 2002. Romney officials say he was CEO in paperwork only, and wasn't actively involved in the firm, but a former SEC chairman dismisses that argument. You can't say statements filed with the SEC are meaningless, he says, adding that if Romney wasn't at the helm, he could be sued by investors who thought he was. Romney's campaign released a statement today officially denying the Globe story, USA Today reports.","output":"Mitt Romney, the former Governor of Massachusetts and unsuccessful Republican nominee for President in 2012, has been found to have been the CEO of Bain Capital for three years longer than he publicly claimed, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Boston Globe uncovered documents that identified Romney as the \\"sole stockholder, chairman of the board, chief executive officer, and president\\" of Bain Capital until 2002, despite Romney previously stating he departed the firm in February 1999. Romney claimed that his early exit was an attempt to shield himself from criticism regarding the firm's later activities, such as bankruptcies and layoffs. However, the Globe's findings throw Romney's explanation into question, casting doubt on his departure from the company. The discovery prompted accusations that Romney may have misled investors about his involvement with Bain from an official perspective. The documents also suggest that Romney had managerial control over five Bain units formed in January 2002, further contradicting his assertion that he had severed ties with the firm three years earlier. Romney's campaign officials have attempted to dismiss the Globe's claims, stating that he was CEO in name only and played no active role in the company. They argue that the documentation was filed as a procedural requirement for his departure, as he retained ownership of a portion of the company. However, former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt argues that this argument is baseless. \\"You can't say statements filed with the SEC are meaningless,\\" Levitt said, adding that investors who believed that Romney was still CEO could sue him for damages. Romney's representatives have responded by vehemently denying that the Globe's story is factual. The controversy has caused significant damage to Romney's political reputation, as the perception of his authenticity and business acumen was integral to his candidacy in 2012. The scandal has ignited debate within the Republican Party over the suitability of Romney to run for office in the future.

Hint: In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfatereducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Nonrespiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic byproducts (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste.

Tycho Brahe also noticed discrepancies. The Gregorian leap year rule (97 leap years in 400 years) was put forward by Petrus Pitatus of Verona in 1560. He noted that it is consistent with the tropical year of the Alfonsine tables and with the mean tropical year of Copernicus (De revolutionibus) and Reinhold (Prutenic tables). The three mean tropical years in Babylonian sexagesimals as the excess over 365 days (the way they would have been extracted from the tables of mean longitude) were 14,33,9,57 (Alphonsine), 14,33,11,12 (Copernicus) and 14,33,9,24 (Reinhold).

However, I can help you with a sample article with the given title: MCCAIN FANS IN PA: A LOYAL FOLLOWING Pennsylvania was one of the crucial states during the 2008 US Presidential Election. The state was a stiff battleground and witnessed some exceptional campaigns from both parties. Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama toured the state making their case to the voters. McCain's supporters in Pennsylvania were not just backing his policies; they were individuals impressed by his courage and service to his country. McCain, a senator from Arizona and former POW, had a loyal following in Pennsylvania. His supporters felt a connection with him that went beyond politics. McCain's military service was respected and admired by many across the state. His running mate, Sarah Palin, also connected with the conservative values of a majority of Pennsylvanians. Despite losing the state to Obama, McCain's fans remained steadfast in their support for the senator. In fact, his supporters started to refer to themselves as \\"McCainiacs\\" or \\"McCainiac Nation\\". These supporters were individuals who appreciated McCain's frankness, honesty and authenticity. They saw him as a political leader who spoke his mind, even if it meant going against the status quo. McCain was also known for his work with veterans and his commitment to bipartisanship. Supporters in Pennsylvania viewed him as a bipartisan leader who had the ability to work across the aisle for the betterment of the country. They were impressed with his ability to bring both sides of the political divide together on national issues such as immigration, healthcare and the deficit. In conclusion, for many Pennsylvania residents, McCain represented a politics-free approach to leadership. McCain fans in the state were not just supporters of John McCain, but they were fans of his principles and values. They respected his service to his country and saw him as a fearless leader who spoke his mind. Even though he was not successful in Pennsylvania during the election, his fans remained steadfast in their support and admiration for him."},{"instruction":"this question asking for city, country, mountain, state, other location?
