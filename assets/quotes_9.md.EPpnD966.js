Article: Vinegar contains acetic acid, which effectively kills weeds. Keep in mind that vinegar is non-selective and will kill any living plant it touches, not just weeds. White vinegar can be used alone, or you can add additional ingredients to the vinegar to make an even stronger solution.  Avoid using vinegar on or near your lawn, since it will kill the grass. Vinegar will raise the acidity of your soil. Before planting, test the pH of your soil and adjust it accordingly, if needed. Use horticultural vinegar with 20% acetic acid for increased effectiveness between pavers or on patios. The extra acidity will affect the pH balance of your soil and other plants. Lemon juice contains high levels of citric acid and can be effective when used with the white vinegar. If you want to try it, simply mix the lemon juice in with your 2 c (400 mL) of white distilled vinegar. Dish soap can be a helpful addition to vinegar when you're dealing with weeds that have a waxy coating or a “hairy” surface, like dandelion and crabgrass. The fuzzy exterior blocks the absorption of vinegar, but dish soap will penetrate the outer protective layer of the plant and help the mixture stick to the leaves.  You can use dish soap or dishwasher detergent in liquid or powder form. Dish soap can be used in conjunction with a lemon-vinegar mixture, but a soap and vinegar solution will be very effective. Isopropyl alcohol can be very effective when mixed with white vinegar or even when used alone. You can also use cheap gin to achieve similar results. Simply add the alcohol of your choice to the white vinegar and stir it thoroughly. You can use alcohol, vinegar, and lemon juice together in one mixture, but a solution that strong may cause soil damage. You can use the full-strength solution if your weed problem is severe, but this is typically too strong. A 50/50 mix diluted with water will be very effective on weeds without traumatizing the area where it's used. Full strength solutions may penetrate the soil and kill the roots of plants other than weeds. They can also disturb crucial microorganisms in the soil. Use a funnel to transfer the solution to a spray bottle, then replace the nozzle tightly. Apply the solution to the weeds and monitor the results for 24 hours. If needed, you can apply more solution, but you probably won't need to.  Set the nozzle to \\"stream\\" rather than \\"spray\\" if the weeds are growing close to plants that you don't want to kill. Don't forget -- weed killer does not discriminate. It will kill any plant it comes in contact with, so use it carefully! What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article discusses the use of vinegar and its various combinations with other ingredients as an effective, non-selective weed killer. Mixing vinegar with lemon juice, dish soap, or alcohol can enhance its weed-killing properties but may also affect soil pH and harm non-target plants.

Question: On which coast does the battle take place? Movie plot title: Attack of the Killer Tomatoes Movie plot: The film opens with a scroll saying that when Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds (1963) was released, audiences laughed at the notion of birds revolting against humanity, but when an attack perpetrated by birds occurred in 1975, no one laughed. This is followed by a pre-credits sequence of a tomato rising out of a woman's garbage disposal unit. Her puzzlement turns into terror as the tomato draws her into a corner. Following the credits, the police investigate her death. One officer discovers that the red substance she is covered with is not blood, but tomato juice. A series of attacks perpetrated by tomatoes occur (including a man dying by drinking tomato juice made from a killer tomato, a boy heard being gobbled up by a killer tomato, and a sequence where the tomatoes attack innocent swimmers, in a parody of Jaws). While the President's press secretary Jim Richardson tries to convince the public that there is no credible threat, the president puts together a team of specialists to stop the tomatoes led by a man named Mason Dixon. Dixon's team includes Sam Smith, a disguise expert who is seen at various points dressed as, among other things, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Adolf Hitler; Navy diver Greg Colburn; Olympic swimmer Gretta Attenbaum; and parachute-toting soldier Wilbur Finletter. Smith is sent out to infiltrate the tomatoes at a campfire, eventually blowing his cover while eating a hamburger and asking if anyone could \\"pass the ketchup.\\" Colburn and Gretta are sent to sectors, while Finletter stays with Mason. Meanwhile, the president sends Richardson to the fictitious ad agency \\"Mind Makers,\\" where executive Ted Swan spends huge amounts of money to develop virtually worthless ploys including a bumper sticker with \\"STP\\" for \\"Stop Tomato Program\\" on it, a satirical reference to both the real \\"whip inflation now\\" campaign with its widely ridiculed \\"WIN\\" slogan and STP motor oil decals and bumper stickers which were commonplace in the 1970s.

Review: It's always tough having a sibling doing better in their life than you, always a struggle to get out from under that shadow and not let bitterness keep you away from your family. So, imagine that your older brother is Santa and then imagine how tough that must be. That's the premise here. Vince Vaughn plays the titular Fred, an embittered loser who spends a lot of his energy making sure that people don't go around expecting good things to happen to them or giving his brother, Santa (played by Paul Giamatti), too much praise for simply being the limelight-hogging, fame-hungry, slightly creepy guy that Fred would want to portray him as. Then, wouldn't you know it, Fred needs a financial favour and so has to make up for it by helping his brother on the run up to Christmas. And hilarity and life lessons ensue. Well, that's what should happen. The reality is that we get a Christmas movie featuring a few good moments of Vaughn's patented fast-talking, a ridiculously out-of-nowhere music video moment, Kevin Spacey playing an auditor out to close down Santa's operation (and he's one of the weakest baddies I have seen in some time), not enough of the gorgeous Elizabeth Banks in a lush Christmas outfit, too much of John Michael Higgins in his elf outfit (to be fair, he's a highlight though) and a movie that's too swimming in bitterness to feel like good seasonal fare yet too schmaltzy in it's latter half to feel like a fun poke at all the bad things about the commercialism of the time. Rachel Weisz is along for the ride too, as is Kathy Bates, but it's really nothing more than a movie for Vaughn and if you like his style you will find something to enjoy here. Unfortunately, there's very little else to recommend this seasonal stinker. Outside of Vaughn's rantings the script barely throws up anything decent with the exception of one particularly good scene involving a hilarious support group dealing with a very specific problem. David Dobkin's direction is as mediocre and staid as the 20p Christmas card that you send the auntie you haven't seen in 10 years and he seems to think that simply putting the ingredients together without a good mix or decent care taken will guarantee a delicious Christmas pudding. Nope, we get a burnt, bland lump with too much sugar on top. Forget this and stick the hilarious Elf on again if you want a great, modern Christmas comedy.

The mother of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects is set to travel to the U.S. today with her ex-husband, nearly a week after one of their reign of terror came to an end. Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, who now lives in Dagestan, Russia, said in an emotional telephone interview that she believes her sons, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, have been framed for the bombings. The suspects' father, Anzor Tsarnaev, has already been interviewed by Russian and American authorities there - and will also travel to the U.S. to be interviewed by investigators. Speaking out on Wednesday, Mrs Tsarnaeva launched into a bizarre rant in which she claims she does not care if she or her youngest son are killed by U.S. authorities. while her youngest,","output":"Dzhokhar, remains in custody facing charges of using a weapon of mass destruction, which caused 3 deaths and injured more than 260 people during the April 15 bombings in 2013. The older brother, Tamerlan, was killed in a police shootout on April 19, only days after the tragic attack during the annual iconic race in the heart of Boston. Upon arrival in the United States, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva and Anzor Tsarnaev are expected to face a barrage of questions from the FBI and other law enforcement agencies seeking answers and further insights into the motives behind the attack. Despite the incriminating evidence against their sons, the couple passionately maintains that their children were innocent victims of an elaborate conspiracy by the American government. Throughout the intense media attention surrounding the case, the Tsarnaev family has expressed a variety of controversial opinions and conspiracy theories in an attempt to deflect the blame from their sons. Some family members have even gone so far as to claim that the bombs used in the attack were merely \\"fake\\" and that the entire incident was staged by the US government to justify the increased surveillance and security measures that followed the tragic event. Boston breathed a collective sigh of relief when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the surviving brother, was captured after a massive manhunt that left the city and its surrounding areas in a state of panic for days. His capture provided an opportunity for authorities to uncover more about the motivations, radicalization, and planning behind the heinous act that had torn the city apart. Meanwhile, Tsarnaeva's bizarre rant may spark fear among citizens who worry that the mother of the two suspects might show sympathy for her children's hate-filled actions, despite overwhelming evidence against them. There are also concerns that her presence in the United States could incite further tension and hostility, as the country continues to grapple with its recovery and healing process. As more facts and evidence continue to emerge, the grave implications of the Boston Marathon bombings have had far-reaching effects on not only the victims and their families but also the nation as a whole. It has raised questions about national security, the influence of radical ideologies, and the ability of intelligence agencies to identify potential threats before they can cause harm. In these challenging times, it is up to all individuals, citizens, and government bodies to work collaboratively in maintaining vigilance and fostering understanding between diverse communities. It is only through unity, resilience and a shared sense of purpose that tragedies like these can be prevented in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This statement refers to a comprehensive breakdown of minor planets within a specific range (in this case, 246001 through 247000).  Minor planets, also commonly known as asteroids or small Solar System bodies, are celestial objects that orbit around the Sun. They are smaller than planets, and their classification can include asteroids, dwarf planets, Kuiper Belt objects, trans-Neptunian objects, and centaurs. The majority of these minor planets are situated in the inner Solar System, particularly within the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.  The enumeration of minor planets originates from the Minor Planet Center (MPC), which is part of the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The MPC is responsible for assigning provisional designations to newly discovered minor planets, tracking their orbits, and providing accurate data for researchers and observers.  A list, such as \\"List of minor planets: 246001-247000,\\" would comprise the specific details of each minor planet within that range, offering extensive data on each celestial object. This information could include the following: 1. Provisional and permanent designations: These serve as unique identifiers for minor planets, allowing for easy reference and organization within the scientific community.  2. Discovery date and location: The date and location of each minor planet's discovery provide historical and geographical context for researchers. 3. Discoverer(s): The individual(s) or team responsible for the discovery of a minor planet are credited, recognizing their contributions to the field of astronomy. 4. Orbital characteristics: This encompasses the parameters that define a minor planet's path around the Sun, such as its semi-major axis, eccentricity, orbital period, and inclination. 5. Physical properties: This data covers the dimensions, mass, rotation period, and density of a minor planet, providing vital information for astronomers studying its composition and structure. 6. Absolute magnitude and albedo: These aspects refer to the brightness and the reflection coefficient of a minor planet, allowing for estimations of its size and surface properties.

He explained that pursuing his creative ambitions in Los Angeles had led to a \\"love/hate relationship\\" with the city. Leto told Interview magazine, \\"the song is about people coming to the City of Angels to live their dreams and to make their dreams their reality. It's about how the other people they've met in the city have helped them—you know, a group of people all kind of joining together into a community of outsiders, of mavericks, of freaks, of artists. It's about coming to a place to do something different and something special.\\", what would be the answer ?

Normally, Roman numerals are used to identify each game, rather than the year in which it is held. For example, Super Bowl I was played on January 15, 1967, following the 1966 regular season. The single exception to this rule is Super Bowl 50, which was played on February 7, 2016, following the 2015 regular season. The next game, Super Bowl LI, scheduled for February 5, 2017, will follow the 2016 regular season.  - Jeff Bentrim (born June 21, 1965) was an American football player who played quarterback.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S.  Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs  the highest level  playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities  Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University  consist entirely of chairback seating.)  - Ronald McKinnon ( born September 20 , 1973 ) is a former American football linebacker in the National Football League .

Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world's nations, is celebrated religiously by the vast majority of Christians, as well as culturally by a number of non-Christian people, and is an integral part of the holiday season, while some Christian groups reject the celebration. In several countries, celebrating Christmas Eve on December 24 has the main focus rather than December 25, with gift-giving and sharing a traditional meal with the family.  - A touchdown is a means of scoring in both American and Canadian football.

Sentence 2: Sunlight shone as expectedly upon the world. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"Yes, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is true as well. Both sentences express that sunlight is shining on the world, although they differ in terms of detail and description. The first sentence provides a more detailed and vivid description of the situation. It emphasizes that sunlight is not only shining on the world but doing so normally or as expected. Additionally, the sentence offers more specific elements related to the visual appearance of the sky - gaudy blue - and the fact that the observer can see cracks in the sky that are smoothing out. The mention of the roof implies that the observer is likely situated indoors or under a sheltered area, taking in the scene outside. In contrast, the second sentence conveys similar information but in a much simpler and more concise manner. It states that sunlight is shining on the world, as expected. It does not provide any information about the sky’s appearance or the observer's location. However, the core idea - that sunlight is shining on the world - is present in both sentences.

Examine the first sentence: \\"Even more surprising than how boring this book was is the fact that some people actually loved it.\\" This sentence clearly has a negative tone, as the reviewer is stating that they found the book boring and are surprised that others enjoyed it. 3. Analyze the following sentences: \\"It had absolutely no depth or insight as to motivation, character, or more importantly, the gravity of the holocaust.\\" Again, the statement is negative, as the reviewer believes the book lacked depth, insight, and failed to grasp the importance of its subject matter. 4.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options：  A. get better  B. train  C. battle cancer  D. throw up  E. take medicine The answer is:","output":"D. throw up However, it is important to note that this answer does not encompass all possible reactions or outcomes when a sick person is not treated. Depending on the illness or condition affecting the individual, various symptoms, reactions, or outcomes may occur if no medical treatment is provided. If a sick person is not treated, their condition can manifest itself in many different ways. In the given options, \\"throw up\\" or vomiting is a common response to various illnesses, particularly those involving the gastrointestinal system, such as food poisoning or stomach flu. This reaction serves as a way for the body to expel harmful substances and protect itself from further damage. On the other hand, some individuals may eventually get better (option A) without treatment due to their immune system's ability to fight off infections or illnesses. However, it is essential to seek medical guidance to determine if treatment is necessary or if the body can recover on its own. Option B, \\"train,\\" is not suitable since engaging in physical activity or training is generally not recommended while a person is sick, especially if they are experiencing fever, fatigue, or other symptoms that could be worsened with exertion. Option C, \\"battle cancer,\\" is not an appropriate answer to the question since cancer is a specific illness and requires specialized treatment based on various factors like the type and stage of cancer, overall health, and other considerations. Additionally, not all sick individuals are suffering from cancer. Finally, option E, \\"take medicine,\\" is not a valid response either, as it involves a form of treatment. The question asks what a sick person would do if they are NOT treated. Taking medication would be a treatment option that contradicts the premise of the question.

She said that after she arrived in Tahoe, the two had dinner, and then when the two returned to her room, Cosby gave her “wine and a pill.” “The next morning I woke up and I wasn’t wearing my pajamas,” she said. “And I remember before I passed out that I had been sexually assaulted by this man.” “Before I woke up in the morning, the last thing I remember was Bill Cosby, in a patchwork robe, dropping his robe and getting on top of me.” When asked if she ever confronted the TV star about what happened, she said that she had not, and that Cosby had never broached it with her. “I’ll tell you why I’m doing this,\\" Dickinson said. “Because it’s the right thing to do, and it happened to me, and this is the true story.” Dickinson is the self-proclaimed \\"world's first supermodel\\" who claims to have coined the term during her covergirl heyday in the 70s and 80s. She's remained in the public eye over the past decade by appearing on several reality TV shows, including \\"The Surreal Life,\\" \\"The Janice Dickinson Modelling Agency,\\" and \\"Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew,\\" where she confronted addictions to prescription pills, and plastic surgery. Dickinson is the third accuser to come forward since comedian Hannibal Buress called Cosby a rapist during a stand-up routine in Philadelphia last month. The latest accuser before Dickinson, Joan Tarshis, went public over the weekend. In an essay published Sunday on the Hollywood Elsewhere website and an interview with CNN, Tarshis claimed that Cosby raped her in the autumn 1969, when she was a starstruck 19-year-old aspiring actress. Tarshis claimed Cosby lured her to his bungalow at Universal Studios in Los Angeles, drugged her and then forced her to perform oral sex on him. Tarshis said Cosby attacked her again days later at the Sherry Netherland hotel, after she accompanied him to a performance he gave at The Westbury Music Theater on Long Island. Last week, another woman, Barbara Bowman, published a first-person story in The Washington Post alleging that Cosby raped her in 1985 when she was 17. Bowman's story hit some of the same notes as Tarshis'; she said Cosby drugged her at his New York City brownstone and she recalled coming to \\"in my panties and a man's t-shirt, and Cosby was looming over me.\\" Both Joan Tarshis (l.) and Barbara Bowman have come forward with allegations against Bill Cosby. Cosby has never been criminally charged for any of the alleged sexual assaults. However, he did settle a civil case in 2006 brought by Temple University employee Andrea Constand who originally claimed he drugged and groped her in his mansion. Cosby's lawyer John Schmitt issued a statement that dismissed Tarshis and Bowman's claims as \\"decade-old, discredited\\" allegations. ON A MOBILE DEVICE?

Write an article based on this summary: Just over 18 months ago, the UK's Crown Prosecution Service nailed its colours to the mast over Syria, making clear that fighting in Syria would almost certainly lead to the criminal dock back home.","output":"Title: Criminal Repercussions: A Close Look at the Legal Consequences of Fighting in Syria for UK Citizens Introduction In the past few years, the world has seen an alarming rise in the number of foreign individuals joining various militia and fighting groups in Syria. One of the countries that took a firm stand against such acts is the United Kingdom, with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) stating that British citizens participating in the Syrian conflict will likely face legal consequences upon their return. This article will outline the reasons behind this decision, the legal stance held by the UK, and the potential ramifications faced by those who defy this warning.  The Crown Prosecution Service's Warning In October 2019, the UK's Crown Prosecution Service made a strong statement condemning Britons who participate in the Syrian conflict. According to the CPS, fighting in Syria, regardless of the side taken, is deemed as an offence under UK law. This means that any UK citizen who fights in Syria will be investigated and possibly charged with criminal offences upon returning home.  The announcement solidified the UK's commitment to combating terrorism and maintaining national security – a top priority for the British government. This stance also aligns with the country's efforts to deter young people from being radicalized or recruitment by extremist groups. Legal Implications To understand the legal implications, it is essential to highlight the key legislation targeting those who engage in conflicts abroad. Under the Terrorism Act 2000, it is illegal for British citizens to participate in terrorist-related activities outside the UK. Specifically, Section 5 of the Act criminalizes the preparation or instigation of terrorism abroad, stating that individuals found to have participated in acts of terror in foreign countries may face prosecution. Furthermore, the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019 expands upon the 2000 Act, strengthening the UK's response to the broad range of terrorist threats. This newer legislation has increased penalties for criminal offences related to terrorism and allows for the prosecution of individuals who travel or plan to travel abroad with the intention of joining any terrorist organizations.  Possible Charges While the exact charges applicable to a returned UK citizen would depend on the specifics of their case, common charges could include membership in a proscribed (banned) organization, attending a place used for terrorist training, or involvement in terrorist funding. For instance, if a UK national travelled to Syria to join a group like ISIS (Daesh), they may be charged with membership in a proscribed organization, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment upon conviction. Potential Ramifications The ramifications of these charges and penalties go beyond the legal aspect. There are several social consequences UK citizens must understand if they choose to fight in the Syrian conflict. First, they may face distrust, alienation, and difficulties reintegrating into society. Additionally, they may struggle to find or keep employment, as employers may be hesitant to hire individuals with terrorism-related convictions.  Moreover, those convicted may lose access to social benefits or housing assistance, further complicating their efforts to regain a semblance of a normal life. Furthermore, the individual's friends and family may endure significant emotional distress and become targets of intrusive investigations by security and law enforcement agencies.  Conclusion The UK's Crown Prosecution Service has demonstrated a clear intent to prosecute those who disobey its warning against engaging in any form of conflict in Syria. With the potential risk of lengthy prison sentences and various personal, social, and financial consequences, citizens must weigh these potential costs against their intention to participate in the Syrian conflict. The British government's stance on this matter is strong and unwavering to ensure national security, deter extremist recruitment, and maintain societal harmony. In conclusion, the UK aims to prevent its citizens from participating in the Syrian conflict by implementing clear legal ramifications. The potential consequences of engaging in combat abroad are dire – from criminal charges and imprisonment to societal backlash and the disruption of the individual's life. Therefore, it is imperative that all UK citizens understand the risks involved and take heed of the government's warnings to avoid compounding this already complex and multifaceted global issue."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person whose works are on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario? is inside the article: Since his death, Thomson's work has grown in value and popularity. Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he \\"is the manifestation of the Canadian character\\". Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, \\"Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as the Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind.\\" For Canadian artists Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee, he is a \\"haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity\\".As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was Early Spring, Canoe Lake, which sold in 2009 for CAD2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute., can you guess it ?","output":"Based on the information provided in the article, the last name of the person whose works are on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario is Thomson.

Here is a question about this article: In 1903, Brigham Young Academy was dissolved, and was replaced by two institutions: Brigham Young High School, and Brigham Young University. (The BY High School class of 1907 was ultimately responsible for the famous giant \\"Y\\" that is to this day embedded on a mountain near campus.) The Board elected George H. Brimhall as the new President of BYU. He had not received a high school education until he was forty. Nevertheless, he was an excellent orator and organizer. Under his tenure in 1904 the new Brigham Young University bought 17 acres (69,000 m2) of land from Provo called \\"Temple Hill\\". After some controversy among locals over BYU's purchase of this property, construction began in 1909 on the first building on the current campus, the Karl G. Maeser Memorial. Brimhall also presided over the University during a brief crisis involving the theory of evolution. The religious nature of the school seemed at the time to collide with this scientific theory. Joseph F. Smith, LDS Church president, settled the question for a time by asking that evolution not be taught at the school. A few have described the school at this time as nothing more than a \\"religious seminary\\". However, many of its graduates at this time would go on to great success and become well renowned in their fields. What is the answer to this question: At what age did BYU's elected president in 1904, George H. Brimhall, receive his high school education?","output":"George H. Brimhall, who was elected as the President of Brigham Young University (BYU) in 1904, received his high school education at the age of forty.

From 1961 until his death he worked at the British Museum, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase. Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles. The \\"abiding passion of his life\\" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered Greek vases were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams's crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete. Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in Aqaba, Jordan, where he was working on a British Museum excavation. The Ceramics & Glass group of the Institute of Conservation awards a biennial prize in his honour, recognising his significant contributions in the field of conservation., what would be the answer ?

Background: Shelton was born in Ada, Oklahoma, to Dorothy, a beauty salon owner, and Richard Shelton, a used car salesman. Shelton began singing at an early age and by the age of 12, he was taught how to play the guitar by his uncle. By age 15, he had written his first song. By age 16, he had received a Denbo Diamond Award in his home state. Context: Shelton released his fourth studio album, Pure BS, in early 2007. Unlike with his first three albums, which were produced entirely by Bobby Braddock, Shelton worked with Braddock, Brent Rowan, and Paul Worley as producers for this album. Its first two singles--\\"Don't Make Me\\" and \\"The More I Drink\\"--were both Top 20 hits on the country charts, respectively reaching No.12 and No. 19. Also in late 2007, Shelton made appearances on television shows: first as a judge on the talent competition Nashville Star, and later on Clash of the Choirs.  Pure BS was re-released in 2008 with three bonus tracks, including a cover of Michael Buble's hit single \\"Home\\". This cover, released in early 2008 as the album's third single, became his fourth No.1 hit in July.  \\"Home\\" was followed in August 2008 by the single \\"She Wouldn't Be Gone\\", his 14th chart entry and his fifth No. 1 hit. It was the first time in his career that he had two consecutive number ones. \\"She Wouldn't Be Gone\\" is the lead-off to Shelton's fifth studio album, Startin' Fires, which has also produced the single \\"I'll Just Hold On.\\" This album also includes \\"Bare Skin Rug,\\" a duet with Lambert. It was produced by Scott Hendricks, except for one track which was produced by Brent Rowan, and another (\\"I Don't Care\\", which carried over from Pure BS) was produced by Braddock. After \\"I'll Just Hold On\\" fell off the chart in October 2009, Blake Shelton released a duet with Trace Adkins titled \\"Hillbilly Bone\\". It was the lead single on Shelton's EP, Hillbilly Bone, released on March 2, 2010 through Reprise Records Nashville. After \\"Hillbilly Bone\\" reached No. 1 in February, came the August release of \\"All About Tonight\\", the lead-off single to his EP of the same name. In September, he released the second single from All About Tonight, \\"Who Are You When I'm Not Looking\\", his 18th single release. He released his first greatest hits album, Loaded: The Best of Blake Shelton in November 2010.  Shelton was invited to join the Grand Ole Opry during the September 28, 2010 \\"Country Comes Home\\" concert celebrating reopening of the Grand Ole Opry House after the Cumberland River flooded the Opry House in May 2010. The formal invitation was extended on his Twitter account and was announced by Opry star Trace Adkins. He was formally inducted by Adkins at the October 23, 2010 Opry performance. Shelton recorded the title track for the remake of Footloose released on October 14, 2011. Shelton appeared on the 44th Annual Country Music Awards on November 10, 2010 where he performed \\"All About Tonight\\" and won Male Vocalist of the Year.

How to get a credit card machine  Open a business checking account with the bank of your choice.

Estimate your total annual receipts. Choose from:  +It can be helpful to leave more than one bank account open for your business expense accounting. In this way, you can choose the correct one and complete the balance (and fine print, if necessary) for each transaction..  +In an official merchant account, you should be able to check annual receipts for the period of the credit card expiration-typically four years. You do not have to specify your exact year because it is your business's annual annual income..  +Always check the annual receipts from each paycheck you make. For example, if you make 2 , 000 a month, 5 , 000 a month would be your annual receipts..  +The merchant service provider will use this information to determine if you will be a worthwhile customer. You need not supply the provider with an exact figure; estimating the amount of money you take in is enough.. Answer:","output":"Getting a credit card machine involves several crucial steps and a clear understanding of your business's financial flow. Initially, you need to open a business checking account. This account serves as the primary connector between your business's cash flow and the merchant service provider who will be handling your credit card transactions. This account does not specifically have to be opened in the same bank as your merchant service provider; however, having it in place is needed to accept payments from the merchant service provider. Once the business account is in place, you need to estimate your total annual receipts. Annual receipts represent the total income your business generates in a year, and having an accurate estimate plays an essential role in acquiring a credit card machine. The annual receipts estimation should encompass all business income sources including, sales, services, and other revenue streams. The total annual receipts indicate your business's financial health, and the merchant service provider relies on this information to assess if you will be a potential credible customer. While evaluating total annual receipts, consider your steady revenue sources like your monthly income. For instance, if you make 2,000 a month consistently, you can predict that your annual receipts will be around 24,000. Also, include any additional revenue streams or bonus periods where your profits might spike. It's important to remember that you don't have to give the provider an exact number; an approximation of your business's annual income is sufficient. As a side note, some businesses choose to open more than one bank account for different operational needs. By doing so, they can distribute expenses and funds appropriately, and it also helps in accounting and financial management. However, for the purpose of acquiring a credit card machine, having one business checking account is necessary. A merchant account is defined by the relationship between a business and a merchant service provider. You should be able to review your annual receipts for standard credit card expiration terms, typically four years. This thorough check gives a more comprehensive view of your business's financial standing. Before finalizing anything, always read the fine print associated with setting up a credit card machine. Consider the transaction costs, any hidden costs, the type of cards the machine can accept, and the type of connection (whether it's wired or wireless). Ensure the machine suits your business's needs effectively. In conclusion, there are multiple considerations involved in getting a credit card machine. Studying your finances beforehand and understanding the requirements is the key to smoother transactions in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly.

He is testing how fast metal takes to rust. He rakes 3 pieces of iron one is a cube, and the other is a sheet both weighing the same. It takes the cube almost a week to fully rust but the sheet only takes 2 days. The only difference between the two is that the sheet has more surface area. He tries this again with a cylinder so the surface area is larger than the cube but smaller than the sheet and it takes about 4 days to fully rust.  But I can use this background: When a solid substance is involved in a chemical reaction, only the matter at the surface of the solid is exposed to other reactants. If a solid has more surface area, more of it is exposed and able to react. Therefore, increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate. Look at the hammer and nails pictured in the Figure below . Both are made of iron and will rust when the iron combines with oxygen in the air. However, the nails have a greater surface area, so they will rust faster.  What is an answer for this question: Which will rust faster given they contain the same amount of iron, a sheet or a cylinder? Answer:","output":"Given the background information and the results of Andy's science fair experiment, it can be concluded that the sheet of iron will rust faster than the cylinder, even though they both contain the same amount of iron. The primary factor influencing the rusting process is the surface area of the iron object. The increased surface area allows for more exposure of iron molecules to the environmental factors that cause rust, such as oxygen and moisture. In Andy's experiment, the sheet had a greater surface area compared to the cube and cylinder, which resulted in the sheet rusting completely in just 2 days, while the cylinder took 4 days and the cube took almost a week. As discussed in the background information, the rate of a chemical reaction involving a solid substance, such as rust forming on iron, depends on the extent to which the solid's surface is exposed to other reactants. In the case of iron rusting, the reaction involves iron combining with oxygen in the presence of moisture to form hydrated iron(III) oxide, commonly known as rust. When an iron object has a larger surface area, more of its iron molecules are exposed to oxygen and moisture, allowing the rusting reaction to proceed at a faster rate. Comparing a sheet and a cylinder with the same amount of iron, the sheet has a larger surface area than the cylinder. Therefore, the sheet will rust faster than the cylinder because more of the iron in the sheet is exposed to oxygen and moisture, allowing for a greater number of iron molecules to react and form rust. This conclusion aligns with the results of Andy's science fair experiment, which demonstrated that the iron sheet rusted significantly faster than both the cube and the cylinder due to its larger surface area."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: Cristiano Ronaldo and Gonzalo Higuain each scored twice as Real Madrid beat city rivals Getafe 4-2 on Thursday to move back above Barcelona at the top of the Spanish Primera Liga table. Real Madrid's 10th successive league victory ensured Manuel Pellegrini's side move above Barcelona on goal difference, just 24 hours after the defending champions had gone top with a 2-0 win over Osasuna. Four goals in the opening 37 minutes set the visitors on their way, with Ronaldo opening the scoring in the 13th minute with a superb free-kick. Higuain made it 2-0 just seven minutes later after converting Rafael van der Vaart's pass and he added a third within three minutes after being put through by fellow-Argentine Fernando Gago. That goal was Higuain's 22nd of the season, equalling his tally for the whole of last season. And Ronaldo made it 4-0 for a rampant Real side in the 37th minute -- cutting inside from the right before thundering home a superb shot into the top corner. But Getafe refused to lie down and pulled a goal back almost immediately when former Madrid player Dani Parejo dispossessed goalkeeper Iker Casillas before firing into an empty net. And the home side added a second consolation goal with 10 minutes remaining when Pedro Leon slotted home after Javi Casquero's shot had deflected off Raul Albiol. Meanwhile, Juventus continue to struggle in Italy's Serie A and they slumped to another defeat on Thursday, 3-1 at Napoli -- who moved up to sixth place in the table, one ahead of Juve. The evening started well for Alberto Zaccheroni's side and they took an early lead when defender Giorgio Chiellini nodded home from close range. The home side missed a penalty early in the second half before levelling when Fabio Quagliarella's superb cross from the left was headed home by Marek Hamsik, who had been the guilty party from the spot. Hamsik then set up Quagliarella to put Napoli ahead with 18 minutes remaining and the points were sealed with two minutes left when Ezequiel Lavezzi slotted home. Highlights:","output":"1. Cristiano Ronaldo and Gonzalo Higuain score twice as Real Madrid defeat Getafe 4-2 in the Spanish Primera Liga. 2.

The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction and disappointment with both the service and the overall dining experience at the sushi restaurant. From the beginning, the reviewer acknowledges the good aspects of the restaurant, such as the quality of the sushi and the all-you-can-eat price. However, their experience is marred by the strict enforcement of the restaurant's policy on charging extra for uneaten food, as well as the constant reminders about the policy by the server. The reviewer's frustration is further exacerbated by the server's intrusive behavior, including staring at the reviewer, keeping a close eye on their eating habits, and repeatedly reminding them of the extra charges for leftovers. The reviewer finds this behavior unsettling and uncomfortable, making it difficult to enjoy their meal. Additionally, the reviewer's background as a server and bartender intensifies their dissatisfaction with the treatment they received, as they believe it's not the standard way to treat customers, even those who might not be following the rules perfectly. In conclusion, the sentiment of this review is highly negative due to the poor customer service received, the imposing manner in which the restaurant policy was enforced, and the overall lack of consideration for the dining experience. As a result, the reviewer has no intention of returning to the restaurant and shares their worst sushi experience, leaving a lasting negative impression."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Classically trained in St. Petersburg, Russia before the Bolshevik Revolution, he moved to Berlin and then New York City after the Russian Revolution. In 1929, after the stock market crash, he moved to Hollywood, where he became best known for his scores for Western films, including Duel in the Sun, Red River, High Noon, The Big Sky, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, and Last Train from Gun Hill. Tiomkin received twenty-two Academy Award nominations and won four Oscars, three for Best Original Score for High Noon, The High and the Mighty, and The Old Man and the Sea, and one for Best Original Song for \\"The Ballad of High Noon\\" from the former film. Following his work for Fred Zinnemann on The Men (1950), Tiomkin composed the score for the same director's High Noon (1952). His theme song was \\"Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin'\\" (\\"The Ballad of High Noon\\"). At its opening preview to the press, the film, which starred Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly, did badly. Tiomkin writes that \\"film experts agreed that the picture was a flat failure... The producers hesitated to release the picture.\\" Tiomkin bought the rights to the song and released it as a single for the popular music market, with singer Frankie Laine. The record became an immediate success worldwide. Based on the song's popularity, the studio released the film four months later, with the words sung by country western star Tex Ritter. The film received seven Academy Award nominations and won four awards, including two for Tiomkin: Best Original Music and Best Song. Walt Disney presented him with both awards that evening.  According to film historian Arthur R. Jarvis, Jr., the score \\"has been credited with saving the movie.\\" Another music expert, Mervyn Cooke, agrees, adding that \\"the song's spectacular success was partly responsible for changing the course of film-music history\\". Tiomkin was the second composer to receive two Oscars (score and song) for the same dramatic film. (The first was Leigh Harline, who won Best Original Score for Disney's Pinocchio and Best Song for \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\". Ned Washington wrote its lyrics as he did for \\"Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin\\".)  The song's lyrics briefly tell High Noon's entire story arc, a tale of cowardice and conformity in a small Western town. Tiomkin composed his entire score around this single western-style ballad. He also eliminated violins from the ensemble. He added a subtle harmonica in the background, to give the film a \\"rustic, deglamorized sound that suits the anti-heroic sentiments\\" expressed by the story.  According to Russian film historian Harlow Robinson, building the score around a single folk tune was typical of many Russian classical composers. Robinson adds that the source of Tiomkin's score, if indeed folk, has not been proven. However, the Encyclopedia of Modern Jewish Culture, on page 124, states: \\"The fifty-year period in the USA between 1914, the start of the First World War and the year of Irving Berlin's first full score, Watch Your Step, and 1964, the premiere of Boek and Hamick's Fiddler on the Roof, is informed by a rich musical legacy from Yiddish folk tunes (for example Mark Warshavsky's \\"Di milners trem,\\" The miller's tears: and Dimitri Tiomkin's \\"Do Not Forsake Me.\\" High Noon)...\\" The composer worked again for Zinnemann on The Sundowners (1960).  Tiomkin won two more Oscars in subsequent years: for The High and the Mighty (1954), directed by William A. Wellman, and featuring John Wayne; and The Old Man and the Sea (1958), adapted from an Ernest Hemingway novel. During the 1955 ceremonies, Tiomkin thanked all of the earlier composers who had influenced him, including Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and other names from the European classical tradition.

However, a Chanel nail polish was definitely attainable. Whilst they are ridiculously expensive compared with most other nail polishes (AU39), they are still much more affordable than the AU1,000,000,000 a handbag costs (or so I estimate as I have never actually priced one). After seeing swatches of Peridot online, I knew that baby would one day be mine. The other two polishes in the collection - Quartz and Graphite - did not excite me the way Peridot did. That was until I read this review of Graphite on the Polish Police. Suddenly, Graphite was on my radar. It was stuck in my head like an ear worm; another baby, soon to be adopted. I argued with myself for about a month on whether to get these polishes or not. Could I really spend nearly 80 on nail polish. It did seem rather excessive to me. Then, Myers sent me a 10 voucher for my birthday and I got a 30 voucher for doing a survey so the decision was made. For 38 of my own money (less than the cost of two OPI's!) I became the proud owner of Peridot and Graphite. Here is my review of Graphite. Graphite is the most stunningly intriguing nail polish I have ever owned. In the bottle it looks a little bit dull and boring - grey and bland. But on the nail it is completely different. In some lights it is silvery, others a more gun metal grey, and in others it has almost a goldish tone to it. It is super sparkly, yet is not a glitter polish - though in saying that it appears more glitter than shimmer. It is quite opaque. Two coats and you can't see the nail line.

LIEBEFELD, Switzerland -- In August 1998, as famine reached a terrible climax in North Korea, the destitute Asian nation enrolled a shy teenager in a Swiss state school. He arrived with a fake name, a collection of genuine, top-of-the-line Nike sneakers and a passion for American basketball.      \\"We only dreamed about having such shoes. He was wearing them,\\" recalled Nikola Kovacevic, a former schoolmate of the curiously well-heeled North Korean. Each pair, estimates Kovacevic, cost more than 200 -- at least four times the average monthly salary in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, where perhaps 1 million people died as a result of food shortages in the mid- and late 1990s.      Today, the student -- who vanished from this sleepy Swiss district as mysteriously as he appeared -- is a key figure in a puzzle that U.S. and Asian intelligence services are scrambling to solve: Who will lead nuclear-armed North Korea -- and where to -- once its gravely ill leader, Kim Jong Il, passes from the scene?      The answer is of vital importance to Washington, which has about 25,000 troops in South Korea, on guard against any resumption of a conflict frozen -- but never formally ended -- by a Korean War armistice accord in 1953. Who rules North Korea will decide whether Seoul, Tokyo and perhaps even Hawaii risk attack from a nation that has tested two nuclear devices, the most recent in May, and built up an arsenal of missiles and long-range artillery. The Pentagon has sent missile-defense systems to Hawaii just in case. North Korea marked July 4 this year by test-firing seven more rockets.      North Korea shrouds the biographies of its rulers and their offspring in a fog of fiction and silence. \\"It is pretty amazing how very little real information we have,\\" said Victor Cha, who served as a Korea expert on the National Security Council in the Bush administration.      A rare insight into this sealed world is offered by Swiss recollections of the young North Korean who, from 1998 until late 2000, lived here in Liebefeld at No. 10 Kirchstrasse, a sedate suburban street with two pizza joints, a Credit Suisse bank and a Coop supermarket. He was around 17 when he abruptly left in the middle of the school year, apparently to return to Pyongyang.      There are many signs that he may now be the next leader of North Korea -- 26-year-old Kim Jong Un, the third and youngest son of Kim Jong Il.      Known as \\"Pak Un\\" to his teachers at Liebefeld-Steinh√∂lzli Schule, a German-speaking state school, he was registered with Swiss authorities as the son of an employee at North Korea's embassy in the nearby city of Bern, Switzerland's capital, according to Ueli Studer, director of education in the local administration.      Throughout Pak Un's time in Liebefeld, however, neither friends nor teachers ever met the parents. \\"I never saw his father or mother,\\" said the school's principal, Peter Burri, recalling how they repeatedly failed to show up for parents' night. Attending in their place, Burri said, were assorted North Koreans who apologized for the parents' absence and said this was due to their inability to speak German.      A more likely reason: The boy's father didn't work in Bern at the embassy but was more than 5,000 miles away in Pyongyang.      Maria Micaelo, the mother of one of Pak Un's closest school friends, said the North Korean teenager once confided to her son, Joao, that his father was the leader of North Korea. She recalled that she dismissed the claim as a fanciful teenage boast, but had second thoughts when her son saw pictures of Kim Jong Il on television and told her that he'd seen the same man in a photograph with Pak Un. Joao Micaelo, now a cook in Vienna, did not respond to repeated e-mail messages seeking comment.      Kongdan Oh Hassig, an expert on North Korea at the Alexandria-based Institute for Defense Analyses, which does research for the Pentagon, says Pak Un certainly appears to be Kim Jong Il's third son, Kim Jong Un, adding that members of North Korea's elite usually use bogus names outside their homeland. Pak is a very common Korean surname akin to Smith. ||||| International      Who Is Kim Jong Un? Who Really Knows?      It's been two years since Kim Jong Un effectively became North Korea's \\"Great Successor\\" and heir to the seat of power in the communist nation run by a family dynasty — a dynasty that began with his grandfather, Kim Il Sung (the \\"Great Leader\\") and continued with his father, Kim Jong Il (the \\"Dear Leader\\").      i i hand-out / AFP/Getty Images hand-out / AFP/Getty Images      But in that time about the only new thing we know is that he's two years older and now thought to be in his late 20s. And, that he appears about to become at least the titular head of an impoverished nation that threatens its richer neighbor to the south with nuclear weapons      Other than that, you could pretty much reread this 2009 report from NPR's Anthony Kuhn, this 2010 story from NPR's Corey Flintoff and any number of other such stories from those years and be up to speed about Kim Jong Un. Still, with Saturday's death of his father, the world is watching anxiously to see what happens in North Korea and hoping to learn more about this Great Successor.      So, here is some biographical material about North Korea's latest mystery man. Note: Because so much of what we've heard from North Korea about its leaders in the past has obviously been fantastical (such as Kim Jong Il's ability to control the weather), everything that's been reported about Kim Jong Un has to be viewed skeptically:      — \\"Jong Un is believed to have been educated in Switzerland, where he learned to ski, and to speak English, French and German.\\" (From Anthony's 2009 report.)      — \\"Analysts believe he is Kim Jong Il's son by his third wife (or consort — their marital status is unclear), a dancer named Ko Hyong Hui. ... He reportedly was disguised as the son of a North Korean embassy employee while in Berne, attending the school under a fake name. Former classmates have said he liked skiing and basketball, and idolized hoops star Michael Jordan.\\" (From Corey's 2010 report.)      — He is \\"said to have a fondness for James Bond and Hollywood tough guy Jean-Claude Van Damme. He is rumored to be married but there has never been any official word. ... [North Korean officials say] he graduated from Kim Il Sung Military University and in the fall of 2010, he was made a four-star general. ... He also received two key political posts — membership on the Central Committee of the party, and a vice chairmanship of the party's Central Military Committee, which had been overseen by his father. The anointed heir was given the titles of 'Young General' and 'Great Comrade.' \\" (Canada's CTV News.)      — \\"He was always said to be his father's favorite, particularly after his older half brother, Kim Jong Nam, became something of an embarrassment by famously turning up in Japan in 2001 on a phony passport and asking to visit Tokyo Disneyland.\\" (Time magazine.)      — Last year's two attacks from the North on targets in South Korea, \\"sinking a warship and shelling an island,\\" have been \\"widely regarded as linked to Kim Jong Un's rise: the 'young general' showing his mettle.\\" (BBC News)      — Kim Jong Un was quickly named \\"first in the membership list of the ... 232-member funeral commission\\" that will oversee his father's burial later this month. \\"That could also be seen as a possible sign that the communist nation is under control.\\" (South Korea's Yonhap News.)      We'll keep our eye out for more about him.      Update at 4:11 p.m. ET. The View From A Former Intelligence Officer:      NPR's Robert Siegel spoke to the author of the Inspector O detective series, a former Western intelligence officer who goes by the pen name James Church. His series of books are based in North Korea.      Church told Robert that we \\"know very little about Jong Un. \\"We only began to know of his existence a few years ago,\\" after his brother was push aside 10 years ago.      Church says one detail he thinks holds promise is Jong Un's studies in Switzerland.      \\"I think it's a clue to something and I don't think people focused on it enough,\\" he said.      But Church said it may not be what kind of impact the studies had Jong Un's worldview that interest him, but why his father wanted to send him to a Western school. It might imply something about where Kim Jong Il saw the country going in his absence, said Church.      Much more of Robert's talk with Church is on tonight's All Things Considered.

Kim Jong-il, North Korea's \\"Dear Leader\\", was in the process of grooming him as his successor when he died in December 2011.      Immediately after his father's death, the younger Kim was hailed as \\"the great successor\\". He was named head of the party, state and army within a fortnight of his father's death.      Since then, he has shown he is committed to the advancement of North Korea's weapons programme, ordering four nuclear tests and several missile tests.      He has also shown himself to be ruthless with the purge of his powerful uncle and the murder, widely attributed to an order from him, of his half-brother.      'Morning Star King'      Kim Jong-un, the youngest son of Kim Jong-il and his third wife Ko Yong-hui, was born in 1983 or 1984.      Image copyright AFP Image caption The undated image shows Kim Jong-un as a student in Switzerland      He was initially not thought to be in the frame to take up his father's mantle. Analysts focused instead on his older half-brother Kim Jong-nam and older full brother Kim Jong-chol.      However Kim Jong-nam's deportation from Japan in May 2001 and middle brother Kim Jong-chol's reported \\"unmanliness\\" improved his chances.      Analysts saw him as the coming man after he was awarded a series of high-profile political posts.      Swiss-educated like his brothers, Kim Jong-un avoided Western influences, returning home when not in school and dining out with the North Korean ambassador.      After his return to Pyongyang, he is known to have attended the Kim Il-sung Military University.      His mother was thought to be Kim Jong-il's favourite wife, and she clearly doted on her son, reportedly calling him the \\"Morning Star King\\".      In August 2010, when Kim Jong-il visited China, one report said Kim Jong-un had accompanied his father on the trip. By then he was widely seen as the heir-apparent and when Kim Jong-il died, this was quickly confirmed.      Military-first      Mr Kim made his first public speech as North Korea marked the 100th anniversary of the birthday of founder Kim Il-sung on 15 April 2012, praising the \\"military first\\" doctrine and vowing the time his nation could be threatened was \\"forever over\\".      Image copyright KCNA Image caption State media showed Kim Jong-un in a celebratory mood following the launch of a ballistic missile in July 2017      Image copyright KCNA Image caption Factory inspections are the mainstay of the North Korean leader's domestic media appearances      Under him, the development of North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes has continued and appears to have made rapid strides. Four more nuclear tests have taken place, bringing the regime's total to six.      Pyongyang claims it has successfully tested a miniaturised hydrogen bomb that could be loaded on to a long-range missile, but experts remain divided on how advanced its programme is.      The reach of North Korea's missiles also appears to have increased. In 2017 the regime test-fired several missiles, and claimed it had tested intercontinental ballistic missiles that could reach the US - leading to a surge in tensions with the Donald Trump-led administration and an intensified UN sanctions regime.      As the animosity between the two sides rose, Mr Trump and Mr Kim engaged in an increasingly fiery war of words.      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies?      Mr Trump called the North Korean leader a \\"rocket man on a suicide mission\\" while Mr Kim called the US leader a \\"mentally deranged US dotard\\".      Yet, unexpectedly, Mr Kim offered an olive branch to South Korea in his new year's address, saying he was \\"open to dialogue\\" and might send a team to the February 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea.      A flurry of diplomatic activity followed, with the two Koreas marching under one flag in the Olympic opening ceremony, and high-level meetings taking place between the two sides.      Two milestone meetings have now been planned: a summit between Mr Kim and his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in in late April, and a face to face meeting between Mr Kim and Mr Trump in May - the first of its kind between sitting US and North Korean leaders.      Ahead of the two summits, Mr Kim made his first known foreign trip as leader. He took a train to Beijing - North Korea's main ally and trading partner.      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Chinese TV showed footage of the two leaders with their wives      In April, Kim Jong-un said he had suspended all missile tests and would shut down a nuclear test site, because his country had achieved \\"nuclear weaponisation\\".      Although the halt was welcomed internationally, observers pointed out that Pyongyang had not pledged to get rid of its existing weapons, and has previously broken promises to halt nuclear development.      Meet the Kims      Image copyright AFP Image caption Mr Kim and Ms Ri are thought to have three children      Domestically, Mr Kim's repeated replacement of defence ministers - there have been at least six men in the post since 2011 - has been seen by some analysts as an indication of his lack of confidence in the loyalty of the armed forces.      And the most high-profile indication of a possible power struggle within the North Korean elite came in December 2013, when Kim Jong-un ordered the execution of his uncle Chang Song-thaek. State media said he had been plotting a coup.      Mr Kim is also widely believed to have ordered the murder of his exiled half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, in February 2017 at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.      Not much was known of Mr Kim's personal life until television footage of an unidentified woman attending events with him surfaced. In July 2012, state media announced that Mr Kim was married to \\"Comrade Ri Sol-ju\\".      Image copyright AFP Image caption Kim Yo-jong, Mr Kim's sister, holds a senior post in the Workers' Party of Korea      Little is known of Ms Ri, but her stylish appearance led some analysts to suggest that she was from an upper-class family. Reports have suggested that Ms Ri may have been a singer who caught Mr Kim's attention during a performance.      According to South Korean intelligence, the couple have three children.      Mr Kim's sister, Kim Yo-jong, holds a senior post in the Workers' Party of Korea - and stole the limelight when she represented her brother at the Winter Olympics in the South. It is not known whether his elder brother, Kim Jong-chol, holds an official role. ||||| CTVNews.ca Staff      Like so much about North Korea, the man expected to lead the country next, Kim Jong Un, is a mystery. So little is known about the younger Kim, both within his home country and by the outside world, even his age appears to be a state-guarded secret.      Since his father's death was announced Monday, North Korean state media has fallen short of calling Kim Jong Un the country's next leader. But they are making it clear that Kim Jong Il's son will succeed his father, lauding him as the \\"Great Successor,\\" and \\"the outstanding leader of our party, army and people.\\"      North Korea's official KCNA news agency said that while North Koreans from all walks of life were in utter despair over the death of their leader, they were finding comfort in the \\"absolute surety that the leadership of Comrade Kim Jong Un will lead and succeed the great task of revolutionary enterprise.\\"      Much of what is known about the younger Kim has been gleaned in only the last three years, because before Kim Jong Il suffered what is believed to be a stroke in August 2008, he had never been seen in public before.      It's believed the new, chubby-faced leader is in his late 20s and was educated at an English-language school in Switzerland. He speaks some English, as well as some German and French, and is said to have a fondness for James Bond and Hollywood tough guy Jean-Claude Van Damme. He is rumoured to be married but there has never been any official word.      But what role Kim Jong Un has played in preparing to take over his country's leadership is unknown; there isn't even a record that he has served in his country's military.      Nevertheless, the country insists he graduated from Kim Il Sung Military University and in the fall of 2010, he was made a four-star general. That occurred during a meeting of the ruling Workers' Party -- the first time Jong Un had ever appeared publicly.      At that same meeting, he also received two key political posts — membership on the Central Committee of the party, and a vice chairmanship of the party's Central Military Committee, which had been overseen by his father.      The anointed heir was given the titles of \\"Young General\\" and \\"Great Comrade,\\" and began appearing in public alongside his father as they toured North Korea's factories and military facilities and voted in elections.      Since then, the country has pushed forward an image of Jong Un as destined to follow in both his father's footsteps, and the footsteps of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, who founded North Korea in 1948.      But Jong Un has not had the years of grooming for leadership that his own father enjoyed before he took over the impoverished country in 1994.      By then, Jong Il had a full two decades to prepare for leadership. He had even taken part in a number of military moves against the North's hated neighbour to the South, including masterminding a 1983 bombing that killed 17 South Korean officials visiting Burma, and the 1987 bombing of a Korean Air Flight that killed all 115 on board.      By contrast, Kim Jong Un has had but a handful of years to adjust. Nevertheless, state-run media have worked to build a cult of personality around Kim Jong Un, just as they did for his father.      Shortly after he was given the titles of \\"Young General\\" and \\"Great Comrade,\\" Jong Un was credited with directing the surprise shelling of South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island last December.      It's not clear why Kim Jong Il chose his youngest son to succeed him, since he has two other sons. It's said that his eldest, Kim Jong-nam, lost any hope for power in 2001, when he embarrassed his father by trying to enter Japan with his family on fake passports for a trip to Japan's Disneyland.      His middle son, Kim Jong-chol, also attended school in Switzerland and was said to be a fan of Michael Jordan, Eric Clapton and Keanu Reeves. But his father reportedly dismissed his chances for leadership because he thought him too \\"girlish.\\"      As Jong Un moves into his new role, he is expected to have the guardianship of his aunt, his father's only sister, Kim Kyong hui, 64. She was promoted to general in 2010, while her husband, Jang Song thaek, is seen as the country's unofficial No. 2 leader.      Jang was a rising star among the country's leadership until he was demoted by Jong Il as a strike against his perceived grasp at power. But Jong Il turned to him again after he became ill in 2008 and it is thought that Jang still wields plenty of power in Pyongyang.      It's possible that over the next few months or years, Jong Un might act as a figurehead for a government led by his older relatives, some analysts believe. How he will eventually transition out of that remains to be seen. ||||| By Andreas Lorenz      North Korean leader Kim Jong Il has died of a heart attack and his son Kim Jong Un is set to take the helm, according to state media. But who is the young man dubbed the \\"Great Successor\\" and how will he lead the reclusive nation?      The death of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il on Saturday has propelled the region into deep uncertainty. The \\"Dear Leader\\" died of a heart attack during a train ride, state television reported early on Monday morning. The big question now is: Who will succeed the late ruler?      The official news agency KCNA sent a clear signal on Monday, naming the North Korean ruler's son Kim Jong Un as \\"the Great Successor.\\" It wrote that \\"Kim Jong Un is now at the head of the Korean revolution.\\"      Kim Jong Un topped the list of officials who will lead the funeral, seen as a big hint as to who will take the reins of the state. KCNA said the funeral will take place in Pyongyang on Dec. 28, with the mourning period lasting until Dec. 29.      \\"We will prevail in our revolution today and tomorrow, because we have comrade Kim Jong Un,\\" KCNA quoted a resident of Pyongyang as saying.      Little is known about the leader's youngest son. His mother, Kim Jong Il's third wife, was a dancer who was born in Japan. She died of cancer in 2004. Jong Un is probably 29 years old and studied in Bern, Switzerland under a false name from 1998 to 2000. After class, he was reportedly always whisked away into the custody of the North Korean embassy.      Back in North Korea, his father sent him to a military academy between 2002 and 2007, where he was allegedly trained as an artilleryman. He is later said to have worked in the \\"Leadership Section\\" of the party which manages all senior members' files. Some North Korean experts suspect he spent a brief stint working for the intelligence service. He has been general of the North Korean army for a year and is a member of the powerful National Defense Commission.      A Fearless Personality      Now he will continue the family dynasty, but no one knows what he and his entourage stand for or what his leadership will mean for the hermit state. Jong Un has no foreign policy experience, but may have spent some time in China. His father reportedly introduced him to the Beijing leadership.      Will Kim the third seek reconciliation with South Korea or blackmail the world with nuclear bombs? Will he start opening his closed country, à la Gorbachev, or continue to run the planned economy with a grotesque personality cult, following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather Kim Il Sung?      Kim Jong Il's former Japanese chef Kenji Fujimoto wrote in his memoir that the leader-to-be is both ambitious and tough. He also resembles his father in appearance, shape and personality, he wrote.      A year before his death, the elder Kim tried to get his house in order by placing relatives and confidantes in key positions in the party and the army. Kim wanted to ensure that the powerful army rallies behind his son, thus safeguarding his family's grip on power, at least for now. Kim's sister Kim Kyong Hui, 65, formerly responsible for light industry, became the first woman to rise to the rank of four-star general and join the Politburo.      The Purity of Korean People      Other relatives and comrades will also act as mentors for the young man: Kyong Hui's husband Chang Sung Taek is expected to advise the new leader. Korean refugees have described Chang, a senior member of the National Defense Commission, as \\"number two\\" in the party.      Family members will also pull strings behind the scenes. The deceased leader's fourth wife and a daughter from his first marriage will both likely exert influence. Meanwhile, one of his confidants has been recently appointed Vice-Marshal.      Kim's clan has operated a strict planned economy and forged a unique ideology, which hinges on quasi-religious notions of the purity of the Korean people rather than Marxism. In North Korea, a holy family prevails over a childlike people, protecting it from dangerous outside influences.      They derive their legitimacy from Kim's family history. The ascendant leader's grandfather Kim Il Sung founded the \\"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\\" with Stalin's help in 1948. Since then the family has adorned their dictatorship with legends and mysteries: the country's fate is closely linked to the holy mountain of Mount Baekdu, seen as the crib of their ancestry. Koreans' survival allegedly hinges on the continuation of the revolutionary family's bloodline, a belief which is taught to North Korean children in kindergarten.      During a battle against the Japanese in 1942, Kim Jong Il reportedly saw the light of the world in a guerrilla camp on Mount Baekdu. The legend goes that he saw a double rainbow in the sky. Kim Jong Il, who began his rule in 1994, is still seen as the \\"Eternal President,\\" ruling his subjects from beyond the grave. It remains to be seen how his legacy will be steered into the future. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Kim Jong-un, the youngest son of Kim Jong-il and his third wife Ko Yong-hui, was born in the early 1980s and was initially not considered as a contender for taking up his father's position.

Biles, described by many as the greatest ever gymnast, had arrived in Rio as the overwhelming favourite for gold and the 4ft 8in athlete delivered in a big way. Having already led the United States to victory in the team event, she turned the spotlight on her individual brilliance with a dazzling display of power, agility and gravity-defying moves. She went ahead after the first of four disciplines with a score of 15.866 on vault, although she dropped back to second with 14.966 on the uneven bars, with Mustafina taking the lead at the halfway point. Biles then turned on the style with an acrobatic beam routine that included a stunning spin to score 15.433 before a floor routine to samba music packed with energetic tumbles, including the move that bears her name. She scored 15.933 for that final routine and burst into tears when the victory was confirmed. The United States have now won this event four times in a row, following victories by Carly Patterson in 2004, Nastia Liukin in 2008 and Gabrielle Douglas in 2012. Biles has more chances for success in Rio as she is also in the vault final on Sunday, the beam final on Monday and the floor final on Tuesday. Britain's Max Whitlock had won a bronze medal in the men's event on Wednesday, but Downie's medal hopes ended with a poor score on her third apparatus, the uneven bars, before she made another error on beam. Find out how to get into gymnastics with our special guide. Those mistakes saw her drop down from seventh to 13th, to miss out on emulating her sister Becky Downie, who came 12th in the all-around final at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. Seventeen-year-old Ellie Downie, the winner of the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year award in 2015, gained a total of 56.883 after scores of 14.300 on floor, 15.100 on vault, 13.783 on uneven bars and 13.700 on beam. Gold medallist Simone Biles said: \\"I'm very excited and relieved, I've finally done it. You never know the feeling until it hits you. \\"I'm not the next Usain Bolt or Michael Phelps, I'm the first Simone Biles. To me I'm just the same Simone.\\" Silver-medallist Alexandra Raisman added: \\"No-one goes into this thinking they can beat Simone. \\"I'm sure most people don't go into it thinking they can beat Usain Bolt, so it's kind of the same thing. \\"We are like sisters. I told her before today, I want you to win and I want second.\\" Great Britain's Ellie Downie said: \\"I was really happy with how floor and vault went. On bars I lost a bit of concentration, which is something I'll learn from. \\"On beam I didn't feel nervous and the actual routine was really good but the landing I needed to focus more. \\"It's mixed emotions knowing if I had gone clean I had a chance of a medal, which shows I'm right up there. That's a big positive to take out of these Games. \\"It's been a bit of a rollercoaster experience but I'm very proud of what I've achieved.\\" Subscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.","output":"American gymnast Simone Biles secured the women's all-around Olympic gold medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics after an impressive performance that pushed her more than two points ahead of her competitors.

Answer a question about this article: In each case, cables are attached to a hitch plate on top of the cab or may be \\"underslung\\" below a cab, and then looped over the drive sheave to a counterweight attached to the opposite end of the cables which reduces the amount of power needed to move the cab. The counterweight is located in the hoist-way and rides a separate railway system; as the car goes up, the counterweight goes down, and vice versa. This action is powered by the traction machine which is directed by the controller, typically a relay logic or computerized device that directs starting, acceleration, deceleration and stopping of the elevator cab. The weight of the counterweight is typically equal to the weight of the elevator cab plus 40-50% of the capacity of the elevator. The grooves in the drive sheave are specially designed to prevent the cables from slipping. \\"Traction\\" is provided to the ropes by the grip of the grooves in the sheave, thereby the name. As the ropes age and the traction grooves wear, some traction is lost and the ropes must be replaced and the sheave repaired or replaced. Sheave and rope wear may be significantly reduced by ensuring that all ropes have equal tension, thus sharing the load evenly. Rope tension equalization may be achieved using a rope tension gauge, and is a simple way to extend the lifetime of the sheaves and ropes. The counterweight runs equal to the cab weight plus what percentage of the elevator capacity?","output":"The counterweight runs equal to the cab weight plus 40-50% of the elevator capacity. This balance helps reduce the amount of power needed to move the elevator cab, as the counterweight moves in the opposite direction of the cab when it is in operation (i.e., when the cab goes up, the counterweight goes down, and vice versa). By having the counterweight's weight set to approximately the weight of the cab plus a percentage of its capacity, the system can optimize its performance and efficiently transfer the forces generated during the cab's movement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And the answer is?","output":"Epistaxis, a medical term that might seem unfamiliar to many, is more commonly known as a \\"nosebleed.\\" Nosebleeds can manifest in individuals of any age and are a relatively frequent occurrence. There are two types of nosebleeds: anterior and posterior. Anterior nosebleeds are the most common and typically originate in the lower part of the nasal septum, which is the cartilage dividing the two nostrils. This area contains many delicate blood vessels that can be easily damaged, leading to a nosebleed. Common causes for such damage include dry air, nose picking, and nasal irritation from allergies, colds, or sinus infections. Posterior nosebleeds, on the other hand, are less common and tend to affect older individuals or those with high blood pressure. These nosebleeds arise in the deeper parts of the nasal cavity and are generally more severe, often requiring medical attention. Several factors can contribute to the occurrence of nosebleeds. Some of these factors are environmental, such as exposure to dry air or extremely cold temperatures, while others are lifestyle-related, such as the use of nasal decongestants or antihistamines, smoking, or alcohol consumption. Furthermore, certain medical conditions and treatments, like blood thinners, can increase the risk of nosebleeds. While most nosebleeds are harmless and can be managed at home by pinching the nostrils together and leaning slightly forward, it is crucial to seek medical help if the bleeding is excessive or persistent, or if it's accompanied by additional symptoms like difficulty breathing, dizziness, or pain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

From 2010 to 2012, he was president of The King's College, a Christian school in New York City. Born in Bombay, D'Souza came to the United States as an exchange student and graduated from Dartmouth College. He became a naturalized citizen in 1991. On July 25, 2016, D'Souza released the documentary film Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party. The film criticizes the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton, the presumptive (and ultimate) Democratic nominee for President of the United States in 2016.  The film was universally panned by professional film critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 4%, based on 27 professional reviews, with an average rating of 1.7/10. The critics consensus on the site reads, \\"Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party finds Dinesh D'Souza once again preaching to the right-wing choir--albeit less effectively than ever.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a score of 2 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \\"overwhelming dislike\\". The film has the fifth lowest score of all films on the site. Peter Sobczynski wrote, \\"Hillary's America may well be the single dumbest documentary that I have ever seen in my life.\\" A July 2016 review in Variety characterized D'Souza as \\"a right-wing conspiracy wingnut, the kind of \\"thinker\\" who takes off from Barack Obama birther theories and just keeps going, spinning out a web of comic-book liberal evil.\\"  Other critics and figures viewed the film positively. John Fund of the National Review stated that \\"[the film] is over the top in places and definitely selective, but the troubling facts are accurate and extensively documented in the D'Souza book that accompanies the movie.\\" He also called the film \\"intensely patriotic\\". On July 23, 2016, Donald Trump, who was then running as the Republican presidential nominee against Clinton, called on supporters to see the film.  On January 23, 2017 the film was nominated for five Razzies including: Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Dinesh D'Souza), Worst Actress (Becky Turner), Worst Director (Dinesh D'Souza and Bruce Schooley), and Worst Screenplay.

The management of Rockefeller Center shifted around this time. In November 1936, John Todd was featured in two New Yorker articles that emphasized his role in the complex's construction. At the same time, Nelson was gaining clout within Rockefeller Center Inc., and he disagreed with nearly all of Todd's suggestions. Nelson's father, John, was relinquishing his responsibilities, since the Rockefeller family's youngest son David had moved out of the family home at 10 West 54th Street, and John was now focusing on his own personal life. By April 1937, Todd regretted his decision to be featured in The New Yorker. In March 1938, Nelson became the president of Rockefeller Center Inc. He then fired Todd as the complex's manager and appointed Hugh Robertson in his place. Nelson and Robertson wanted to avoid workers' strikes, which would delay the completion of construction. Nelson, Robertson, and the workers' unions agreed to a contract in which the unions would not strike, Robertson would not lock out union workers, and both would agree to arbitration if a labor dispute arose.

Answer:","output":"The Carl Albert Congressional Research and Studies Center is located in Norman, Oklahoma, which is a city in the United States. To formulate an answer to the question of how many inhabitants were living in Norman, Oklahoma, in 2015, we must turn to historical population data. According to the United States Census Bureau, the population of Norman, Oklahoma, in 2015 was approximately 120,284 inhabitants. This figure is based on census data and population estimates that are produced by the Census Bureau to provide annual growth data between decennial censuses. It is crucial to be aware that the population of a city is fluid and changes over time due to various factors, such as births, deaths, and migration patterns. Therefore, while the population of Norman, Oklahoma, was 120,284 in 2015, it has likely changed since then. The Carl Albert Congressional Research and Studies Center, as an institution, is a part of the University of Oklahoma and was established in 1979. It is named after the late Carl Albert, who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Oklahoma, and as the Speaker of the House from 1971 to 1977. The Center is a non-partisan learning facility that focuses on contributing to the understanding of Congress, its members, and the legislative process. It also hosts several programs and resources, including a significant collection of historical Congressional papers. The city of Norman, where the center is located, is the third-largest city in Oklahoma and is part of the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Area. It is home to the University of Oklahoma, which is one of the leading public research universities in the state. Norman has a vibrant and diverse community, thanks in part to the university's significant influence. This city also enjoys various cultural events, recreational activities, and educational opportunities, making it a great place for residents and visitors alike. In conclusion, the Carl Albert Congressional Research and Studies Center is located in Norman, Oklahoma, which had a population of around 120,284 inhabitants in 2015, according to the United States Census Bureau. The center is an essential institution for the study of the U.S. Congress and legislative processes and is situated in a thriving city that offers a host of diverse experiences for its residents and visitors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He amassed  a fortune of 1.3 billion dollars during his career but instead of keeping the money and living like an emperor, he decided to give it all away. All of his fortune will be spent on helping poor Chinese students get a better education. And Yu isn't the only super-rich person in China who has this spirit of giving. Chen Guangbiao, a Jiangsu recycling tycoon, has given millions of dollars to charity  and promises to give all of his money to charity when he dies.    Yu and Chen are among the many businessmen who have become prosperous during China's economic rise. An American business magazine, Forbes, estimates that there are 117 billionaires in China and hundreds of thousands of millionaires. What sets Yu and Chen apart from the rest, though, is their tremendous generosity(,) when it comes to donating money to charity.    Last week Bill Gates and Warren Buffett came to Beijing. Gates and Buffett, two of the world's richest men, are also the world's biggest philanthropists. They invited fifty of China's richest people to have dinner with them and talk about the spirit of giving. At first, only a few people accepted their invitation. It seemed some of the invited guests were afraid that Buffett and Gates were going to pressure them into giving their wealth to charity.    A lot of people are angry at the billionaires who are not willing to give away their fortunes. They  _ hem for being miserly and not caring about the poor and the less fortunate. But I think this criticism is wrong. A gift, any gift, should come from the heart. Instead of criticism, these reluctant billionaires should be encouraged to follow the examples of Yu Pengnian and Chen Guangbiao. Encouragement is always a better strategy than criticism. As we say in English, \\"You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.\\" What sets Yu and Chen apart from other rich people in China? A) When it comes to charity work, they are very generous. B) They had dinner with Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, talking about the spirit of giving.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Carcassonne  is a fortified French town in the Aude department, of which it is the prefecture, in the Region of Occitanie.  - Old Occitan (Modern Occitan: \\"occitan ancian\\"), also called Old Provençal, was the earliest form of the Occitano-Romance languages, as attested in writings dating from the eighth through the fourteenth centuries. Old Occitan generally includes Early and Old Occitan. Middle Occitan is sometimes included in Old Occitan, sometimes in Modern Occitan. As the term \\"occitanus\\" appeared around the year 1300, Old Occitan is referred to as \\"Romance\\" (Occitan: \\"romans\\") or \\"Provençal\\" (Occitan: \\"proensals\\") in medieval texts.  - The trobairises (singular: trobairitz) were Occitan female troubadours of the 12th and 13th centuries, active from around 1170 to approximately 1260. The word \\"trobairitz\\" was first used in the 13th-century romance \\"Flamenca\\". It comes from the Provençal word \\"trobar\\", the literal meaning of which is \\"to find\\", and the technical meaning of which is \\"to compose\\". The word \\"trobairitz\\" is used very rarely in medieval Occitan, as it does not occur in lyrical poetry, grammatical treatises, or in the biographies of the \\"trobairitz\\" or troubadours. \\"Trobairitz\\" composed, wrote verses, and performed for the Occitan noble courts. They are exceptional in musical history as the first known female composers of Western secular music; all earlier known female composers wrote sacred music. The \\"trobairitz\\" were part of courtly society, as opposed to their lower class counterparts the \\"joglaressas\\". Although troubadours sometimes came from humble originsBernart de Ventadorn may have been the son of a castle's bakerthe \\"trobairitz\\" were nobly born. The most important \\"trobairitz\\" are Alamanda de Castelnau, Azalais de Porcairagues, Maria de Ventadorn, Tibors, Castelloza, Garsenda de Proença, Gormonda de Monpeslier, and the Comtessa de Diá.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France. It has an area of and a population in 2013 of 2,229,621 within its administrative limits. The city is both a commune and department, and forms the centre and headquarters of the Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an area of and a population in 2014 of 12,005,077, comprising 18.2 percent of the population of France.  - Aude is a department in south-central France named after the river Aude. The local council also calls the department \\"Cathar Country\\". Aude is also a frequent feminine French given name in Francophone countries, deriving initially from Aude or Oda, a wife of Bertrand, Duke of Aquitaine, and mother of Saint Hubertus's brother Eudo. Aude was the name of Roland's fiancée in the chansons de geste.  - A troubadour was a composer and performer of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages (11001350). Since the word \\"troubadour\\" is etymologically masculine, a female troubadour is usually called a trobairitz.  - Lyric poetry is a formal type of poetry which expresses personal emotions or feelings, typically spoken in the first person. The term derives from a form of Ancient Greek literature, the lyric, which was defined by its musical accompaniment, usually on a stringed instrument known as a lyre. The term owes its importance in literary theory to the division developed by Aristotle between three broad categories of poetry: lyrical, dramatic and epic.  - Narbonne (Occitan: \\"Narbona\\") is a commune in southern France in the Occitanie region. It lies from Paris in the Aude department, of which it is a sub-prefecture. Once a prosperous port, and a major city in Roman times, it is now located about from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. It is marginally the largest commune in Aude, although the prefecture is the slightly smaller commune of Carcassonne.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - A minstrel was a medieval European entertainer. Originally describing any type of entertainer such as a musician, juggler, acrobat, singer or fool, the term later, from the sixteenth century, came to mean a specialist entertainer who sang songs and played musical instruments.  - Peire Rogier ( born c. 1145 ) was a twelfth - century Auvergnat troubadour ( fl . 1160 -- 1180 ) and cathedral canon from Clermont . He left his cathedral to become a travelling minstrel before settling down for a time in Narbonne at the court of the Viscountess Ermengard . His life and career are known because his late thirteenth - century vida survives , as well as some of his works . The reliability of his vida , upon which all the details of his goings and comings are known , however , is not complete . According to it , he left the religious life to become a jongleur . He fell in love with his hostess and patron and wrote many songs in her honour , giving Ermengard the nickname Tort - n'avetz ( \`\` You are wrong '' ) , but for what reasons is unknown . Eventually the people of the Narbonnaise believed that he was in a sexual relationship with the viscountess and so she asked him to leave . He moved on to the court of Raimbaut d'Aurenga , where he also remained for a long time . From Raimbaut 's court he moved on to sojourn at that of Alfonso VIII of Castile , then that of Alfonso II of Aragon , and finally that of Raymond V of Toulouse , where he arrived circa 1170 . According to his vida , he became much esteemed as a troubadour through his travels , but there is no evidence otherwise for any movements in Spain , except perhaps the assembly of troubadours at the court of Aragon mentioned in a work of Peire d'Alvernhe ( which need not have taken place ) . He entered the Order of Grandmont before his death . Peire Rogier 's style of courtly love poetry is of the extremely reverent variety , in which the man submits completely to his lady and she is a paragon of virtue and courtliness ( though the word cortezia is absent from his surviving works ) .

How do you do this: One wants to remove rust from a metal object.","output":"To remove rust from a metal object effectively, you should follow these steps: 1. Gather required materials: Before beginning the rust removal process, ensure you have the necessary materials for the job. These may include:     - A wire brush or steel wool     - Sandpaper (with varying grit sizes)     - White vinegar     - Baking soda     - Lemon or lime juice     - A bowl or container large enough to submerge the rusted object     - Protective gloves and eyewear     - An old toothbrush or a soft cloth     - Rust converter, rust remover, or rust inhibitor products (optional) 2. Assess the rusted object: Determine the severity of rusting on the metal object. There may be surface rust, a flaking/crusting rust, or deep rust that has penetrated the metal. Knowing the extent of rust will help you choose which method to apply. 3. Choose the appropriate rust removal method:     - Surface rust: For minor surface rust, you can use a combination of mechanical and chemical rust removal processes. Start by gently scrubbing the rusted areas with a wire brush, steel wool, or sandpaper (beginning with a coarser grit and working your way down to the finer grit). Once most of the rust has been removed, you can move on to using some white vinegar or lemon/lime juice to neutralize any remaining rust.     - Flaking/crusting rust: Begin by using a wire brush or steel wool to remove the flaking rust. If more force is needed, use a hammer and chisel to break away large chunks of rust. Once the majority of the rust has been chipped away, you can use a rust converter or rust remover product according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, you can use a vinegar or lemon/lime juice soak to treat any remaining rust.     - Deep rust: Depending on the depth of the rust and the value of the object, consider professional help or replacing the item. If you choose to remove the rust by yourself, you may need to use a heavy-duty rust remover product or an electrolysis setup. Electrolysis involves connecting a car battery charger and a sacrificial metal to the rusted object submerged in an electrolyte solution. This setup creates a reaction that draws the rust out of the metal object and onto the sacrificial metal. 4. Chemical treatment: If you chose to use vinegar or lemon/lime juice, soak the rusted metal object in the liquid for several hours or overnight. Ensure the object is fully submerged. The acidic properties will help dissolve the rust. After soaking, remove the object and scrub it gently with an old toothbrush or a soft cloth to remove any leftover rust. 5. Rinse and neutralize: After the rust has been removed, rinse the metal object with water to remove any remaining vinegar or lemon/lime juice. To neutralize the acid, mix a solution of baking soda and water (approximately one tablespoon of baking soda per cup of water) and soak the metal item for 10-15 minutes, then rinse with water again. 6. Dry and protect: Dry the metal object thoroughly to prevent the formation of new rust. Once it is completely dry, you can apply a rust inhibitor, light oil, or a coat of protective paint to protect the surface and prevent future rusting. Remember to dispose of any waste materials responsibly, following local guidelines, and consider recycling when possible."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer this question. “Harlequin” is the first book in a series about a quest for which item?","output":"\\"Harlequin\\" is the first book in the Grail Quest series written by esteemed British author Bernard Cornwell. The Grail Quest series is a historical fiction that revolves around the quest for the Holy Grail, which is a significant symbol in Christian mythology. The Holy Grail is traditionally thought to be the dish, plate, or cup used by Jesus at the Last Supper, said to possess miraculous powers. According to Arthurian literature, the elusive Holy Grail was the cup used by Joseph of Arimathea to catch and store the blood of Christ at the Crucifixion. The grail became a focal point in tales of King Arthur and his knights, who were portrayed as embarking on a spiritual and physical pursuit to find and protect this sacred object, which was thought to hold divine powers, including the power to heal all wounds, grant eternal youth or sustenance in infinite abundance. In Bernard Cornwell's Grail Quest series, the main character is an English longbowman named Thomas of Hookton. Thomas becomes entangled in this historic quest for the Holy Grail during the turbulent time of the Hundred Years War between England and France. Thomas's personal connection to the Holy Grail is what drives him into this quest. After his village was slaughtered by a renegade group of raiders who also stole his father's religious artifact which Thomas believes might connect him with the Holy Grail, he joins the English army and embarks on the quest himself. Throughout the series, Thomas battles against the forces of his own king, rival claimants, and the Church while dodging danger and deception at every turn. His courage, his skill as an archer, and his own semi-heretical belief that the Grail is a force for good separate from the established Church, all fuel his single-handed quest for this mythic object. Therefore, Bernard Cornwell's \\"Harlequin\\" (known as \\"The Archer's Tale\\" in the United States), as the very start of this series, sets the groundwork for a thrilling narrative, centered around a multi-layered, centuries-old quest for the Holy Grail. It effectively sets the tone for the successive books in the series, propelling the reader into the cataclysmic conflicts of historical Europe, all told from the perspective of a singular archer who holds the clue to Christianity's greatest relic."},{"instruction":"Question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Choose your story that continues the following story. Joel wore a Princess Leia suit while Joseph wore normal clothes, because  Possible answers: [1]. Joel loved cosplay .; [2]. Joseph loved cosplay .;","output":"[1]. Joel loved cosplay . Ever since he was a child, Joel had been fascinated by the art of cosplay. Growing up, he found solace in attending various conventions, meticulously crafting costumes and becoming lost in the worlds of his favorite characters. For Joel, cosplay was more than just a hobby; it was a way to celebrate the magic of storytelling, connect with like-minded individuals, and escape from the mundaneness of everyday life. Joseph, on the other hand, had never been intrigued by the phenomenon of cosplay. He preferred to express his love for the fictional realm through writing or discussing the subject matter with others. To him, cosplay seemed slightly too dramatic and outside of his comfort zone. One day, Joel came across an advertisement for the upcoming \\"NebulaCon,\\" a massive convention meant for fans of science fiction, fantasy, and all things geeky. His heart began to race with excitement, and a plan quickly formed in his mind. He would attend the convention with his best friend Joseph and would create the perfect costume for them to go together. Joel's imagination ignited as he began brainstorming ideas for the perfect pair of costumes. He wanted something iconic, unique, and timeless. The idea hit him one evening while browsing through some old promotional posters from beloved sci-fi movies. Joel would dress as the courageous and powerful Princess Leia from Star Wars, while Joseph would become the lovable rogue Han Solo. When Joel shared his exciting costume idea with Joseph, the response was less than enthusiastic. Joseph hesitated, reminding Joel of his aversion to cosplay and expressing concerns about drawing unnecessary attention to himself. Despite his reservations, Joseph didn't want to let his friend down and chose to support Joel's passion by accompanying him to the convention—but insisted on wearing 'normal clothes' instead of engaging in cosplay. On the day of the convention, Joel awoke early with boundless enthusiasm as he donned his meticulously crafted Princess Leia costume. He had spent countless hours perfecting every minute detail to truly embody the iconic character. Meanwhile, Joseph stood by and watched, equally nervous and excited about the day's festivities. As they arrived at NebulaCon, Joel's presence was met with admiration and awe from fellow fans. His Princess Leia costume was a hit among the attendees, and the convention floor buzzed with excitement and camaraderie. Although Joseph chose not to engage in cosplay, he couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder and appreciation for the artistry and talent on display all around him. Throughout the day, Joel effortlessly transitioned between fan-turned-photographer, posing for photos with excited fellow cosplayers, and an enthralled bystander as he soaked in the myriad of panels, workshops, and vendors that NebulaCon had to offer. As the convention came to a close, Joel and Joseph found themselves standing outside the entrance, reminiscing on their shared experiences and newfound camaraderie amongst the fans. With a renewed sense of appreciation for his friend's passion, Joseph began to contemplate the idea of participating in cosplay at the next convention. He realized that transcending the boundaries of reality, even if just for a brief moment, could be a liberating and thrilling experience. And thus, Joel's love for cosplay opened Joseph's eyes to a new world of creativity and self-expression that had been hidden in plain sight. The seed of change had been planted—perhaps, one day, Joseph would embrace his own inner Princess Leia or Han Solo, and the two friends would embark on even more extraordinary adventures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Q: The documented history of malaria in parts of Asia goes back more than 2,000 years, during which the disease has been a major player on the socioeconomic stage in many nation states as they waxed and waned in power and prosperity. On a much shorter time scale, the last half century has seen in microcosm a history of large fluctuations in endemicity and impact of malaria across the spectrum of rice fields and rain forests, mountains and plains that reflect the vast ecological diversity inhabited by this majority aggregation of mankind. That period has seen some of the most dramatic changes in social and economic structure, in population size, density and mobility, and in political structure in history: all have played a part in the changing face of malaria in this extensive region of the world. While the majority of global malaria cases currently reside in Africa, greater numbers inhabited Asia earlier this century before malaria programs savored significant success, and now Asia harbors a global threat in the form of the epicenter of multidrug resistant Plasmodium falciparum which is gradually encompassing the tropical world. The latter reflects directly the vicissitudes of economic change over recent decades, particularly the mobility of populations in search of commerce, trade and personal fortunes, or caught in the misfortunes of physical conflicts. The period from the 1950s to the 1990s has witnessed near \\"eradication\\" followed by resurgence of malaria in Sri Lanka, control and resurgence in India, the influence of war and postwar instability on drug resistance in Cambodia, increase in severe and cerebral malaria in Myanmar during prolonged political turmoil, the essential disappearance of the disease from all but forested border areas of Thailand where it remains for the moment intractable, the basic elimination of vivax malaria from many provinces of central China. Both positive and negative experiences have lessons to teach in the debate between eradication and control as alternative strategies. China has for years held high the goal of \\"basic elimination\\", eradication by another name, in sensible semi-defiance of WHO dictates. The Chinese experience makes it clear that, given community organization, exhaustive attention to case detection, management and focus elimination, plus the political will at all levels of society, it is possible both to eliminate malaria from large areas of an expansive nation and to implement surveillance necessary to maintain something approaching eradication status in those areas. But China has not succeeded in the international border regions of the tropical south where unfettered population movement confounds the program. Thailand, Malaysia and to an extent Vietnam have also reached essential elimination in their rice field plains by vigorous vertical programs but fall short at their forested borders. Economics is central to the history of the rise and fall of nations, and to the history of disease in the people who constitute nations. The current love affair with free market economics as the main driving force for advance of national wealth puts severe limitations on the essential involvement of communities in malaria management. The task of malaria control or elimination needs to be clearly related to the basic macroeconomic process that preoccupies governments, not cloistered away in the health sector Historically malaria has had a severe, measurable, negative impact on the productivity of nations. Economic models need rehoning with political aplomb and integrating with technical and demographic strategies. Recent decades in Chinese malaria history carry some lessons that may be relevant in this context.

Mark tackled the quarterback, but he was penalized.","output":"In the given sentence, \\"Mark tackled the quarterback, but he was penalized,\\" the pronoun \\"he\\" is referring to Mark. Here's a detailed explanation of the sentence and how we can deduce the antecedent of the pronoun: The sentence contains two clauses:  1. \\"Mark tackled the quarterback\\" - This clause describes an action performed by Mark, where he tackled the quarterback. 2. \\"he was penalized\\" - This clause describes a consequence (a penalty) that someone is facing. For understanding who \\"he\\" is referring to, we need to analyze the context. The context of the sentence is a football game in which a player named Mark tackles the quarterback. In football, penalties are usually given to the player who commits a foul or breaks a rule. In this case, given that the sentence connects the two clauses using \\"but,\\" it implies that although Mark performed the action (tackling the quarterback), he experienced a consequence (being penalized). This connection and the structure of the sentence indicate that the pronoun \\"he\\" is referring to Mark, the one who encountered a penalty as a result of his action. So, to sum up, \\"he\\" in the sentence \\"Mark tackled the quarterback, but he was penalized\\" refers to Mark, as he was the one who faced a penalty due to his action of tackling the quarterback."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

In 1973, Cave met Mick Harvey (guitar), Phill Calvert (drums), John Cochivera (guitar), Brett Purcell (bass), and Chris Coyne (saxophone); fellow students at Caulfield Grammar. They founded a band with Cave as singer. Their repertoire consisted of proto-punk cover versions of songs by Lou Reed, David Bowie, Alice Cooper, Roxy Music and Alex Harvey, among others. Later, the line-up slimmed down to four members including Cave's friend Tracy Pew on bass. In 1977, after leaving school, they adopted the name The Boys Next Door and began playing predominantly original material. Guitarist and songwriter Rowland S. Howard joined the band in 1978.  They were a leader of Melbourne's post-punk scene in the late 1970s, playing hundreds of live shows in Australia before changing their name to the Birthday Party in 1980 and moving to London, then West Berlin. Cave's Australian girlfriend and muse Anita Lane accompanied them to London. The band were notorious for their provocative live performances which featured Cave shrieking, bellowing and throwing himself about the stage, backed up by harsh pounding rock music laced with guitar feedback. Cave utilised Old Testament imagery with lyrics about sin, debauchery and damnation. Cave's droll sense of humour and penchant for parody is evident in many of the band's songs, including \\"Nick the Stripper\\" and \\"King Ink\\". \\"Release the Bats\\", one of the band's most famous songs, was intended as an over-the-top \\"piss-take\\" on gothic rock, and a \\"direct attack\\" on the \\"stock gothic associations that less informed critics were wont to make\\".

If you find the lowest price on the best hotel in Honolulu at the height of the season, you will save money, but still have a very expensive vacation.

This will be difficult for some of you, and entirely unacceptable to others. Nonetheless  ,the travelers who get to travel the most, go to the widest variety of places, learn the most and do the most, are the opportunists. This will be true until you are so wealthy that you have no monetary (;)limits. The first time I went to Ecuador, I went there because it was cheap. If it wasn't, I would have had a great time--somewhere else.

I cut the cost by taking a bus from my home in Michigan to Miami, and back again when I returned from Ecuador. The round-trip ticket cost 158.

During the 1750s  Messiah was performed increasingly at festivals and cathedrals throughout the country. Individual choruses and arias were occasionally extracted for use as anthems or motets in church services, or as concert pieces, a practice that grew in the 19th century and has continued ever since. After Handel's death, performances were given in Florence (1768), New York (excerpts, 1770), Hamburg (1772), and Mannheim (1777), where Mozart first heard it. For the performances in Handel's lifetime and in the decades following his death, the musical forces used in the Foundling Hospital performance of 1754 are thought by Burrows to be typical. A fashion for large-scale performances began in 1784, in a series of commemorative concerts of Handel's music given in Westminster Abbey under the patronage of King George III. A plaque on the Abbey wall records that \\"The Band consisting of DXXV [525] vocal & instrumental performers was conducted by Joah Bates Esqr.\\" In a 1955 article, Sir Malcolm Sargent, a proponent of large-scale performances, wrote, \\"Mr Bates ... had known Handel well and respected his wishes. The orchestra employed was two hundred and fifty strong, including twelve horns, twelve trumpets, six trombones and three pairs of timpani (some made especially large).\\" In 1787 further performances were given at the Abbey; advertisements promised, \\"The Band will consist of Eight Hundred Performers\\".In continental Europe, performances of Messiah were departing from Handel's practices in a different way: his score was being drastically reorchestrated to suit contemporary tastes. In 1786, Johann Adam Hiller presented Messiah with updated scoring in Berlin Cathedral. In 1788 Hiller presented a performance of his revision with a choir of 259 and an orchestra of 87 strings, 10 bassoons, 11 oboes, 8 flutes, 8 horns, 4 clarinets, 4 trombones, 7 trumpets, timpani, harpsichord and organ.

'She hasn't had a boyfriend for a long while,' he says in the home-made clip, filmed in his car. 'Don't know whether it's because she's infertile, she's too old, whatever.' 'I'm not going to go into that because she'll kick off.' Adam and older sister Natalie are close, working together running media company Suave Productions. Adam recorded a video of his sister which he posted online alongside an advert for a date with her. Although she admits she was originally cross with her brother, Natalie now is enjoying sifting through the responses from men hoping to date her - having whittled it down to between five and eight suitors. 'We need to get her a boyfriend because she's doing my head in!' His unwitting sister then gets into the car, looking a tad taken aback when he explains what he's doing. He then continues: 'If anyone's interested, she's 33, she's got her own car, runs her own business, she's... I've run out of things to say about you. Anyway, if you're interested, add her on Facebook.' Adam put the video on Facebook without his sister's knowledge and then shared it on different sites such as Free Ads and Gumtree. When Natalie found out about the video she said 'at first I was shocked and kicked off but then I began to see the funny side and now I'm thankful'. The fact it was an an instant success and sparked multiple responses in just 24 hours may have helped. 'My laptop has not stopped beeping since,' says Natalie. Natalie scours the profiles of men who respond to the video, checking out their appearance and whether they can 'have a laugh' like her. 'It was not until we got home when he told me he shared it on his Facebook.' Adam says the video has been watched over 8,000 times so far and Natalie has had around 70 messages. She says she's whittled potential suitors down to between five and eight and may even be heading out on a date this week. Adam apparently was prompted to place the adverts when he found a girlfriend himself and wanted Natalie (right) to also find a special someone for 'balance' Adam and Natalie work together running media company Suave Productions, based in Cardiff. But after Adam found himself a girlfriend he felt 'it would be nice for her to have some balance, and get her head out of her laptop'. Asked what she looks for in a man, she said: 'I'll admit it's a little shallow but... looks. I'll look at their profile and through their timeline to see if they stand out, to see if they can have a laugh like me.' What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

They are searching for three crewmen still missing after the helicopter crashed at about 01:00 on Tuesday. A fourth crew member, Captain Dara Fitzpatrick died in hospital after she was recovered from the sea on Tuesday. The search for chief pilot Mark Duffy and winchmen Paul Ormsby and Ciarán Smith continues. Irish chief air accident investigator Jurgen Whyte described the location of a signal as \\"hugely significant\\" and said he hoped the recorder was in or near the helicopter wreckage. \\"To get the signal is the big thing,\\" he told Irish broadcaster RTÉ. \\"We are now in what would be described as a football pitch and somewhere within that football pitch there is a very small tweeting, chirping sound and as we move around that field we hope to get closer and closer to it. \\"The likelihood is that the three missing persons may be within that area as well - so our focus is still on recovering the three crew members and we believe that by finding the recorder that will bring us closer to that goal.\\" Accident investigators from the UK have joined the search for the black box with specialised equipment to assist the operation. The Irish Navy, RNLI, police divers and fishing boats are searching the coast off Mayo. Captain Robert McCabe, Director of Operations and Navigation with the Commissioners of Irish Lights, said all the lighthouses in the area were in \\"full working order\\" on the morning of the incident. Capt McCabe added that aids to navigation at Blackrock Lighthouse were functioning properly at the time of the crash. The Irish coastguard asked the Irish Defence Forces to provide top cover for the fatal rescue mission at 22:06 on Monday, but its fixed-wing aircraft were not available, so Rescue 116 was deployed instead. The Irish Defence Forces added that at 01:45 on Tuesday, the Irish Air Corps logged an emergency request from the Irish coastguard \\"to provide an aircraft to conduct a search for a missing helicopter, Rescue 116\\". \\"The Air Corps initiated its recall plan and as a result was able to offer a Casa CN235 maritime patrol aircraft. That plane took off from Casement Aerodrome south of Dublin shortly before 04:30 Rescue teams are using sophisticated underwater equipment which picks up a faint chirp from the locator beacon on the flight recorder. It's in water about 40m deep and only about 50 or 60m from Blackrock which is a tall, rocky island topped by a lighthouse about 10 miles off the Mayo coast. The next stage is to pinpoint its exact location and then attempt to recover the device either by using an underwater robot or dive teams. There are two black boxes, one which records the engine and flight data and the other which captures the voice and radio communications and investigators hope they'll be able to retrieve the data to find out what happened in the final moments of the flight. The water conditions are described as difficult, there are very strong currents and the weather today could impede the search with large swells forecast The Irish naval ship, LÉ Eithne, is helping to co-ordinate the ongoing search and rescue operation. On Wednesday, civil defence volunteers carried out searches along the shore. Irish Transport Minister Shane Ross visited Blacksod in County Mayo and spoke to relatives of the crew. \\"It's a very, very devastating experience for them as can be expected,\\" he said. The Dublin-based helicopter crew had been assisting colleagues from Sligo in a rescue operation on a UK fishing vessel about 150km (95 miles) west of Eagle Island. They lost contact at about 01:00 local time on Tuesday on a refuelling journey to Blacksod. Capt Fitzpatrick was the mother of a young son and the most senior pilot with CHC which runs the contract to provide search and rescue services in the Republic of Ireland. R116 from Dublin was sent to help the Sligo aircraft communicate with the base at Malin, as the fishing boat was too far out for the first helicopter to stay within communication range. The Sligo crew picked up the fisherman, who had a serious hand injury, and transferred him to hospital. Shortly afterwards, communication was lost with the Dublin-based aircraft. Conditions were described as good when the helicopter lost contact on its final approach to Blacksod refuelling depot. It is the second fatal accident involving Irish Coastguard crew members over the past six months. In September 2016, volunteer Coastguard Caitriona Lucas died while assisting in a rescue operation off the County Clare coast. The mother-of-two was one of three crew members on board a rigid inflatable boat which flipped over during a search for a man near cliffs at Kilkee. Irish coastguard helicopters have been used for a number of operations in Northern Ireland.

Charles 'Chuck' Levine (Who is a chronic womanizer) and Lawrence 'Larry' Valentine (Who is a bachelor and trying to raise his children after his wife passed away some time ago) are two veteran New York City Firefighters. During a routine sweep of a burned building, a segment of floor collapses and Chuck almost dies. Larry rescues Chuck by shielding him from the falling debris. As he and Larry awaken at a hospital later, Chuck vows to repay his debt in any way possible.

Larry was given at least a year to change his beneficiaries but he was profusely mourning his wife, and left it too late. However, One of the ways suggested for him to do so is to get married. Inspired by a newspaper article about domestic partnerships, Larry asks Chuck to enter a civil union with him. Although at first Chuck declines, he is reminded of his debt to Larry and finally agrees.Chuck and Larry become domestic partners and Chuck becomes Larry's primary beneficiary in the event of his death.

What is the density of a 64-g iron cube that displaces 8 mL of water?The answer is:","output":"To find the density of a 64-g iron cube that displaces 8 mL of water, we need to use the formula for density, which is: Density = Mass / Volume First, let's break down the information we have: 1. Mass: The mass of the iron cube is given as 64 grams. 2. Volume: To find the volume of the cube, we can use the information about water displacement. When the iron cube is immersed in water, it displaces 8 mL of water. According to Archimedes' principle, the volume of the water displaced is equal to the volume of the object (in this case, the iron cube) that is immersed in the water. Therefore, the volume of the iron cube is 8 mL (or 8 cm³, since 1 mL equals 1 cm³). Now we can plug these values into the density formula: Density = Mass / Volume Density = 64 grams / 8 cm³ Density = 8 g/cm³ So, the density of the 64-g iron cube that displaces 8 mL of water is 8 grams per cubic centimeter (8 g/cm³)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - The carafe is filled with water - The water is poured into the machine at the back - Coffee beans are put into a grinder - The grinder is activated - A filter is put into the coffee maker - The ground coffee is put into the filter - Sometimes a bit of salt is added to the grounds to bring out flavor - The top of the machine is closed - The power is turned on - The water passes through the grounds and becomes coffee.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose beans are more expensive happens, how will it affect MORE coffee being made.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"If coffee beans become more expensive, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that there would be an effect on the process of making more coffee. This effect could be direct or indirect, depending on how the price change influences the consumption, production, and supply chain of coffee beans. We'll examine various ways in which the higher price of coffee beans could affect the process of making more coffee. 1. Direct Effects: a) Consumers may purchase fewer coffee beans due to the higher price, leading to a reduction in the quantity of coffee being made at home or workplaces. This could result in consumers either drinking less coffee or seeking alternative sources of caffeine, such as tea or energy drinks. b) Coffee shops and cafés could also be affected by the higher coffee bean prices. They may increase the selling price of their coffee beverages to compensate for the increased cost of ingredients, which could lead to a reduction in coffee consumption if consumers become more price-sensitive. c) The higher cost of coffee beans could also have an impact on industrial coffee production. Coffee manufacturers might opt to reduce their production levels or cut back on the quality of coffee beans used to produce their products, which could affect the overall taste and quality of the final coffee products. 2. Indirect Effects: a) A reduction in coffee consumption due to higher prices may lead to changes in the coffee supply chain and industry. With lower demand, coffee growers might decide to cut back on production or even switch to alternative crops, resulting in even higher coffee bean prices and further affecting the process of making more coffee.  b) The higher cost of coffee beans could lead to the development and increased popularity of coffee substitutes. For example, chicory or barley-based coffee alternatives may gain more traction in the market due to their lower price and similar flavor profile. c) An increase in the price of coffee beans may also drive innovation in the coffee industry. Coffee machine manufacturers could opt to create machines that use less coffee while still maintaining the same quality and flavor, or research could be conducted to develop new methods for producing coffee with lower prices, such as synthetic alternatives or genetically modified beans. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis does suggest that the higher price of coffee beans would have both direct and indirect effects on the process of making more coffee. It can affect consumer behavior, production levels, supply chain dynamics, and the overall coffee industry. The extent to which this price increase influences the process of making more coffee would depend on numerous factors, including consumer sensitivity to price changes, the volatility of the coffee market, and the adaptability of the coffee industry itself."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","output":"The last castle built in England is not a straightforward question to answer, as it depends on how one defines a \\"castle.\\" Traditionally, castles were built as fortifications during the medieval times and served as the residences of powerful lords and nobility. This period lasted from the 11th to early 16th century. However, if we consider the broader definition of castles, which could also include fortified manor homes and follies, castles continued to be built in later centuries. With these distinctions in mind, the following castles can be considered as some of the last built in England: 1. Fort Belvedere, Surrey: Built between 1750 and 1755, Fort Belvedere was a Gothic-style fortified folly constructed by Sir William Chambers for King George II. The fort was built for purposes of leisure and entertainment rather than as a defensive structure. 2. Highclere Castle, Hampshire: Highclere Castle was built between 1839 and 1842 as a country house for the Herbert family, who hold the title Earl of Carnarvon. Designed by Sir Charles Barry, Highclere Castle is in a more Victorian architectural style. Today, it is best known as the filming location for the television series \\"Downton Abbey.\\" 3. Wray Castle, Cumbria: Wray Castle was built in 1840 by Dr. James Dawson, a retired Liverpool surgeon, as a private residence in a mock-Gothic style. The castle was later acquired by the National Trust and has since become a prominent tourist attraction. 4. Whitstable Castle, Kent: Originally built as Tankerton Tower in 1790, it was extensively renovated and extended by architect Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1859 to form a private residence known as Whitstable Castle. The castle is now open to the public and used for various activities and events. 5. Castell Coch, Wales: Built between 1875 and 1891, Castell Coch is a Gothic Revival-style castle designed by William Burges for the Marquess of Bute. Although technically in Wales, it is worth mentioning as it was built during a similar timeframe as the other castles mentioned above. The castle today is under the care of Cadw and is open to the public. It is worth noting that many older castles in England have been continuously renovated, restored, or expanded over the centuries. Thus, even though they may have been initially built during medieval times, their current appearance may reflect more recent architectural styles and designs. Ultimately, the answer to when the last castle was built in England depends on the criteria one uses to define a castle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu.  - Auckland is a city in the North Island of New Zealand. It is the most populous urban area in the country. Auckland has a population of , which constitutes percent of New Zealand's population. It is part of the wider Auckland Regionthe area governed by the Auckland Councilwhich also includes outlying rural areas and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf, resulting in a total population of . Auckland also has the largest Polynesian population of any city in the world. The Mori language name for Auckland is or , meaning \\"Tmaki with a hundred lovers\\", in reference to the desirability of its fertile land at the hub of waterways in all directions. It has also been called karana, the Mori enunciation of \\"Auckland\\".  - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  - The Dicksoniaceae is a family of tropical , subtropical and warm temperate ferns . Most of the 5 - 6 genera in the family are terrestrial ferns or have very short trunks compared to tree ferns of the family Cyatheaceae . However , some of the larger species can reach several metres in height . A number of others are epiphytes . They are found mostly in tropical regions in the Southern Hemisphere , as far south as southern New Zealand .  - Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with residents. It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa. As the nation's capital city, the New Zealand Government and Parliament, Supreme Court and most of the civil service are based in the city.  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - The North Island or Te Ika-a-Mui (\\"Mori\\") is one of the two main islands of New Zealand, separated from the slightly larger but much less populous South Island by Cook Strait.

They are also very ancient plants, appearing in the fossil record in the late Jurassic, though the modern genera likely appeared in the Cenozoic. Cyatheaceae are the largest family of tree ferns, including about 500 species. Cyatheaceae and Dicksoniaceae, together with Metaxyaceae and Cibotiaceae, are a monophyletic group and constitute the \\"core tree ferns\\". Cyatheaceae are leptosporangiate ferns, the most familiar group of monilophytes.  - The Southern Hemisphere is the half sphere of Earth which is south of the equator.

Please answer the following question: What is the first name of the person that is asked to talk to Hortense about Feet?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Broadway, New Year's Eve, 1928. A muckraking reporter, Waldo Winchester, frames four major stories during the wild New Year's Eve of 1928. We meet the players in a diner. The Brain, a gangster with multiple girlfriends, is accompanied by a gambler named Regret (after the only horse he ever placed a winning bet) and an outsider who (with his bloodhounds) is being treated to a meal. Feet Samuels (so named because of his big feet) is in love with a showgirl named Hortense Hathaway, who is tossed out of the diner because of an unsavory reputation. Feet plans to have one wild night before committing suicide, having sold his body in advance to a medical doctor. Harriet MacKyle, a sheltered but friendly socialite, makes arrangements with a smooth-talking fixer for a big party that night at her estate, where many of the players will later attend. She has an interest in the exciting but dangerous criminal element. A girl selling flowers comes in after Feet makes a full payment of a debt to the Brain, so the Brain offers 5 for a 5-cent flower, telling her to keep the change. But before he can leave, a hitman for the Brooklyn Mob stabs him.  The wounded Brain tells his men to take him \\"home.\\" Unfortunately, his many girlfriends refuse to allow him in for various reasons. Feet gets involved in a high-stakes craps game. With considerable luck, he wins a massive payoff of money and jewelry.  Regret suggests they find another game, but Feet reveals his plan to kill himself.  Regret tries to talk him out of it, but Feet, sworn to see his last promise fulfilled, is adamant. Regret dials up the reporter, who is now at MacKyle's party, and asks him to talk to Hortense (his niece) and get her to realize Feet is smitten with her. Hortense must try to persuade Feet that she wants to quit her life as a lounge singer, move to New Jersey and raise a family. Regret, meanwhile, continues to be the world's unluckiest gambler, but showgirl Lovey Lou is in love with him anyway. Answer:","output":"Waldo"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on this summary: with bc-yugoslavia church of england head urges forgiveness and hope in sarajevo Text:","output":"The head of the Church of England has urged forgiveness and hope during a visit to Sarajevo, a poignant city that epitomizes the turmoil and difficulties that once reigned in the region formally known as Yugoslavia. The city, which bears deep scars even decades after the breakdown of Yugoslavia, is attempting to heal and build a better future. This church leader's visit, which aimed at fostering a message of compassion, reconciliation, and perseverance, is particularly resonant considering the locale's tumultuous past. Sarajevo – a city renowned for its cultural and religious diversity – was significantly hit during the Bosnian War (1992 to 1995) that followed the breakup of Yugoslavia. The war was marked by ethnic strife, which caused significant suffering and division among the country’s diverse population. Neighbors turned against each other, friends became foes, and the city was left with a legacy of splintered communities. Against this backdrop of historical pain and division, the Church of England's leader's visit offered a potent symbol of peace and reconciliation. The head of the Church, bearing a message of forgiveness, urged the city's individuals and communities to heal the past's wounds by pardicating in acts of forgiveness. This plea aligns with Christian principles concerning compassion and the healing power of forgiveness – principles that don't only pertain to individual transgressions but can also apply on a broader societal level. In his speech, the Church leader also conveyed a message of hope, encouraging the city to look beyond the hardships of the past towards a positive and more harmonious future. Such a vision will require the commitment of the entire community, transcending ethnic, religious, and cultural lines. He called for the city's diverse religions and communities to work together in grasping the hope for a renewed and peaceful Sarajevo. This was an appeal to the city's deep roots of multiculturalism - a feature that before the war, was a beacon of co-existence and unity.  Furthermore, the church leader emphasized the importance of education in building this hopeful future. By learning from the past, he suggested, future generations could prevent history from repeating itself, fostering understanding, peace, and unity. Overall, the Church of England's head visit to Sarajevo sent a strong message of forgiveness, hope, and unity. He reminded the city that they could not change the past, but they could decide their future. His speech was a call to action for Sarajevo and, indeed, for the world, suggesting that reconciliation and peace are possible even in the face of deep-rooted conflict and hardship. In the wake of his visit, the call for forgiveness and unity in Sarajevo echoes far and wide, not only in Yugoslavia but across the world as an example of the healing power of forgiveness and the unifying force of hope. The Church of England's leader's visit and his message serve as a reminder to all of us that we have the power to forge our future, however tangled our past may be."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"if a species is rare, harm to it's population increases or decreases?\\" is \\"pesticides\\", given that  the rarity of a species increases harm to population exponentially? A:","output":"The given answer, \\"pesticides,\\" does not directly address the question of whether harm to a rare species' population increases or decreases. However, we can analyze the question and discuss the potential impact of pesticides as well. The rarity of a species can be linked to increased harm to its population in various ways. For example, rare species might have limited habitat availability, low genetic diversity, and small population size, which could make them more vulnerable to threats like habitat loss, disease, or other external factors. Regarding pesticides, their impact on a species can be context-specific. Pesticides can negatively affect rare species if they are sensitive to the chemicals used, if their preferred habitat is frequently sprayed, or if their primary food sources are affected. For example, pesticides could harm pollinators like bees and butterflies, which might lead to a decline in the availability of food sources for other species. In some cases, pesticides might not directly affect a rare species, but their application could lead to a decrease in their population indirectly. For example, by eliminating certain types of plants, pesticides can remove essential habitat or food resources for rare species. In conclusion, the rarity of a species could result in increased harm to its population, particularly if they face additional threats like habitat loss, diseases, or the use of pesticides. However, the direct answer to the question is not \\"pesticides,\\" but rather an explanation that the rarity of a species can increase the harm to its population due to various factors, including but not limited to pesticides."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They are the descendants of free blacks and of escaped slaves (called maroons) who allied with Seminole groups in Spanish Florida. Historically, the Black Seminoles lived mostly in distinct bands near the Native American Seminole. Some were held as slaves of particular Seminole leaders; but they had more freedom than did slaves held by whites in the South and by other Native American tribes, including the right to bear arms. Throughout the period, several hundred Black Seminoles remained in the Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). Because most of the Seminole and the other Five Civilized Tribes supported the Confederacy during the American Civil War, in 1866 the US required new peace treaties with them. The US required the tribes emancipate any slaves and extend to the freedmen full citizenship rights in the tribes if they chose to stay in Indian Territory. In the late nineteenth century, Seminole Freedmen thrived in towns near the Seminole communities on the reservation. Most had not been living as slaves to the Indians before the war. They lived --as their descendants still do-- in and around Wewoka, Oklahoma, the community founded in 1849 by John Horse as a black settlement. Today it is the capital of the federally recognized Seminole Nation of Oklahoma.  Following the Civil War, some Freedmen's leaders in Indian Territory practiced polygyny, as did ethnic African leaders in other diaspora communities. In 1900 there were 1,000 Freedmen listed in the population of the Seminole Nation in Indian Territory, about one-third of the total. By the time of the Dawes Rolls, there were numerous female-headed households registered. The Freedmen's towns were made up of large, closely connected families.  After allotment, \\"[f]reedmen, unlike their [Indian] peers on the blood roll, were permitted to sell their land without clearing the transaction through the Indian Bureau. That made the poorly educated Freedmen easy marks for white settlers migrating from the Deep South.\\" Numerous Seminole Freedmen lost their land in the early decades after allotment, and some moved to urban areas. Others left the state because of its conditions of racial segregation. As US citizens, they were exposed to the harsher racial laws of Oklahoma.  Since 1954, the Freedmen have been included in the constitution of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma. They have two bands, each representing more than one town and named for 19th-century band leaders: the Cesar Bruner band covers towns south of Little River; the Dosar Barkus covers the several towns located north of the river. Each of the bands elects two representatives to the General Council of the Seminole Nation.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What was their Indian territory?","output":"The Black Seminoles' Indian territory was present-day Oklahoma.

Let me explain this to you: Question 1: Do research scientists need to have a PhD? Answer: Not always, but having a PhD can help a lot. Research scientists study and discover new things. A PhD helps them learn more about a specific area, so they become better at asking questions and solving problems.

Answer the following question: Information:  - The green jersey is a term used in road bicycle racing and Grand Tour stage races in particular. The green jersey is a distinctive racing jersey worn by the leader in a subsidiary competition.  - The Tour de France is an annual multiple stage bicycle race primarily held in France, while also occasionally making passes through nearby countries. The race was first organized in 1903 to increase sales for the newspaper \\"L'Auto\\"; which is currently run by the Amaury Sport Organisation. The race has been held annually since its first edition in 1903 except when it was stopped for the two World Wars. As the Tour gained prominence and popularity the race was lengthened and its reach began to extend around the globe. Participation expanded from a primarily French field, as riders from all over the world began to participate in the race each year. The Tour is a UCI World Tour event, which means that the teams that compete in the race are mostly UCI WorldTeams, with the exception of the teams that the organizers invite.  - The Great Dividing Range, or the Eastern Highlands, is Australia's most substantial mountain range and the third longest land-based range in the world. The range stretches more than from Dauan Island off the northeastern tip of Queensland, running the entire length of the eastern coastline through New South Wales, then into Victoria and turning west, before finally fading into the central plain at the Grampians in western Victoria. The width of the range varies from about to over .  - The Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) is part of the French media group, EPA (Éditions Philippe Amaury). It organises sporting events including the Tour de France, Vuelta a España and ParisNice professional cycle road races, and the Dakar Rally. In 2008 it began the Central Europe Rally, a rally raid endurance race in Romania and Hungary.  - The points classification is a secondary competition in the Tour de France, that started in 1953. Points are given for high finishes in a stage and for winning intermediate sprints, and these are recorded in a points classification. It is considered a sprinters' competition. The leader is indicated by a green jersey which has become a symbol for the points classification in the sense that when a cyclist wins the points classification.  - Robbie McEwen ( born 24 June 1972 in Brisbane , Queensland ) is an Australian former professional road bicycle racer . He last rode for Orica - GreenEDGE on the UCI World Tour , . As a triple winner of the Points classification in the Tour de France , at his peak he was arguably the fastest sprinter in the world . A former Australian BMX champion , McEwen switched to road racing in 1990 at 18 . He raced as a professional from 1996 until 2012 . McEwen lives in Australia with his Belgian wife Angélique Pattyn , his son Ewan , and his daughters Elena and Claudia . In 2011 he published an autobiography , One Way Road . McEwen lived a long time in the Belgian town of Everbeek and is fluent in Dutch . He retired from the World Tour after riding the 2012 Tour of California .  - The UCI ProTour was a series of road bicycle races in Europe, Australia and Canada organised by the UCI (International Cycling Union). Created by Hein Verbruggen, former president of the UCI, it comprises a number of 'ProTour' cycling teams, each of whom are required to compete in every round of the series. It was initially the basis of a season long competition for rankings points, created for 2005 to replace the UCI Road World Cup series, which ended at the end of the 2004 season (although the World Cup did not include any stage races). The ProTour was the subject of continuing disputes involving the UCI, cycling teams, and the organizers of the world's most prominent bicycle races (most notably, the Grand Tours), and in 2009 and 2010 the ranking element of the ProTour was superseded by the UCI World Ranking. For 2011, the ProTour and World Ranking were fully merged into the UCI World Tour. ProTour status for teams  relabelled UCI ProTeams  will continue as the highest level of registration, and will carry the right and obligation to participate in all World Tour races.  - The UCI World Tour (20092010: \\"UCI World Ranking\\") is the premier annual male elite road cycling tour. It refers to both the tour of 28 events and an annual ranking system based upon performances in these.

They also create a little waste, like when we get sweaty after running. Some bacteria are like superheroes that can change their powers based on what they need. These are called facultative anaerobes. Facultative anaerobes can switch between using fermentation and using oxygen, depending on what's available.

Soon, there were 60 students. A school infrastructure description in the region in 1900 reveals that the boys' school in Carabane was open from December to August each year, and that holidays ran from September to November, when parents needed their children in the fields to help cultivate rice. In 1903, when Carabane lost its status as capital, the school was instructing 63 boys and 102 girls. In 1914, it had only 56 boys and 26 girls, a situation similar to that in Bignona. Carabane has a new primary school, École François Mendy, inaugurated on January 21, 2006, hosting six classes. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students may continue their studies at the middle school in Elinkine, the Aline Sitoe Diatta High School in Oussouye, and then a university in either Dakar or Ziguinchor.

This technique comes in handy when you're baking or cooking recipes that call for either only yolks or whites. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to separate an egg using a plastic water bottle: 1. Prepare your materials:    - A clean, empty plastic water bottle with a lid (preferably small- to medium-sized, so it's easier to control)    - A small bowl or container for the egg yolk    - A large bowl or container for the egg whites    - A flat surface or plate for cracking the egg    - A clean kitchen towel or paper towels for wiping up any spills 2. Crack the egg:    - Place the egg on a flat surface or plate. Using the edge of a counter, a knife, or the back of a spoon, gently tap the equator of the eggshell until you see a small crack.    - Carefully pull the eggshell apart with your fingers, trying to avoid any shell pieces from falling into the egg. Allow the egg contents to fall onto the flat surface or plate. 3. Inspect the egg:    - Before the next step, ensure the egg yolk is intact and not broken. If it appears damaged, discard the egg and start again with a new one.    - Remove any tiny bits of eggshell that may have fallen into the egg using a spoon or your clean fingers. 4. Prepare the water bottle:    - Remove the lid of the plastic water bottle.    - Ensure that the bottle is clean and free of any residue or liquid from its previous use.    - Squeeze the middle of the bottle to force some air out, creating a small vacuum. 5. Separate the egg yolk:    - With the squeezed bottle, carefully place the opening over the egg yolk while keeping its body squeezed.    - Slowly release your grip on the bottle, allowing the vacuum created to suck the egg yolk into the bottle. Make sure the edge of the bottle remains in contact with the flat surface to prevent any air from entering, which may break the yolk.    - Once the yolk is securely in the bottle, carefully lift the bottle away from the egg white. 6. Transfer the yolk and the egg white:    - Gently move the bottle with the yolk over the small bowl or container you prepared earlier. Squeeze the bottle once again to release the egg yolk. Make sure that the yolk does not get mixed with the egg white in this process.    - Pour the egg white from the flat surface or plate into the large bowl or container using a scraper or a similar tool to ensure you collect as much of the egg white as possible. 7. Clean up:    - Wash and dry the plastic water bottle, so it's ready for your next egg-separating adventure.    - Wipe up any spills or drips with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels, ensuring your workspace stays clean. In conclusion, separating an egg yolk from the egg white using a plastic water bottle is a simple, quick, and mess-free technique that anyone can easily execute. It requires very little skill and ensures that your egg yolks and whites remain separated, perfect for any recipe that calls for only one component of the egg."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Gone are the days when a pair of black Copa Mundials were the boot of choice for England players ahead of the World Cup. Today's stars prefer to be noticed on the pitch and it seems the more fluorescent the boot the better. A whole host of bright colours were seen flashing across the Wembley turf during England's 3-0 friendly win over Peru but Raheem Sterling's footwear particularly caught the eye. The Liverpool frontman, who replaced Wayne Rooney during the Three Lions' warm-up game on Friday night, was wearing Nike's new Flyknit Mercurial Superfly IV boot - which has a partial sock fitted to it.

Other options like England, World Cup, Wembley, Liverpool, and Raheem Sterling were mentioned in the passage but are not the entities responsible for the evolution of the boot, and thus they would not receive Ronaldo's feedback on it."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Context: The thalidomide tragedy resurrected Kefauver's bill to enhance drug regulation that had stalled in Congress, and the Kefauver-Harris Amendment became law on 10 October 1962. Manufacturers henceforth had to prove to FDA that their drugs were effective as well as safe before they could go on the US market. The FDA received authority to regulate advertising of prescription drugs and to establish good manufacturing practices. The law required that all drugs introduced between 1938 and 1962 had to be effective. An FDA - National Academy of Sciences collaborative study showed that nearly 40 percent of these products were not effective. A similarly comprehensive study of over-the-counter products began ten years later.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: This week I shot my Interview with Claire Bridge. Myself and Riah travelled, I would say all the way out too Wheelers Hill, but it’s really not that far away, unless you live on the North side, which we both do. Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire’s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot. Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire’s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne’s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were. Overall the experience was also, I have a lot of friends who are artists so I hope to do more artist portraits in the future.

Step 1: Understand the Compromise of 1850 The Compromise of 1850 was a series of five bills passed in the United States Congress to resolve disputes related to slavery and territorial expansion. It aimed to address the divisive issue of whether newly acquired territories would allow slavery or not, following the Mexican-American War. Step 2: Identify the key figures Henry Clay, a prominent American statesman and senator, was the initial driving force behind drafting the Compromise of 1850. He crafted a single, comprehensive bill, known as the Omnibus Bill, which included all components of the compromise. Unfortunately, the Omnibus Bill failed to pass due to disagreement among lawmakers. Step 3: Identify who broke the bill into sections Senator Stephen A. Douglas was the one who decided to break the Compromise of 1850 into separate bills, making it more palatable for lawmakers to vote on each individual issue. By doing so, he managed to find support from different factions and coalitions in Congress, ultimately leading to the passage of all five bills. Conclusion: Senator Stephen A. Douglas was the person who broke the Compromise of 1850 into sections, which eventually allowed it to pass in the United States Congress. His strategic approach made it possible for lawmakers to vote on each individual component, leading to the resolution of disputes over slavery and territorial expansion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – How’s this for a stupid study: Researchers at Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest, Hungary, set out to discover the criteria people use when determining that a particular behavior is, well, stupid, Live Science reports. It turns out it doesn't exactly take a rocket scientist: Judging whether something is stupid \\"comes instantaneously,\\" researcher Aczél Balázs says. \\"If one person calls something stupid, there's a high likelihood others will do the same thing.\\" In fact, the rate of agreement was 90%, the Huffington Post notes. Researchers found that behaviors deemed stupid stem from three primary conditions: Overconfidence: You thought you could, but you couldn’t. Lack of control: You knew you shouldn't, but you did. Absent-mindedness: You weren't paying attention. In the study, researchers gathered online anecdotes describing behaviors that had been called stupid. They asked 154 students to read them and determine if they were, indeed, stupid. Then, the students chose reasons why a behavior was stupid from a list. Some interesting takeaways: People with high intelligence aren't necessarily immune to doing stupid things. A determination of stupidity is based on the observer’s expectations for a person’s behavior; the person engaged in stupid behavior may have different expectations. Understanding the causes of stupid behavior may help people warn others from engaging in it—rather than saying, \\"You’re being stupid,\\" one can say \\"You’re being overconfident.\\" No matter what, Balázs tells Live Science, we not only recognize stupidity when we see it, we love to \\"watch other people doing something stupid as a source of amusement.\\" (Stupidity may have thwarted a Nazi invasion of Britain. Can't get enough stupidity? Here.) Article:","output":"Title: The Art of Recognizing Stupidity: How Our Brains Instantly Judge Stupid Behavior Introduction Ever wonder what makes a person's behavior seem stupid? Researchers at Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest, Hungary, investigated the criteria people use to determine when an action appears stupid. Spoiler alert: most people are pretty quick to judge. The explanation behind this swift discernment may lie in three primary conditions that contribute to stupid behavior: overconfidence, lack of control, and absent-mindedness. The Study To explore how people perceive stupidity, researcher Aczél Balázs and his team collected online anecdotes describing behaviors that had been called stupid. They then asked a group of 154 students to read these anecdotes and judge whether or not those behaviors were indeed stupid. The students also had to select the reasons they believed contributed to the actions being considered as such. The study found a significant 90% rate of agreement among the students when it came to labeling a behavior as stupid. This means that the judgment of stupidity \\"comes instantaneously,\\" as Balázs remarked. \\"If one person calls something stupid, there's a high likelihood others will do the same thing.\\" The Three Primary Conditions of Stupid Behavior According to the research, three main conditions lead people to label actions as stupid: 1. Overconfidence: Believing one can do something, but in reality, cannot. 2. Lack of control: Being aware an action is ill-advised but proceeding with it anyway. 3. Absent-mindedness: Not paying attention to the situation. Interestingly, people with high intelligence aren't necessarily immune to engaging in stupid behavior. The determination of stupidity is also based on the observer's expectations for a person's actions; the person displaying the perceived stupid behavior may have different expectations and not realize their actions are being judged as such. Applying the Research to Everyday Life Understanding the causes of stupid behavior might help to better guide and warn others from engaging in it. Rather than labeling someone's actions as \\"stupid,\\" it would be more helpful to address the specific reasons behind the stupidity, such as overconfidence. This approach could potentially lead to enhanced communication and awareness among individuals in social situations. But it's not all serious, as Balázs points out. People love to \\"watch other people doing something stupid as a source of amusement.\\" So, while the research highlights our propensity to judge stupidity swiftly, it also serves as a reminder of the role laughter and amusement play in our lives, often in response to witnessing \\"stupid\\" behavior. Conclusion The study conducted at Eotvos Lorand University provides insight into our cognitive and social processes when it comes to judging stupid behavior. Whether it results from overconfidence, lack of control, or absent-mindedness, the ability to recognize and assess these situations is an innate part of being human. However, by understanding the factors contributing to such behaviors, perhaps we can strive to be more understanding, rather than simply labeling actions as \\"stupid.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The father of a Chechen immigrant killed in Florida... (Associated Press)      Meanwhile, the father of a Chechen immigrant killed in Florida while being interrogated by the FBI about his ties to the slain brother maintained that the U.S. agents killed his son \\"execution-style.\\"      Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, walked without a wheelchair to speak to his mother last week for the first and only phone conversation they have had since he has been in custody, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva told the AP.      In a rare glimpse at Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's state of mind, he told her he was getting better and that he had a very good doctor, but was struggling to understand what happened, she said.      \\"He didn't hold back his emotions either, as if he were screaming to the whole world: What is this? What's happening?,\\" she said.      The April 15 bombings killed three people and wounded more than 260. Elder brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was killed in a shootout with police, and Dzhokhar remains in a prison hospital after being badly wounded.      \\"I could just feel that he was being driven crazy by the unfairness that happened to us, that they killed our innocent Tamerlan,\\" their mother said, standing by the family's insistence that their children are innocent.      The Tsarnaevs met the AP in their new apartment in a 14-story building in a well-to-do area of Makhachkala, the capital of the restive Caucasus province of Dagestan. The apartment had no furniture apart from a TV, a few rugs, and wallpaper materials lying on the floor.      Anzor Tsarnaev, the suspects' father, said they bought it for Tamerlan, his wife, and their young daughter in the expectation that they would move to Makhachkala later this year. He added that they planned to turn their old home in a dingy district on the outskirts of town into a dentist's office, so that Dzhokhar, a dental hygiene student, could work out of it after completing his studies.      \\"All I can do is pray to God and hope that one day fairness will win out, our children will be cleared, and we will at least get Dzhokhar back, crippled, but at least alive,\\" Tsarnaev said.      Separately, at a news conference in Moscow, the father of a 27-year-old mixed martial arts fighter who was killed during FBI questioning accused agents of being \\"bandits\\" who executed his son.      Abdul-Baki Todashev showed journalists 16 photographs that he said were of his son, Ibragim, in a Florida morgue. He said his son had six gunshot wounds to his torso and one to the back of his head and the pictures were taken by his son's friend, Khusen Taramov.      It was not immediately possible to authenticate the photographs.      The FBI says Todashev was being questioned by an FBI agent and two Massachusetts state troopers about his ties to Tamerlan Tsarnaev, as well as about a 2011 triple slaying in Massachusetts.      Three law enforcement officials said initially that Ibragim Todashev had lunged at the FBI agent with a knife, although two of them later said it was no longer clear what had happened.      The father said his son was \\"100 percent unarmed.\\"      Taramov confirmed Thursday that he had taken some pictures of Ibragim Todashev's body at an Orlando funeral home and sent them to the father. He said Ibragim Todashev had a decorative sword with a broken handle, but that it was not a weapon.      \\"The sword wouldn't cut nothing,\\" Tamarov said. \\"I played with it many times. It wasn't sharp from any angle. It would do the same harm as a piece of wood.\\"      The father said Taramov told him that U.S. agents interrogated him on the street while five officials interrogated Todashev in his Florida house for eight hours on May 22, the night he was shot.      Todashev's father said that his son moved to the U.S. in 2008 on a study exchange program and met Tsarnaev at a boxing gym in Boston in 2011, about a year before he moved to Orlando. He said the two were \\"not particularly close friends.\\"      Prior to last month's bombings, Todashev underwent an operation for a sports injury and was on crutches, making it physically impossible for him to have been involved in the bombings, his father said. He added that Todashev had recently received a green card and was planning to return to Chechnya for the summer last Friday, two days after he was killed.      The father said he and his brother were interviewed at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow on Thursday as they sought a visa to take his son's body back to Chechnya.      FBI agents interrogated the younger Todashev twice before the night he was shot, his father said. He said his son told him that he thought Tsarnaev had been set up to take the blame for the bombings.      \\"I'd only seen and heard things like that in the movies _ they shoot somebody and then a shot in the head to make sure,\\" Todashev said.      \\"These just aren't FBI agents, they're bandits,\\" he added.      The FBI wouldn't comment on the claims made by Todashev's father.      The Tsarnaevs' parents have held fast to their belief that their sons were framed. Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, dressed all in black and still visibly distressed, showed AP several YouTube videos on an iPad she claimed cleared her sons. They could not be authenticated by the AP.      \\"I remember when our cat was sick, Tamerlan was sick himself for two days afterward, because he was so worried about her,\\" Tsarnaeva said.      She said Tamerlan told her about Todashev, and that she and her husband had invited him to visit them in Russia, though he never came. Tamerlan later told them that he and Todashev were unlikely to continue training together since they practiced different sports, and he appeared to have lost track of him after Todashev moved to Florida, Tsarnaeva added.      _____      Seddon reported from Moscow.

Sign Up      BOSTON (CBS) – Law enforcement officials are revealing what they say happened just before the deadly FBI shooting in Florida.      Multiple sources tell the I-Team that the suspect, Ibrahim Todashev, flipped over a table, grabbed what appeared to be a metal pole, and lunged at the FBI agent before that agent fired.      Officials say there were four investigators interviewing Todashev that day: Two Massachusetts State Troopers questioning him about the Waltham triple murder, an FBI agent questioning him about Tamerlan Tsarnaev, and a local Florida police officer. They had spoken with him earlier in the day, and then returned that night for a second interview.      At one point, an official says, two of the investigators stepped outside, and one of the state troopers and an FBI agent were left inside with Todashev.      The FBI agent had built up a rapport with Todashev and he was doing most of the questioning.      An official says Todashev was about to provide a written confession to the Waltham murders, when the state trooper who was present, noticed Todashev became agitated and shared that information with the FBI agent through a text message, so Todashev wouldn’t hear what they were discussing.      The official says the FBI agent looked down to read the text message, and at that moment Todashev flipped over a table into the agent and knocked him into the wall.      According to the officials, Todashev then grabbed a pole that was nearby, and started lunging at the agent. The agent shot Todashev two to three times, stopping him momentarily, before the official says Todashev came at the agent again.      The official says that is when the FBI agent shot and killed Todashev. He was treated with several stitches for his cuts from being hit by the table.      There have been other media reports that Todashev used a sword. Sources tell WBZ there had been a sword on the wall, but one of the investigators took it down earlier to get it out of the way. ||||| The ethnic Chechen was being questioned about his ties to a Boston bombing suspect.

Initially, at least one law enforcement official told USA TODAY that Todashev, an ethnic Chechen, was armed with a knife or other sharp object and violently attacked an FBI agent during questioning, which led the agent to open fire.      Abdul-Baki Todashev speaks at a news conference in Moscow on Thursday. (Photo: Alexander Zemlianichenko, AP)      Some news reports Thursday, quoting FBI and law enforcement sources, said Todashev was unarmed when he was shot.      Late Thursday, a more detailed government version of the incident emerged.      Todashev overturned a wooden table, forcefully shoved an FBI agent into a wall and lunged at the agent with a pole, a government official briefed on the incident but not authorized to speak publicly said.      The FBI agent and state troopers had interviewed Todashev earlier that morning, the government official said. That afternoon, when Todashev did not answer his phone, the FBI agent, the two troopers and an Orlando police officer went to his condo, the government official said.      Todashev invited them in and began talking, the official said. As the conversation continued, Todashev indicated he was ready to confess to his involvement in the homicides, so the FBI agent pulled up a table so Todashev could write down his confession, the government official said. Meanwhile, one of the troopers left the room to make a phone call and the Orlando officer accompanied him, the official said.      Todashev became agitated, the government official said. He suddenly stood and flipped the wooden table up, hitting the FBI agent, who was slammed \\"forcefully\\" into the wall, the government official said.      Todashev reached down and picked up a metal pole about the size of a broom handle and swung it at the FBI agent, the official said.      The agent fired two or three shots, hitting Todashev, but Todashev came at him again with the metal pole, the official said. The FBI agent then shot him \\"until he eliminated the threat,\\" the official said. The incident happened in a few seconds, the official said.      The FBI agent was treated at the hospital for injuries, including lacerations that required stitches, the government official said.      An advocacy group is demanding a civil rights investigation into the death of a Chechen immigrant who was shot to death by authorities in central Florida while being questioned about his ties to one of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects. (May 30) AP      At the news conference in Moscow on Thursday, Todashev's father, flanked by Maxim Shevchenko, a member of the Presidential Council of Human Rights, said his son was never a close friend of Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and knew nothing about the attacks in advance.      He called \\"absurd\\" the claims by some U.S. officials that Todashev had attacked an FBI agent.      \\"Maybe my son knew something, some information the police did not want to be made public. Maybe they wanted to silence my son,\\" Todashev's father said.      He said his son was grilled for many hours about the Boston bombings.      \\"They tortured a man for eight hours with no attorney, no witnesses, nobody. We can only guess what was going on there, until there is an official investigation,\\" Todashev said.      Shevchenko told reporters at the news conference that Todashev's killing looked like \\"cold-blooded murder.\\"      The Florida branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations has called for a federal civil rights investigation.      \\"We have confirmed through senior sources within the FBI that Ibragim was indeed unarmed when he was shot seven times in the head, what appear to be even in the back of the head,\\" said Hassan Shibly, executive director of the CAIR Florida. \\"That's very disturbing.\\"      Later, according to the Orlando Sentinel, Shibly told reporters that CAIR has an \\"intermediary\\" who said the FBI told him Todashev was unarmed. Shibly did not identify the intermediary.      Shibly, speaking to reporters in Orlando on Wednesday, said the group was calling for the independent investigation \\"to make sure excessive force was not used against this unarmed individual.\\"      Todashev has not been directly implicated in the April 15 Boston Marathon bombings that killed three people and injured more than 260. The FBI has said only that Todashev, a martial arts enthusiast like Tamerlan Tsarnaev, knew the suspect when he lived in Boston.      Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 27, and his brother, Dzhokhar, 19, were named as suspects in the bombings. Tamerlan died three days after the bombings during a shootout with police that also left Dzhokhar injured.      Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was later captured and charged in connection with the bombings. He is being held at a prison medical center near Boston.

She enrolls Ikuko in a nearby kindergarten and in order to win custody of her daughter, starts working as a proofreader, a job she held before she was married. The ceiling of the apartment has a leak, which worsens on a daily basis. Matsubara complains to the janitor but he does nothing to fix the leak. She then tries to go to the floor above her apartment to find out the root of the leak, and discovers that the apartment is locked. Strange events then happen repeatedly: a red bag with a bunny on the front reappears no matter how often Yoshimi tries to dispose of it. Hair is found in tap water. Yoshimi gets glimpses of a mysterious long-haired girl who is of similar age to her daughter. Yoshimi discovers that the upstairs apartment, the source of the leak, was formerly the home of a girl named Mitsuko Kawai (æ²³å ç¾æ´¥å­ Kawai Mitsuko; Mirei Oguchi), who was Ikuko's age. She had attended the same kindergarten Ikuko now attends. Mitsuko was abandoned by her mother and vanished more than a year ago. One day, Ikuko goes missing and Yoshimi finds her in the apartment upstairs, where the walls are running with water and the entire place is flooded. Convinced something eerie is happening, she decides to move but her lawyer convinces her that moving now would weaken her position greatly in her divorce. One evening, after Yoshimi finds that the red bag has reappeared in Ikuko's school bag, she heads to the roof of the building, and is drawn to the huge water tank. She notices that it was last inspected â and thus opened â over a year ago, on the day Mitsuko was last reported seen. She comes to the horrific realization via a vision that Mitsuko had fallen into the tank while trying to retrieve her red bag, and was thus drowned.

So we have this equation: -665 * k - 467809 + 407294 = 0 First, let's add the big numbers (-467809 and 407294) together: -467809 + 407294 = -60,515 Now our equation looks like this: -665 * k - 60,515 = 0 Next, we want to get rid of the -60,515 on the left side. To do this, we'll add 60,515 to both sides of the equation: -665 * k = 60,515 Now we just need to find out what number \\"k\\" is. To find it, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -665: k = 60,515 / -665 When you do that division, you'll find that: k = -91 So, k = -91 is the solution to the equation.

Can you tell me the answer to what is a good solvent for vegetable oil??","output":"Vegetable oil, being an organic compound, typically follows the principle of \\"like dissolves like.\\" It means that polar substances dissolve in polar solvents, while nonpolar substances are more soluble in nonpolar solvents. Vegetable oil is a nonpolar substance, so a good solvent for it would be a nonpolar or a slightly polar solvent. Here is a list of suitable solvents along with some additional information about each one: 1. Isopropyl alcohol: Also known as rubbing alcohol, isopropyl alcohol is a slightly polar solvent that can dissolve vegetable oil effectively. It is a common household item and is readily available in drugstores. It is widely used as a solvent, disinfectant, and cleaner. 2. Ethanol: Ethanol, also known as ethyl alcohol or grain alcohol, is another slightly polar solvent that is effective in dissolving vegetable oil. It is the same type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages, and it’s often used as a solvent in various industrial processes. It is a more eco-friendly and food-safe option than isopropyl alcohol. 3. Acetone: Acetone, also known as propanone or dimethyl ketone, is a colorless liquid that is used as a solvent in various industries, including pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and plastics. Although not as effective as isopropyl alcohol or ethanol in dissolving vegetable oil, it can be used as an alternative. Be aware that acetone has a strong odor and is highly flammable. 4. Toluene: Toluene is a nonpolar solvent that can dissolve vegetable oil. It is a colorless, water-insoluble liquid used mainly as a solvent in industrial processes. It is highly effective in dissolving vegetable oil, but it is not a food-safe option and should be used with caution due to its toxic nature. 5. Dichloromethane: Dichloromethane, also known as methylene chloride, is a powerful nonpolar solvent that can dissolve vegetable oil with ease. It is used in various industries, such as paint removers, degreasers, and other cleaning applications. However, dichloromethane is toxic and not suitable for home use or in applications where it can come into contact with food. Its use must be strictly controlled. 6. Hexane: Hexane is a nonpolar solvent commonly used to extract edible oils from seeds and other plant materials. It is also used as a solvent in various industrial processes. Hexane is very effective in dissolving vegetable oil but, like dichloromethane, should be used with caution due to its flammable and toxic nature. 7. Diethyl ether: Diethyl ether, sometimes referred to as ether, is a colorless and highly volatile liquid. It is used as a solvent in various industrial and laboratory applications. It can effectively dissolve vegetable oil; however, it is not safe for food or home use due to its flammability and possible harmful health effects. When choosing a solvent for vegetable oil, consider the application, safety concerns, and whether the solvent will come into contact with food. For food-related applications, ethanol or other food-grade solvents would be more appropriate. For non-food purposes, isopropyl alcohol, acetone, or hexane can be used, but always ensure that proper safety precautions are taken while handling potentially toxic or flammable solvents."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Wambugu is especially interested in finding simple ways to produce more food. In the past ten years, Wambugu has spent much of her time studying sweet potatoes, which are an important food in her part of Kenya. A virus   kept attacking the plants. It stopped the sweet potatoes from growing well. Because of the virus, some farmers lost three quarters of their crops. Wambugu went to war against the virus. Her research for a way to save the sweet potatoes led to a lab in St. Louis, Missouri. The lab mainly works on genes  , the chemical \\"computer programs\\" found in the cells of living things. Genes tell a plant to produce pink flowers or an animal to grow black hair. Now scientists have found ways to move genes from one living thing to another. That process is called genetic engineering. Wambugu spent three years in the lab. As a result, she created a sweet potato plant that could fight off the virus. Wambugu tested her research in Kenya, and her plants produced wonderful sweet potatoes. That's just the beginning, Wambugu believes. Genetically modified   foods, she thinks, could help farmers in poor countries grow badly needed crops, thus, fewer people will go hungry.

Homogenized milk has already had its fat molecules broken down before it is sent to the store. If your milk is straight from the cow, you know it hasn’t been homogenized yet. Check the label on your store-bought milk and make sure it says “non-homogenized” on it. You can buy non-homogenized milk at many natural grocery stores or farmers markets. Choose a container that you can make airtight. Mason jars, tupperware containers, or even cups with plastic wrap on top will work. Pour as much milk as you want to skim into your container.  You can purchase mason jars in bulk for a low price at most grocery stores. Use a clear container to make it easier to see the separation line between the milk and the fat. Keep your milk in its container inside of your fridge. The fat will naturally rise to the top as your milk sits undisturbed. Be sure not to shake the milk or move it around as it is sitting. Cold milk takes longer to separate, but leaving milk out at room temperature could cause it to spoil. Once your milk has separated, you will be able to see a layer of cream, or fat, floating at the top of your container. The cream will be a slightly lighter color, and might have small bubbles in it. Once you identify the cream line, you'll know how much cream to skim off the top. Carefully scrape the layer of cream off the top of the milk with a spoon. You can save the cream to use in a recipe or rinse it down the drain. Be careful not to mix the cream back into the milk. You can keep your skim milk in the container that you were using, or transfer it to a separate one. Be sure to store your skim milk at a cold temperature in the fridge. Try putting skim milk into recipes as a healthier alternative to whole milk. Summary:","output":"This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to skim cream from non-homogenized milk by allowing it to separate in a clear, airtight container in the fridge and then carefully removing the cream layer, resulting in skim milk that can be used as a healthier alternative in recipes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Secretary Chertoff says he won't relent \\"for a particular individual\\" Eloisa Tamez says her property has been in her family since 1767. Border town mayor calls the fence \\"a multibillion-dollar speed bump\\" Article:","output":"Title: Landowners Stand Firm Against Government Land Seizure for Border Fence Introduction: The United States government is facing pushback in its efforts to acquire private property for the construction of a border fence, designed to deter illegal immigration and drug smuggling. In particular, Eloisa Tamez, a landowner whose property has been in her family since 1767, is steadfast in her refusal to relinquish her land. This situation has sparked discussions about the effectiveness and morality of the fence project. Landowners Refuse to Relinquish Property: In various parts of the country, landowners are defying the United States government's efforts to appropriate their land for the construction of a border fence. \\"I will never sign any papers giving [the government] permission to come onto my land,\\" Eloisa Tamez says, maintaining that her property, which has been in her family for generations, is immensely valuable to her. Despite the difficulties posed by these protests, Secretary Chertoff has expressed his commitment to the border fence project, stating that he will not be deterred \\"for a particular individual.\\" Historical Importance of the Land: One key point in the landowners' argument is the historical and cultural significance of their properties. Eloisa Tamez's land, for example, has been passed down through her family since 1767. These family ties run deep, with a strong sense of attachment to the land. The proposed border fence would cut through these properties, potentially destroying centuries-old buildings and disrupting the cultural heritage of the region. Border Town Mayor's Critique: The fence project has also faced criticism from local political leaders, such as the mayor of a border town who refers to the fence as \\"a multibillion-dollar speed bump.\\" This sentiment highlights the belief that the costly project will not be effective in stopping illegal immigration or drug smuggling. Opponents of the fence also argue that investing in more advanced technology, such as ground sensors and cameras, would be a better use of resources. Conclusion: As the United States government continues its pursuit to acquire land for the construction of a border fence, private landowners and local leaders are not backing down. With historical and cultural significance serving as the backdrop to these disputes, the debate regarding the effectiveness and necessity of the border fence will continue. As contentious as this issue may be, it raises questions about the right way to address perceived problems at the border while respecting individual property rights and cultural heritage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A: These include the flying buttresses, pinnacles and traceried windows which typify Gothic ecclesiastical architecture.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"Yes, the answer correctly addresses the question by providing examples of Gothic-style elements that were incorporated due to technological innovation. To give a more detailed and long response, let's dive deeper into these innovations: One of the most significant technological innovations in Gothic architecture was the development and application of the flying buttress. Flying buttresses are arched exterior supports that transfer the weight of the vaulted ceilings and walls outward and downward to massive piers or columns. As a result, these structures allowed for thinner walls, larger windows, and higher ceilings, which enabled the creation of more extensive stained glass windows, a defining feature of Gothic cathedrals. The widespread use of flying buttresses greatly impacted the visual aesthetic of Gothic architecture, as they allowed for more elaborate and detailed designs in the exterior. They helped create tall, slender structures with intricate and decorative elements while still providing structural support. This characteristic enabled Gothic architects to experiment with different visual balances and structural forms, contributing to the unique ornate style associated with Gothic architecture. The pinnacle is another example of a Gothic-style element that was incorporated due to technological innovations. Pinnacles are tall, slender, and pointed elements that are often placed at the corners of buildings or atop flying buttresses. They serve both as decorative features and structural reinforcements, providing additional weight to stabilize the flying buttresses and helping to resist wind forces. Pinnacles were a product of the advancements in stone carving, as their intricate and delicate nature demanded precise craftsmanship and technological improvements in quarrying and shaping stone. Traceried windows, another characteristic feature of Gothic architecture, were also made possible by technological innovations. Traceried windows are elaborate, decorative windows with patterns of stone divisions (called tracery) that create a visual effect both inside and outside the building. The development of more advanced stone-cutting techniques allowed artisans to create these intricate geometric designs without compromising the structural integrity of the window. Tracery designs often included elements like quatrefoils, trefoils, and ogee arches, contributing to the iconic visual language of Gothic architecture. In summary, Gothic architecture incorporated numerous style elements, such as flying buttresses, pinnacles, and traceried windows, through the advancements in technological innovation. The development of new construction techniques and the craftsmanship allowed architects to create visually stunning and structurally sound buildings that have endured for centuries, reflecting the brilliance of the Gothic style and its impact on architectural history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a dialog based on this summary: Angelo doesn't like Henry's design. .","output":"Step 1: Identify the setting and characters Since the summary doesn't provide much information about the characters or setting, I will assume that Angelo and Henry are both professionals working together on a design project. The setting is their office or workspace. Step 2: Establish their roles I will assume that Angelo is a senior designer who is reviewing the design created by Henry, a junior designer who respects Angelo's experience and expertise. Step 3: Identify the key issues Angelo doesn't like Henry's design and probably wants to express his concerns and suggestions for improvement. Step 4: Determine the tone and atmosphere The tone of the conversation can be professional and constructive, with Angelo supporting his viewpoint with instances from the design itself, while Henry listens and responds to Angelo's critique. Step 5: Create the dialog Angelo: Hey Henry, I had a chance to look at your design for the website. Can we talk about it for a minute? Henry: Of course, Angelo. I appreciate your feedback. Angelo: First of all, I appreciate the hard work you put into this. I like the overall layout and how you've managed to cover all the client's requirements. However, there are a few things I think we need to change. Henry: Sure, what do you suggest? Angelo: I don't think the color palette you've chosen works well with the brand's identity. The colors are a bit too bright and could be distracting to users. I suggest using more muted tones that will complement the brand's logo and create a more cohesive visual experience. Henry: I see what you mean. I chose those colors to grab attention, but I can see how it might be overwhelming. I'll try some different colors and see how it looks. Angelo: Another thing is the typography. It's important that the font choices are easily readable and convey a professional tone. The current font doesn't quite achieve that balance. Consider using a more understated font that still has some personality, but doesn't take away from the content. Henry: I completely agree. I think I got a bit carried away trying to make the design unique. I'll explore some other font options and make it more legible. Angelo: That's great. Lastly, the navigation menu needs some work. It should be more intuitive and provide clear paths for the user to access the main sections of the website. Try to streamline it and simplify the user journey. Henry: You're right. I'll revise the menu and make sure it's easy to navigate. Thanks for your feedback, Angelo. I'll get started on the revisions right away and share the updated design with you. Angelo: No problem, Henry. I know you can improve it. Just keep the user experience and brand identity in mind while refining the design. Good luck!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: [i] negative; [ii] positive; Short movie review: seriousness and quality  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"Based on the provided information, it is slightly challenging to determine with absolute certainty whether the critic thought positively or negatively about the movie. Nonetheless, I will provide a detailed analysis to help you understand better.  The phrase \\"short movie review\\" suggests that the critic has offered a concise evaluation of the film, and it does not reveal their opinion directly. However, understanding the keywords \\"seriousness\\" and \\"quality\\" could provide clues about the critic's perspective. [i] Negative view: If the critic addressed the film's \\"seriousness\\" with a negative connotation, they may have found the film overly grave or depressing, failing to provide ample entertainment or lighter moments, thus leading to an unsatisfactory viewing experience. In this case, the critic's mention of \\"quality\\" could refer to the perceived lack of balance in tone or inferior production aspects, such as poor direction, unconvincing performances, or weak storytelling. [ii] Positive view: On the other hand, if the critic viewed the film's \\"seriousness\\" as a positive trait, they might have appreciated the mature themes, thought-provoking subject matter, or engaging drama, which contributed to a well-crafted and meaningful cinematic experience. In this scenario, the term \\"quality\\" would likely refer to the film's high production values, compelling narrative, exceptional performances, and skillful direction that resulted in a polished and memorable movie. In conclusion, the critic's opinion on the movie's \\"seriousness\\" and \\"quality\\" could lead to either a positive or negative review, and additional context is needed to determine their precise stance. It is important to analyze specific phrases or statements made within the review to more accurately gauge whether the critic leaned more towards a positive or negative assessment of the film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Where do I acquire a letter of credit from? What is a letter of credit? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"A letter of credit is a financial instrument used in international trade to mitigate risk and ensure that sellers receive payment for their goods or services. They are particularly useful in cross-border transactions, as they provide a level of security and certainty for both the buyers and the sellers involved. A letter of credit is essentially a written commitment from a bank, on behalf of the buyer, guaranteeing payment to the seller under the terms and conditions specified in the letter. To acquire a letter of credit, you should follow these steps: 1. Choose a bank: Find a financial institution that offers letters of credit services. This is generally a bank with which you have an existing business relationship or one that is experienced in handling international trade transactions. You can approach your current bank or search for a bank that specializes in trade finance. 2. Provide necessary information: Complete the bank's application form for a letter of credit (sometimes referred to as the \\"Letter of Credit Application and Agreement\\"). On this form, you will need to provide information such as:    - The full name and address of the beneficiary (the seller)    - The amount and currency of the letter of credit    - A description of the goods or services to be purchased    - The shipping terms (Incoterms) and any related insurance requirements    - The expiration date and place for the presentation of documents 3. Submit supporting documents: In addition to the application form, the bank may require you to submit various supporting documents such as:    - Purchase order, contract, or pro forma invoice between the buyer and the seller    - Financial statements or business plans, particularly for new businesses or those seeking a large letter of credit    - Evidence of creditworthiness, such as personal or business credit reports 4. Await bank review and approval: Once the application and supporting documents have been submitted, the bank will review the information and determine whether to issue the letter of credit. This process may involve checking your creditworthiness, the feasibility of the transaction, and compliance with local and international regulations. 5. Pay fees and secure collateral: Upon approval, you will need to pay the fees associated with the issuance of a letter of credit. These fees may vary depending on the bank, complexity of the transaction, and the specific terms of the letter of credit. Additionally, the bank may require you to provide collateral (such as cash, property, or other assets) to secure the letter of credit, particularly if the bank believes there may be risks associated with the transaction. 6. Receive and review the issued letter of credit: After the bank issues the letter of credit, you should review the document carefully to ensure that all the terms and conditions are accurate and consistent with your agreement with the seller. Provide a copy of the letter of credit to the seller and make sure they understand and agree with its terms. In conclusion, the questions you asked do not have the same meaning. The first question asks where you can acquire a letter of credit, while the second question asks for the definition of a letter of credit. Acquiring a letter of credit involves following certain steps with a financial institution that issues such letters, while understanding a letter of credit revolves around grasping its purpose, uses, and role in international trade transactions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Atlantic City was incorporated on May 1, 1854, from portions of Egg Harbor Township and Galloway Township. The city borders Absecon, Brigantine, Pleasantville, Ventnor City and West Atlantic City.  Because of its location in South Jersey, hugging the Atlantic Ocean between marshlands and islands, Atlantic City was viewed by developers as prime real estate and a potential resort town. In 1853, the first commercial hotel, The Belloe House, located at Massachusetts and Atlantic Avenue, was built.  The city was incorporated in 1854, the same year in which the Camden and Atlantic Railroad train service began. Built on the edge of the bay, this served as the direct link of this remote parcel of land with Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. That same year, construction of the Absecon Lighthouse, designed by George Meade of the Corps of Topographical Engineers, was approved, with work initiated the next year. By 1874, almost 500,000 passengers a year were coming to Atlantic City by rail. In Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times, and Corruption of Atlantic City, \\"Atlantic City's Godfather\\" Nelson Johnson describes the inspiration of Dr. Jonathan Pitney (the \\"Father of Atlantic City\\") to develop Atlantic City as a health resort, his efforts to convince the municipal authorities that a railroad to the beach would be beneficial, his successful alliance with Samuel Richards (entrepreneur and member of the most influential family in southern New Jersey at the time) to achieve that goal, the actual building of the railroad, and the experience of the first 600 riders, who \\"were chosen carefully by Samuel Richards and Jonathan Pitney\\": Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1.

Output:","output":"Task explanation: You are given a math problem involving the number of people who purchased books A and B. You must find the number of people (C) who purchased only book A. Step 1: Understand the given information - The number of people who purchased book A is twice the number of people who purchased book B. - The number of people who purchased both books A and B is 500. - The number of people who purchased only book B is half the number of people who purchased both books A and B. Step 2: Set up equations based on the given information Let A be the number of people who purchased book A. Let B be the number of people who purchased book B. Let X be the number of people who purchased only book B. You are asked to find the number of people C who purchased only book A. From the given information, you can form the following equations: 1. A = 2B (since the number of people who purchased book A is twice the number of people who purchased book B) 2. A + B - 500 = C (since the 500 people who purchased both books should be removed to find the people who purchased only book A) 3. 500 = 2X (since the number of people who purchased only book B is half the number of people who purchased both books A and B) Step 3: Solve the equations First, we'll solve Equation 3: 500 = 2X X = 250 (This indicates that 250 people purchased only book B) Now, we'll plug the value of X in Equation 2: A + B - 500 = C A + 250 - 500 = C (Since X = 250) A - 250 = C Next, we'll substitute A from Equation 1 into the equation above: 2B - 250 = C Step 4: Find B using the information given We know that the number of people who purchased both books A and B is 500, which is twice the number of people who purchased only book B. So: 500 = 2(250) (Since 250 people purchased only book B) 500 = 500 (The equation holds true, so our value for B is correct) Step 5: Find A using the value of B Now that we found B, we can find A using Equation 1: A = 2B A = 2(250) A = 500 Step 6: Find C using the values of A and B Finally, we can find C using the equation from Step 3: C = A - 250 C = 500 - 250 C = 250 Output: The number of people C who purchased only book A is 250."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given these facts, what do earthworms do among the following options: - Start fires  - reproduce  - Destroy earth  - Move to another area  - Converting waste.  - Create earth  - competing for resources  - Help plants grow A:","output":"Earthworms play several crucial roles in the ecosystem, particularly in enhancing soil quality and promoting plant growth. Among the options provided, their primary functions include reproduction, converting waste, and helping plants grow. Let us explore these roles in detail, along with a few more critical functions that earthworms serve. 1. Reproduction: Earthworms reproduce by producing cocoons, which encase the young worms, providing them with necessary nutrients in their early stages. A healthy population of earthworms helps maintain their vital functions in the ecosystem. 2. Converting waste: Earthworms consume organic matter and waste, such as dead leaves, decaying plants, and detritus. Through a process called digestion, they break down this matter into simpler compounds and excrete nutrient-rich castings. These castings, or worm poop, form a large part of the organic matter in soil, making it more fertile and capable of supporting healthier plant growth. 3. Help plants grow: The nutrient-rich castings produced by earthworms, along with their tunneling activities, help enhance soil structure and aeration. Air and water can penetrate the soil more easily, improving root penetration and nutrient uptake by plants. Additionally, earthworms help in the distribution of nutrients throughout the soil layers, ensuring that plants have access to them at different root depths. 4. Soil formation: Earthworms contribute to soil formation by turning and mixing the different layers. Their burrowing and feeding activities help bring mineral-rich subsoil to the surface, mixing it with organic materials. This process enriches the topsoil and provides a fertile environment for plant growth. 5. Enhancing microbial activity: The gut of earthworms is home to various beneficial microorganisms, which assist in breaking down organic matter into simpler compounds. When earthworms excrete their castings, these microorganisms are introduced into the soil, where they further contribute to nutrient cycling and overall soil health. Though earthworms may move to another area when environmental conditions become unfavorable, this activity doesn't fall within their most critical functions. As for the other options like starting fires, destroying earth, creating earth, and competing for resources, these do not pertain to the roles of earthworms in the ecosystem. In conclusion, earthworms primarily reproduce, convert waste, and help plants grow by participating in vital processes such as soil formation, enhancing microbial activity, and improving soil structure. All these functions contribute to the health of the ecosystem and support overall biodiversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Premise: \\"Sure thing they would!\\" This statement implies that there is certainty in the belief that a particular action, event or behavior would occur. It represents a confidence in its occurrence and serves as the basis for drawing conclusions. Hypothesis: \\"No, they wouldn't.\\" This statement, on the other hand, proposes the opposite outcome, suggesting that the particular action, event or behavior would not occur. It is an alternative explanation or prediction that contradicts the premise or the existing belief. Now, let's determine if it's possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. In this case, both the premise and hypothesis represent opposing viewpoints or outcomes. They are mutually exclusive, meaning that if one of them is true, the other must be false. This is because the premise asserts a positive belief in the occurrence of something while the hypothesis suggests the exact opposite occurrence. Given this relationship, if the premise is true (i.e., it is a sure thing that they would do something or something would happen), it is not possible for the hypothesis to be true simultaneously (i.e., they wouldn't do that thing, or it wouldn't happen), as they cannot both be true at the same time. However, it's important to note that although the premise and hypothesis represent opposing viewpoints, this does not mean that they entirely nullify each other - there is always the possibility that both the premise and the hypothesis are incorrect. What it does mean is that they cannot both be true together given their contradictory nature. In conclusion, it is not possible to determine that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. They represent opposing outcomes and are mutually exclusive. If the premise is true, it likely means that the hypothesis is false, and vice versa. However, it's crucial to remember that the truth of one does not necessarily establish the validity of the other, as both could be incorrect. In any situation, it's important to gather evidence, test assumptions, and use logic and reasoning when determining the truth of a premise or hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bride-to-be hijacks live BBC broadcast A rowdy bride-to-be momentarily stole the limelight from the Rio Olympics by hijacking a live cross on the BBC overnight. Presenter Dan Walker was trying to update British viewers on all the action from Saturday but had to raise his voice to be heard above a boozy chorus of singing hens night revellers. \\"It look like some sort of hens do. Can we have a look,\\" Walker said as the camera panned across to a group of singing and dancing Brazilian women. As Walker pointed to the bride she didn't hesitate to seize the spotlight, asking the reporter where he was from as she ducked under a barrier to gate crash the broadcast. After exchanging pleasantries the bride, named Maria, said she was getting married on 17 September as her friends chanted her name in the background. She then used the opportunity to send a message to her soon to be husband. \\"I love you so much,\\" she said. \\"You are my love love love.\\" Maria then told viewers to watch the BBC before having her cohort close the segment by chanting the broadcaster's name. © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2016 Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"A fun bride-to-be named Maria joined a live BBC broadcast about the Rio Olympics, and used the opportunity to tell her soon-to-be husband how much she loved him while her friends cheered for her."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The concept of God as described by most theologians includes the attributes of omniscience (infinite knowledge), omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere), divine simplicity, and as having an eternal and necessary existence. Many theologians also describe God as being omnibenevolent (perfectly good) and all loving.  - Hebrew Bible or Hebrew Scriptures is the term used by biblical scholars to refer to the \\"Tanakh\\", the canonical collection of Jewish texts, which is the common textual source of several canonical editions of the Christian Old Testament. They are composed mainly in Biblical Hebrew, with some passages in Biblical Aramaic (in the books of Daniel, Ezra and a few others).  - An oven is a thermally insulated chamber used for the heating, baking or drying of a substance, and most commonly used for cooking. Kilns and furnaces are special-purpose ovens, used in pottery and metalworking, respectively.  - The Israelites (\\"Bnei Yisra'el\\") were a Semitic-speaking people of the ancient Near East, who inhabited a part of Canaan during the tribal and monarchic periods. The ancient Israelites are considered to be an outgrowth of the indigenous Canaanite populations that long inhabited the Southern Levant, Syria, ancient Israel and the Transjordan.  - Hebrew (\\"\\" or ) is a language native to Israel, spoken by over 9 million people worldwide, of whom over 5 million are in Israel. Historically, it is regarded as the language of the Israelites and their ancestors, although the language was not referred to by the name Hebrew in the Tanakh. The earliest examples of written Paleo-Hebrew date from the 10th century BCE. Hebrew belongs to the West Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family. The Hebrew language is the only living Canaanite language left.  - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?  - Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\". Different religions may or may not contain various elements, ranging from the \\"divine\\", \\"sacred things\\", \\"faith\\", a \\"supernatural being or supernatural beings\\" or \\"some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life.\\"  - A Cheder ( alternatively , Cheider , in Hebrew  , meaning \`\` room '' ) is a traditional elementary school teaching the basics of Judaism and the Hebrew language .  - The Torah (\\"instruction, teaching\\"), or in Christianity, the Pentateuch (\\"five books\\"), is the central reference of the religious Judaic tradition. It has a range of meanings. It can most specifically mean the first five books of the twenty-four books of the Tanakh, and it usually includes the rabbinic commentaries ('). The term \\"Torah\\" means instruction and offers a way of life for those who follow it; it can mean the continued narrative from Book of Genesis to the end of the Tanakh, and it can even mean the totality of Jewish teaching, culture and practice. Common to all these meanings, Torah consists of the foundational narrative of Jewish peoplehood: their call into being by God, their trials and tribulations, and their covenant with their God, which involves following a way of life embodied in a set of moral and religious obligations and civil laws (').  - Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\"  - Judaism (from , derived from Greek , originally from Hebrew , \\"Yehudah\\", \\"Judah\\"; in Hebrew: , \\"Yahadut\\", the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos) encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people. Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship that God established with the Children of Israel. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth-largest religion in the world.  - Israel , officially known as the State of Israel, is a country in the Middle East, on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea. It has land borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively, and Egypt to the southwest. The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel's financial and technology center is Tel Aviv, while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem, although the state's sovereignty over the city of Jerusalem is internationally unrecognized.  - The Talmud (Hebrew: ' \\"instruction, learning\\", from a root ' \\"teach, study\\") is a central text of Rabbinic Judaism. It is also traditionally referred to as, a Hebrew abbreviation of ', the \\"six orders\\", a reference to the six orders of the Mishnah. The term \\"Talmud\\" normally refers to the collection of writings named specifically the Babylonian Talmud \\"(Talmud Bavli)\\", although there is also an earlier collection known as the Jerusalem Talmud, or Palestinian Talmud\\"' \\"(Talmud Yerushalmi)\\". When referring to post-biblical periods, namely those of the creation of the Talmud, the Talmudic academies and the Babylonian exilarchate, Jewish sources use the term \\"Babylonia\\" long after it had become obsolete in geopolitical terms.  - The Tanakh (or ; also \\"Tenakh\\", \\"Tenak\\", \\"Tanach\\") or Mikra or Hebrew Bible is the canonical collection of Jewish texts, which is also a textual source for the Christian Old Testament. These texts are composed mainly in Biblical Hebrew, with some passages in Biblical Aramaic (in the books of Daniel, Ezra and a few others). The traditional Hebrew text is known as the Masoretic Text. The Tanakh consists of twenty-four books.  - In Judaism, the midrash (pl.

Johnson is a justice on California's Second District Court of Appeal. Lash and Johnson are co-chairs of the California Commission on Access to Justice. The full report can be viewed at (www.calbar.org). In her year-long odyssey through the California justice system, Katherine, a 35-year-old single mother with three children, experienced failure at every turn. Leaving her abusive husband, she moved into the only apartment she could afford, and soon discovered a broken toilet and non- working oven, rats and roaches, and a fourthfloor landing with no railing. She began withholding rent pending repairs her landlord refused to make, but then her Medi-Cal benefits were cut off when she could not provide rent receipts. She lost health care for her children and herself, although she is a borderline diabetic in need of medication and her children were suffering from rat bites. Katherine tried to seek help through the courts. Representing herself at an administrative hearing, she lost her appeal to restore Medi-Cal benefits because she did not have proper documentation of the rent account. When she went to a courthouse to file a complaint against her landlord, she found the process so confusing that she gave up and went home. According to \\"The Path to Justice: A Five-Year Status Report on Access to Justice in California,\\" prepared by the California Commission on Access to Justice, Katherine is just one of 4.6 million poor Californians whose basic civil legal needs -- often involving such critical needs as housing, health care, education, employment, safety and transportation -- are not being addressed. California has a critical dearth of legal services for the poor, and, as this report makes clear, it is imperative that the state join with the federal government and private funders to increase resources so that all Californians, regardless of income, have equal access to our justice system. Our justice system is predicated on the assumption that both parties will be represented by lawyers who act as gatekeepers and guides through a complex legal system that would otherwise be inaccessible to many of us. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable members of our society are the least able to afford legal services. California does have a strong network of legal aid organizations that try to help meet the needs of the poor, but there's just one legal aid lawyer available per 10,000 poor people. We may promise \\"justice for all,\\" but for those who can't afford a lawyer, that promise is often a lie. In its new report, the Commission on Access to Justice notes some significant steps toward providing equal access to justice for all Californians.

Labour MP Steve McCabe requested an inquiry last year after it was reported that a business Mr Schapps co-founded was selling ‘plagiarising’ software which helps firms boost profits by breaching Google’s rules.

His businesses are getting looked at and people are talking about a letter that mentioned something about “fraud.” In this sentence, we find out what people from Shapps's side are saying about all this. This follows directly from the previous part of the story, so it makes sense as the next sentence. All the other choices aren't right.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Parents fear they are putting too much pressure on their daughters to reach their academic potential, the president of a girls' school body has said. Incoming Girls School Association head Jill Berry said parents were worried about achieving a balance between school achievement and happiness.  Mrs. Berry also said that girls could put themselves under a lot of pressure. A poll of 1000 parents surveyed for the association said their top concern was their daughter's education. Girls tend to outperform boys in all stages of their education, and this can lead schools to assume all girls will do well.  Mrs. Berry said, \\"There is no doubt that many mothers and fathers are worried about getting the balance right between their daughters realizing their academic potential while at the same time being happy and safe.\\" Mrs. Berry said in her experience girls had very high expectations of themselves. \\"That's a positive thing and we want them to aim high. But sometimes we do find a girl is being unrealistic in her aspirations or putting herself under unreasonable pressure. It's not necessarily pushy parents--it can come from the girls themselves.\\"  But parents, too, wanted support to get the balance right between caring and being involved in their children's lives and not being \\"helicopter parents\\", she added.  Women could be perfectionists and it was important to encourage girls to listen to their body, which could give warning signs of too much stress, she added. \\"Bright motivated high achieving girls with high expectations of themselves are more susceptible   to eating disorders,\\" Mrs. Berry said, \\"But girls' schools are usually very good at dealing with these things.\\"  It was a teacher's job to help girls \\"to have it all\\", but to help them deal with inevitable   disappointments as well, she said.

But I also know that it hasn't always been easy for you and Mom, and that as excited as you both are about that new puppy, it doesn't make up for all the time we've been apart. I know how much I've missed these past two years, and today I want to tell you a little more about why I decided to take our family on this _  When I was a young man, I thought life was all about me--about how I'd make my way in the world, become successful, and get the things I want. But then the two of you came into my world with all your curiosity and mischief and those smiles that never fail to fill my heart and light up my day. And suddenly, all my big plans for myself didn't seem so important anymore. I soon found that the greatest joy in my life was the joy I saw in yours. And I realized that my own life wouldn't count for much unless I was able to ensure that you had every opportunity for happiness and fulfillment in yours. In the end, girls, that's why I ran for President: because of what I want for you and for every child in this nation. I want all our children to go to schools worthy of their potential--schools that challenge them, inspire them, and instill in them a sense of wonder about the world around them. I want them to have the chance to go to college--even if their parents aren't rich. And I want them to get good jobs: jobs that pay well and give them benefits like health care, jobs that let them spend time with their own kids and retire with dignity. I want us to push the boundaries of discovery so that you'll live to see new technologies and inventions that improve our lives and make our planet cleaner and safer. And I want us to push our own human boundaries to reach beyond the divides of race and region, gender and religion that keep us from seeing the best in each...

Movie plot title: The Prophecy 3: The Ascent Movie plot: Danyael Rosales, a street preacher who thinks God doesn't care about anyone because of the death of his parents Valerie Rosales and the angel Danyael from the previous film. He is then forced to face his destiny. As a Nephilim, he has some of the angels' abilities, such as regeneration, and can only be killed if his heart is removed. One night, a blind assassin shoots Danyael as he preaches before a crowd, but the assassin is driven off before he can take out Danyael's heart. As punishment for his failure, Zophael kills the assassin and starts going after Danyael himself with an extendable bladed weapon (the blade can be turned into a three-pronged hook) with which he plans to use to remove Danyael's heart, killing him for good. However, Danyael is protected by Gabriel, a now-human fallen angel who killed Danyael's father and performed many misdeeds. After being defeated by Danyael's mother, Gabriel was turned into a human as punishment. He has spent eighteen years as a human, and realized how wrong he was in the past so has now switched sides.Zophael manages to convince Danyael's girlfriend Maggie to work with him on killing Danyael, but she realizes she's on the wrong side and tries to shoot the angel. It has little effect on Zophael, and he tells her what he is. Frightened, Maggie agrees to help him, and the two catch up to Danyael on a Native American reservation, where he is going to confront Pyriel, another angel who wants to overthrow God. Danyael briefly meets Mary, a Native American woman (first introduced as a child in the first film). Mary informs Danyael that she dreamed of his coming, and that she believes he will be victorious against Pyriel. After parting from Mary, Danyael is attacked by Zophael, crashing Maggie's truck and badly injuring her. He then faces off against Danyael in battle, and seemingly defeats him by impaling his chest with a motorcycle tailpipe, but the angel gets back up and uses his weapon to impale Danyael from behind.

If we look at someone else's body, we can often tell how they are feeling by their body signals. So reading body language signals is a great tool in daily communication. In case  you don't think that learning how to read and use body language is important, here are some numbers for you. 7% of the information we receive is from what people actually say, and 38% of the information we receive is from the tone  and the speed of their voice; while 55% of the information we receive is from their body language. These non-verbal  signals will help you a lot, but you still need to focus on what people are saying. If you focus too much on their body language signals, you and the person may feel uncomfortable. It is useful to be able to read people's body language, but it is useful to learn how to send the right signals and avoid the wrong signals too. Body language may be given several interpretations. Many signals have different meanings, depending on the person and the situation. Be sure of it when you are trying to read a body language signal.

Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. Why did the author change his views about what was the best representation of himself? - after he read Huck Finn his perspective changed - after he read Anne Dillard his perspective changed - not enough information - after he read Tom Sawyer his perspective changed Answer:","output":"The author changed his views about what was the best representation of himself after reading a quote by Annie Dillard that states, \\"How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives.\\" This quote made the author realize that the way they spent their days, rather than their internal list of characteristics, ultimately determined who they were or how they had spent their life.

The Draags are an alien race which is humanoid in shape but a hundred times larger than humans, with blue skin, fan-like earlobes and huge, protruding red eyes. The Draags also live much longer than human beings one Draag week equals a human year. Some Oms are domesticated as pets, but others run wild, and are periodically exterminated. The Draags' treatment of the Oms is ironically contrasted with their high level of technological and spiritual development.The story opens with a woman running, occasionally looking behind her as if pursued. An enormous hand descends and blocks her way. She runs back the way she came and finds her way blocked by another hand. It becomes apparent that she is being toyed with by entities that do not appreciate her fragility, and as she dies, the infant she has been carrying and attempting to protect begins to cry.The view changes to reveal the Draag children who have accidentally killed the woman; they leave quickly when an adult Draag and child approach.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 6*q + 137*q + 1287 = 0 for q.","output":"To solve the given equation 6*q + 137*q + 1287 = 0 for q, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. The equation has two terms containing the variable q, which are 6*q and 137*q. We can combine these two terms. 6*q + 137*q = (6 + 137)*q = 143*q So now the equation becomes: 143*q + 1287 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable q. We want to isolate q on one side of the equation. In order to do this, we will need to subtract 1287 from both sides of the equation. 143*q + 1287 - 1287 = 0 - 1287 This simplifies to: 143*q = -1287 Step 3: Solve for q. Now we have an equation with q isolated on one side. In order to solve for q, we will divide both sides of the equation by 143. 143*q/143 = -1287/143 This results in: q = -1287/143 Step 4: Simplify the fraction. To simplify the fraction -1287/143, we can check if both the numerator and denominator have any common factors. Indeed, both numbers are divisible by 11. -1287 ÷ 11 = -117 143 ÷ 11 = 13 So the simplified fraction is: q = -117/13 Step 5: Divide the fraction. Now we can divide -117 by 13 to find the value of q. q = -117 ÷ 13 q = -9 So the solution to the equation 6*q + 137*q + 1287 = 0 is q = -9."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which particle would have lower temperature, particle A or particle B?  David is a physicist. He teaches school children how matters and energy work. One day he was teaching them about two particles of matter, particle A and particle B. Particle A moves faster, but particle B moves slower. He was showing the children about different characteristics of moving particles.  Hint: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. Answer:","output":"Particle B would have a lower temperature."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Just a day after this announcement, Fury's licence to box has been temporarily revoked, putting his career on hold as he focuses on his mental health. Step 1: Provide background information on Tyson Fury and his career. Tyson Fury, a British professional boxer, has been making waves in the world of boxing since his debut in 2008. Over the course of his career, Fury has claimed several titles, including the WBA, IBF, WBO, and IBO heavyweight championships. Known for his aggressive fighting style and showmanship, Fury has become a force to be reckoned with in the ring. Step 2: Discuss his decision to give up his world heavyweight titles. On October 10th, Tyson Fury made the decision to give up his heavyweight titles, citing mental health issues as the primary reason. This bold move has been met with mixed reactions from the boxing community, with some people commending Fury for prioritizing his mental well-being, while others express disappointment at the loss of a champion fighter. Step 3: Explain the temporary revocation of Fury's boxing licence. In a surprising turn of events, just one day after Fury gave up his titles, the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) temporarily revoked his licence to fight. This decision leaves Fury's future in the sport uncertain, as he will no longer be permitted to compete in professional matches until his licence is reinstated. Step 4: Delve into the boxer's mental health struggles. Fury has been open about his battles with mental health, including depression and substance abuse. In recent interviews, he has discussed the pressures of being a world champion and the toll it has taken on his emotional well-being. In giving up his titles, Fury has made the decision to prioritize his mental health and focus on recovery. Step 5: Discuss reactions from the boxing community and fans. The boxing community has been abuzz with reactions to Fury's difficult decision. Prominent boxing world figures, such as promoter Frank Warren and fellow heavyweight Anthony Joshua, have expressed support for Fury's choice to put his mental health first. Fans of the athlete have also taken to social media to voice their concern and show their support for the fighter. Step 6: Consider the future of Tyson Fury's boxing career. As Tyson Fury steps back from the ring to focus on his well-being, the future of his boxing career remains uncertain. With his licence to box temporarily revoked, Fury's return to the sport will be contingent on the BBBofC's decision to reinstate his boxing privileges. In the meantime, it is crucial that Fury receives the support and understanding from the boxing community as he navigates this challenging period in his life. Conclusion: Tyson Fury's decision to relinquish his world heavyweight titles and focus on his mental health demonstrates the importance of self-care and awareness in an industry that is known for its physical and emotional demands. While boxing will undoubtedly miss one of its brightest stars, Fury's choice to prioritize his personal well-being sets a powerful example, reminding us that even the strongest competitors are human beings with vulnerabilities and struggles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The term originated in the 19th century but is often applied to music that is older than that. Some types of folk music are also called world music. \\"Traditional folk music\\" has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, or music performed by custom over a long period of time. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles.  - The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a British public service broadcaster. It is headquartered at Broadcasting House in London, is the world's oldest national broadcasting organisation, and is the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees, with over 20,950 staff in total, of whom 16,672 are in public sector broadcasting; including part-time, flexible as well as fixed contract staff, the total number is 35,402.  - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.  - The V Shows is a live album/DVD recorded at the London Astoria by rock band Mostly Autumn. It was recorded on the tour supporting their 2003 release \\"Passengers\\". The DVD for this show was also included in their 2005 DVD release \\"Pink Floyd Revisited\\". Also, this is the first Mostly Autumn release to feature drummer Andrew Jennings.  - Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London. They achieved international acclaim with their progressive and psychedelic music. Distinguished by their use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, extended compositions and elaborate live shows, they are one of the most commercially successful and influential groups in the history of popular music.  - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards.  - Psychedelic music (sometimes psychedelia) covers a range of popular music styles and genres influenced by the 1960s psychedelic culture, a subculture of people who used psychedelic drugs such as LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, mescaline and DMT to experience visual and auditory hallucinations, synesthesia and altered states of consciousness. Psychedelic music attempted to replicate the hallucinogenic experience of using these drugs or enhance the experience of using them. Psychedelic music emerged during the mid-1960s among folk rock and blues rock bands in the United States and Britain.  - The London Astoria was a music venue, located at 157 Charing Cross Road, in London, England. It had been leased and run by Festival Republic since 2000. It was closed on 15 January 2009 and has since been demolished. The venue is still seen today as an iconic music establishment, as it helped to launch the careers of many British rock bands and also played a part in the UK success of many international acts. It was also a famous venue in Britain's LGBT scene, for holding London's biggest gay new year parties along with G-A-Y.  - Mostly Autumn are an English rock band. The group formed in 1995 and have built their reputation through constant touring, never signing to a major label. They produce music heavily influenced by 1970s progressive rock. According to the BBC, Mostly Autumn \\"fuse the music of Genesis and Pink Floyd with Celtic themes, hard rock and strong, emotional melodies\\". They have also been compared with other progressive bands such as Jethro Tull and Camel, blended with traditional folk music. Later albums also include more contemporary influences.  - Pink Floyd Revisited is a live DVD recorded by rock band Mostly Autumn in 2004 .

Additionally, the 'V Shows' DVD, another live album/DVD by Mostly Autumn, was also included in the same box, making it a double DVD set.

Never in my life have I been unfortunate enough to witness such repulsive behavior from one human being to another. Getting in my car at a Macquarie University car park this afternoon I noticed an altercation between a man of middle eastern ethnicity and an Asian woman, pushing and shoving each other, both calling out for help. As myself and another bystander approach the two, we made the shocking discovery that this poor man was actually trying to fight off this woman from his wife, who was sitting inside their car behind him. This deranged woman had the nerve to attack his wife because of the burka she was dressed in, claiming she 'didn't feel safe' around people like her. She was demanding this man show her some form of ID, calling out that she didn't belong here, and that we shouldn't let her walk around freely because we didn't know what she could have hiding under her dress. The whole time this woman was having her rant, her baby was sitting in her unlocked car, meters from where she was hurling abuse. Yes, she had left her infant child in the car to run over and launch herself at an innocent couple minding their business. It makes me feel sick to know we coexist in a world where this happens so frequently, people thinking they have the right to belittle someone else because of their race or religion - to see what absolute shit some people actually have to deal with. Just listen to the garbage she kept repeating!! I'm sorry ma'am, in my opinion the only ones who don't 'belong' here are racist people like yourself who have the nerve to discriminate and abuse innocent people.

As we entered the car, my wife (who wears an Islamic veil - niqab) decides to smile politely and wave innocently at the lady assuming everything was good... This is where the entire situation just turned upside down. The lady flips it and sticks her middle finger right at us! Me, being completely dumbfounded “Ah, Is everything ok?!”. At this point, she blows up in a rage... starts pointing at my wife and screaming “F**k you! Take it off!!” (referring to my wife’s veil). She then runs towards our car and I urge my wife to lock her door and start recording if anything happens…      The video will tell you the rest of the story… she keys my car, pounds on my window and continues to hurl racial and discriminatory slurs at my wife      “Take it off! You Muslim Terrorist! Who the f**k are you?”      I refused to just brush off the situation knowing that she may harm other people on campus who are identifiably Muslim.

The Glacier des Diablerets, also known as the Diablerets Glacier, extends from the northern slopes of the summit of Les Diablerets, which stands at an impressive altitude of 10,663 feet (3,250 meters) above sea level. It covers an area of approximately 6.3 square miles (16.3 square kilometers) and is the largest ice stream in the Diablerets Massif. The glacier is easily accessible via the town of Les Diablerets, situated on the valley floor and acting as the gateway to the glacier and the surrounding region. Visitors can access the glacier by taking the cable car to the Glacier 3000 ski area, which offers spectacular panoramic views of the alpine landscape, including the Bernese and Mont Blanc massifs. As the climate warms and glaciers begin to recede globally, the Glacier des Diablerets has not been an exception. However, its immense size and high altitude provide somewhat of a buffer, helping to preserve its beautiful ice formations and crevasses for visitors and locals alike to admire and explore. The Glacier des Diablerets and the surrounding regions offer visitors a wide variety of recreational activities, including skiing, snowboarding, hiking, and mountaineering. Ski resorts cater to winter sports enthusiasts, while the summertime offers idyllic hikes through lush Alpine valleys, wildflower meadows, and picturesque mountain lakes. The natural beauty and unique characteristics of the Glacier des Diablerets and the surrounding regions contribute to its importance as both a geographical landmark and a popular tourist destination in Switzerland."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

You've really got to empathize with what they want.","output":"While the verb \\"empathize\\" is used in both sentences, the meaning and context differ in each. In the first sentence, \\"You really have to empathize,\\" the statement is more general and implies that empathizing is necessary or important in a given situation, but it does not specify with whom the empathy should be directed. This statement could be interpreted as advice to be more understanding or compassionate toward others, regardless of the specific circumstances. One might hear this in a conversation where the speaker encourages the listener to be more receptive to people's emotions or experiences. In the second sentence, \\"You've really got to empathize with what they want,\\" the statement is more specific in its direction and focus. The listener is explicitly encouraged to empathize with someone else's desires or needs. In this context, empathizing involves putting oneself in another person's shoes and understanding their perspective when it comes to their expectations or requests. This statement could be heard in a conversation where the speaker wants the listener to be more considerate of other people's wishes and preferences.

Please answer the following question: Sweden and Norway had taken two different approaches in dealing with their electric power suppliers. Sweden has broken up large companies into many smaller companies. But Norway kept the handful of large electric power suppliers they had intact, and didn't take initiative to increase their numbers.  Would companies in Sweden find return on investment harder or easier?  Hint: Since the 1990s, many regions have broken up the generation and distribution of electric power to provide a more competitive electricity market. While such markets can be abusively manipulated with consequent adverse price and reliability impact to consumers, generally competitive production of electrical energy leads to worthwhile improvements in efficiency. However, transmission and distribution are harder problems since returns on investment are not as easy to find. Answer:","output":"Companies in Sweden might find return on investment slightly harder compared to Norway. The reason is that breaking up large companies into smaller ones has led to a more competitive electricity market. While this can potentially result in improvements in efficiency, the transmission and distribution aspects become more challenging. It is harder for companies to find worthwhile returns on investment in these areas due to the increased competition and fragmented structure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I know that the answer to the question \\"The dynasty that ruled Germany in the High Middle Ages was replaced by which dynasty?\\" is in \\"During the early High Middle Ages, Germany was ruled by the Ottonian dynasty, which struggled to control the powerful dukes ruling over territorial duchies tracing back to the Migration period. In 1024, they were replaced by the Salian dynasty, who famously clashed with the papacy under Emperor Henry IV (r. 1084–1105) over church appointments as part of the Investiture Controversy. His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility. A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V (r. 1111–25), who died without heirs, until Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1155–90) took the imperial throne. Although he ruled effectively, the basic problems remained, and his successors continued to struggle into the 13th century. Barbarossa's grandson Frederick II (r. 1220–1250), who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother, clashed repeatedly with the papacy. His court was famous for its scholars and he was often accused of heresy. He and his successors faced many difficulties, including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid-13th century. Mongols first shattered the Kievan Rus' principalities and then invaded Eastern Europe in 1241, 1259, and 1287.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

The hartebeest (; Alcelaphus buselaphus), also known as kongoni, is an African antelope. Eight subspecies have been described, including two sometimes considered to be independent species. A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45–70 cm (18–28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.

Commander Nathan Walker, Lieutenant Colonel John Grey, and Captain Ben Anderson are launched toward the Moon to place detectors to alert the United States of any impending ICBM attacks from the USSR. Grey remains in orbit aboard the Freedom command module while Walker and Anderson land on the moon in the lunar module Liberty. While planting one of the detectors, the pair take moon rock samples. After returning to Liberty, the pair hear noises outside and a camera captures a small rock moving nearby. Houston claims the noises are interference from the ICBM detectors. Anderson finds a rock sample on the floor of Liberty despite having secured the samples. During further lunar exploration they discover footprints that lead them to a bloodstained, functioning Soviet LK lander, and a dead cosmonaut in a nearby crater. Walker queries Houston about the Soviet presence, but he is told only to continue with the mission. The following day the pair find that the flag they had planted is missing. Their mission complete, the crew prepares to leave, but the launch is aborted when Liberty suffers violent shaking. An inspection reveals extensive damage to Liberty and non-human tracks that Walker cites as evidence of extraterrestrial life. Walker feels something moving inside his spacesuit and is horrified as a spider-like creature crawls across the inside of his helmet. Walker disappears from view and Anderson finds him unconscious outside of Liberty. Walker later denies the events. A wound is discovered on Walker's chest; Anderson removes a moon rock embedded within him. The pair find themselves unable to contact Houston or Grey due to increased levels of interference from an unknown source.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which entity is this text about? Terence Steven McQueen was born on March 24, 1930, at St. Francis Hospital in Beech Grove, Indiana, a suburb of Indianapolis. His father, William Terence McQueen, was a stunt pilot for a barnstorming flying circus who left McQueen's mother, Julia Ann (a.k.a. Julian; nee Crawford), six months after meeting her. Several biographers have stated that Julia Ann was an alcoholic. In 1952, with financial assistance provided by the G.I. Bill, McQueen began studying acting in New York at Sanford Meisner's Neighborhood Playhouse. Reportedly, he delivered his first dialogue on a theatre stage in a 1952 play produced by Yiddish theatre star Molly Picon. McQueen's character spoke one brief line: \\"Alts iz farloyrn.\\" (\\"All is lost.\\"). During this time, he also studied acting with Stella Adler in whose class he met Gia Scala.  McQueen began to earn money by competing in weekend motorcycle races at Long Island City Raceway and purchased the first of many motorcycles, a Harley-Davidson and Triumph. He soon became an excellent racer, and went home each weekend with about 100 in winnings (equivalent to 900 in 2017). He appeared as a musical judge in an episode of ABC's Jukebox Jury, that aired in the 1953-1954 season.  McQueen had minor roles in productions including Peg o' My Heart, The Member of the Wedding, and Two Fingers of Pride. He made his Broadway debut in 1955 in the play A Hatful of Rain, starring Ben Gazzara.  In late 1955, at the age of 25, McQueen left New York and headed for California, where he moved into a house on Vestal Avenue in the Echo Park area, seeking acting jobs in Hollywood. When McQueen appeared in a two-part television Westinghouse Studio One presentation entitled The Defenders, Hollywood manager Hilly Elkins (who managed McQueen's first wife, Neile) took note of him and decided that B-movies would be a good place for the young actor to make his mark. He landed his first film role in a bit part in Somebody Up There Likes Me, directed by Robert Wise and starring Paul Newman. McQueen was subsequently hired for the films Never Love a Stranger, The Blob (his first leading role) which depicts a flesh eating amoeba-like space creature, and The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery.  McQueen's first breakout role came on television. He appeared on Dale Robertson's NBC western series, Tales of Wells Fargo. Elkins, then McQueen's manager, successfully lobbied Vincent M. Fennelly, producer of the western series Trackdown, to have McQueen read for the part of bounty hunter Josh Randall in a Trackdown episode. McQueen appeared as Randall in the episode, cast opposite series lead and old New York motorcycle racing buddy Robert Culp. McQueen then filmed the pilot episode, which became the series titled Wanted: Dead or Alive, which aired on CBS in September 1958.  In 1971 McQueen starred in the poorly received auto-racing drama Le Mans. Then came Junior Bonner in 1972, a story of an aging rodeo rider. He worked for director Sam Peckinpah again with the leading role in The Getaway, where he met future wife Ali MacGraw. He followed this with a physically demanding role as a Devil's Island prisoner in 1973's Papillon, featuring Dustin Hoffman as his character's tragic sidekick.  In 1973 The Rolling Stones referred to McQueen in the song \\"Star Star\\" from the album Goats Head Soup for which an amused McQueen reportedly gave personal permission. The lines were \\"Star , star , star , star  star/ Yes you are, yes you are, yes you are/Yeah, Ali MacGraw got mad with you/For givin' head to Steve McQueen\\".  By the time of The Getaway, McQueen was the world's highest-paid actor, but after 1974's The Towering Inferno, co-starring with his long-time professional rival Paul Newman and reuniting him with Dunaway, became a tremendous box-office success, McQueen all but disappeared from the public eye, to focus on motorcycle racing and traveling around the country in a motor home and on his vintage Indian motorcycles. He did not return to acting until 1978 with An Enemy of the People, playing against type as a bearded, bespectacled 19th-century doctor in this adaptation of a Henrik Ibsen play. The film was never properly released theatrically.  His last two films were loosely based on true stories: Tom Horn, a Western adventure about a former Army scout-turned professional gunman who worked for the big cattle ranchers hunting down rustlers, and later hanged for murder in the shooting death of a sheepherder, and The Hunter, an urban action movie about a modern-day bounty hunter, both released in 1980.  In 1998 director Paul Street created a commercial for the Ford Puma. Footage was shot in modern-day San Francisco, set to the theme music from Bullitt. Archive footage of McQueen was used to digitally superimpose him driving and exiting the car in settings reminiscent of the film. The Puma shares the same number plate of the classic fastback Mustang used in Bullitt, and as he parks in the garage (next to the Mustang), he pauses and looks meaningfully at a motorcycle tucked in the corner, similar to that used in The Great Escape.  In 2005, Ford used his likeness again, in a commercial for the 2005 Mustang. In the commercial, a farmer builds a winding racetrack, which he circles in the 2005 Mustang. Out of the cornfield comes Steve McQueen. The farmer tosses his keys to McQueen, who drives off in the new Mustang. McQueen's likeness was created using a body double (Dan Holsten) and digital editing. Ford secured the rights to McQueen's likeness from the actor's estate licensing agent, GreenLight, for an undisclosed sum.  At the Detroit Auto Show in January 2018, Ford unveiled the new 2019 Mustang Bullitt. The company called on McQueen's granddaughter, actress Molly McQueen, to make the announcement. After a brief rundown of the tribute car's particulars, a short film was shown in which Molly was introduced to the actual Bullitt Mustang, a 1968 Mustang Fastback with a 390 cubic-inch engine and a four-speed manual gearbox. That car has been in possession of the same family since 1974 and hidden away from the public until now, when it was driven out from under the press stand and up the center aisle of Ford's booth to much fanfare.

Here's how we can break it down: 1. \\"This is convenient if you're staying at Delano, but its definitely not a place to trek to.\\" - This sentence has a mixed sentiment. It acknowledges the convenience of the location, but also implies that it's not worth making a special trip for. 2. \\"I ordered a cheese panini and it was just okay.\\" - This sentence has a neutral sentiment, as the reviewer finds the panini to be nothing special or remarkable. 3. \\"The sandwich was haphazardly put together.\\" - This sentence has a negative sentiment, as it indicates that the presentation of the sandwich was unsatisfactory. 4. \\"The bread was just decent and the cheese was just okay.\\" - This sentence has a neutral sentiment, as the reviewer finds both the bread and cheese to be average. 5. \\"The small side of tomato soup was good.\\" - This sentence has a positive sentiment, as the reviewer liked the tomato soup. 6. \\"The fruit side had a chemical taste to it and I just couldn't eat most of it.\\" - This sentence has a negative sentiment, as the reviewer found the fruit to be unpalatable due to a chemical taste. Overall, I would describe the sentiment of this review as leaning towards negative. Although there are some neutral and positive parts, the negative aspects seem to outweigh them.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who is hired by Cora and Nick?, using the article: Frank Chambers a drifter, stops at a depression-era rural California diner for a meal and ends up working there. The diner is operated by a young, beautiful woman, Cora Smith, and her much older husband, Nick Papadakis, a hardworking but unimaginative immigrant from Greece. Frank and Cora start to have an affair soon after they meet. Cora is tired of her situation, married to an older man she does not love, and working at a diner that she wishes to own and improve. She and Frank scheme to murder Nick to start a new life together without her losing the diner. Their first attempt at the murder is a failure, but Nick is not even aware they tried to kill him, so goes about living his life as usual. Frank and Cora succeed with their next attempt. The local prosecutor suspects what has actually occurred but does not have enough evidence to prove it. As a tactic intended to get Cora and Frank to turn on one another, he tries only Cora for the crime. Although they turn against each other, a clever ploy from Cora's lawyer, Katz, prevents Cora's full confession from coming into the hands of the prosecutor. With the tactic having failed to generate any new evidence for the prosecution, Cora benefits from a deal in which she pleads guilty to manslaughter and is sentenced to probation. Months later, Frank has an affair with Madge Gorland while Cora is out of town. When Cora returns, she tells Frank she is pregnant.

The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit.

Who won the Booker Prize twice for his novels 'Oscar and Lucinda' and 'True History of the Kelly Gang'?","output":"The Australian author Peter Carey won the prestigious Booker Prize twice, for his novels 'Oscar and Lucinda' and 'True History of the Kelly Gang.' Peter Carey is among a select few who have achieved this distinction, making him one of the most renowned contemporary writers. 'Oscar and Lucinda,' published in 1988, was Peter Carey's first Booker Prize-winning novel. The book is a historical fiction set in the 19th century, bringing together the lives of two unlikely characters. The plot follows a young English clergyman, Oscar Hopkins, who has a gambling addiction, and an Australian heiress, Lucinda Leplastrier, who shares Oscar's passion for gambling. The story beautifully captures their growing relationship and love as they embark on a risky journey through the Australian Outback. This novel received widespread acclaim for its lyrical prose, rich characterizations, and intriguing narrative, which showcased the author's exceptional storytelling skills. In 2001, Peter Carey received his second Booker Prize for 'True History of the Kelly Gang,' a novel that portrays the life of the legendary Australian outlaw Ned Kelly. The story is presented in the form of a first-person narrative, convincingly told in the voice of Kelly himself, using his distinctive grammatical style. The novel delves into Kelly's difficult upbringing, his strained relationship with his father, his criminal activities, and consequent notoriety. Through this compelling work, Carey humanizes the figure of Ned Kelly, offering readers a nuanced interpretation of his motivations and the social injustices that shaped his life. The novel, much like 'Oscar and Lucinda,' demonstrates Peter Carey's remarkable ability to blend historical accuracy, vivid storytelling, and compelling characters. Peter Carey's dual success at the Booker Prize underlines his talent as a writer and his distinctive voice in modern literature. His novels, while rooted in the historical and social context of Australia, touch on universal themes of love, identity, and the human struggle, which have earned him broad international recognition and acclaim."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: It's axiomatic that all cultures reserve a special place for food in their daily and social lives. For something as simple as a cuppa joe, we schedule and juggle our time to meet at predetermined locations to share conversation and libation. Meals require even more effort and the social ramifications increase. One is expected to show up on time, sometimes dress to certain standards and bring one or many bottles of wine as a thoughtful gift to the hosts. And of course, the food is just an excuse to get together with friends to enjoy a meal, share stories, to discuss or seduce, to seal an agreement or act as a prelude to a severance of relations (frequently unintentionally). I was first introduced to dining for pleasure as opposed to sustenance while at the University of New Brunswick. I lived in Bridges House, one of the men's residences. The young, eager, bright-eyed students in each residence were kept more or less in check by a Don. Each residence had its share of maniacs and troublemakers who were at university to get some form of education, alcohol poisoning or a social disease; sometimes all three. The Don's job was to act as a mentor and prison warden. Imagine a building housing up to 100 young adult men. It doesn't take much to start a riot. In our case, the Don was Locutus. When we met him, he must have been in his forties but looked to us adolescents to be older than Father Time. He was immediately dubbed 'Grandpa Munster'. With the tender sensitivity of males of our age, we didn't bother to hide this from him and he took it in good humour. In point of fact, Locutus was a great Don; firm when he needed to be and understanding and helpful as appropriate. You crossed this guy at your peril, but he was generally pretty tolerant.

Claremore Fire crews responded near the intersection of Archer Dr. and Archer Ct. around 10:30 p.m. to help flooding victims of nearby duplexes.      About an hour after they arrived, one firefighter was believed to have stepped into rushing water, which swept him into a storm drain, according to fire officials.      The body of Claremore Firefighter Captain Jason Farley was found inside the storm drain around 1 a.m. Sunday, Fox23 reports.      Officials suspect Farley drowned, but a medical examiner will determine the cause of death.      A second firefighter, Zane James, attempted to save the Captain Farley, but reports say he was also knocked down by the rushing water and had to be rescued.      He suffered minor injuries.      Report a typo ||||| Daytime heating is helping fuel a resurgence in thunderstorm activity across the beleaguered Plains states on this Sunday afternoon, prompting two tornado watches and concerns for additional flash flooding in areas already hard-hit by up to a foot of rain since Saturday.      A destructive, catastrophic flash flood hit a stretch of the Blanco River in and near Wimberley, Texas overnight Saturday night into early Sunday morning, and has since moved downstream into the San Marcos River. Officials estimate that about 1,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed, and at least one person has died.      (FORECASTS: Record Rainfall and Flash Flooding | Severe Weather Forecast)      Countless water rescues have been reported in Oklahoma and Texas since Saturday, and several tornadoes have been confirmed so far this weekend.      (MORE: State by State Coverage of Ongoing Flooding)      Here are the latest reports of flooding and severe weather.      Across the Region      Several tornado watches have been issued in the central U.S. For a map of the latest watches, see the radar maps below the live blog.      Severe thunderstorms blew trees onto homes near Marshall, Texas, early Sunday afternoon. The storms damaged an 18-wheeler on nearby Interstate 20.      The National Weather Service confirms that a tornado struck the west side of Corpus Christi, Texas, around 1:30 a.m. local time. The agency has not finished its survey and has not yet assigned the damage a rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.      The Houston Fire Department responded to the partial collapse of an apartment complex on the city's southwest side early Sunday on Nairn St. Four people were injured, and 10 units sustained severe damage. The National Weather Service says a brief tornado is to blame for the damage, and has given a preliminary EF1 rating to the twister.      Lake Texoma is now flowing over the spillway at the Denison Dam, which impounds the Red River to form the lake. According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the lake was at 107 percent of its flood control capacity Sunday afternoon, meaning the lake was holding nearly 55 billion gallons more than its full flood-control pool of 1.62 trillion gallons. Lake Texoma is along the Texas-Oklahoma border north of Dallas.      Mandatory evacuations were issued for properties below the Lewis Creek Dam west of Willis, Texas, about 50 miles north-northwest of downtown Houston. These were ordered as a precaution given the potential for more heavy rain. A Red Cross shelter was opened at the Lone Star Community Center in Montgomery.      At least one swift-water rescue was performed early Sunday morning in Arlington, Texas, where a shopping center was also flooded.      A firefighter in Claremore, Oklahoma, died after he was swept away performing a water rescue in the city early Sunday. A few houses were flooded in the city.      Multiple high-water rescues were reported Sunday morning in Venus, Texas (Johnson County), in the south Dallas-Ft. Worth metroplex. Farther south, rescues were also performed in the cities of Uvalde, D'hanis and Yancy, Texas.      High water was reported on Interstate 20 in both directions near Carrier Parkway in Grand Prairie Sunday morning, west of downtown Dallas. Numerous roads remained closed as of early Sunday morning in Ellis County, Texas. Part of a block of county road 1418 near Covington, Texas was reported to be partially washed out Sunday morning.      Catastrophic Flash Flood near San Marcos, Texas      At least one man has died in San Marcos, Texas, as a result of the catastrophic flash flood that developed on the Blanco River late Saturday night before emptying into the San Marcos River Sunday morning.      The National Weather Service issued a flash flood emergency late Sunday morning for the San Marcos River from San Marcos to Luling, Texas. This included parts of southeastern Hays, western Caldwell and northern Guadalupe counties. San Marcos is a city of about 55,000 people between Austin and San Antonio. A surge of floodwater continues to roll downstream along the San Marcos River into Luling, Texas.      The San Marcos River is rising fast in Martindale and Luling, Texas. Palmetto State Park at Ottine is experiencing severe flooding with at least 6 feet of water in the pavilion building likely, based on Sunday afternoon's NWS river stage report. Much of the Luling Golf Course is likely to flood, and some of the lowest homes north and northeast of the golf course may flood depending on exactly how high the river gets.      A curfew has been declared beginning at 9 p.m. Sunday and ending at 7 a.m. Monday for the cities of San Marcos and Wimberley, Texas, as well as unincorporated areas of Hays County.      An estimated 1,000 homes have been flooded in Hays County, Texas. Some residents are still stranded in their homes, but officials said Sunday afternoon that there are no longer any people waiting on rooftops for rescue. Up to 12.32 inches of rain fell near Kendalia, Texas in this event.      The Blanco River at San Marcos, Texas, crested just over 43 feet early Sunday morning, a rise of over 31 feet since late Saturday night. That 31-foot surge in the river level included a rise of 17 feet in just 30 minutes. Water levels remain high this morning as the flood crest rolls downstream.      The Blanco River rose more than 33 feet in just 3 hours in Wimberley, Texas, reaching a level more than 27 feet above flood stage at 1 a.m. Sunday. This broke the all-time record crest from 1929 by nearly 7 feet, before the river gauge stopped reporting. Wimberley is about 25 miles southwest of Austin. Emergency management reported residents were trapped on rooftops due to the sudden rise in floodwaters. Officials opened shelters to house those forced from their homes by the swollen river.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials? is inside the article: Zappa's relationship with long-time manager Herb Cohen ended in 1976. Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for Läther (pronounced \\"leather\\"), a four-LP project. Läther encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it. Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast Läther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the Läther material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited promotion.Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands. Drummer Terry Bozzio became a regular band member, Napoleon Murphy Brock stayed on for a while, and..., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"The first name of the person who prevented Zappa from having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials is Herb. This is evident from the information provided in the article which states, \\"Zappa's relationship with long-time manager Herb Cohen ended in 1976.\\" It was Herb Cohen who was involved in the legal disputes that led to Zappa being unable to access his previously recorded material during the trials."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The premise tells us the following information: 1. Many trees come from nurseries, specifically from locations like Missouri. 2. These trees from Missouri and other such places are brought down to this particular area. 3. When the trees are brought to the local nurseries in this area, they will leaf out, which means they will produce new leaves or replace old leaves with new growth. 4. The speaker notes that they are transplanting already leafed-out trees. Based on this information, we can infer that some, if not many, trees in this area are not native and are brought from external nurseries, both within and potentially outside of the state. However, the premise does not provide enough information to conclude that all trees in the area have exclusively originated from local nurseries. There might be trees that naturally germinate in the wild, or trees that are brought in from other nurseries beyond Missouri. It's important to consider the possibility of different tree species, some of which might be endemic to the region, while others may be introduced by humans or travel naturally through bird or animal activity. Additionally, the speaker's knowledge might not encompass the entire scope of tree origins in the area. In conclusion, while the premise provides some insight into the origin of some trees in the area, it does not entail the hypothesis \\"I know for a fact that all of the trees here originated from local nurseries.\\" The information given is not sufficient to confirm the exclusive origin of all trees in the area, and as such, the hypothesis remains unproven."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have a math problem to solve, so let's do it together step by step. We are given this equation: 444446 = 855*m + 489761 First, we need to find out what number (m) when we multiply it by 855 and then add 489761 to the result, we get 444446. Let's start by moving 489761 to the other side of the equation. We do this by subtracting it from both sides: 444446 - 489761 = 855*m Now, after subtracting, we get: -45315 = 855*m Now we need to find the value of m. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 855: -45315 / 855 = m After dividing, we get the answer: m = -53 So, the value of m is -53!

Please answer a question about the following article about Switzerland: Switzerland (/ˈswɪtsərlənd/), officially the Swiss Confederation (Latin: Confoederatio Helvetica, hence its abbreviation CH), is a country in Europe. While still named the \\"Swiss Confederation\\" for historical reasons, modern Switzerland is a federal directorial republic consisting of 26 cantons, with Bern as the seat of the federal authorities, called Bundesstadt (\\"federal city\\").[note 3] The country is situated in Western and Central Europe,[note 4] and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of 41,285 km2 (15,940 sq mi).

Options: - store window - public place - doorway - shop window - hallway  Explain why a human would choose \\"hallway\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"hallway\\" to answer the question above because it is the most relevant and logical option among the choices provided, considering the context of finals week and the behavior of students. During finals week, students are usually stressed and busy studying for their exams. They often reside in dormitories or accommodation facilities close to their educational institutions, where they have their individual rooms. Hallways are the common passageways linking these individual rooms, functioning as a shared space where students move around and interact. A \\"do not disturb\\" sign is typically used to communicate the desire for privacy and minimum distractions. In this case, the student seeking solitude during finals week would place this sign outside their room, specifically in the hallway. This placement ensures that people passing by or fellow students residing in nearby rooms will see the sign and understand the student's need for privacy and focus during the critical period. In contrast, options like \\"store window,\\" \\"public place,\\" and \\"shop window\\" don't quite align with the context since they are mostly unrelated to a student's living space and don't represent an appropriate location for placing personal \\"do not disturb\\" sign. The \\"doorway\\" option might be considered, but \\"hallway\\" is more precise as it better specifies the area where the sign is expected to be placed, considering that the doorway is just a part of the entire hallway system. Therefore, a human would choose \\"hallway\\" as the most appropriate answer in this context, as it best matches the situation described and the purpose of the \\"do not disturb\\" sign."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Snap Inc. shares closed up 44% Thursday after the Snapchat parent company made its highly anticipated debut on the New York Stock Exchange.      Shares of Snap SNAP, -0.84% opened at 24 after the company priced its initial batch of shares at 17. Snap sold 200 million shares to raise 3.4 billion, making it the largest U.S. initial public offering since Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s BABA, +1.04% offering in 2014. The IPO price commanded an initial market capitalization of 19.7 billion, though that valuation rises to roughly 24 billion on a fully diluted basis. Both figures are above Snap’s last reported private market valuation of 17.8 billion.      The stock traded up as much as 53% above its IPO price Thursday, hitting an intraday high of 26.05      See also: Six things to know about Snap as it goes public      Alibaba raised 21.8 billion in its initial offering, but that total rose to 25 billion after underwriters also sold the so-called green shoe, extra shares companies make available at IPO time. Snap offered its underwriters the option to purchase up to an additional 30 million shares in its green shoe, and will disclose at a later date if they were sold.      Despite the share pop, Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, said the sentiment from investors has been largely negative due to Snap’s expensive valuation compared with its revenue. The app launched in 2011, but generated no revenue until 2015. While advertising efforts have ramped up since, with total revenue reaching 404.5 million in 2016, the company is paying far more to keep the service running and generating huge net losses.      Still, Snapchat is the first major venture-backed technology IPO of 2017, after the number of such offerings plummeted in 2016, and investors wanted to get in on it, he said.      “I think people just want to get in and say, ‘Hey, what’s the worst that can happen?,’” Rao said.      First Take: Snap’s high price and big pop mean nothing      In a sense, it is nice to see investors excited about a new issue, said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, a manager of IPO-focused exchange-traded funds. But given the large share move alongside the high valuation, she too feels investors may not have fully evaluated the company’s fundamentals.      “It’s the kind of first day pop that suggests some sort irrational exuberance,” Smith said.      Investors last year were more cautious, as the average IPO priced below the midpoint of the range and had an average one-day pop of 5%, according to Renaissance Capital.      Don’t miss: Two views of Snapchat: An app that has peaked or a platform set to blossom      Snapchat has grabbed the attention of a generation of younger smartphone users, who post and share photos and videos on the app that can disappear after a set amount of time. The app—developed by Stanford University students, two of whom are still executives at Snap—had 158 million daily active users as of December 2016, according to the company’s prospectus.      Snap has big plans for the future, though. The first hardware offering from the company—Snapchat Spectacles, sunglasses that have a small camera installed and can upload video to the app—launched last year, and executives described Snap as “a camera company” in the run-up to the IPO. The app also has a payments feature called Snapcash.      Read also: Snapchat founders, investors cash out nearly 1 billion in IPO      Future innovations, whether it be in cameras or in additions to its social platform, are what investors were buying into, according to Ethan Kurzweil, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners.      “You’re counting on them to come up with something that will reignite their growth,” Kurzweil said.      Snap will have to fend off rivals for its core business as it attempts to develop new sources of revenue. The company admitted in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it experienced “increased competition” in 2016, which many understood as an acknowledgment that Facebook Inc.’s FB, +0.52% Instagram Stories offering had managed to steal traffic away from Snapchat’s feature that is also called Stories.      See also: How Snap stacks up against Facebook and Twitter      The competition from Instagram, as well as the recent uptick in the market, likely played into Snap’s decision to go public at this time, Rao said.      “I think what they decided was Instagram is coming on strong, they’re copying everything that we have and it was stealing the thunder a little bit,” Rao said.      Snap initially set a price range of 14 to 16 for the Class A common shares it sold in the IPO, which don't have voting rights, a rare and potentially unprecedented move. The Snap co-founders who are still with the company, Chief Executive Evan Spiegel and Chief Technology Officer Bobby Murphy, will together control more than 88% of voting power in the company thanks to that move.      Related: Can IPO market Snap out of its doldrums?      There were only 21 U.S. tech IPOs last year, according to global IPO investment adviser Renaissance Capital, which said 2016 was the worst year for IPO returns since 2003 and had the lowest number of offerings since 2009.      Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were the lead underwriters on the offering. ||||| Snap's cofounders, Evan Spiegel, 26, and Robert Murphy, 28, rang the opening bell on the exchange earlier Thursday. Lucas Jackson/Reuters      Snap Inc. surged in its debut as a publicly traded company Thursday, after raising a greater than expected 3.4 billion in an initial public offering.      Shares of Snapchat's parent company opened for trading at 24, up about 41% from the IPO price of 17 apiece. At the opening price, Snap had a valuation of about 33 billion.      The stock closed at 24.48, up 44%. Snap's cofounders, Evan Spiegel, 26, and Robert Murphy, 28, rang the opening bell on the exchange earlier Thursday. At the IPO price, Spiegel's stake in the company is worth at least 4.5 billion. Murphy's stake in Snap is valued at closer to 3.9 billion. The shares opened for trading at 11:19 a.m. after a period of \\"price discovery\\" during which traders on the floor of the exchange try to corral demand for the stock. Speaking on the floor of the exchange, Glenn Carell, director of NYSE floor operations for Global Trading Systems, said the price discovery took a long time because of heavy demand from buyers who didn't get allocations they wanted in the IPO itself. Carell expects the stock to end its first day of trading around 24 or 25 a share. Snap's is the first tech IPO of the year, the first offering from a social network since Twitter went public, and the largest tech deal since Alibaba went public in 2014.      Lucas Jackson/Reuters      It is going public at an opportune time. Stock benchmarks hit record highs on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing above the 21,000 mark for the first time.      Since it was launched in 2011, Snapchat has matured from a \\"sexting app\\" to one that still deletes messages by default, but is a viable competitor to companies like Facebook and Twitter.      According to its IPO prospectus, it posted a net loss of 514.6 million in 2016 and warned that it may never be able to achieve or maintain profitability. It earned 404.4 million in revenue in 2016, up from 58.6 million in 2015.      Snap is \\"significantly overvalued given the likely scale of its long-term opportunity and the risks associated with executing against that opportunity,\\" said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, in a note on Thursday. He rated the stock a \\"sell\\" with a 10 price target.      During the roadshow, investors raised questions about the slowdown in the rate of active users, and how much potential Snapchat has as an advertising platform. Snap said its biggest revenue opportunity is the growing budget for worldwide mobile advertising, which could reach 196 billion by 2020 from 66 billion now.      \\"Snapchat's slowing user growth ultimately caps its long-term revenue opportunity,\\" said Anthony DiClemente, a Nomura analyst who sees 6% downside to the stock, in a note.      Snap's stock is listed under the ticker SNAP. The shares offered to investors will have no voting rights.Portia Crowe contributed reporting. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Snap's shares closed 44% up on its debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, raising a more than expected 3.4bn.

Answer based on context: In week 4, the Lions traveled south to Arlington, Texas to take on the Dallas Cowboys. The Cowboys dominated the first half, putting the Lions in a big hole for the second straight week. First came a 25-yard touchdown catch by Dez Bryant. In the second quarter, Bryant scored again on a 6-yard touchdown catch. Dallas added more points with a 41-yard field goal by Dan Bailey. The Lions then got their only points of the first half with a 33-yard field goal by Jason Hanson. The Cowboys responded with a 35-yard field goal just before halftime. After the break, Dallas added more points with a 1-yard touchdown pass to Jason Witten, putting them up 27-3. The Lions responded with two consecutive defensive touchdowns: first a 34-yard interception return by Bobby Carpenter, then a 56-yard pick-6 by Chris Houston. The Cowboys scored their final points of the game with a 23-yard field goal late in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the Lions continued their comeback with a 23-yard touchdown catch by Calvin Johnson. They made it a three-point game with a 51-yard field goal by Jason Hanson, then Romo threw an interception to Stephen Tulloch, and took their first lead of the game late in the final quarter when Calvin Johnson caught his second touchdown of the game from 2 yards out to become only the second player in NFL history to record at least two touchdown catches in 4 straight games (the other to do so is former Vikings receiver Cris Carter). The Lions defense held off Dallas for the win. Like the previous week, the Lions came back and won it in the final moments of the game after being down by a large margin at halftime. This was also the largest comeback the Dallas Cowboys have ever allowed, and it is the largest comeback by a road team in NFL history as the Cowboys were up by 24 in the 3rd quarter. It was the first time the Lions started 4-0 since 1980. This also was its franchise-record fifth straight road win. Ironically, their last game at Dallas saw the Lions lose their franchise-record 26th straight road game.

This place sucks  With so many places to stay in Las Vegas Why would anyone stay at the Mirage? My wife had a conference at the Mirage so we were stuck there.  As my daughter and I were walking through the casino (the only way to get to the elevators fron the front) one of the casino bosses rather rudely informed me that kids aren't allowed in the casino.  Our daughter was looking forward to swimming in the pool unfortunately there wasn't any water in it. The Jacuzzi was cold with cigar butts and ashes around the edge. Great for a kid.    When we got out vehicle from the Valet we found that they broke part of the door handle. Now every time I go to open the drivers side door the trim falls off and we're reminded the lousy care we received.   Of course they won't take responsibility for the damages.

To elaborate, the review contains numerous components that add up to a negative sentiment overall.  Firstly, the initial statement, \\"This place sucks,\\" clearly sets a negative tone. Following this, the reviewer questions the choice of staying at the Mirage among all the places in Las Vegas, again suggesting a lack of satisfaction. Their lodging was not a choice, but a compromise they had to make due to a conference, which further underlines their dissatisfaction. Secondly, the customer experience appears to be very poor according to this review. The reviewer was treated rudely by a casino boss when simply passing through the casino with their child, which would clearly add to negative feelings about the hotel.  Additionally, the amenities were not as expected or as promoted. The pool that the reviewer's daughter was looking forward to using was empty, and the Jacuzzi, another related amenity, was not only cold but surrounded by trash in form of cigar butts and ashes. This shows an evident lack of maintenance and significantly detracts from the reviewer's experience. The reviewer also mentions damage to their vehicle that happened under the Valet's care. Not only did this issue occur, but the hotel reportedly took no responsibility for it, which suggests poor customer service and added to the reviewer's negative experience and sentiment. Lastly, the poor review of the hotel also extends to an overall negative view of Las Vegas, describing it as a place for drunk people, indicating the whole trip was disappointing. Overall, the reviewer presents a litany of complaints without mentioning any redeeming qualities or positive aspects of the Mirage or their trip, squarely placing the overall sentiment of this review in the negative category."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Their tolerance to freezing and drying is known to shift between AM fungal taxa.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   For all collisions in a closed system, momentum is conserved. In some collisions in a closed system, kinetic energy is conserved. When both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved, the collision is called an elastic collision. Most collisions are inelastic because some amount of kinetic energy is converted to potential energy, usually by raising one of the objects higher (increasing gravitation PE) or by flexing the object. Any denting or other changing of shape by one of the objects will also be accompanied by a loss of kinetic energy. The only commonly seen elastic collisions are those between billiard balls or ball bearings, because these balls do not compress. And, of course, collisions between molecules are elastic if no damage is done to the molecules.

The electric car maker  relieved some investors and customers when  it  said  it  is sticking to  its  latest Model 3 production targets. But some analysts still question exactly where  Tesla  is in  its  production ramp and are concerned that  its  targets may be too aggressive. \\"The data point everyone wants  we didn't get â current Model 3 run rate \\" RBC analyst Joseph Spak said in a note Wednesday after  the company  reported earnings that beat analyst expectations.  Tesla  had originally aimed to be making 5 000 Model 3 cars per week by the end of 2017  but  the company  has changed that deadline twice. On Wednesday   the company  reiterated reaching 5 000 by the end of the second quarter and set a smaller goal of 2 500 per week by the end of the first quarter.

John's parents started to find a place that would allow children as young as six and seven to volunteer. They finally find a day care center for disabled children to let John and his friends visit. They went and played with these kids, playing around the room as if they belonged there. John and his friends named their work Kids Cheering Kids. John and his friends visited kids at some childcare centers, helping out with a party they organized. They also prepared a performance for children with disabilities.

The premise provides a general scenario describing a young woman in a city park near a water feature, while the hypothesis specifically states that a woman is standing next to a large water fountain. Although the hypothesis is a possible instance of the given premise, the premise does not provide enough information to confirm if the hypothesis is true. The term \\"water feature\\" can encompass a broad range of water-related structures, such as fountains, ponds, or even small streams within the park. The premise does not explicitly mention that the water feature is indeed a \\"large water fountain,\\" nor does it state the exact position of the woman in relation to the water feature – in this case, the term \\"near\\" can be subjective and vary in distance. Therefore, given the information in the premise, we cannot determine for certain if the provided hypothesis is true. For the hypothesis to be confirmed as true by the premise, the premise would need to more explicitly describe the woman's proximity to a specific water feature, namely a large water fountain.

There was a mystery here, and Duane could scarcely wait for it to be solved. While eating he had bent keen eyes around him. After a first quiet scrutiny the rangers apparently paid no more attention to him. They were all veterans in service--Duane saw that--and rugged, powerful men of iron constitution.

We'll do this by subtracting 9 from both sides: -3j + 9 - 9 = 0 - 9 -3j = -9 Step 3: Solve for j Finally, we will solve for j by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of j, which is -3: j = (-9) / (-3) Dividing both sides by -3: j = 3 Thus, the solution to the equation -23j + 20j + 9 = 0 is j = 3."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The given equation is : a - 16 = -7*a  You are supposed to find 'a'. First, you want to get the variables on the same side of the equation. I will add 7a to both sides of the equation to keep 'a' positive.  a + 7a - 16 = -7*a + 7a which simplifies to: 8a - 16 = 0 Now to isolate 'a', we will add 16 to both sides of the equation: 8a = 16 Finally, the aim is to find the value of 'a' so we'll divide both sides of the equation by 8: a = 16/8 So, your final answer is a = 2. Meaning the value that solves the equation a - 16 = -7*a is a = 2.  To check this, we can substitute the value of 'a' back into the original equation: 2 - 16 = -7 * 2 -14 = -14 As the LHS equals to RHS, therefore 'a' = 2 is indeed the solution to the equation a - 16 = -7*a."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Dubbed the \\"King of Pop\\", he was one of the most popular entertainers in the world, and was the best-selling music artist during the year of his death. Jackson's contributions to music, dance, and fashion along with his publicized personal life made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades. The eighth child of the Jackson family, Michael made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5. Jackson was influenced by musicians including Little Richard, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly, David Ruffin, the Isley Brothers, and the Bee Gees. While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: \\"Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized. I had never seen a performer perform like James Brown, and right then and there I knew that was exactly what I wanted to do for the rest of my life because of James Brown.\\"  Jackson owed his vocal technique in large part to Diana Ross, especially his use of the oooh interjection, which he used from a young age; Ross had used this effect on many of the songs recorded with the Supremes. Not only a mother figure to him, she was often observed in rehearsal as an accomplished performer. He said: \\"I got to know her well. She taught me so much. I used to just sit in the corner and watch the way she moved. She was art in motion. I studied the way she moved, the way she sang - just the way she was.\\" He told her: \\"I want to be just like you, Diana.\\" She said: \\"You just be yourself.\\"  According to choreographer David Winters, who met and befriended Jackson while choreographing the 1971 Diana Ross TV special Diana!, Jackson watched the musical West Side Story almost every week, and it was his favorite film; he paid tribute to it in \\"Beat It\\" and the \\"Bad\\" video. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Does the article have any quotes from Jackson about his influences?","output":"Yes, the article has quotes from Jackson about his influences.

In early 1701, Louis registered Philip's claim to the French throne with the Paris Parlement, raising the possibility of union with Spain, contrary to Charles' will. In February, the Spanish-controlled Duchies of Milan and Mantua in Northern Italy announced their support for Philip and accepted French troops. Combined with efforts to build an alliance between France and Imperial German states in Swabia and Franconia, these were challenges Leopold could not ignore. At the same time, French garrisons took over Dutch-held 'Barrier' fortresses in the Spanish Netherlands, helped by the Spanish Viceroy and French ally Max Emanuel of Bavaria. This undid Dutch gains made at Ryswick and threatened their lucrative monopoly over the Scheldt granted by the 1648 Peace of Münster. It was also a concern to English merchants since control of the ports of Antwerp and Ostend would allow France to blockade the Channel at will. In response, Leopold, the Dutch Republic and Britain signed the Treaty of The Hague on 7 September 1701 renewing the 1689 Grand Alliance. Provisions included securing the Dutch Barrier in the Spanish Netherlands, the Protestant succession in England and Scotland and an independent Spain but made no reference to placing Archduke Charles on the Spanish throne. When the Stuart exile James II died on 16 September, Louis reneged on his commitment at Ryswick to recognise William as King by proclaiming James Francis Edward King of England and Scotland. The vast majority in Britain now supported war and after William's death on 19 March 1702, Queen Anne announced the continuation of his policies ie ensuring the Protestant succession and resisting French expansion. The Dutch did the same and on 15 May the Grand Alliance declared war on France, followed by the Imperial Diet on 30 September. Based on the above article, answer a question. How many years after the Grand Alliance was the Treaty of the Hauge signed?","output":"To determine the number of years between the formation of the Grand Alliance and the signing of the Treaty of the Hague, we need to find the dates for both events as mentioned in the article. 1.

Identify the date of the Treaty of the Hague signing: Thearticle states that the Treaty of the Hague was signed on 7 September 1701. Now, we can calculate the number of years between these two events: 3.

From the premise, it's evident that there is some situation or task at hand which is unavoidable: \\"there was no use trying to duck the ordeal\\". This suggests that it is impossible or highly impractical to avoid the issue. 2. Next, the premise notes, \\"the Kentuckian had never been one to put off the inevitable with a pallid hope that something would turn up to save him.\\" From this statement, we can infer that the character referenced, \\"the Kentuckian,\\" generally does not avoid issues or challenges, especially those that are inevitable - in this case, he doesn't rely on the thin possibility that circumstances may change and save him from the ordeal.  3. While the premise doesn't refer to the size or magnitude of the issue directly, the intensity with which it describes the unlikelihood of avoiding or deferring the ordeal implies that it is indeed significant. On the basis of these observations, we can reasonably conclude that the hypothesis \\"The issue was simply too large to avoid.\\" is true. While the premise does not explicitly discuss the size of the issue, it can be inferred from the urgent, inescapable nature of the predicament that the issue at hand is substantial and unavoidable.

Please answer the following question: Mike was reading about an instrument that could measure gravity, gravimeter. He then found how gravimeter was used to measure the gravitational field of the Moon. He read about two distinct cases where the Moon's gravitational field was measured on earth, side A and side B. In side A the Moon's gravity was measured from the side where the Earth was facing the Moon. And in side B the Moon's gravitational field was measured from the opposite side of the Earth. He found these two locations showed very different consequences of Moon's gravitational field.  On which side the Moon's gravitational field would exert weaker force, side A side B?  Hint: Because the gravitational field created by the Moon weakens with distance from the Moon, it exerts a slightly stronger than average force on the side of the Earth facing the Moon, and a slightly weaker force on the opposite side. The Moon thus tends to \\"stretch\\" the Earth slightly along the line connecting the two bodies. The solid Earth deforms a bit, but ocean water, being fluid, is free to move much more in response to the tidal force, particularly horizontally.  As the Earth rotates, the magnitude and direction of the tidal force at any particular point on the Earth's surface change constantly; although the ocean never reaches equilibrium—there is never time for the fluid to \\"catch up\\" to the state it would eventually reach if the tidal force were constant—the changing tidal force nonetheless causes rhythmic changes in sea surface height.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I can use this background: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.  Now, I have a new situation: Dan studied genetic engineering. He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop.  Answer this question please: Would crop A need less or more number of chemicals than crop B? Answer:","output":"Crop A would need less number of chemicals than crop B due to its herbicide tolerance. This is because genetically engineered herbicide tolerance allows crop A to grow effectively while resisting the negative effects of herbicides that target weeds. Since crop A can withstand the herbicides, farmers would not need to apply multiple chemicals, including various herbicides and other agents, to protect the crop from harm and to control different types of weeds throughout the growing season. In contrast, crop B, which lacks herbicide tolerance, would require the use of multiple herbicides for effective weed management. The farmers would need to apply different chemicals at various stages of growth, as well as performing mechanical and hand weeding to control weeds that are not affected by the chemicals. Moreover, crop B is also more susceptible to harm caused by the herbicides, which might hinder its growth and productivity. In summary, the introduction of Dan's genetically-engineered herbicide-tolerant crop, crop A, has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during the growing season. This would not only result in cost savings for the farmers but also lead to increased crop yields due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops. Therefore, crop A would require a lower number of chemicals than crop B, making it a more beneficial and sustainable choice for farmers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: HONG KONG -- Hong Kong Disneyland is too crowded, a senior Chinese tourism official said today, hinting that another Disney Park is necessary to accommodate demand from China's huge population. The comments by Shao Qiwei, director of China's State Administration of Tourism, came a day after Shanghai's mayor Han Zheng said the city was preparing to build China's second Disney theme park. \\"China has a very large population. We now have 1.3 billion people. The market is very large. As far as I know, Hong Kong Disneyland is now very crowded,\\" said Shao, whose comments were broadcast on Hong Kong's Cable TV. The Hong Kong theme park, which opened in September, was widely criticized in January when it turned away hundreds of Lunar New Year holiday makers from mainland China because the park was full. Chaos  erupted when angry crowds tried to force their way into the park. The embarrassing incident prompted a public apology from Hong Kong Disneyland Managing Director Bill Ernest and a dressing down from Hong Kong's leader Donald Tsang. Authorities are carefully studying the issue of overcrowding in preparation for the possible building of the Disney park in Shanghai, Shao said. The official Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesday that no agreement has been reached on the park in Shanghai, quoting senior vice president of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, Leslie Goodman. Hong Kong Disneyland is a joint venture between The Walt Disney Co. and the local government, which shouldered the bulk of the park's construction fees. Question: Why is it necessary to build a Disney park in Shanghai? - Hong Kong Disneyland can't meet the need of the large population. - Hong Kong Disneyland is too small and very crowded. - Hong Kong Disney Park was criticized by tourists. - Hong Kong Disneyland is far from the mainland. The answer is:","output":"- Hong Kong Disneyland can't meet the need of the large population.

Alex Rodriguez may have to start serving a suspension as soon as it is announced rather than wait for a grievance to play out.      FILE - In this July 15, 2013, file photo, New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez heads out to batting practice before a Class AA baseball game with the Trenton Thunder against the Reading Phillies... (Associated Press)      FILE - In this June 22, 2010, file photo, New York Yankees' Alex Rodriguez warms up before batting during a baseball game against the Arizona Diamondbacks in Phoenix. After a week's worth of high drama,... (Associated Press)      Major League Baseball may try to suspend A-Rod under its collective bargaining agreement instead of its drug rules, which would eliminate any chance of delaying a penalty until after the case goes to an arbitrator, The Associated Press has learned.      Rodriguez has never been disciplined for a drug offense, and a first offender under baseball's Joint Drug Agreement is entitled to an automatic stay if the players' association files a grievance _ meaning the penalty is put on hold until after an arbitrator rules.      While use of banned performance-enhancing substances falls under the drug agreement, MLB may argue other alleged violations are punishable under the labor contract, a person familiar with management's deliberations told the AP, speaking on condition of anonymity because no statements were authorized.      Taking that action would prevent the New York Yankees third baseman from returning to the field, even if he recovers from a quadriceps injury cited by the team as the reason for keeping him on the disabled list.      And merely threatening to use that provision might give MLB leverage to force a deal.      The Yankees expect Rodriguez to be accused of recruiting other athletes for the clinic, of attempting to obstruct MLB's investigation, and of not being truthful with MLB in the past when he discussed his relationship with Dr. Anthony Galea, who pleaded guilty two years ago to a federal charge of bringing unapproved drugs into the United States from Canada.      Four years ago, Rodriguez admitted using PEDs while with Texas from 2001-03. He has repeatedly denied using them since.      Baseball has been investigating Rodriguez and other players since a January report in the Miami New Times alleging they received PEDs from Biogenesis of America, a closed anti-aging clinic on Florida.      \\"We're still involved in the process of preparing for an eventual appeal in this matter,\\" Rodriguez's lawyer, David Cornwell, said Monday on ESPN New York Radio. \\"My understanding is that the next step that is going to be taken is that the players' association and baseball will meet to discuss the investigation and baseball's focus on particular players. So we'll see how that process plays out. But at this point my understanding or my expectation is that we're going to be working through the process towards an appeal.\\"      Cornwell did not return an email seeking comment.      Aside from the drug agreement, there is no automatic stay for suspensions under baseball's labor contract. Rodriguez could be punished under Article XII (B) of the Basic Agreement, which states: \\"Players may be disciplined for just cause for conduct that is materially detrimental or materially prejudicial to the best interests of baseball including, but not limited to, engaging in conduct in violation of federal, state or local law.\\"      If suspended under that section, Rodriguez would serve the penalty while a grievance is litigated before arbitrator Fredric Horowitz _ unless the union asks for a stay and the arbitrator grants one, which would be unusual under the grievance procedure. And baseball could always try to punish A-Rod on drug violations later.      It would be difficult for Commissioner Bud Selig to remove the arbitrator from the process. A provision in Article XI gives the commissioner permission to rule instead of the arbitrator on a complaint \\"involving the preservation of the integrity of, or the maintenance of public confidence in, the game of baseball.\\"      But a letter from Selig that is Attachment 1 states: \\"I understand that the players' association has expressed concern that the commissioner might take some action pursuant to Article XI (A) (1) (b) of the Basic Agreement which could negate rights of players under the new Basic Agreement. While I have difficulty seeing that this is a real problem, I am quite willing to assure the association that the commissioner will take no such action.\\"      In addition, if Selig attempted to bypass the arbitrator, the union would have the right to reopen the labor contract with respect to that provision.      Cornwell would not respond to a report in the New York Daily News on Monday that said Selig would not pursue a lifetime ban if Rodriguez accepted a suspension through 2014.      \\"There's been all sorts of reports, all sorts of sources and all sorts of breaking news and breathless coverage, and I don't feel any need to respond to any of it,\\" Cornwell told ESPN.      In announcing Ryan Braun's 65-game suspension last week, MLB cited violations of both the labor contract and drug agreement.      A person familiar with that deal, speaking on condition of anonymity because no statements were authorized, said 50 games of the penalty for the 2011 NL MVP were connected to Biogenesis. The additional 15 games stemmed from the Milwaukee outfielder's actions during the grievance that overturned his October 2011 positive test for testosterone.      Cornwell represented Braun in the 2012 hearing before arbitrator Shyam Das, but said he was not involved in Braun's agreement to be suspended.      Rodriguez, who turned 38 Saturday, has not played this season following hip surgery in January. The three-time AL MVP, fifth on the career list with 647 home runs, appeared to be on the verge of rejoining New York on July 22, but the Yankees said a day earlier that an MRI revealed a strained quadriceps.      Rodriguez pushed to be activated last Friday, but the Yankees said he wouldn't even resume a minor league injury rehabilitation assignment until Aug. 1. Rodriguez then went on a New York radio station to criticize the team's decision.      The Miami New Times story was prompted by information provided by Porter Fischer, an ex-Biogenesis employee.      \\"What's been made public are various documents that a disgruntled ex-employee of Biogenesis allegedly stole. I would imagine we'll spend time talking with the arbitrators about the documents and things of that nature, their authenticity, their relevancy, the reliability,\\" Cornwell told ESPN.      Gary Smith, a spokesman for Fischer, responded in an email: \\"Cornwell can get in line with many others who want to attack Porter Fischer for exposing the truth and is left without support. He did it because it was the right thing to do.\\"      Also Monday, Toronto manager John Gibbons said he thinks Blue Jays outfielder Melky Cabrera won't be penalized. Cabrera, MVP of the 2012 All-Star game, was banned for 50 games last year for a positive testosterone test while with San Francisco.      \\"We don't think anything's going to happen,\\" Gibbons said. \\"We think, because he served his time, it's over with. I haven't given it much thought and the GM hasn't talked much about it.\\"      ___      AP Baseball Writer Janie McCauley and AP Sports Writer Tim Reynolds contributed to this report. ||||| After Alex Rodriguez's lawyer said his client would fight any discipline from Major League Baseball, a source familiar with discussions told ESPN's \\"Outside the Lines\\" Wednesday that A-Rod's representatives are now negotiating a possible settlement that could result in a lengthy suspension.      The source said MLB officials have told Rodriguez's attorneys that they are willing to ban him for life, although sources said it was not clear commissioner Bud Selig was prepared to make such a move, knowing Rodriguez would fight it in arbitration.      Several sources have told \\"Outside the Lines\\" that some MLB officials have pushed for a lifetime ban, saying they would rather force Rodriguez to defend himself than agree to a suspension that allows him play while he appeals.      Rodriguez was presented with MLB's evidence in recent days, detailing what sources said were \\"volumes\\" of documents establishing a connection between Rodriguez and Biogenesis clinic founder Tony Bosch.      Sources said MLB was also given evidence supporting accusations that Rodriguez attempted to coerce at least one witness in MLB's investigation. That accusation is the basis of MLB's argument that Rodriguez may be punished for his conduct, in addition to multiple violations of the game's joint drug agreement.      MLB is apparently hoping that Rodriguez will accept a lengthy suspension that could keep him off the field through at least next season, without the time and trouble of an arbitration hearing.      Rodriguez's attorney, David Cornwell, has consistently said they will fight any suspension. MLB is expected to issue suspensions for Rodriguez and other players connected to Bosch within the next few days.      Most players are expected to accept 50-game suspensions -- the standard punishment for a first PED violation -- without appeal. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Alex Rodriguez, a famous baseball player, might get suspended from playing baseball because he is being accused of some wrong things.

Which village observed increased yields because of the arthropods?  Two neighboring villages practiced extensive agriculture for their food supply. Leaf village used the intentional cultivation of arthropods to help them get better harvests. Tree village didn't do that, they used conventional methods of growing their crops and got smaller harvests but used arthropods for food.  Hint: The intentional cultivation of arthropods and other small animals for human food, referred to as minilivestock, is now emerging in animal husbandry as an ecologically sound concept. However, the greatest contribution of arthropods to human food supply is by pollination. Three-fourths of the world’s flowering plants and about 35% of the world’s food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce and increase crop yields. More than 3,500 species of native bees pollinate crops.

On April 5, 1946, the entire cast, including Stafford and Perry Como, participated in the first commercial radio broadcast from an airplane. The initial plan was to use the stand-held microphones used in studios but when these proved to be problematic, the cast switched to hand-held microphones, which because of the plane's cabin pressure became difficult to hold. Three flights were made that day; a rehearsal in the afternoon, then two in the evening—one for the initial 6:00 pm broadcast and another at 10:00 pm for the West Coast broadcast.Stafford moved from New York to California in November 1946, continuing to host Chesterfield Supper Club from Hollywood. In 1948, she restricted her appearances on the show to Tuesdays, and Peggy Lee hosted the Thursday broadcasts. Stafford left the show when it was expanded to 30 minutes, making her final appearance on September 2, 1949. She returned to the program in 1954; it ended its run on NBC Radio the following year. During her time with Chesterfield Supper Club, Stafford revisited some of the folk music she had enjoyed as a child.

At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage.  Rob is a chemist with a pharmaceutical company. He is trying to devise a technique that would  be able to control chemical reactions. For that, he conducted two tests.

Designed to release emotional pain from early childhood, the therapy entailed two half-days a week with Janov for four months; he had wanted to treat the couple for longer, but they felt no need to continue and returned to London. Lennon's debut solo album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970), was received with praise by many music critics, but its highly personal lyrics and stark sound limited its commercial performance. Critic Greil Marcus remarked, \\"John's singing in the last verse of 'God' may be the finest in all of rock.\\" The album featured the song \\"Mother\\", in which Lennon confronted his feelings of childhood rejection, and the Dylanesque \\"Working Class Hero\\", a bitter attack against the bourgeois social system which, due to the lyric \\"you're still fucking peasants\\", fell foul of broadcasters. In January 1971, Tariq Ali expressed his revolutionary political views when he interviewed Lennon, who immediately responded by writing \\"Power to the People\\". In his lyrics to the song, Lennon reversed the non-confrontational approach he had espoused in \\"Revolution\\", although he later disowned the message, saying that it was borne out of guilt and a desire for approval from radicals such as Ali. Lennon became involved with Ali in a protest against the prosecution of Oz magazine for alleged obscenity. Lennon denounced the proceedings as \\"disgusting fascism\\", and he and Ono (as Elastic Oz Band) released the single \\"God Save Us/Do the Oz\\" and joined marches in support of the magazine.

Question: Here's a logic test: Mike knows that a train is slower then a plane. If he rides both vehicles for 40 minutes, which will have taken him a lesser distance? (A) train (B) plane  Choose the answer between \\"train\\" and \\"plane\\". Answer:","output":"The answer to this logic test is \\"train\\". Since Mike knows that a train is slower than a plane, it can be inferred that he will travel a lesser distance in the same amount of time on the train compared to the plane. When Mike rides both the train and the plane for 40 minutes, the key factor to consider is the speed of each vehicle, which determines how far they travel in a given time period. Planes generally travel at a higher speed compared to trains. Hence, in this scenario, the plane will cover a greater distance in 40 minutes relative to the train. To further elaborate on this, let's consider the following theoretical example using the formula for distance (distance = speed x time): Assume that the train travels at a speed of 60 mph, while the plane travels at a speed of 500 mph. If both vehicles are ridden for 40 minutes (which is equivalent to 2/3 hours), the distance covered by each would be: - Train: distance = 60 mph x (2/3) hours = 40 miles - Plane: distance = 500 mph x (2/3) hours = 333.33 miles As we can see from this example, the plane covers a significantly greater distance in the same amount of time as the train.

The most startling moment in the whole film is when his parents rip the mask off to see their son killed their daughter. The film goes downhill from there and doesn't pick up until the last fifteen minutes, but by then it's too late, we the audience have lost all interest in the story. There is barely any character development, and people always rave about Laurie being such an exceptional heroine, when there really isn't much to her. I'm sorry to disagree with everyone terrified by this movie, but if you want a great horror movie go watch The Shining or Rosemary's Baby. Those are the two best horror films ever made. Halloween is certainly not in their ranks. I can't believe Roger Ebert gave it four stars, for there is no way this film could ever deserve such a high rating.

Synthesize the information: Once I have gathered enough information, I will synthesize the key points to determine the correct answer. 5. Present the answer: Finally, I will present the answer to the user. After conducting the research, I found out that Paul Baran and Donald Davies are credited with the initial research on packet switching theory. While Leonard Kleinrock also significantly contributed to the development of the theory, Paul Baran came up with the idea of distributed networks using packet switching techniques, which was further developed by Donald Davies who coined the term \\"packet switching.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - earth - country - pack - organization - army  Explain why a human would choose \\"country\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"country\\" as the answer to the question, \\"What is a person the leader of after they are inaugurated?\\" because an inauguration typically pertains to the formal investiture or installation of an individual into a high public office or position of authority. In this context, an inauguration most commonly refers to the ceremony wherein a president, prime minister, or other head of state assumes office. Therefore, the term is most associated with political roles that involve the leadership of a country. Here's a brief explanation of why the other options are less fitting: 1. Earth: While some leaders may have significant international influence, no single individual is inaugurated to lead the entire Earth. There is no centralized global government, and leadership roles are typically conferred within the framework of individual countries or their subsidiary political divisions. 2. Pack: The term \\"pack\\" often refers to a group of animals, such as wolves or dogs, and is not regularly applied to human social structures, especially with regard to political leadership. An inauguration is a formal human ceremony, so \\"pack\\" is not a suitable answer in this context. 3. Organization: While the term \\"organization\\" could apply to a political party or government entity, it is a more general term and does not specifically refer to a nation or country. While some leaders may be inaugurated to lead organizations, the assumption in this question is that the person is taking on a leadership role at a national level, making \\"country\\" the more appropriate choice. 4. Army: An army is a branch of a nation's military, and the leader of an army would be a military officer who has attained their position through military service and promotion rather than political appointment or election. While some political leaders may also hold military titles, the focus of the question is on the political role they assume after inauguration, which would more accurately correspond to leadership of the country. Given this rationale, a human would choose \\"country\\" as the answer because it is the most appropriate and accurate reflection of the leadership role and scope of responsibility assumed by an individual after being inaugurated. An inauguration ceremony represents the peaceful and orderly transfer of power within a governance system, and the person being inaugurated becomes responsible for the policies, actions, and well-being of their country during their term in office."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: One student started packing up at the beginning of a lab exercise. I asked him where he was going. He said “I’m going to fail this class anyway, so I have other things to do.” It was true that he wasn’t doing well, and we had addressed this previously, but his attitude was completely defeatist. He had given up. So, there, in the middle of class, before he could get away, I said “Well, yeah. You will certainly fail if you don’t even try. I thought you were graduating at the end of this semester.” “I’m supposed to, but I won’t, because I’m going to fail physics. All I need is a D.” (He was right; his major didn’t require knowing any physics but they put it in the curriculum as a kind of gatekeeper course. Most students took physics much earlier in their studies than he did.) “If you have already decided to fail, I can’t stop you; you’re an adult. But you can make an appointment with me anytime. You already know that. You can email me. It’s my job to help you understand, but you have to come to me. You are an adult. It would be very inappropriate of me to follow you around, inviting you to office hours. And you must do the homework and the labs.” He stayed for the lab. I notified his counselor about what was going on, and she called him in and said the same things that I said. Next class he moved from the seat at the edge of my peripheral vision, to the middle, started working his ass off, and he passed. For a while I thought he was closing in on a C, but he got his D and graduated. And I didn’t give him anymore of a grading break than I give any of my students. Why did the student think he wasn't going to graduate? - not enough information - because he couldn't pass gym - because he couldn't pass math - because he couldn't pass physics Answer:","output":"because he couldn't pass physics"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying. He instructed my mother \\"To get me the Hell out of his office.\\" Needless to say my mother never took any of us to see this old, miserable bastard again. She found another doctor that actually treated us like we were human. where the boy go with his mom?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. More than 40,000 properties in the North East - 3.8% of the area's housing stock - are empty, compared with more than 600,000 nationally. Twelve councils in the region have formed a group to reduce the number. Empty Property Forum chair Susan Cousins said vacant homes were a \\"waste of a valuable resource\\". \\"We work with the owners to find out why the house is empty and provide the advice and support they need to bring their property back into use,\\" she said. \\"But, if we can't find an owner, or if they refuse to talk to us, we will consider taking enforcement action.\\" Properties have been left empty because of negative equity, unaffordable repairs, inheritance and a growing private rented sector, the council said. More than 200,000 homes in England - and 20,00 in the North East - have been unoccupied for longer than six months. Northumberland County Council cabinet member for housing, Allan Hepple, said this could have \\"a negative influence on the sustainability of an area\\". Thirty privately rented homes that have been empty for two years or more will be repaired using a Â£750,000 government grant, the council said. They will be chosen according to cost of repair, housing need and the impact of them remaining empty. Some will be bought and rented out by the council. It will take over further properties - either with or without the owners' consent- by using empty dwelling management orders. Summary:","output":"Twelve councils in North East England form a group to address over 40,000 vacant properties, collaborating with owners and utilizing enforcement action when necessary, aiming to reduce wasted resources and maintain area sustainability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: Congress' inaction to extend unemployment benefits to millions of struggling Americans is not only irresponsible policy, it is morally wrong. The economy is getting better for some, but the tragic effects of reckless public policy and deregulation spurred by the disproportionate political influence of big money still linger for far too many ordinary Americans. Congress, the elected representatives of the people, must find its moral compass, push through this unending nightmare of political gridlock and do right by the people. Contrary to the silly and obsessive partisan gamesmanship that currently paralyzes our politics, much more is at stake than the next election or some empty ideological argument. On the line are the lives of decent hardworking Americans, trying to cross over into the dignity of work but still caught in the barbwire of a historic global recession. Opinion: For women, equal pay and economic justice are civil rights issues. Some argue that unemployment benefits are a disincentive to people finding employment. But the sheer number of our unemployed neighbors and family members speaks volumes about the fallibility of such a claim. According to The Washington Post, the long-term unemployment rate has not been as high as it is now since World War II. A jaw-dropping 4 million Americans have been out of work for 27 weeks or longer. The problems we face are systemic and structural, and the vast majority of the unemployed are crippled not by a lack of interest or drive, but of opportunity and access. That's why long-term solutions for economic growth are needed. But in the meantime, we will actually do further damage to a struggling economy if our elected officials shape public policy by the very same stereotypes and faulty assumptions that keep some unemployed in the first place. For a major reason that the unemployed cannot find work is because they are unemployed. The data show that they face bias and discrimination. If anyone has the ability to provide some relief from this vicious cycle, it is Congress, and its members should feel obligated to do so. Moreover, those of us who are faith leaders, particularly we pastors in the African-American churches, should speak up too. Because black unemployment is twice that of whites and has been for as long as the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping track by race, we have an obligation to honor our historic reason for being -- defending those on the margins of the margins. Lessons with MLK: Eight students recall a special class. As we celebrate the life of the most famous black pastor, Martin Luther King Jr., we should remember that the black church mission connects faith with justice and personal salvation with social transformation, and addresses personal piety and public policy for the well-being of the whole person and the whole community. It fights for the weak and sees the Gospel as \\"good news to the poor.\\" More than 50 years after Dr. King and others marched on Washington for jobs and freedom, African-Americans remain disproportionately unemployed and impoverished. The unemployment rate for African-Americans was at 12.5% when the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the most recent numbers last month. Yet the fact is the black unemployment rate will undoubtedly increase if extended unemployment insurance is cut off now, adding to the devastating impact that rampant unemployment has already had on the black community for decades. And given our nation's shifting demographics, that's bad for everybody. The greatest MLK speeches you never heard. Playing politics with the very unemployment insurance afforded to American workers who are now unemployed is both immoral and economically destructive. That's why now, more than ever, we need to hear the voices of people of faith and people of good will raising the moral and practical questions about who we are to one another. And the black church -- that American church built by those who worked without wages or benefits, born fighting for freedom and thus the source of America's greatest freedom fighter -- ought to lead the way. If we really want to honor Dr. King and protect the American promise, we must demand that Congress do the right thing for American workers and the right thing for the American economy. Do not shrink a struggling economy, putting us all at risk. Rather, extend the safety net of unemployment insurance to those who cannot help but stimulate the economy by spending it immediately on the basics of food, gas and medicine, even as we debate the best prescription for long term economic health. It's just the right thing to do. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Raphael G. Warnock. Highlights:","output":"1. The article argues that Congress' failure to extend unemployment benefits is not only an irresponsible policy but also morally wrong, as it affects millions of struggling Americans. 2. It emphasizes the need for Congress to move past political gridlock, prioritizing the needs and dignity of hardworking citizens caught in the aftermath of a historic global recession. 3. The author highlights the challenges faced by the unemployed, who often face bias and discrimination, and are crippled by lack of opportunity and access. 4.

This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.  After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. When will fresh skin cells ready for treatment occur when cleansing skin? - not enough information - after using water - after using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser - after using soap A:","output":"After using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Information:  - Earl of Longford is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of Ireland.   - The Peerage of Ireland is a 19th century creation, and is different from the more ancient native Gaelic peerage used by Irish aristocracy from before the arrival of Christianity. The Gaelic system was disrupted by the English peerage in the early modern period by confiscations deemed illegal in Continental courts at the time. The latter system consists of those titles of nobility created by the English monarchs in their capacity as Lord or King of Ireland, or later by monarchs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The English ranks of the Irish peerage are Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount and Baron, whilst the Irish system uses Gaelic titles, in accordance with a genealogy of the Ard Rí (High King of Ireland) chronicled in numerous ancient manuscripts, including the Annals of the Four Masters. The Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland continues to exercise jurisdiction over its Peerage of Ireland, but not those peers whose titles derive from places located in what is now the Republic of Ireland. Importantly, Article 40.2 of the Irish Constitution forbids conference of titles of nobility by anyone but the Uatarán -- President of the Republic -- and a citizen may not accept titles of nobility or honour except with the prior approval of the Government. Gaelic titles of nobility, amongst the oldest in European history, remain the providence of individual clanna or families.

Shortly thereafter, Annie tells the family that she's pregnant, and George begins to mildly panic, insisting he is too young to be a grandfather. He has his assistant make a list of people who are older than him, dyes his hair brown, and decides he and Nina should sell the home their children have grown up in if one more thing goes wrong with it. Termites strike the house two weeks later. George puts the house on the market without telling Nina, and sells it to the Habibs. At dinner, after a discussion on whether the baby's last name will be hyphenated or not, George reveals the house has been sold. Nina is livid, as she and George have to be out in 10 days and have no place to go. Having no place to go, the Banks stay at the mansion owned by Bryan's parents. As the MacKenzies are on a cruise in the Caribbean, the Banks have to deal with their vicious Dobermans, much to the chagrin of George, who is still obviously paranoid from a previous mishap with them. Nina begins experiencing symptoms that bring up the concern of menopause. After visiting the doctor the following day, they are given the opposite news: Nina is pregnant, too.  Not long after, they have a chance meeting with Franck, Annie's wedding planner, who is elated at both women expecting. George switches gears, now believing he is too old to be a father again. His feelings come to a head when he and Nina go to Annie's and Bryan's house to announce their news. Nina brings his insensitivity to light and tells him not to come home.

However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22]  Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23]  Now, I have a new situation: Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns.

Question: I read this background article the other day: Continued heating of the water after the ice has completely melted will now increase the kinetic energy of the liquid molecules and the temperature will rise. Assuming that the atmospheric pressure is standard, the temperature will rise steadily until it reaches 100°C. At this point, the added energy from the heat will cause the liquid to begin to vaporize. As with the previous state change, the temperature will remain at 100°C while the water molecules are going from the liquid to the gas or vapor state. Once all the liquid has completely boiled away, continued heating of the steam (remember the container is closed) will increase its temperature above 100°C.  I am facing a new situation today: Tommy sets two pots of water, Pot A and Pot B, on the stove and sets each burner to a different temperature. Tommy is unable to see what the temperatures of the burners are though. He sits around patiently and waits until he notices that Pot B's water is beginning to vaporize, while Pot A's water is not vaporizing.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: The water in which pot is hotter?

Article: Fashion isn't very environmentally-friendly because it makes people buy things they don't need, just because they're new. We want to take care of the environment, we don't want to pollute the air and we don't want to waste energy and resources. But we also want to be fashionable. How can we buy fashionable clothes and protect the environment? Old styles are fashionable again, so one way is to buy second-hand clothes -- recycled clothes. Another way is to buy' fair trade clothes. These clothes are either recycled or made in a ' way that protects the environment. They also protect the people who make the clothes. Surprisingly, white cotton is one of the least environmentally-friendly crops of all. To protect the cotton, the growers use chemicals that pollute water, make farm workers ill and kill wildlife. New materials, such as hemp and bamboo, grow quickly and are more environmentally-friendly. These materials are very soft, and look fantastic. The best materials are coloured using natural dyes, made from plants. Environmentally-friendly clothes are practical but until now they were often dull. Now fashion-designers are working with these materials and the clothes are beautiful as well. So now we can buy fashionable clothes that are also environmentally-friendly.

In this case, the term containing the variable r is 4*r. To isolate it, we should first get rid of the constant term on the right-hand side of the equation, which is -9. Step 2: Add 9 to both sides of the equation. Since we want to remove the constant term -9, we perform the inverse operation, which is addition. 11 = 4*r - 9 11 + 9 = 4*r - 9 + 9 This simplifies to: 20 = 4*r Step 3: Now that we have the term containing the variable r isolated, we move to solving for r by undoing the multiplication operation by 4. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 4. 20 = 4*r 20 / 4 = 4*r / 4 Step 4: Simplify the equation. 5 = r So, the solution for the given equation is r = 5."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Which place did Holmes allow himself to be captured by Spedding and her gang?

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Available options: [-] no; [-] yes;","output":"Converting Kilometers to Megameters: There are several ways to convert kilometers to megameters, and the process is relatively straightforward as it involves simple mathematical operations. Before diving into the methods of conversion, let's understand the relationship between these two units of length. 1 kilometer (km) is equal to 0.001 megameters (Mm). In other words, one megameter is equal to 1,000 kilometers. Keeping this relationship in mind, we can explore different ways to convert kilometers to megameters: 1. Division Method Divide the given kilometers by 1,000 to obtain the length in megameters. For example, if you have 5000 kilometers, you would divide 5000 by 1000 to get 5 megameters (5000 km / 1000 = 5 Mm). 2. Multiplication with Conversion Factor Method Multiply the given kilometers by the conversion factor from kilometers to megameters (0.001). For example, if you have 2,000 kilometers, you would multiply 2000 by 0.001 to get 2 megameters (2000 km * 0.001 = 2 Mm). 3. Unit Cancelling Method Another approach is to use a unit conversion chart and cancel out the units for easier calculations. For example, if you have 3,500 kilometers, the conversion would look like this: 3500 km * (1 Mm / 1000 km) = 3500/1000 Mm = 3.5 Mm Here, the kilometer unit cancels out, leaving you with the value in megameters. Converting Miles to Kilometers: 1 mile is approximately equal to 1.60934 kilometers. To convert miles to kilometers, you can use a similar approach as with the kilometers to megameters conversion: 1. Multiplication with Conversion Factor Method Multiply the given miles by the conversion factor from miles to kilometers (1.60934). For example, if you have 10 miles, you would multiply 10 by 1.60934 to get approximately 16.0934 kilometers (10 miles * 1.60934 = 16.0934 km). 2. Proportional Calculation Method You can also set up a proportion and solve for the unknown value. If 'x' is the distance in kilometers, and 'm' is the distance in miles, the proportion can be expressed as: x km / 1.60934 = m miles For example, to convert 15 miles into kilometers, set up the proportion like this: x km / 1.60934 = 15 miles Then, cross-multiply and solve for x: x = 15 * 1.60934 x ≈ 24.1401 km Multi-choice problem: Regarding the multi-choice problem, the correct answer is: - no This is because the two questions inquire about different information. The first question is about converting kilometers to megameters, while the second question is about converting miles to kilometers.

Film Has Some Merit Despite Some Flaws . I enjoyed this film very much.  It strikes a common chord for a lot of gay people who have suffered rejection and pain for their coming out of the closet.  How many can identify with the lead character David, obviously suffering from the depression of an unrequited love for his best straight friend of fourteen years, a fellow named Theo.  What gives this film merit is that they made the gay character straight acting, devoid of all feminine stereotypes that most gay films project into their lead gay characters.  In an ironic twist, his best friend, Theo, played by John Simm is decidedly feminine acting and looking yet he is the straight guy.  Unfortunately, Simm and the actress who plays his girlfriend have NO chemistry, thus making their relationship implausible.  If it is true that gay people look for \\"looks in a person first\\" rather than personality, then this movie proves that this is a myth.  I liked the fact that David, who could have any man he wanted (because HE is the good looking one) saw beyond Theo's average looks and felt a genuine, albeit, obsessive and unhealthy love for him.  One sympathizes with David because he is so obviously miserable having to stand by and watch his best friend get it on with the girlfriend, and then hear the details afterward.  Again, how many gay people have ever been in this situation?  It is a common occurrence in the gay community.  Another implausibility is the \\"coming out on a talk show\\" with a near \\"Jenny Jones\\" type of fiasco at the end with Theo nearly beating David to a pulp until his girlfriend, who inexplicably and conveniently shows up and stops him from killing David.  One can't believe that Theo would have THAT much violence and hated toward David, no matter what drove David to break up the relationship between Theo and the girlfriend.  John Simm (Theo) did not play the aspect of homophobia convincingly enough to warrant his attack.  The film ends with David serenely contended in a lush, green park, free at last.  Free from hiding, yes, but free from his love for THeo?  I think not. The film was, indeed, realistic in its attempt to portray the consequences of coming out and a homophobic society.  However, the end result is that, in my opinion, one is not entirely convinced that Theo would abandon David in such a violent way.  Not after being taken care of and defended by David for fourteen years.  Thanks to the fine portrayal of the actor who played David, this film has merit because he made the character sympathetic and identifiable, despite some of the malicious things he was driven to do for the sake of his love for Theo.  This film is worth a look.","output":"POS"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Can you tell me the answer to who wrote the poem that is engraved on the pedestal of the statue of liberty??","output":"The poem engraved on the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty is titled \\"The New Colossus,\\" and it was written by American poet Emma Lazarus in 1883. Emma Lazarus was born on July 22, 1849, in New York City. She was part of a Sephardic Jewish family with Portuguese roots, and her father, Moses Lazarus, was a wealthy merchant. Emma was well-educated, having studied languages, literature, and poetry from a young age, allowing her to become a prolific poet throughout her life. \\"The New Colossus\\" was initially written as a contribution to an auction of art and literary works organized by the \\"Art Loan Fund Exhibition in Aid of the Bartholdi Pedestal Fund for the Statue of Liberty.\\" The goal of this auction was to raise money for the construction of the pedestal upon which the Statue of Liberty would stand. Although the poem did not gain much recognition at the time, it later became an essential part of the statue's symbolism and message. The poem alludes to the Colossus of Rhodes, an ancient statue that was considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. However, Lazarus' poem portrays the Statue of Liberty as a new symbol of freedom and hope for the oppressed, extending a welcome to immigrants from all over the world. Some of the most famous lines of the poem read: \\"Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\\" These words embody the spirit of the United States, which has long been viewed as a land of opportunity and refuge for those seeking a better life. The poem gained increased prominence in 1903 when it was engraved on a bronze plaque and mounted inside the pedestal of the statue. Emma Lazarus' powerful words continue to serve as a poignant reminder of the message of hope, freedom, and acceptance that the Statue of Liberty represents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The period between 1890 and 1920 is known as the \\"golden age\\" of print media. Broadcast radio came onto the media scene in the 1920's. Newspapers were forced to re-evaluate   their role as society's primary information provider. Like the new media technologies of today, the development of a low-cost, convenient media source produced results that radio would greatly affect the newspaper industry.  No sooner had newspapers adapted to radio than they were forced to re-evaluate themselves because of a new and more powerful medium: television. Between 1940 and 1990, newspaper sales in America dropped from one newspaper for every two adults to one for every three adults. Some newspapers, like USA Today, responded to the technological advancements by using color1 and the \\"short, quick and to the point\\" stories that are usually featured on television. The technological revolution of today is creating new challenges and opportunities for traditional media. Never before has so much information been so accessible   to so many.

Question: Article: Six days before the 63rd birthday of New China, our country received a great gift. The country's first aircraft carrier  , Liaoning, has made China become the l0th country in the world to have an aircraft camer. An aircraft carrier is a kind of ship that planes can fly from and land on--like an airport on the sea. It stands for a country's military strength . It plays an important role in modern wars. In August last year, the air craft carrier began its trial run at Dalian Port in Liaoning. The carrier was at first called the Varyag. It was built in the former Soviet Union. However, the Soviets failed to finish the ship. China bought the Varyag in 1998. Now after 10 trial runs, the aircraft carrier, renamed Liaoning, is in active service. Liaoning is about 300 meters long and 70 meters wide. It can take 30 planes and hold 2,000 soldiers. According to Xinhua News, Liaoning will be used for scientific research and military training. The aircraft carrier will help protect our country and promote  world peace. The BBC said that Liaoning coming into service \\" marks China as a rising power\\". ,. Question: When was China's aircraft carrier born? Yes or no, is the answer \\"September 25th.\\"? Answer:","output":"To find out when China's aircraft carrier was born, we need to analyze the information given in the article. The article states that it was six days before the 63rd birthday of New China when the country received the aircraft carrier as a great gift. We know that the People's Republic of China was founded on October 1, 1949. Step 1: Determine the date of the 63rd birthday of New China. 1949 + 63 = 2012 So, the 63rd birthday of New China was on October 1, 2012. Step 2: Calculate six days before the 63rd birthday of New China. October 1, 2012, minus 6 days equals September 25, 2012. Therefore, China's aircraft carrier was born on September 25, 2012, and the answer \\"September 25th\\" is correct.

While the first sentence does indicate that the speaker's sister is involved in gardening and grows flowers that can be dried, it does not specifically mention the type of flowers she grows, which could be any number of flower varieties. It is possible that the sister grows daffodils, which are a popular type of flower. However, it is important to note that daffodils are typically not considered to be a popular choice for drying or creating dried flower arrangements. Rather, the more commonly dried flowers include varieties such as roses, lavender, and hydrangeas. Therefore, while it is certainly possible that the sister also grows daffodils, the first sentence alone does not give us enough information to confirm the second sentence as true. In order to determine whether the second sentence is true, we would need additional information or context about the specific types of flowers that the sister grows.

Review: The com.google.android.gms app has become an integral part of my daily life. With its wide array of handy features and seamless integration with Google services, it truly improves my overall experience with using Android. First off, the app's core functionality is excellent – it provides stable and consistent updates for Google Play Services. The background tasks run smoothly, and the periodic updates are efficient. All these ensure that my apps stay connected, synchronized, and up-to-date, giving me peace of mind. Additionally, the app has some impressive built-in libraries. The Google Maps API never disappoints, offering precise and accessible location information. Similarly, the Firebase integration provides valuable tools for app development and enhancement. However, my main concern is the power consumption. I noticed a significant drain on the battery after prolonged periods of usage. This can be quite challenging when away from a charging source, and I hope future updates address this issue. Another area I believe could use refinement is the app's user interface. While minimalistic and functional, it would be even more appealing if it were more user-friendly and visually engaging, especially for less tech-savvy users. All things considered, I give com.google.android.gms a rating of 4 stars out of 5.

This is jazz at its most human; the players are playing for the love of the music. You will hear many familiar riffs in very fresh ways. The lyrics are funny and charming. The version of Costello's Almost Blue is a spacy funeral march. The Ellington numbers get the awe inspiring intimacy that Duke always got from his band.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the band that played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All? ?  Kill 'Em All features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \\"naive charm\\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. \\"Phantom Lord\\" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. \\"No Remorse\\" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was inspired by Diamond Head's \\"Dead Reckoning\\" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. \\"Metal Militia\\", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity....

Nevertheless Lurz has hatched a secret plan to boost sales. Meanwhile Susanne, Lurzâs secretary, receives a phone call with the message: The world as will and idea. This is a code phrase among a secret group of thirty-something middle-class leftists and would-be terrorists to which she belongs. The phrase has been taken from the central work of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation. With these words, Susanne sets an ambiguous covert plot into motion, alerting the members of the terrorist cell of an upcoming meeting.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Whose album changed perceived notions about the number of successful singles that could be taken from one album?  Blender described Jackson as the \\"late 20th century's preeminent pop icon\\", while The New York Times gave the opinion that he was a \\"musical phenomenon\\" and that \\"in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else\\". Jackson changed the way the industry functioned: both as an artistic persona and as a financial, profitable entity. His attorney John Branca observed that Jackson achieved the highest royalty rate in the music industry to that point: approximately 2 (US4.82 in 2018 dollars) for each album sold. As a result, Jackson earned record-breaking profits from compact disc sales and from the sale of copies of the documentary, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller, produced by Jackson and John Landis. Funded by MTV, the film sold over 350,000 copies in its first few months. In a market then driven by singles, Thriller raised the significance of albums, yet its multiple hit singles changed perceived notions as to the number of successful singles that could be taken from an individual album. The era saw the arrival of novelties like the Michael Jackson doll, that appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of 12 (US29 in 2018 dollars). Thriller retains a position in American culture; biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli explains, \\"At some point, Thriller stopped selling like a leisure item—like a magazine, a toy, tickets to a hit movie—and started selling like a household staple\\".At the time of the album's release, a press statement from Gil Friesen, the then President of A&M Records, read that, \\"The whole industry has a stake in this success\\". Time magazine speculated that \\"the fallout from Thriller has given the [music] business its best years since the heady days of 1978, when it had an estimated total domestic revenue of 4.1 billion\\". Time summed up Thriller's impact as a \\"restoration of confidence\\" for an industry bordering on \\"the ruins of punk and the chic regions of synthesizer pop\\". The publication described Jackson's influence at that point as, \\"Star of records, radio,... Answer:","output":"Michael Jackson's album \\"Thriller\\" changed the perceived notions about the number of successful singles that could be taken from one album. In a market driven by singles, Thriller raised the significance of albums, and its multiple hit singles altered the perceptions regarding the quantity of successful singles that could be extracted from an individual album."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?  A). yes  B). it is not possible to tell  C). no","output":"C). No To provide a detailed explanation, let's go through the given sentences and their meanings. Sentence 1: \\"Be inventive.\\" - This sentence suggests that the subject should be creative and come up with new ideas, concepts, or objects. It implies a sense of encouragement or instruction to foster innovation and original thinking. Sentence 2: \\"Stop trying to make stuff.\\" - This sentence conveys the opposite sentiment of the first sentence. It implies that the subject should cease their attempts at creating or coming up with new things. It shows discouragement or restraint towards the creative process. Now, let's analyze the relationship between these two sentences. The question asks: \\"If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?\\" Considering the meanings of both sentences, it becomes clear that the first sentence, \\"Be inventive,\\" encourages creativity and innovation, while the second sentence, \\"Stop trying to make stuff,\\" discourages the same creative process. As a result, the two sentences present contradictory statements. Thus, if the first sentence is true, which encourages creativity, then the second sentence cannot be true because it discourages creative efforts. The two sentences contradict each other, so it is impossible for both statements to be true simultaneously. Therefore, the correct answer is C).

Original sentence information: 1. A black man. 2. In a dress shirt. 3. Is looking through a microscope. 4. A poster about blood cells. 5. Poster is on the wall in the background. Condensed sentence information: 1. A man. 2. Uses a microscope. 3. A poster hanging behind him. Step 1: Compare the subjects of the sentences. The original sentence describes \\"a black man\\" while the condensed sentence only says \\"a man.\\" These two descriptions are compatible since both refer to a man. So, the first part of the condensed sentence is correct. Step 2: Compare the actions of the sentences. The original sentence says the man \\"is looking through a microscope,\\" and the condensed sentence says \\"uses a microscope.\\" These two actions are essentially the same. Therefore, the second part of the condensed sentence is also correct. Step 3: Compare the contextual information of the sentences. The original sentence mentions \\"a poster about blood cells\\" and says that it \\"is on the wall in the background.\\" The condensed sentence says \\"a poster hanging behind him.\\" While they do not specifically mention that it is about blood cells in the condensed sentence, it is still true that there is a poster hanging in the background. So, the third part of the condensed sentence is correct as well. Based on these comparisons, the sentence \\"A man uses a microscope with a poster hanging behind him.\\" is true based on the information provided in the original sentence, although it omits some specific details (such as the man's appearance and the poster's content)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Alibaba Group Holding, which last week filed for an initial public offering in the U.S., has been making some other interesting applications. Early last month, the Chinese e-commerce giant registered a company in Hong Kong under the name Alibaba Films Group. Later in the month, it changed the name to the more slick-sounding Alibaba Pictures Group. What this mysterious company will do isn’t clear, though hints abound. The two directors of Alibaba Pictures Group listed in the registry documents — Dong Ping and Zhao Chao — are both executives at ChinaVision Media, a television and film-production company in which Alibaba bought a 60% stake in March for 805 million. At the time, Alibaba didn’t elaborate on its plans, only saying it would team up with ChinaVision to “explore future business opportunities as part of Alibaba’s digital entertainment strategy.” ChinaVision last year was one of the distributors of the action-comedy movie “Journey to the West: Conquering the Demon,” directed by Hong Kong movie star Stephen Chow. The company’s TV series last year included the drama “Left Hand Joins Right Hand.” Dong, ChinaVision’s chairman, co-produced the 2000 international hit “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,” which won an Oscar for best foreign-language film. He has also been involved in several other internationally distributed Chinese movies. Dong also co-founded the popular tabloid Beijing Times in cooperation with the People’s Daily, the official mouthpiece of China’s Communist Party. So, is Alibaba going into the movies? An Alibaba spokeswoman declined to comment on the registration, while a ChinaVision representative in Hong Kong couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. But since the beginning of this year, Alibaba has been trying to expand into entertainment and digital-media industries through aggressive acquisitions and newly developed services, as part of its attempt to make its e-commerce and other platforms more attractive. In January, for example, Alibaba started offering videogames to people using its e-commerce mobile apps. Last month, Alibaba agreed to buy a 16.5% stake in Youku Tudou, a Chinese online video company that works like a combination of YouTube and Netflix. A private-equity fund set up by Alibaba founder Jack Ma also agreed to buy a 2% stake in Youku Tudou, bringing the total value of that deal to 1.22 billion. ______________________________________________________ For the latest news and analysis, follow us @WSJD.

Context: Vinaya is the specific moral code for monks and nuns. It includes the Patimokkha, a set of 227 rules for monks in the Theravadin recension. The precise content of the vinayapitaka (scriptures on Vinaya) differs slightly according to different schools, and different schools or subschools set different standards for the degree of adherence to Vinaya. Novice-monks use the ten precepts, which are the basic precepts for monastics.

Celia Crowson and her family go on holiday to the south coast of England in the summer of 1939. Soon afterwards the Second World War breaks out and Celia's father joins what was to become the Home Guard and her more confident sister Phyllis joins the Auxiliary Territorial Service.  Fearing her father's disapproval if she moves away from home, Celia hesitates about joining up but eventually her call-up papers arrive. Hoping to join the WAAF or one of the other services, Celia instead gets posted to a factory making aircraft components, where she meets her co-workers, including her Welsh room-mate Gwen Price and the vain upper middle class Jennifer Knowles. Knowles dislikes the work they have to do at the factory, causing friction with their supervisor Charlie Forbes which eventually blossoms into a verbally combative romance. A nearby RAF bomber station sends some of its men to a staff dance at the factory, during which Celia meets and falls in love with an equally shy young Scottish flight sergeant Fred Blake. Their relationship encounters a crisis when Fred refuses to tell Celia when he is sent out on his first mission, but soon afterwards they meet and make up, with Fred asking Celia to marry him. After the wedding they spend their honeymoon at the same south coast resort as the Crowsons went to in 1939, finding it much changed with minefields and barbed wire defending against the expected German invasion.

A YEAR AFTER KOREAN UPRISING, CHUN'S GRIP IS FIRM SEOUL, South Korea, May 26— A year after the civil insurrection in Kwangju and despite recent minor demonstrations, President Chun Doo Hwan appears to have consolidated his grip on power, according to Western diplomats. As a result, the diplomats said, South Korea and its 38 million people should enjoy a period of comparative calm and stability. Government officials said that Mr. Chun and his supporters have begun capitalizing on this and devoting their efforts mainly to the country's economic performance. ''The only sector they have to worry about now is the economy,'' a Western diplomat said, adding that political opponents, religious dissidents and student militants ''are having trouble getting people to do much.'' They would ''need a Kent State-type situation'' in order to stimulate activity, he said, referring to the 1970 incident in which Ohio National Guardsmen killed four persons at an antiwar protest at Kent State University. Several Days of Riots South Korea's version of Kent State occurred on a much more violent scale a year ago, in several days of anti-Government demonstrations in Kwangju, 160 miles south of Seoul. By official count, at least 189 people were killed and thousands were injured when troops were ordered by Mr. Chun, then a general, to move into the city and restore order. The ferocity of the Government's reaction to that protest, combined with other measures in the last year aimed at repressing popular opposition to Mr. Chun, left dissident groups divided and weak. ''The human rights movement here has adopted a wait-and-see attitude,'' a diplomat said. ''They ask why they should go out and get their heads bashed in.'' The campuses, historically a source of dissent, have been relatively placid in recent months, students and professors said. ''It is not from happiness or satisfaction,'' a professor explained, ''but fear and resignation.'' Minor Protests on Campuses Last week there were demonstrations at several universities, but both witnesses and the police described them as minor. About 400 students distributed anti-Government leaflets or marched at Sung Kyun Kwan University, a Buddhist institution in Seoul, and about 20 of them were detained by the police, an instructor said. Other demonstrations in the capital, at Seoul National University and Korea University, drew similar turnouts and police reaction, witnesses said. Park Shin Il, a Government spokesman, said the regime was trying to overlook the demonstrations ''as much as possible'' while preventing the protesting students from going out into the streets. ''Unless we grow out of this chronic phenomenon,'' he said, ''we won't make it as a mature, stable society.'' In Kwangju, 20 to 30 Roman Catholic priests began a hunger strike last week, according to diplomatic and church sources, and demanded the release from prison of Kim Dae Jung, South Korea's most prominent dissident, who was convicted of sedition last year but whose death sentence was commuted by President Chun in January. Call for Priest's Release The priests reportedly also demanded compensation for the victims of the Kwangju rioting and the release of a priest jailed last year for alleged involvement in the uprising. It was not clear whether the priests had ended their hunger strike. Citing police reports, Mr. Park, the Government spokesman, said that the men ''voluntarily'' ended the strike on Thursday, but that claim could not be independently confirmed. The Government has not responded officially to any of the priests' demands. The Government of Mr. Chun faces a huge challenge in its effort to deal with the nation's formidable economic problems. After a decade in which the real gross national product grew by an average of nearly 10 percent a year, it declined 5.7 percent last year. Economists and business leaders attributed most of the drop to the 44 percent inflation rate and the consequent loss of price competitiveness in world export markets. To regain their edge, economists say, South Korean companies must curb wage increases, which averaged more than 30 percent in each of the last three years. However, because of a decline in real income for many workers last year, the Government must control inflation to prevent political unrest, especially at the lower end of the salary scale. ''Someday there will be an incident at some factory and nobody knows where it will go,'' a diplomat said. Hesitation on New Investment Recent indicators portend a gradual strengthening of the economy, Korean and foreign economists said, but both Korean and foreign business leaders remain hesitant about resuming or initiating substantial investments or purchase orders. The new National Assembly finished its first session last week after debating and passing largely inconsequential legislation. Many Koreans question whether that body can ever become a center of influence in view of President Chun's authoritarian control. Oh Se Eung, an 11-year veteran of the legislature and a member of Mr. Chun's party, said he believed the Assembly would eventually become something more than a rubber stamp for Mr. Chun. ''There is no reason that he would not want the National Assembly to take care of political affairs so pressure for change would not spill over to university campuses,'' Mr. Oh said. Meanwhile, both supporters and opponents of Mr. Chun agreed that after 19 months of turmoil following the assassination of President Park Chung Hee in October 1979, most South Koreans were ready for the stability, authoritarian or not, that Mr. Chun seems to offer. ''They've changed the rusty old Park barbed wire for shiny new barbed wire,'' a diplomat said, ''but it's still barbed wire.''

QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs. Question: What is probably true about the relationship between US and Canada after Trump met with Canada's leader? Options: - it gets really bad   - it remains good   - it dwindles   - not enough information === The correct answer is A:","output":"It remains good The G-7 summit meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appeared to be cordial and diplomatic, with both leaders expressing a commitment to work towards fair trade and cutting tariffs between their countries. While there were disagreements and criticism regarding each other's trade policies, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, and they made progress in their discussions. This indicates that the relationship between the U.S. and Canada probably remains good after the meeting, as both leaders are willing to engage in dialogue and cooperation despite their differences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the South Seas, a volcano explodes, eventually causing North Pole icebergs to shift. Below the melting polar ice caps, a 200-foot-long praying mantis, trapped in the ice for millions of years, begins to stir.  Soon after, the military personnel at Red Eagle One, a military station in northern Canada that monitors information gathered from the Distant Early Warning Line, realize that the men at one of their outposts are not responding to calls.  Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside. When a radar blip is sighted, Joe sends his pilots out to investigate, but their intended target disappears. Soon an Air Force plane is attacked by the deadly mantis.  He searches the wreckage, and this time, in addition to the huge slashes, finds a five-foot-long pointed object in the snow.  He takes it to General Mark Ford at the Continental Air Defense in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  Ford gathers top scientists, including Professor Anton Gunther, to examine the object, but when they cannot identify it, Gunther recommends calling in Dr. Nedrick Jackson, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History. When Ned gets the call from Ford, he is helping museum magazine editor Marge Blaine plan her next issue, and dodges her questions as she begs him for a big scoop.  Later, after examining the object, Ned recognizes it as a torn-off spur from an insect's leg, and soon guesses, from evidence that the creature ate human flesh, that it must be a gigantic praying mantis.  Meanwhile, in the Arctic, the people of an Eskimo village spot the mantis in the sky, and although they hurry to their boats to escape, it swoops down and kills several men.

If  Reminders of the permanent threat posed by pirates can be found everywhere on Ibiza., can we conclude that \\"Pirates weren't a serious threat.\\"? Available options:  A). yes;  B). it is not possible to tell;  C). no;","output":"C). no Based on the statement provided, \\"Reminders of the permanent threat posed by pirates can be found everywhere on Ibiza,\\" we can conclude that pirates were indeed a serious threat, at least in the context of Ibiza. The fact that there are numerous reminders of the threat suggests that pirates had a significant impact on the island and its people. Historically, piracy was a significant issue for many coastal areas, as seafaring pirates would often raid and plunder towns, take hostages, and create a sense of fear among the local population. Ibiza, being an island in the Mediterranean Sea, would have been particularly exposed to the maritime activities of pirates due to its geographical location. Moreover, the presence of visible reminders of the pirate threat on Ibiza suggests that their impact on the island must have been on a scale that warranted commemoration or remembrance. These reminders could include fortifications built to defend against pirate attacks, historical artifacts that reflect piracy's role in the local economy, or even cultural influences manifested through local storytelling, music, and events celebrating or remembering the battle against piracy. However, it is important to note that this conclusion primarily focuses on Ibiza and its experiences with piracy. In different parts of the world or at different points in history, the pirate threat may have indeed been less significant. Therefore, while we can conclude that \\"pirates weren't a serious threat\\" is not an accurate statement for Ibiza, it may be true in other locations and contexts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer choices: - It reaches the dew point  - heat to cooler objects  - whale movement  - it flows to a lower level  - Earth's axis of rotation is tilted  - vanes on submarins  - Martian winds rotating.  - 180 revolutions per minute. A:","output":"The vanes rotating in an object with 180 revolutions per minute cause air to move due to the principle of fluid dynamics and the generation of a pressure difference around the vanes.  When the vanes rotate at such a high speed, they effectively create a pressure difference between the front and the back of the vane. The air in front of the vane is compressed, generating high pressure, while the air behind the vane experiences a low-pressure zone. This difference in pressure results in the air molecules in the high-pressure zone moving towards the low-pressure zone, causing air to move.  To summarize, the vanes rotating at 180 revolutions per minute cause air to move due to the pressure differences generated by the motion, and not any of the other options. However, it's important to note that some of these options can impact the movement of air in different scenarios: - The dew point can affect humidity levels and condensation in the surrounding air. - Heat transfer to cooler objects can cause air to expand or contract, affecting air movement. - Whale movement and vanes on submarines can influence water flow, not air movement. - Earth's axis of rotation and tilt can affect global weather patterns, indirectly affecting air movement. - Martian winds and rotational forces can cause air to move, but only in the context of the planet Mars"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Washington state, which had many wildfires year-round, and Oregon, state which had almost no wildfires. Ben enjoyed the visit and planned to return.  Which state had more people inhaling carbon dioxide from the wildfire smoke?  Hint: Wildfire smoke contains particulate matter that may have adverse effects upon the human respiratory system. Evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited. Evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes.Inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i.e. carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, particulate matter, organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides and other compounds. The principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide.Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer.  Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation. This can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing. Coarse PM is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact.Smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream. In asthma patients, PM2.5 causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells. These particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells. Both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function. This damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised. The third PM type is ultra-fine PM (UFP). UFP can enter the bloodstream... Answer:","output":"Washington state had more people inhaling carbon dioxide from the wildfire smoke since it experienced many wildfires year-round, whereas Oregon had almost no wildfires. As mentioned in the hint, wildfire smoke contains particulate matter that may have adverse effects upon the human respiratory system. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, particulate matter, organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides, and other compounds. The main health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide. Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets.

Washington state, having experienced more wildfires, would have subjected its residents to increased exposure to wildfire smoke and its harmful components, including carbon dioxide. This exposure may lead to various health problems for the residents, specifically those related to the respiratory system. In contrast, Oregon had fewer instances of wildfires and thus, lower exposure to harmful smoke and its components for its population. It is essential to relay evidence about the health effects of wildfire smoke to the public and influence policy changes to promote positive health outcomes and limit exposure in regions where wildfires are prevalent, such as Washington state."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is named after the River Exe, the source of which is situated in the centre of the area, two miles north-west of Simonsbath. Exmoor is more precisely defined as the area of the former ancient royal hunting forest, also called Exmoor, which was officially surveyed 18151818 as in extent. The moor has given its name to a National Park, which includes the Brendon Hills, the East Lyn Valley, the Vale of Porlock and of the Bristol Channel coast. The total area of the Exmoor National Park is , of which 71% is in Somerset and 29% in Devon.  - Minehead is a coastal town and civil parish in Somerset, England. It lies on the south bank of the Bristol Channel, north-west of the county town of Taunton, from the border with the county of Devon and in proximity of the Exmoor National Park. The parish of Minehead has a population of approximately 11,981 making it the most populous town in the West Somerset local government district. This figure includes Alcombe and Woodcombe, suburban villages which have been subsumed into Minehead.  - Rolling is a type of motion that combines rotation (commonly, of an axially symmetric object) and translation of that object with respect to a surface (either one or the other moves), such that, if ideal conditions exist, the two are in contact with each other without sliding.  - The Norman conquest of England was the 11th-century invasion and occupation of England by an army of Norman, Breton, and French soldiers led by Duke William II of Normandy, later styled as William the Conqueror.  - Gloucestershire (; abbreviated Glos.) is a county in South West England. The county comprises part of the Cotswold Hills, part of the flat fertile valley of the River Severn, and the entire Forest of Dean.  - Dunster is a village, civil parish and former manor within the English county of Somerset, today just within the north-eastern boundary of the Exmoor National Park. It lies on the Bristol Channel coast south-southeast of Minehead and northwest of Taunton.

The built up area of the town had a population of 64,621 in 2011.  - Dorset (or archaically, Dorsetshire) is a county in South West England on the English Channel coast. The ceremonial county comprises the non-metropolitan county, which is governed by Dorset County Council, and the unitary authority areas of Poole and Bournemouth. Covering an area of , Dorset borders Devon to the west, Somerset to the north-west, Wiltshire to the north-east, and Hampshire to the east. The county town is Dorchester which is in the south. After the reorganisation of local government in 1974 the county's border was extended eastward to incorporate the Hampshire towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch. Around half of the population lives in the South East Dorset conurbation, while the rest of the county is largely rural with a low population density.  - A hammermill is a mill whose purpose is to shred or crush aggregate material into smaller pieces by the repeated blows of little hammers. These machines have many sorts of applications in many industries, including:  - A turbine (from the Latin \\"turbo\\", a vortex, related to the Greek , \\"tyrb\\", meaning \\"turbulence\\") is a rotary mechanical device that extracts energy from a fluid flow and converts it into useful work. The work produced by a turbine can be used for generating electrical power when combined with a generator or producing thrust, as in the case of jet engines. A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels.  - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate.  - The Anarchy was a civil war in England and Normandy between 1135 and 1154, which resulted in a widespread breakdown in law and order. The conflict was a succession crisis precipitated by the accidental death of William Adelin, the only legitimate son of Henry I, in 1120. Henry's attempts to install his daughter, the Empress Matilda, as his successor were unsuccessful and on Henry's death in 1135, his nephew Stephen of Blois seized the throne with the help of another nephew, Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester. Stephen's early reign was marked by fierce fighting with English barons, rebellious Welsh leaders and Scottish invaders. Following a major rebellion in the south-west of England, Matilda invaded in 1139 with the help of her half-brother, Robert of Gloucester.  - Dunster Working Watermill ( also known as Castle Mill ) is a restored 18th century watermill , situated on the River Avill , close to Gallox Bridge , in the grounds of Dunster Castle in Dunster , Somerset , England . It is a Grade II * listed building . The mill stands on a site where a mill was first recorded in the Domesday Book , but the present building was constructed around 1780 . It closed in 1962 but was restored in 1979 and is still used to grind flour . The equipment is powered by two overshot wheels . It is owned by the National Trust but operated as a tourist attraction by a private company .  - Somerset is a county in South West England which borders Gloucestershire and Bristol to the north, Wiltshire to the east, Dorset to the south-east and Devon to the south-west. It is bounded to the north and west by the Severn Estuary and the Bristol Channel, its coastline facing southeastern Wales. Its traditional border with Gloucestershire is the River Avon. Somerset's county town is Taunton.  - A shell keep is a style of medieval fortification, best described as a stone structure circling the top of a motte.  - Dunster Castle is a former motte and bailey castle, now a country house, in the village of Dunster, Somerset, England. The castle lies on the top of a steep hill called the Tor, and has been fortified since the late Anglo-Saxon period. After the Norman conquest of England in the 11th century, William de Mohun constructed a timber castle on the site as part of the pacification of Somerset. A stone shell keep was built on the motte by the start of the 12th century, and the castle survived a siege during the early years of the Anarchy. At the end of the 14th century the de Mohuns sold the castle to the Luttrell family, who continued to occupy the property until the late 20th century.  - A textile or cloth is a flexible material consisting of a network of natural or artificial fibres (yarn or thread). Yarn is produced by spinning raw fibres of wool, flax, cotton, or other material to produce long strands. Textiles are formed by weaving, knitting, crocheting, knotting, or felting.  - A sawmill or lumber mill is a facility where logs are cut into lumber. Prior to the invention of the sawmill, boards were rived (split) and planed, or more often sawn by two men with a whipsaw, one above and another in a saw pit below. The earliest known mechanical mill is the Hierapolis sawmill, a Roman water-powered stone mill at Hierapolis, Asia Minor dating back to the 3rd century AD. Other water-powered mills followed and by the 11th century they were widespread in Spain and North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, and in the next few centuries, spread across Europe. The circular motion of the wheel was converted to a reciprocating motion at the saw blade. Generally, only the saw was powered, and the logs had to be loaded and moved by hand. An early improvement was the development of a movable carriage, also water powered, to move the log steadily through the saw blade.  - A hammer is a tool or device that delivers a blow (a sudden impact) to an object. Most hammers are hand tools used to drive nails, fit parts, forge metal, and break apart objects. Hammers vary in shape, size, and structure, depending on their purposes.  - Flour is a powder made by grinding raw grains or roots and used to make many different foods. Cereal flour is the main ingredient of bread, which is a staple food for many cultures, making the availability of adequate supplies of flour a major economic and political issue at various times throughout history. Wheat flour is one of the most important ingredients in Oceanic, European, South American, North American, Middle Eastern, North Indian and North African cultures, and is the defining ingredient in their styles of breads and pastries.  - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not.  - Bristol is a city, unitary authority area and county in South West England with an estimated population of 449,300 in 2016. It is England's sixth and the United Kingdom's eighth most populous city, and the most populous city in Southern England after London. The city borders the Unitary Authority areas of North Somerset and South Gloucestershire, with the historic cities of Bath and Gloucester to the south-east and north-east, respectively.  - Devon (archaically known as Devonshire) is a county of England, reaching from the Bristol Channel in the north to the English Channel in the south. It is part of South West England, bounded by Cornwall to the west, Somerset to the northeast, and Dorset to the east. The City of Exeter is the county town; seven other districts of East Devon, Mid Devon, North Devon, South Hams, Teignbridge, Torridge, and West Devon are under the jurisdiction of Devon County Council; Plymouth and Torbay are each a part of Devon but administered as unitary authorities. Combined as a ceremonial county, Devon's area is and its population is about 1.1 million.  - South West England is one of nine official regions of England. It is the largest in area, covering and the counties of Gloucestershire, Bristol, Wiltshire, Somerset, Dorset, Devon and Cornwall, as well as the Isles of Scilly. Five million people live in South West England.  - A metal (from Greek  \\"métallon\\", \\"mine, quarry, metal\\") is a material (an element, compound, or alloy) that is typically hard, opaque, shiny, and has good electrical and thermal conductivity. Metals are generally malleable  that is, they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking  as well as fusible (able to be fused or melted) and ductile (able to be drawn out into a thin wire). About 91 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals, the others are nonmetals or metalloids. Some elements appear in both metallic and non-metallic forms.  - A paper mill is a factory devoted to making paper from vegetable fibres such as wood pulp, old rags and other ingredients using a Fourdrinier machine or other type of paper machine.  - The Severn Estuary is the estuary of the River Severn, the longest river in Great Britain. It is at the mouth of four major rivers, being the Severn, Wye, Usk and Avon, and other smaller rivers. Its high tidal range of about means that it has been at the centre of discussions in the UK regarding renewable energy.  - The River Avill is a small river on Exmoor in Somerset, England.  - A water turbine is a rotary machine that converts kinetic energy and potential energy of water into mechanical work.  - Wiltshire (or ) is a county in South West England with an area of . It is landlocked and borders the counties of Dorset, Somerset, Hampshire, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire. The county town was Wilton but Wiltshire Council is now based in the new county town of Trowbridge.  - The Bristol Channel is a major inlet in the island of Great Britain, separating South Wales from Devon and Somerset in South West England. It extends from the lower estuary of the River Severn to the North Atlantic Ocean. It takes its name from the English city of Bristol, and is over 30 miles (50 km) across at its widest point.  - A water wheel is a machine for converting the energy of free-flowing or falling water into useful forms of power, often in a watermill. A water wheel consists of a large wooden or metal wheel, with a number of blades or buckets arranged on the outside rim forming the driving surface. Most commonly, the wheel is mounted vertically on a horizontal axle, but the tub or Norse wheel is mounted horizontally on a vertical shaft. Vertical wheels can transmit power either through the axle or via a ring gear and typically drive belts or gears; horizontal wheels usually directly drive their load.  - A watermill or water mill is a mill that uses moving water as its power source. It is thus a structure that uses a water wheel or water turbine to drive a mechanical process such as milling (grinding), rolling, or hammering. Such processes are needed in the production of many material goods, including flour, lumber, paper, textiles, and many metal products. Thus watermills may be gristmills, sawmills, paper mills, textile mills, hammermills, trip hammering mills, rolling mills, wire drawing mills, and so on.  - Lumber (American English; used only in North America), or timber (used in the rest of the English speaking world) is wood that has been processed into beams and planks, a stage in the process of wood production. Lumber may also refer to currently un-needed furniture, as in Lumber room, or an awkward gait, ultimately derived from the look of unfashionable and unwanted furniture.  - A wheel is a circular component that is intended to rotate on an axle bearing. The wheel is one of the main components of the wheel and axle which is one of the six simple machines. Wheels, in conjunction with axles, allow heavy objects to be moved easily facilitating movement or transportation while supporting a load, or performing labor in machines. Wheels are also used for other purposes, such as a ship's wheel, steering wheel, potter's wheel and flywheel.  - Wire drawing is a metalworking process used to reduce the cross-section of a wire by pulling the wire through a single, or series of, drawing die(s). There are many applications for wire drawing, including electrical wiring, cables, tension-loaded structural components, springs, paper clips, spokes for wheels, and stringed musical instruments. Although similar in process, drawing is different from extrusion, because in drawing the wire is pulled, rather than pushed, through the die. Drawing is usually performed at room temperature, thus classified as a cold working process, but it may be performed at elevated temperatures for large wires to reduce forces.  - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity.  - Paper is a thin material produced by pressing together moist fibres of cellulose pulp derived from wood, rags or grasses, and drying them into flexible sheets. It is a versatile material with many uses, including writing, printing, packaging, cleaning, and a number of industrial and construction processes.

OPTIONS:  *negative  *positiveWould the following phrase be considered positive or negative? made a decent \` intro ' documentary","output":"The phrase \\"made a decent 'intro' documentary\\" can be considered as positive. Let's break it down to understand the positivity in the statement. 1. \\"Made\\": This word indicates that the person or entity being referred to has completed or produced something, which is generally seen as a positive action. In the context of the phrase, it shows accomplishment and productivity. 2. \\"Decent\\": This word is used to describe something that is fairly good or adequate. While it does not indicate a level of excellence, it does imply that the outcome or result is satisfactory or meets a certain standard. In this regard, 'decent' has a positive connotation, as it reflects a level of quality that is acceptable. 3. \\"Intro\\": This word serves as shorthand for an introduction or introductory aspect. An intro documentary typically provides an overview, basic information, or serves as a starting point for a topic or subject matter. This can be considered a positive element in the sense that it is beneficial for the audience to have an accessible and easy-to-understand introduction to a topic. 4. \\"Documentary\\": A documentary is a non-fiction film that presents factual information, often including interviews, photographs, and video footage, to inform, educate, or entertain an audience.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Mini guide to Hong Kong A Chinese junk carries tourists in front of Hong Kongâs convention centre. (Lo Sai Hung/AP) Like a shot of adrenalin, Hong Kong quickens the pulse. Skyscrapers march up jungle-clad slopes by day and blaze neon by night, across a harbour criss-crossed by freighters and motor junks. Hong Kong can overwhelm but offers fantastic experiences, especially to visitors who are willing to step out of their comfort zone. See The Peak Tram rises above skyscrapers, departing from the lower terminus and climbing to the 552-metre Victoria Peak. On clear days and at night, the view from the top is amazing (7am-midnight, every 15 minutes; £3). The largest of Hong Kong’s Man Mo temples was the hub of civil life on the island in the 19th century. The Taoist temple was built in 1847 by Chinese merchants and was dedicated to the gods of literature, ‘man’, and of war, ‘mo’ (24-126 Hollywood Rd, Sheung Wan; 8am-6pm; free). Hong Kong’s first heritage trail, the Ping Shan, includes the territory’s oldest pagoda, a magnificent ancestral hall and temples. All were built by the Tang clan, the most powerful of the five clans that settled in the New Territories around the 11th century (West Rail Tin Shui Wai station, exit E; 10am-1pm and 2pm-5pm; free). Temple Street Night Market is Hong Kong’s liveliest. Aside from the clothes, watches and footwear on offer, it’s worth a visit for the smells and tastes of the open-air street stall and for the occasional Cantonese opera shows. Night owls should try the fruit market, open from midnight until dawn (Man Ming Lane; 6pm-midnight). Picturesque Tai O, on Lantau island, is one of the oldest fishing villages. It is famous for its stilt houses, rope-tow ferry and temple dedicated to the god of war, Guan Yu. Reach it by bus 1 from the Mui Wo ferry point. Eat and drink Dah Wing Wah is the place to go for the village cuisine of the northern New Territories. Local ingredients are sourced from small farms and food producers. Try the lemon-steamed mullet and smoked oysters (00 852 2476 9888; 2nd fl, Koon Wong Mansion, 2-6 On Ning Rd, Yuen Long; lunch and dinner; mains from £3). Tung Po Seafood Restaurant has revolutionised hawkerstyle cooking. Its novel menu has featured items such as steamed glutinous rice with duck jus. Beer is served in big rice bowls, to be downed bandit style. Book ahead or go before 7pm (00 852 2880 9399; 2nd fl, Municipal Services Bldg, 99 Java Rd, North Point; lunch and dinner; meals from £6). Famous tea house Luk Yu is known for its dim sum (available from 7am-5pm) and Cantonese dishes. The delectable food and elegant furnishings make up for the cavalier service (00 852 2523 5464; 24-26 Stanley St, Central; lunch and dinner; mains from £8). Ye Shanghai means ‘Shanghai nights’ and its interior is romantic. The Shanghainese food, lighter than traditional Cantonese dishes, is Michelin-starred (00 852 2376 3322; 6th fl, Marco Polo Hotel, Harbour City, Kowloon; lunch and dinner; mains from £12). The atmosphere at T’ang Court is plush, the service impeccable and the food divine. Try sautéed prawns with deep-fried taro puffs (00 852 2375 1133; Langham Hotel, 8 Peking Rd, Tsim Sha Tsui; lunch and dinner; mains from £30). Sleep Hop Inn has a youthful vibe and nine small but artful rooms, each featuring illustrations by a Hong Kong artist. Three rooms have no windows, but the art on the walls makes this seem like less of a problem (00 852 2881 7331; Flat A, 2nd fl, Hanyee Bldg, 19-21 Hankow Rd, Tsim Sha Tsui; from £40). Given its location in the Central Business District, Ice House is excellent value. It’s styled in contemporary fashion with lots of white and colourful, contrasting bedspreads and accessories. Each room has a kitchenette and a work area (00 852 2836 7333; 38 Ice House St, Central; from £80). Many of the handsomely proportioned rooms at the Hyatt Regency Hong Kong, Tsim Sha Tsui feature harbour views. They are modern, with bamboo flooring, king-size beds and large picture windows. The black-and-white photographs of Tsim Sha Tsui are a stylish touch (00 852 2311 1234; 18 Hanoi Rd, Tsim Sha Tsui; from £155).","output":"Hong Kong, a city known for its skyscrapers and neon lights, provides fantastic experiences for visitors.

Barack Obama cautioned supporters Thursday against becoming complacent during the final days leading up to the election, noting he lost the New Hampshire primary despite a lead in the polls. After debating Sen. John McCain, Sen. Barack Obama says there's still plenty of campaigning to be done. \\"For those of you who are feeling giddy or cocky and think this is all set, I just [have] two words for you: New Hampshire,\\" the Democratic presidential nominee said during a fundraiser breakfast in New York. \\"You know I've been in these positions before where we were favored and the press starts getting carried away and we end up getting spanked. And so that's another good lesson that Hillary Clinton taught me.\\" About 10 hours after debating Sen. John McCain, Obama urged top campaign contributors at the Metropolitan Club in Manhattan to not be overconfident, despite leading in a number of national polls. A CNN Poll of Polls calculated Wednesday showed him leading 51 percent to 42 percent. \\"We've got 19 days,\\" Obama said. \\"We're going to have to work absolutely as hard as we've ever worked in our lives in order to just to get to the start of what is going to be a very difficult and very challenging but ultimately a very fulfilling four years where we can get this country back on track.\\"  Watch more of Obama's comments ». Hours later, Obama spoke to a crowd in Londonderry, New Hampshire, lashing out at McCain's debate tactics. \\"Well, New Hampshire, last night we had a debate. I think you saw a bit of the McCain attack strategy in action,\\" he said. \\"But here's what Sen. McCain doesn't seem to understand: With the economy in turmoil and the American dream at risk, the American people don't want to hear politicians attack each other -- you want to hear about how we're going to attack the challenges facing middle-class families each and every day.\\" Obama urged McCain to \\"debate our genuine differences on the issues that matter\\" rather than making the Arizona senator's campaign \\"all about me.\\" \\"The truth is, this campaign is about you. It's about your jobs. It's about your health care. It's about your retirement. It's about your children's future,\\" he added.  Watch Obama discuss the economy ». McCain, speaking at an event in Downington, Pennsylvania, on Thursday, touched on his debate performance. \\"We had a good debate last night. It was a lot of fun. ... I thought I did pretty well,\\" he said to loud cheers. McCain reiterated his position for taking America forward as economists say a recession is all but inevitable. \\"We can't spend the next four years waiting for our luck to change ... I'll take us in a new direction,\\" he said. \\"Our troubles are getting worse, our enemies watch and we have to fight, and that's what I'll do for you ... I'm not afraid of the fight, I'm ready for it.\\" McCain also urged voters there to help him win Pennsylvania -- a state where a CNN Poll of Polls shows Obama leading his counterpart 50 percent to 40 percent. \\"I need your vote. We will carry Pennsylvania. ... We need your help. ... It's a close race, my friends,\\" he said. McCain also responded to Obama's assertions that his crowds are unruly and use dangerous language to describe the Illinois senator. \\"I cannot tell you about how proud I am of you,\\" he said. It was a line that he used in Wednesday night's debate. iReport.com: Obama survived knock-out punch. Obama and McCain are scheduled to speak Thursday night at the Alfred E. Smith dinner, a political tradition that dates back to 1945. It honors the first Catholic ever nominated for president and was begun by Francis J. Spellman, the archbishop of New York's Roman Catholic Archdiocese at the time. The Republican presidential nominee will also appear on the \\"Late Show with David Letterman,\\" after canceling an earlier appearance, which left the host fuming. Also Thursday, McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, sounded a note of triumph about Wednesday's presidential debate while campaigning in Bangor, Maine. \\"They [Obama and Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden] look to the past because they'd rather run against the current administration, it sounds like, and that strategy though, thankfully, it's really starting to wear very very thin,\\" Palin said. \\"As John McCain reminded Barack Obama last night, if he wanted to run against George Bush, he had his chance four years ago.

Given the question: What is the last name of the person who studied under Ambroise Thomas?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Jules Émile Frédéric Massenet (French: [ʒyl emil fʁedeʁik masnɛ]; 12 May 1842 – 13 August 1912) was a French composer of the Romantic era best known for his operas, of which he wrote more than thirty. The two most frequently staged are Manon (1884) and Werther (1892). He also composed oratorios, ballets, orchestral works, incidental music, piano pieces, songs and other music. While still a schoolboy, Massenet was admitted to France's principal music college, the Paris Conservatoire. There he studied under Ambroise Thomas, whom he greatly admired. After winning the country's top musical prize, the Prix de Rome, in 1863, he composed prolifically in many genres, but quickly became best known for his operas. Between 1867 and his death forty-five years later he wrote more than forty stage works in a wide variety of styles, from opéra-comique to grand-scale depictions of classical myths, romantic comedies, lyric dramas, as well as oratorios, cantatas and ballets. Massenet had a good sense of the theatre and of what would succeed with the Parisian public. Despite some miscalculations, he produced a series of successes that made him the leading composer of opera in France in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Like many prominent French composers of the period, Massenet became a professor at the Conservatoire. He taught composition there from 1878 until 1896, when he resigned after the death of the director, Ambroise Thomas. Among his students were Gustave Charpentier, Ernest Chausson, Reynaldo Hahn and Gabriel Pierné. By the time of his death, Massenet was regarded by many critics as old-fashioned and unadventurous although his two best-known operas remained popular in France and abroad. After a few decades of neglect, his works began to be favourably reassessed during the mid-20th century, and many of them have since been staged and recorded. Although critics do not rank him among the handful of outstanding operatic geniuses such as Mozart, Verdi and Wagner, his operas are now widely accepted as well-crafted... The answer is:","output":"Massenet. Jules Émile Frédéric Massenet is the person who studied under Ambroise Thomas. He was a French composer of the Romantic era, best known for his operas. Massenet was admitted to the Paris Conservatoire, where he studied under Ambroise Thomas, whom he greatly admired."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Why it's time for brain science to ditch the 'Venus and Mars' cliche As hardy perennials go, there is little to beat that science hacks' favourite: the hard-wiring of male and female brains. For more than 30 years, I have seen a stream of tales about gender differences in brain structure under headlines that assure me that from birth men are innately more rational and better at map-reading than women, who are emotional, empathetic multi-taskers, useless at telling jokes. I am from Mars, apparently, while the ladies in my life are from Venus. And there are no signs that this flow is drying up, with last week witnessing publication of a particularly lurid example of the genre. Writing in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia revealed they had used a technique called diffusion tensor imaging to show that the neurons in men's brains are connected to each other in a very different way from neurons in women's brains. This point was even illustrated by the team, led by Professor Ragini Verma, with a helpful diagram. A male brain was depicted with its main connections – coloured blue, needless to say – running from the front to the back. Connections within cranial hemispheres were strong, but connections between the two hemispheres were weak. By contrast, the female brain had thick connections running from side to side with strong links between the two hemispheres. \\"These maps show us a stark difference in the architecture of the human brain that helps provide a potential neural basis as to why men excel at certain tasks and women at others,\\" said Verma. The response of the press was predictable. Once again scientists had \\"proved\\" that from birth men have brains which are hardwired to give us better spatial skills, to leave us bereft of empathy for others, and to make us run, like mascara, at the first hint of emotion. Equally, the team had provided an explanation for the \\"fact\\" that women cannot use corkscrews or park cars but can remember names and faces better than males. It is all written in our neurons at birth. As I have said, I have read this sort of thing before. I didn't believe it then and I don't believe it now. It is biological determinism at its silly, trivial worst. Yes, men and women probably do have differently wired brains, but there is little convincing evidence to suggest these variations are caused by anything other than cultural factors. Males develop improved spatial skills not because of an innate superiority but because they are expected and encouraged to be strong at sport, which requires expertise at catching and throwing. Similarly, it is anticipated that girls will be more emotional and talkative, and so their verbal skills are emphasised by teachers and parents. As the years pass, these different lifestyles produce variations in brain wiring – which is a lot more plastic than most biological determinists realise. This possibility was simply not addressed by Verma and her team. Equally, when gender differences are uncovered by researchers they are frequently found to be trivial, a point made by Robert Plomin, a professor of behavioural genetics at London's Institute of Psychiatry, whose studies have found that a mere 3% of the variation in young children's verbal development is due to their gender. \\"If you map the distribution of scores for verbal skills of boys and of girls, you get two graphs that overlap so much you would need a very fine pencil indeed to show the difference between them. Yet people ignore this huge similarity between boys and girls and instead exaggerate wildly the tiny difference between them. It drives me wild.\\" I should make it clear that Plomin made that remark three years ago when I last wrote about the issue of gender and brain wiring. It was not my first incursion, I should stress. Indeed, I have returned to the subject – which is an intriguing, important one – on a number of occasions over the years as neurological studies have been hyped in the media, often by the scientists who carried them out. It has taken a great deal of effort by other researchers to put the issue in proper perspective. A major problem is the lack of consistent work in the field, a point stressed to me in 2005 – during an earlier outbreak of brain-gender difference stories – by Professor Steve Jones, a geneticist at University College London, and author of Y: The Descent of Men. \\"Researching my book, I discovered there was no consensus at all about the science [of gender and brain structure],\\" he told me. \\"There were studies that said completely contradictory things about male and female brains. That means you can pick whatever study you like and build a thesis around it. The whole field is like that. It is very subjective. That doesn't mean there are no differences between the brains of the sexes, but we should take care not to exaggerate them.\\" Needless to say that is not what has happened over the years. Indeed, this has become a topic whose coverage has been typified mainly by flaky claims, wild hyperbole and sexism. It is all very depressing. The question is: why has this happened? Why is there such divergence in explanations for the differences in mental abilities that we observe in men and women? And why do so many people want to exaggerate them so badly? The first issue is the easier to answer. The field suffers because it is bedevilled by its extraordinary complexity. The human brain is a vast, convoluted edifice and scientists are only now beginning to develop adequate tools to explore it. The use of diffusion tensor imaging by Verma's team was an important breakthrough, it should be noted. The trouble is, once more, those involved were rash in their interpretations of their own work. \\"This study contains some important data but it has been badly overhyped and the authors must take some of the blame,\\" says Professor Dorothy Bishop, of Oxford University. \\"They talk as if there is a typical male and a typical female brain – they even provide a diagram – but they ignore the fact that there is a great deal of variation within the sexes in terms of brain structure. You simply cannot say there is a male brain and a female brain.\\" Even more critical is Marco Catani, of London's Institute of Psychiatry. \\"The study's main conclusions about possible cognitive differences between males and females are not supported by the findings of the study. A link between anatomical differences and cognitive functions should be demonstrated and the authors have not done so. They simply have no idea of how these differences in anatomy translate into cognitive attitudes. So the main conclusion of the study is purely speculative.\\" The study is also unclear how differences in brain architecture between the sexes arose in the first place, a point raised by Michael Bloomfield of the MRC's Clinical Science Centre. \\"An obvious possibility is that male hormones like testosterone and female hormones like oestrogen have different effects on the brain. A more subtle possibility is that bringing a child up in a particular gender could affect how our brains are wired.\\" In fact, Verma's results showed that the neuronal connectivity differences between the sexes increased with the age of her subjects. Such a finding is entirely consistent with the idea that cultural factors are driving changes in the brain's wiring. The longer we live, the more our intellectual biases are exaggerated and intensified by our culture, with cumulative effects on our neurons. In other words, the intellectual differences we observe between the sexes are not the result of different genetic birthrights but are a consequence of what we expect a boy or a girl to be. Why so many people should be so desperate to ignore or obscure this fact is a very different issue. In the end, I suspect it depends on whether you believe our fates are sealed at birth or if you think that it is a key part of human nature to be able to display a plasticity in behaviour and in ways of thinking in the face of altered circumstance. My money is very much on the latter. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The article argues that claims about inherent differences between male and female brains are often exaggerated and based on cultural expectations rather than biological determinism. While there may be some differences in how male and female brains are wired, these differences are likely influenced by upbringing and societal expectations.

The idea that men and women are \\"hardwired\\" for specific tasks is oversimplified, and more research is needed to understand the complex factors that influence brain development and function."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(Photo: Charles Dharapak, AP) Story Highlights President Obama made a statement on Saturday to update the country on his Syria deliberations      Members of his national security team briefed lawmakers on Saturday      Obama overrode top advisers' objections      WASHINGTON — President Obama said on Saturday that he was ready to take military action against Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime in retaliation for its alleged use of chemical weapons, but that he will seek the approval of Congress before carrying out any military strike.      Obama says congressional leaders have agreed to schedule a debate and vote when they return to session. They are scheduled to return from their summer recess on Sept. 9.      The president did not say whether he'd forgo a strike if Congress rejects his call to action.      \\"After careful deliberation, I have decided that the United States should take military action against Syrian regime targets,\\" Obama said. \\"This would not be an open-ended intervention. We would not put boots on the ground. Instead, our action would be designed to be limited in duration and scope.      \\"This attack is an assault on human dignity,\\" Obama said of the alleged Aug. 21 chemical assault the U.S. intelligence community has linked to Assad's regime. \\"It also presents a serious danger to our national security.\\"      The remarks came amid a flurry of briefings for skeptical lawmakers by the president's national security team. Shouts from hundreds of activists outside the White House protesting against military action could be heard from the Rose Garden shortly before Obama spoke.      \\"Over the last several days, we've heard from several members of Congress who want their voices to be heard,\\" Obama said. \\"I absolutely agree.\\"      FULL COVERAGE: Latest developments in Syria      STORY: 5 possible risks of a U.S. military strike on Syria      House Speaker John Boehner announced in a joint statement with the GOP House leadership that he expected to consider a measure that would authorize the president to carry out a military strike the week of Sept. 9.      \\"Under the Constitution, the responsibility to declare war lies with Congress,\\" the statement said. \\"We are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in Syria in response to serious, substantive questions being raised. This provides the president time to make his case to Congress and the American people.\\"      Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., welcomed Obama's decision.      \\"The president's role as commander in chief is always strengthened when he enjoys the expressed support of the Congress,\\" McConnell said.      Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, praised Obama's decision to seek congressional authorization as \\"absolutely the right decision.\\" Corker in recent weeks had been a public advocate for an authorization vote, contending that the Congress too often takes a back seat on determining critical foreign policy decisions.      Obama said some have advised not to seek Congress' approval, noting that the British Parliament this week rejected a similar call for action by Prime Minister David Cameron. Obama also rejected Boehner's notion that he must seek congressional authorization.      \\"While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,\\" Obama said. \\"We should have this debate. The issues are too big for business as usual.\\"      The president's senior advisers had initially advised him not to seek congressional authorization for a military strike, according to a senior administration official.      Obama indicated last Saturday during a National Security Council meeting that he was leaning toward taking action against Syria, but had not made a final decision, said the official, who asked not to be identified to discuss internal deliberations.      But when Obama convened his senior advisers on Friday night to tell them he had decided to take military action, he also told his advisers that he would seek Congressional authorization, the official said.      In the Friday night meeting and again on Saturday morning, Obama explained his reasoning to his advisers for seeking congressional backing. The same aides who had advised him not to go to lawmakers for backing threw their support behind his plan.      Obama's remarks on Saturday afternoon came hours after United Nations experts, who had been collecting samples from last week's alleged chemical weapons strike outside Damascus, left Syria bound for the Netherlands.      The chemical weapons experts were working to determine what occurred in the apparent chemical weapons attack near Damascus on Aug. 21, which U.S. intelligence reports say left 1,429 people dead, including 426 children. They have taken blood and urine samples from victims and soil samples from areas where chemical attacks have been reported. The samples will be tested in Europe.      Obama attempted to put the onus on Congress, which he suggested has a moral responsibility to take action. He noted that Americans have become weary after more than a decade of war, but that something as heinous as a chemical attack could not be ignored.      \\"Here's my question for every member of Congress and every member of the global community: What message will we send if a dictator can gas hundreds of children to death in plain sight and pay no price?\\" Obama said.      The president had long expressed skepticism about the merits of American involvement in the civil war in Syria that has left more than 100,000 dead. But Obama stated publicly just over a year ago that movement or deployment of chemical weapons was a \\"red line\\" that must not be crossed.      The White House had determined earlier this summer that Assad's regime had previously used chemical weapons against rebels and civilians on a small scale, but had resisted taking action or offering any significant new military aid to the rebel groups.      Obama said that Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, has advised him that the U.S. military's capacity to execute a strike is not time-sensitive. Five U.S. Navy destroyers equipped with land-attack cruise missiles are deployed in the eastern Mediterranean and stand ready to carry out an assault on the president's order.      \\"In the coming days, my administration stands ready to provide every member with the information they need to understand what happened in Syria and why it has such profound implications for America's national security,\\" Obama said. \\"And all of us should be accountable as we move forward, and that can only be accomplished with a vote.\\"      Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/15IWQnI ||||| President Barack Obama says he has decided that the United States should take military action against Syria in response to a deadly chemical weapons attack.

Write a title for this article: On Tuesday, Amy Harmon reported that a prominent professor at the University of Chicago had stepped down in response to accusations of sexual harassment. The article ignited a heated discussion on Twitter, with some readers sharing their experiences of harassment in the science field. The professor, Jason Lieb, a molecular biologist, made unwelcome sexual advances to several female graduate students at an off-campus retreat of the molecular biosciences division, according to a university investigation letter obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Lieb, 43, also engaged in sexual activity with a student who was “incapacitated due to alcohol and therefore could not consent.” The article highlighted an increasingly tense debate over how universities deal with harassment claims in their science departments. Students and faculty members at the University of Chicago blamed the school, saying it overlooked previous accusations against Mr. Lieb when he worked at the University of North Carolina, and did not find out why he resigned abruptly from Princeton University after just seven months. Below is a selection of the responses to the article on Twitter. Some who work in the sciences expressed concerns about encountering harassment: skin crawling. can't say I haven't worried about this kind of thing when considering how to choose a future advisor https://t.co/k0qbBhX0nO Others pointed to how common harassment is in academia: Virtually every female PhD who knows me well enough to tell me abt it has experienced similar in kind, if not degree https://t.co/b2RCamWV34 A few Twitter users from the schools mentioned in the article spoke out: From the perspective of someone at the 1st of the 3 institutions involved, the secrecy is maddening to deal with 1/2 https://t.co/R2JsYmVJzA ...and makes us culpable. I'm as disappointed in the institutional response as in the person 2/2 Others questioned the University of Chicago’s hiring of Mr. Lieb, and one got a response from a professor on the hiring committe, Yoav Gilad: @hormiga @mbeisen It was, Terry. Given the outcome it's impossible to defend our decision. I can explain to you our view at the time offline @Fierst_Lab @amy_harmon @McLNeuro @UChicago yes, it's the only thing we knew to be true. (Not that that is an excuse.) Drinking was also cited as a common element in academic and medical retreats: Heavy drinking was the norm at our retreats...it's the work hard party hard mantra..rewarding slavery with drunkenness @amy_harmon @nytimes @amy_harmon this is also pandemic in the hospital/clinic environments. Others suggested that academic leaders simply wield too much power: @amy_harmon I think the absolute power primary investigators have over their students and #postdocs lives is root of the problem 2/2 @stephenfloor @amy_harmon In many ways, power differential between grad students and professors greater than corporate employee and manager.","output":"\\"Prominent Molecular Biologist Resigns Amid Sexual Harassment Accusations: Universities' Handling of Harassment Claims Debated\\""},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Question: Given the below context:  In 1823, brash naval officer David Farragut boards the Essex and informs its commander, David Porter, that the Navy is commandeering the ship for a top-secret mission. Although the crew is overdue for shore leave, Porter, a cold, efficient leader, lies to them in order to coerce them to volunteer for the dangerous assignment. Farragut soon reunites with his old shipmate, Chief Petty Officer Link, who tries to convince him that Porter, who years earlier trained Farragut harshly in an attempt to teach him patience and discipline, is not as heartless as he appears. This starts to show itself when Porter later reconciles with Farragut about their past and agree to be civil with one another. Once the ship is at sea, Porter and Farragut open their orders and are dismayed to discover their mission: to disguise themselves as pirates, with no ties to or protection from the United States, in order to track down pirates raiding the West Indies. One night soon after, Farragut is in charge of the ship when a storm hits. Link becomes trapped beneath a keg of rum from which he has tried to sneak a drink and Farragut is forced to break the ship's rudder to rescue him. Porter discovers the damage, but even when he threatens to court-martial Farragut, the officer refuses to inform on Link. Within days, the supplies begin to run out, one of the crew contracts scurvy, and Porter steers the rudderless Essex to the West Indies for repairs and supplies. Farragut grows frustrated with the slow drift and, although Porter forbids anyone to enter the shark-infested waters, he tries to repair the rudder himself. When a shark attacks and Farragut's rope catches on a barnacle, he is barely rescued in time, and Porter chastises him again. Six days later, the men finally reach land and Porter orders Farragut and Link to gather supplies.  Guess a valid title for it!
