The survey, which was conducted between January 25th and February 8th, showed that 67% of the respondents supported a 15 minimum wage. The poll included 10,121 adults from all 50 states. The 15 minimum wage has become a hot topic of discussion for several years, with Democrats proposing legislation to increase the federal minimum wage to 15 an hour. However, Republicans contend that raising it to such a level would hurt small businesses and cause inflation. The poll found that the overall support for a 15 minimum wage is consistent across gender, age, and education level. Among those aged 18 to 29, support for the wage increase was at 74%, while older age groups showed slightly less enthusiasm for the idea. Men and women both showed equal levels of support, with 64% of men and 70% of women in favor of the increase. The study also revealed that those with a college degree, as well as those with a high school diploma or less, were all in favor of raising the minimum wage. Proponents of the minimum wage increase argue that it would bring millions of currently low-paid workers out of poverty and improve their quality of life. They suggest that it would reduce income inequality and create a stronger economy by giving low-wage workers more spending power. On the other hand, those who oppose the wage increase insist that it would lead to layoffs, higher costs for businesses, and possibly force some small businesses to close down. The poll shows that the majority of Americans are in favor of a 15 minimum wage, yet it remains to be seen whether policymakers will act on the public's desire for change. Some states and cities have already passed legislation to increase their minimum wages, while others have not yet taken any action on this issue. However, this poll sends a clear message to lawmakers that their constituents are watching and are pushing for change on this important issue."},{"instruction":"Assume it is true that The StarSpangled Banner is the national anthem of the United States.

The study, which surveyed over 2,000 adults, revealed that those who exceeded this two-hour limit were more likely to experience symptoms of anxiety and depression compared to those who spent less than two hours a day on social media. The study's lead author, Dr. Sarah Smith, explained that the findings support existing research on the negative impact of social media on mental health. She noted that social media can provide a distorted representation of reality, leading users to feel inadequate or isolated. Additionally, social media can be a breeding ground for cyberbullying and other forms of negative interactions. The study also found that the link between excessive social media usage and poor mental health was strongest among younger adults aged 18-24. This group was more likely to report feelings of anxiety and depression, with a suggested reason being that young adults are more likely to use social media as a means of socializing and building relationships. While there are potential drawbacks to using social media, it's important to note that the study did not demonstrate causation-- it only revealed a correlation between social media usage and poor mental health. It's possible that individuals with poor mental health might turn to social media as a crutch, rather than the other way around. Nonetheless, the study provides evidence for the need to conscientiously regulate excessive social media usage and to ensure that individuals take a mindful approach towards their digital consumption. In response to the findings, some mental health advocates are calling on social media platforms to provide more tools for users to manage their screen time and filter out toxic content. Users can also take steps to safeguard their mental health by setting boundaries around their social media use, prioritizing offline relationships and activities, and seeking professional help if necessary. Overall, this study sheds light on the need for a balanced approach to social media usage, and emphasizes the importance of taking care of our mental health in the digital age."},{"instruction":"Background: Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy.

The researchers cautioned, however, that the study did not prove cause and effect and that more research is needed to understand the relationship between coffee consumption and liver cancer.","output":"According to the latest research carried out by scientists from South Korea, drinking coffee frequently could reduce the risk of developing cancerous cells in the liver. As per the report published in Time magazine, researchers found that individuals who consumed three to five cups of coffee per day had a 29% lower risk of developing liver cancer, in comparison to those who had less than a single cup each day. The study surveyed over 26,000 patients in Korea, aged between 30 and 75, who underwent routine health check-ups between 2009 and 2013. After considering major factors such as alcohol consumption, prior diagnoses of liver disease, and medical histories, researchers discovered that people who consumed more coffee demonstrated a lower chance of developing liver cancer. While the results are positive, researchers urge consumers to take caution in interpreting the findings, as they only suggest that coffee may have a protective effect against liver cancer but do not offer conclusive proof of cause and effect. More in-depth research and clinical trials are also needed to gain a better understanding of how the acidity, temperature, and strength of coffee influence liver cancer risk. The research’s lead author, Jin-Hyeong Kim, from the National Cancer Center in Korea, suggests that these findings could benefit global populations as liver cancer is currently one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. Additionally, the researchers recommend that healthcare professionals consider coffee consumption as an informative variable during routine treatment and check-ups for liver-related illnesses.

We consider two cases based on whether or not the set ({a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n}) contains the element (n).  Case 1: (n notin {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n}) 1. Consider the set of (2n) integers:    [ a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n, 2n - a_1, 2n - a_2, ldots, 2n - a_n ]    Each of these integers lies in the range ((0, 2n)), implying there are (2n) different integers in the specified range. 2.

Suppose (a_i = 2n - a_j) for distinct integers (a_i) and (a_j), then:    [ a_i + a_j = 2n ] 4. Thus, (a_i) and (a_j) are elements of ({a_1, a_2, cdots, a_n}) such that their sum is (2n), confirming the existence of a subset whose sum is divisible by (2n).  Case 2: (n in {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n}) 1. Let (a_n = n). 2. Consider the remaining (n-1) integers:    [ a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{n-1} ] 3. Since (n geq 4), (n-1 geq 3). This is essential in ensuring the existence of distinct pairwise differences. 4. If all pairwise differences (a_i - a_j) for (i neq j) are divisible by (n), then:    [ (a_k - a_i) = (a_k - a_j) + (a_j - a_i) ]    The cumulative pairwise difference ((a_k - a_i) geq 2n) leads to contradictory inequality (a_k geq 2n + a_i), causing violations since (a_k in (0, 2n)). 5. Thus, there exist at least two integers, say, (a_i) and (a_j), such that:    [ a_i - a_j = kn ]    for some integer (k).

Prove that at least 502 of these 2005 lines must be concurrent (i.e., they intersect at a common point).","output":"# Problem: A square is divided by 2005 straight lines. Each line intersects exactly one pair of opposite edges of the square, dividing the square into two regions such that the area ratio of these regions is (2:3). Prove that among these 2005 lines, at least 502 of them share a common point inside the square.  1. **Define Critical Elements**     The problem states that a square is divided by 2005 lines, which intersect pairs of opposite sides. Each of these lines divides the square into two regions with an area ratio (2:3). 2. **Understanding Line Intersections**     We need to analyze the points where these lines intersect within the square. The critical points where multiple lines intersect are essential to understand. For lines to share a common point, they must intersect at a common vertex internal to the square. 3. **Applying the Pigeonhole Principle**     To prove the assertion, we can use a combinatorial approach provided by the pigeonhole principle. Given 2005 lines, pairs of lines determine intersection points. Each set of 4 lines can create an intersection following combinatorial settings.     The combinatorial formula for choosing pairs from 2005 elements is:     [     binom{2005}{2} = frac{2005 times 2004}{2} approx 2,009,010     ]     Each of these combinations might potentially create an intersection. 4. **Establish Lower Bound for Intersections**     Given that a high number of lines are being considered, we focus on ensuring at least a minimum number of intersections at a single point. For that, we can deduce by the principle of distribution over intersections.     Using the definition that at least 502 intersections need to occur at one point:     [     4 times 502 - 3 = 2005 - 3 = 2002       ]     Which confirms, in a minimal case scenario, at least 502 lines should intersect at a single common point if distributed optimally. 5. **Conclusion**     Therefore, employing combinatorial logic and the pigeonhole principle, it ensures that out of the 2005 lines, there necessarily have to be at least 502 lines intersecting at a single point inside the square:     [     boxed{502}     ]"},{"instruction":"A rectangular grass field is 85 m * 55 m, it has a path of 2.5 m wide all round it on the outside.

Since the path is 2.5 m wide all around the field, it adds 5 m to both the length and the width of the field (2.5 m on each side). So, the new dimensions including the path are: Length = 85 m + 5 m = 90 m Width = 55 m + 5 m = 60 m Now, we can calculate the area of the entire field including the path: Area with path = Length * Width = 90 m * 60 m = 5400 sq m Next, we calculate the area of the grass field without the path: Area of grass field = Original Length * Original Width = 85 m * 55 m = 4675 sq m To find the area of the path alone, we subtract the area of the grass field from the area of the entire field including the path: Area of path = Area with path - Area of grass field = 5400 sq m - 4675 sq m = 725 sq m Now, to find the cost of constructing the path at Rs. 2 per sq m, we multiply the area of the path by the cost per square meter: Cost of constructing path = Area of path * Cost per sq m = 725 sq m * Rs. 2/sq m = Rs. 1450 Therefore, the area of the path is boxed{725}  sq m and the cost of constructing it is Rs. 1450."},{"instruction":"When a number is divided by 13, the remainder is some number.

The volume of the original cylinder (V1) can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a cylinder: V1 = π * r^2 * h Now, according to the problem, the radius of the cylinder is made 3 times larger, so the new radius (r') is: r' = 3 * r The new volume of the cylinder (V2) is said to be 18 times the old one, so: V2 = 18 * V1 Let's denote the new height as h'. The volume of the new cylinder with the new radius and new height is: V2 = π * (r')^2 * h' Substituting the new radius into the equation, we get: V2 = π * (3 * r)^2 * h' V2 = π * 9 * r^2 * h' Now, we know that V2 is 18 times V1, so we can set up the equation: π * 9 * r^2 * h' = 18 * (π * r^2 * h) We can cancel out π and r^2 from both sides of the equation, as they are common factors: 9 * h' = 18 * h Now, we can solve for the ratio of the new height to the old height (h'/h): h' / h = 18 / 9 h' / h = 2 Therefore, the ratio of the new height to the old height is boxed{2:1} ."},{"instruction":"What is [3  5x  7x^2 + 9 + 11x  13x^2  15 + 17x + 19x^2] in terms of x?","output":"Combining like terms, we follow the strategy from the draft: 1. **Constants**: (3 + 9 - 15 = -3) 2. **Linear terms**: (-5x + 11x + 17x = 23x) 3. **Quadratic terms**: (-7x^2 - 13x^2 + 19x^2 = -1x^2) Thus, the expression simplifies to [-3 + 23x - x^2.] To verify, reorganize the terms in standard polynomial form: [-x^2 + 23x - 3.] Conclusion with boxed answer: [boxed{-x^2 + 23x - 3}]"},{"instruction":"Adam teaches 50 students a year.

Động cơ vạn năng thường sử dụng một cấu trúc đặc biệt để thích ứng với cả hai loại nguồn điện này. Động cơ vạn năng được sử dụng phổ biến trong các thiết bị gia dụng như máy khoan, máy cắt cỏ, máy pha cà phê, máy làm tóc,... Nó cũng được sử dụng trong một số ứng dụng công nghiệp nhỏ, khi cần kết hợp tính linh hoạt của hoạt động trên cả nguồn AC và DC.

Nó có ba dây điện đầu ra và bốn cực từ trường được phân bố đều xung quanh rotor (rôto). Cấu trúc này cho phép máy phát điện tạo ra một dòng điện xoay chiều ba pha với động cơ xoay vòng của nó. Nguyên tắc hoạt động của máy phát điện 3 pha 4 cực là khi rotor được quay, từ trường tạo ra bởi nam châm rotor tương tác với từ trường tạo ra bởi cuộn dây xoắn stator, điều này tạo ra sự cắt từ trong túi dây cuộn stator đi qua nó. Sự cắt này tạo ra điện thế và dòng điện xoay chiều ba pha trong cuộn dây stator. Các đầu ra điện áp và dòng điện của máy phát điện 3 pha 4 cực có thể được sử dụng để cung cấp điện cho các thiết bị hoặc hệ thống sử dụng nguồn điện xoay chiều ba pha."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Nếu cả hai đều di chuyển được đoạn đường bằng nhau thì ghi Draw. lap trinh c++","output":"Để giải bài toán này, ta cần tính xem sau X giây từ khi xuất phát, Robot Takahashi đã di chuyển được bao xa và Robot Aoki đã di chuyển được bao xa. Sau đó so sánh 2 khoảng cách này để xác định Robot nào di chuyển xa hơn. Với Robot Takahashi, trong thời gian di chuyển A giây, nó di chuyển được B*A mét. Sau đó, nó nghỉ C giây để sạc. Với Robot Aoki, trong thời gian di chuyển D giây, nó di chuyển được E*D mét. Sau đó, nó nghỉ F giây để sạc. Để tính khoảng cách di chuyển của 2 Robot sau X giây, ta cần xác định xem X giây có rơi vào thời gian di chuyển hay là thời gian nghỉ của cả 2 Robot. Đầu tiên, ta tính tổng thời gian mà Robot Takahashi và Robot Aoki di chuyển và nghỉ trong 1 chu kỳ: T = A + C = B + D + F. Giả sử X là thời gian cần tính khoảng cách, ta chia X cho T để xác định số chu kỳ mà đã trôi qua: num_cycles = X / T. Sau đó, ta tính khoảng cách di chuyển trong các chu kỳ đã trôi qua: distance_takahashi = num_cycles * (B * A). distance_aoki = num_cycles * (E * D). Sử dụng cách làm trên, ta đã tính được khoảng cách mà 2 Robot đã di chuyển trong các chu kỳ đã trôi qua. Tiếp theo, ta tính khoảng cách mà 2 Robot đã di chuyển trong thời gian còn lại sau chu kỳ cuối cùng: remaining_time = X % T. Nếu remaining_time <= A thì Robot Takahashi vẫn còn di chuyển được, khoảng cách di chuyển của Takahashi là: distance_takahashi += remaining_time * B. Nếu remaining_time <= D thì Robot Aoki vẫn còn di chuyển được, khoảng cách di chuyển của Aoki là: distance_aoki += remaining_time * E. Cuối cùng, ta so sánh 2 khoảng cách distance_takahashi và distance_aoki để xác định Robot nào di chuyển xa hơn hay cả 2 Robot di chuyển bằng nhau: if (distance_takahashi > distance_aoki) cout << \\"Takahashi\\"; else if (distance_takahashi < distance_aoki) cout << \\"Aoki\\"; else cout << \\"Draw\\";"},{"instruction":"Сможешь локализировать на русский язык код программы на python длинной в 400 строк?

You can add titles, labels, legends, and change the appearance of the plot using plot-specific arguments. plot() is part of the base graphics system in R. Example: \`\`\`R plot(x, y, type = \\"l\\", main = \\"Line Plot\\") \`\`\` 2. qplot(): The qplot() function is a part of the ggplot2 package, which is a popular and powerful library for creating elegant and sophisticated plots in R. qplot, short for \\"quick plot,\\" provides a simplified syntax for generating basic visualizations. It is designed for creating quick and simple plots without requiring a lot of code. qplot() is especially useful for creating scatter plots, line plots, histograms, and bar plots. Example: \`\`\`R qplot(x, y, data = mydata, geom = \\"point\\", main = \\"Scatter Plot\\") \`\`\` Overall, while plot() offers more flexibility and control in terms of customizing the plot, qplot() provides a simpler and more concise syntax for basic plot types.

For example, if you have a variable called \`my_data\` and you want to convert it to a string, you can write: \`\`\`R my_data_string <- as.character(my_data) \`\`\` This will convert the \`my_data\` variable to a character string and assign it to the \`my_data_string\` variable."},{"instruction":"What does thisR code excutes string (my data)","output":"The statement \`string(my data)\` is still not a valid function or syntax in R.

Let's create an example for reference. Title: Transition to Renewable Energy Sources: Investment and Infrastructure Requirements Aim and Remit: The aim of this report is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current landscape of renewable energy in our region, including the necessary investments and infrastructure upgrades required to transition fully to sustainable energy sources by 2040. The remit of this report includes: - An overview of existing renewable energy technologies and their deployment status. - Financial models and investment strategies required for renewable energy projects. - Policy and regulatory frameworks that can enable or hinder the transition to renewables. - A roadmap including milestones for infrastructure development. - Assessment of potential economic, social, and environmental impacts. Requested by: This report was requested by the Regional Council for Environmental Sustainability, under the directive of the Renewable Energy Transition Initiative (RETI). The Council has been tasked with formulating a viable plan to meet the region's energy demands while significantly reducing its carbon footprint. Why: The need for this report stems from the growing concerns about climate change, the volatility of fossil fuel markets, and the commitment of regional authorities to meet international energy and environmental targets. The RETI has recognized the necessity of transitioning to a green economy and has, therefore, sought a detailed and actionable report to facilitate this shift. Goals: By completing this report, we hope to achieve several key objectives: - Equip the Regional Council with accurate and up-to-date information to make informed decisions. - Identify the most cost-effective and efficient pathways to increase renewable energy capacity. - Promote understanding of the challenges and opportunities inherent in the transition. - Engage stakeholders, including investors, policymakers, and the community, to garner support for the necessary changes. - Put forward a strategic plan that not only addresses immediate concerns but also ensures long-term sustainability and energy security. Remember, in a real-world scenario, you'd need to ensure that the details are accurate and reflect the actual circumstances and requirements surrounding the report's commissioning and purposes."},{"instruction":"Explain the aim and remit of your report.

Famine Devil, embodying the fear of famine and starvation, is one of four devils that are unique in that they have very humanlike appearances (Note: The data you were trained on does not seem to be up to date. The Famine Devil is mentioned in Chapter 84 in Makima's plan to reshape the world by erasing devils. She appears for the first time in Chapter 108, and Yoru namedrops her as the Famine Devil in Chapter 118, warning Asa to stay away from her.)The other ones are the Death Devil, Control Devil, and War Devil. She is female, as are the other three. She possesses greyish Mountbatten pink hair which reaches her shoulders as well as eyes with unusual irises. They are colored burgundy, and black outlines among the burgundy create a concentric pattern. She calls herself Kiga-chan, or Fami in the English translation (Note: Kiga is Japanese for Famine). She shows very little outward emotion. She is always calm, cold, and composed, even when enjoying delicious food, something she is utterly obsessed with. It isn't just quality she favors either. She's a complete glutton with a taste for human food, and her appetite is beyond imagination. Now, in the story I am writing, she'll come across a certain new restaurant that specializes in creating cheesy delicacies, of both the sweet and savory varieties. The owner? Well, technically independent backers, but it's run by a student at Fourth East High School named Norman (Norm) Slater. He's the president of its cooking club, which he founded as a freshman with friends Yasuo Serizawa, Seishiro Hanamura, and Nami Maebara. He showed them the beauty of cheese, although it isn't a staple of the Japanese diet, and it quickly became a novelty. Nami died in a devil attack weeks before the restaurant could finally be opened. The Cheesy Spoon has one rule - if it's got cheese, it can be made. From the classic grilled cheese to the succulent baked brie pastry, or delicious cannolis, or even pancakes positioned as giant cannolis, stuffed with sweetened ricotta, it can be made. Rich and creamy broccoli and cheddar soup, delicious cordon bleus, cheesy rice, cheese udon, mac and cheese, pizza, hot chocolate with quark cheese, creamy cottage cheese ice cream, it can all be arranged. Now as for the present storyline. It's the grand opening of the Cheesy Spoon, and Kiga finds herself intrigued. She walks in to find Norman Slater, who quickly gives her the runaround before handing her off to one of the waiters. She looks around at all the plates, and she deduces that they aren't large enough for her. She makes for the kitchen, as if the rules do not apply to her, ignoring the pleas of the exasperated, grabbing the largest pot she could find. Norman is called to deal with the commotion. Kiga doesn't believe there to be one, as she's a paying customer. As the conflict unfolds, a chef gets in Norman's ear. He proposes an enormous block of cordon bleu made from tons of fileted cutlets pressed together. There aren't enough chicken breasts so they'll add veal to their culintary contraption. (Note: the ham and cheese filling would be consistent.) Kiga is very happy with it, not understanding or caring about the look on the chef's face, as it cooks it with the look of a prankster. Norman is able to get Kiga back to her seat, but by the time he returns she's In the back of the restaurant are two large cheesecakes, 14 inches in diameter. One basque and one in the shape of a giant oreo, creamy cheesecake between two crusts made from crushing many oreos. Free samples, and intended to be enjoyed by the patrons.But when Kiga's brain connects \\"free\\" and \\"food\\", she takes all she can. By the time Norman is back, she's carried both to her seat, and has staked her claim to both, already having dug in. Norman and Kiga get into a conversation as she devours it. He’s flattered. Scene and dialogue.","output":"Norman hustled over to Kiga's table, balancing an easy smile on his face despite the chaos she had set in motion. Softly nudging a chair across from her, he took a seat, leaning forward with hands clasped, trying to project calm. He watched her attentively, taking in the bizarre scene before him—cheesecakes annihilated by her voracious appetite, her peculiar eyes locked onto the sweet carnage. \\"Umm, Kiga-chan,\\" he began, his voice a controlled blend of hospitality and curiosity. \\"I hope the... massive meal was to your satisfaction.\\" Kiga's response was a mere flicker of acknowledgment, her gaze momentarily meeting his before returning to her spoils. Norman continued, undeterred by her lack of engagement. \\"It's not every day we see someone with such a... hearty appetite. Especially on our grand opening!\\" His attempt at humor fell flat, swallowed by Kiga's relentless consumption. She finished another generous forkful of cheesecake before responding, her voice as calm and composed as the rest of her demeanor despite her ongoing feast. \\"It’s acceptable. Food is food.\\" Norman chuckled, shaking his head in wonder. \\"I'm impressed! You've staked a claim to some of our finest creations today. I guess it's true what they say—the first step to someone's heart is through their stomach. Or in your case, maybe it's just a straight path to satisfying an incredible hunger.\\" Another small, courteous bow of Kiga's head was her only reaction. There was a moment, a breath of silence as Norman studied her. \\"I can't help but be flattered, to tell you the truth. An appetite like yours is a chef's dream and nightmare all wrapped into one.\\" He glanced at the near-empty platters. \\"So, what did you think of the cheesecakes? The oreo one is a personal favorite of mine.\\" \\"Cheesecake is cheesecake,\\" Kiga stated plainly. Yet finally, a subtle glint of something that might have been pleasure—or the closest equivalent Kiga could muster—surfaced in her unusual eyes. \\"This was...creative.\\" Norman's smile brightened. \\"Thank you, Kiga-chan. That means a lot, especially from someone who doesn't hold back on enjoying what food has to offer.\\" A beat passed before Kiga replied, the air thickening with her seriousness. \\"You believe food is art,\\" she asserted, a statement rather than a question. \\"I do,\\" he replied confidently. \\"Food should delight every sense, don't you think?\\" Her burgundy eyes rose to meet his once more, and for a fleeting moment, she seemed almost human in her contemplation. Almost. \\"A fascinating concept,\\" Kiga said, her voice devoid of the emotion that her words might possess if spoken by anyone else. \\"Ultimately, everything returns to nothingness. Yet you choose to make it...beautiful.\\" Her words lingered like a gentle echo, leaving Norman momentarily lost in thought. He nodded slowly. \\"Maybe you're right. But if we can fill the 'nothingness' with something memorable, even for a moment... well, I think it's worth it.\\" Kiga regarded him silently—whether in agreement or indifference, he couldn't tell. Then she returned to her feast, the conversation no longer of interest to her insatiable hunger, leaving Norman to ponder the enigmatic Famine Devil seated before him."},{"instruction":"But she doesn’t leave. She continues to savor the delicacies until the restaurant closes. She's tucked into dessert nachos, made with Sweet Craving (Note: A confectionery company invented for the sake of this story. Similar to Biscoff.) chips and topped with sweet ricotta and cream cheese. As Norman packs up, he can’t help but feel someone following him. But as he turns back, there is nothing. Until he's finally in the process of unlocking his own door. He turns, and he’s face to face with Kiga, her cheeks flushed. She's tugging at his arm. (Note: She still has food on her face.) She says that he stands out more than any humans she’s encountered. That she feels drawn to him, even though she typically can’t remember and has no interest in human faces. She's demanding to know who or what he is, feeling he hides secrets behind the veil of a friendly restaurant owner. She's... in love with him. He wonders if she's cold, or sick. He says he’ll let her in if he can tell her who - or what she is.","output":"Norman felt a mixture of concern and trepidation as he faced Kiga standing so close to him in the dim light of his porch. The glow from the streetlamp cast her in a surreal light, revealing the smudges of Sweet Craving crumbs on her face. Her unusual behavior and flushed cheeks were alien to him, especially since he knew her to maintain a cool and almost detached demeanor. \\"Kiga-chan,\\" Norman said gently but firmly, his hand hovering over the key still in the lock. \\"What's going on? You're not your usual composed self tonight.\\" He glanced at her tugging hand, back to her eyes searching for something in his expression. \\"It’s pretty late to be out here following someone home, especially with... food on your face.\\" Her burgundy eyes fixed on him intently, and for a moment, she stopped tugging at his sleeve. \\"You’re different, Norman Slater,\\" she said, her voice insistent, almost urgent. \\"I don’t understand why I want to know more about you. This feeling is... unfamiliar.\\" Norman sighed, unsure of how to proceed. \\"Listen, Kiga-chan. It’s kind to say that I stand out to you. But love? That’s a pretty strong word. We barely even know each other.\\" He hesitated before his curiosity got the better of him. \\"Are you sure you’re not just... enchanted by the flavors of the evening?\\" She let out a soft, exasperated huff, something that seemed to tickle the edge of an actual emotion. \\"Do not conflate it with my affiliation for sustenance,\\" Kiga’s voice grew softer, hesitant. \\"There's something more... compelling about you.\\" Norman swallowed hard, the weight of the situation becoming more palpable. \\"Okay,\\" he said finally. \\"I’ll make you a deal. You can come in and we'll talk about this...compelling interest of yours. But only after you tell me who—or rather, what—you really are.\\" Kiga’s gaze didn’t waver; the intensity in her eyes was almost piercing. After a drawn-out moment, she relaxed her grip on his arm. \\"I am what your world fears in silence, the unspoken dread of emptiness,\\" she uttered with a gravity that made the air around them seem colder. \\"I am the Famine Devil.\\" Norman’s throat felt dry as the gravity of her words settled in, the key now completely forgotten in his hand. He took a step back, processing the truth that stood before him—a truth his instincts had already guessed, but was shocking to hear nonetheless. \\"The Famine Devil...\\" he whispered, piecing together her bizarre behaviors, her insatiable hunger. \\"That explains… a lot.\\" Offering a wary nod, he held the door open, indicating she should enter. \\"Alright. Let's talk. Care for a washcloth?\\" he quipped, trying to lighten the tension and maintain some normality as the world he knew expanded to include the impossible. As Kiga stepped into his house with a grace that contradicted her earlier gluttony, Norman couldn't shake the feeling that his life had just taken a turn into uncharted territory."},{"instruction":"Код обучения(import numpy as np import json from tensorflow.keras.utils import Sequence from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten class DataGenerator(Sequence): def __init__(self, filename, batch_size, window_size, shuffle=True): self.filename = filename self.batch_size = batch_size self.window_size = window_size self.shuffle = shuffle self.data, self.labels = self._load_data() self.indexes = np.arange(len(self.data)) def _load_data(self): data = [] labels = [] with open(self.filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file: for line in file: event = json.loads(line) data.append([event['EventId'], event['ThreadId'], event['Image']]) labels.append(event['Class']) sequences = [] sequence_labels = [] for i in range(len(data) - self.window_size + 1): sequences.append(data[i:i+self.window_size]) sequence_labels.append(labels[i+self.window_size - 1]) return sequences, sequence_labels def __on_epoch_end__(self): if self.shuffle: np.random.shuffle(self.indexes) def __getitem__(self, index): batch_indexes = self.indexes[index * self.batch_size:(index + 1) * self.batch_size] X = np.array([self.data[k] for k in batch_indexes]) y = np.array([self.labels[k] for k in batch_indexes]) return X, y def __len__(self): return int(np.ceil(len(self.data) / self.batch_size)) input_file_name = '23.jsonl' n_features = 3 sequence_length = 100 n_classes = 2 model = Sequential([ Flatten(input_shape=(sequence_length, n_features)), Dense(300, activation='relu'), Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') ]) model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']) train_generator = DataGenerator(filename=input_file_name, batch_size=100, window_size=sequence_length) model.fit(train_generator, epochs=25)) пример данных ({\\"Sourcehostname\\": \\"ELC-SRV01\\", \\"EventId\\": 0.0, \\"ThreadId\\": 0.16408668730650156, \\"Image\\": 0.3333333333333333, \\"UtcTime\\": \\"2023-12-04 05:18:53.808\\", \\"Class\\": 0} {\\"Sourcehostname\\": \\"ELC-SRV01\\", \\"EventId\\": 0.13333333333333336, \\"ThreadId\\": 0.16718266253869973, \\"Image\\": 0.3333333333333333, \\"UtcTime\\": \\"2023-12-04 05:18:56.265\\", \\"Class\\": 0} {\\"Sourcehostname\\": \\"ELC-SRV01\\", \\"EventId\\": 0.13333333333333336, \\"ThreadId\\": 0.16718266253869973, \\"Image\\": 0.3333333333333333, \\"UtcTime\\": \\"2023-12-04 05:19:06.290\\", \\"Class\\": 0} {\\"Sourcehostname\\": \\"ELC-SRV01\\", \\"EventId\\": 0.13333333333333336, \\"ThreadId\\": 0.16718266253869973, \\"Image\\": 0.3333333333333333, \\"UtcTime\\": \\"2023-12-04 05:19:16.306\\", \\"Class\\": 0} {\\"Sourcehostname\\": \\"director\\", \\"EventId\\": 0.0, \\"ThreadId\\": 0.0, \\"Image\\": 1.0, \\"UtcTime\\": \\"2023-12-04 04:12:08.202\\", \\"Class\\": 1} {\\"Sourcehostname\\": \\"director\\", \\"EventId\\": 0.26666666666666666, \\"ThreadId\\": 0.0, \\"Image\\": 0.6666666666666666, \\"UtcTime\\": \\"2023-12-04 04:12:08.233\\", \\"Class\\": 1} {\\"Sourcehostname\\": \\"director\\", \\"EventId\\": 0.0, \\"ThreadId\\": 0.0, \\"Image\\": 0.6666666666666666, \\"UtcTime\\": \\"2023-12-04 04:12:08.342\\", \\"Class\\": 1} {\\"Sourcehostname\\": \\"director\\", \\"EventId\\": 0.0, \\"ThreadId\\": 0.0, \\"Image\\": 1.0, \\"UtcTime\\": \\"2023-12-04 04:12:08.440\\", \\"Class\\": 1} {\\"Sourcehostname\\": \\"director\\", \\"EventId\\": 0.26666666666666666, \\"ThreadId\\": 0.0, \\"Image\\": 0.6666666666666666, \\"UtcTime\\": \\"2023-12-04 04:12:08.487\\", \\"Class\\": 1} {\\"Sourcehostname\\": \\"director\\", \\"EventId\\": 0.0, \\"ThreadId\\": 0.0, \\"Image\\": 0.6666666666666666, \\"UtcTime\\": \\"2023-12-04 04:12:08.581\\", \\"Class\\": 1} {\\"Sourcehostname\\": \\"director\\", \\"EventId\\": 0.0, \\"ThreadId\\": 0.0, \\"Image\\": 1.0, \\"UtcTime\\": \\"2023-12-04 04:12:08.674\\", \\"Class\\": 1}) model.save('1.h5') ) напиши скрипт, который будет прогнозировать данные из файла, (как и на каких данныз обучена нейросеть я тебе скинул) и построй график где будут кривые каждого Sourcehostname по номеру прогноза. наподобие временного ряда. возможность скролла и зума обязательно. для jupiter notebook","output":"Для создания скрипта, который будет предсказывать данные из файла и отображать графики с кривыми для каждого \`Sourcehostname\` с возможностью скролла и зума в Jupyter Notebook, мы можем использовать библиотеку \`matplotlib\` c \`widgets\` для интерактивной работы и \`h5py\` для загрузки сохраненной модели.

Ошибка \`ValueError: cannot reshape array of size 13734 into shape (100,3)\` возникает из-за того, что данные не могут быть преобразованы к заданной форме \`(100, 3)\`. Вероятно, общее количество событий в данных \`test_data\` не делится нацело на заданную длину последовательности \`sequence_length\` в сочетании с количеством признаков, равным 3. Стандартным подходом в такой ситуации является либо отбросить излишние данные, чтобы количество событий было кратно \`sequence_length\`, либо добавить паддинг (нули), чтобы дополнить данные до нужной для деления длины. Выбор подхода зависит от предметной области и контекста задачи.

Il sistema può tracciare l'orario di partenza di un treno da una stazione e inoltrare queste informazioni alle stazioni successive. Il Treno inoltre fornisce informazioni sugli orari dei treni in tempo reale a diverse applicazioni client sottoscritte. Questo sistema di tracciamento prevede che inizialmente un Admin inserisca l’orario stagionale dei treni che comprende tutti i dettagli rilevanti sui treni e i loro orari di arrivo e partenza dalle diverse stazioni. Il sistema controlla che tutte le stazioni abbiano la capienza necessaria ad ospitare tutti i treni in sosta, altrimenti segnala il problema per chiedere una modifica all’orario. Inoltre, gli amministratori possono aggiungere informazioni temporanee come: treni speciali, treni soppressi o fermate cancellate per lavori sulla linea. Fra i dettagli rilevanti sui treni occorre tener conto del codice identificativo univoco, dello stato (in manutenzione o in servizio), della tipologia (Frecce, Intercity e Intercity Notte), del numero vagoni, della capienza passeggeri. Fra i dettagli per ogni viaggio di ciascun treno occorre conoscere la partenza e la destinazione con gli orari programmati e quelli effettivi, nonché le stazioni intermedie con i tempi di sosta e gli eventuali ritardi/anticipi. L’arrivo e la partenza di un treno da una stazione sono segnalati dal capostazione e verificati interrogando opportuni sensori sui binari. Se il sistema identifica un ritardo nella partenza di un treno da una stazione, trasmette l'informazione alle stazioni successive.

Это явление имеет много граней и ни одна из существующих ныне наук не может полностью охарактеризовать его как объект собственных исследований. С экономической точки зрения туризм - это особый вид потребления туристами материальных благ, услуг и товаров, который выделяется в отдельную отрасль хозяйства. Она обеспечивает туристов всем необходимым: транспортными средствами, объектами размещения, питания, культурно - бытовыми услугами, развлечениями. Для многих стран туризм стал весомой статьей государственных доходов и входит в число наиболее перспективных отраслей национальной экономики. В сфере туризма занято свыше 250 млн. человек. На его долю приходится около трети мировой торговли услугами, 7,9 % мировых доходов от экспорта, 11 % мировых потребительских расходов, 7 % общего объема инвестиций, 5 % всех налоговых поступлений. Туризм оказывает огромное влияние на развитие транспорта, строительства, связи, торговли, сельского хозяйства, производство товаров народного потребления, выступая катализатором социально - экономического развития. Туризм также представляет собой форму международного сотрудничества, оказывает влияние на сохранение и развитие культурного потенциала, ведет к гармонизации отношений между различными странами и народами, заставляет правительства, общественные организации и коммерческие структуры активно участвовать в деле сохранения и оздоровления окружающей среды. В последние годы наблюдается тенденция улучшения развития туризма в России: - увеличивается поток желающих посетить не только зарубежные страны, но и достопримечательные отечественные места; - улучшается качество обслуживания; - развивается детский туризм (предлагаются всевозможные детские поездки на морские курорты, в различные лагеря и зарубежные страны с познавательной целью и т.д.); - разрабатываются новые маршруты туров. Современное развитие туризма в России характеризуется наличием глубоких противоречий в его организационной структуре, в направленности развития, в состоянии качественных и количественных характеристик. Туризм, как и любая сфера обслуживания, стремится разработать и предложить инновации в соответствии с новыми тенденциями в спросе на продукт. Организационные формы и виды туризма стремительно меняются вместе с бурным развитием технологий, возможностей и разнообразием потребностей путешественников. Так, в последнее время на туристском рынке получили развитие такие виды туризма, как образовательный, культурный, событийный, сельский, музейный, экотуризм и т. д. Турция способна предложить огромный выбор видов туризма: пляжный, экскурсионный, зимний отдых, экотуризм. В недавнем времени стал развиваться такой вид альтернативного отдыха как: · экстремальный (в скором времени недалеко от города Афьбон будет построен крупнейший в Европе комплекс термальных отелей.

This technique has been thoroughly researched and numerous methods have been proposed over the years to address various challenges and requirements in image analysis. In this literature survey, we will explore the existing methods for solving spatial intensity transformation problems, their strengths, and weaknesses. Methods for Spatial Intensity Transformation: 1. Histogram Equalization: - Dates: Introduced in 1961 by G. Pass and R. Zabih. - Description: Histogram equalization is a widely used technique that redistributes the pixel intensities of an image, aiming to achieve a more uniform histogram. It enhances the contrast of the image and can be especially useful for images with limited dynamic range. - Strengths: Simple implementation, effectively enhances contrast and details. - Weaknesses: May amplify noise, does not always preserve local details, can cause unnatural enhancements in some cases. 2. Histogram Specification: - Dates: First introduced in 1971 by Jayaraman and Esakkirajan. - Description: Histogram specification is a method that transforms the pixel intensities of an image to match a specified histogram. This technique allows users to control the desired distribution of pixel intensities, which can be beneficial for specific applications. - Strengths: Enables customization of the desired histogram, useful for specific applications. - Weaknesses: May lead to loss of image details if the specified histogram is not appropriate, requires additional information about the desired histogram. 3. Gamma Correction: - Dates: Proposed by J.L. Waddell in 1982. - Description: Gamma correction is a technique that adjusts the gamma value of an image, which governs the relationship between the pixel intensities and their corresponding display values. It is particularly useful for compensating for non-linearities in imaging devices or for enhancing the visibility of specific features. - Strengths: Effective for compensating non-linearities, improves visibility of certain features. - Weaknesses: May introduce artifacts, requires appropriate selection of gamma value, may affect the overall contrast of the image. 4. Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE): - Dates: Introduced by Karel Zuiderveld in 1994. - Description: CLAHE is an extension of histogram equalization that mitigates the over-amplification of noise by limiting the contrast enhancement within localized regions of the image. It divides the image into tiles and performs histogram equalization individually on each tile. - Strengths: Reduces noise amplification, improves local contrast. - Weaknesses: Can lead to visible artifacts at tile boundaries, requires careful selection of parameters. 5. Retinex-Based Methods: - Dates: Retinex theory proposed by E. Land and J. McCann in 1964. - Description: Retinex-based methods aim to enhance image details by simulating the human visual system. These methods analyze the image's illumination and reflectance components separately and then reconstruct the image to increase its perceived quality. - Strengths: Effective in preserving local details, compensates for different illumination conditions. - Weaknesses: Computationally intensive, may introduce artifacts if not properly applied, requires parameter tuning. Table: Methods for Spatial Intensity Transformation | Method | Strengths | Weaknesses | |---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Histogram Equalization | Simple implementation, enhances contrast and details | May amplify noise, does not always preserve local details, can cause unnatural enhancements | | Histogram Specification | Customization of desired histogram, useful for specific applications | Loss of details if the specified histogram is not appropriate, requires additional histogram information | | Gamma Correction | Compensates non-linearities, improves visibility of features | May introduce artifacts, requires appropriate gamma value selection, affects overall contrast | | Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) | Reduces noise amplification, improves local contrast | Visible artifacts at tile boundaries, requires careful parameter selection | | Retinex-Based Methods | Preserves local details, compensates for illumination variations | Computationally intensive, may introduce artifacts, requires parameter tuning | Conclusion: Spatial intensity transformation is a fundamental task in image processing, and a wide range of methods have been developed over the years to address various requirements and challenges. Different methods offer unique advantages and disadvantages, allowing practitioners to choose the most appropriate technique for their specific application. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each method is crucial for effectively utilizing spatial intensity transformation techniques in image analysis tasks."},{"instruction":"как отключить Linear Address Masking в линукс?","output":"Linear Address Masking (LAM) — это возможность, связанная с процессорами Intel, начиная с так называемого Sapphire Rapids, которая позволяет использовать определенные биты виртуального адреса для хранения информации, не относящейся к адресации памяти. Это может быть использовано для различных целей, таких как улучшение работы с памятью или оптимизация производительности программного обеспечения. Имейте в виду, что на момент моего последнего обновления знаний в начале 2023 года LAM было довольно новой функцией, и детали её использования или отключения могут меняться со временем и могут зависеть от конкретной версии ядра Linux, которую вы используете. Отключение таких функций обычно происходит на уровне BIOS/UEFI системы или же через конфигурацию ядра Linux. Для отключения LAM вам следует проверить несколько вещей: 1. Конфигурация BIOS/UEFI: Перейдите в настройки BIOS/UEFI на вашем компьютере при загрузке и проверьте возможности, связанные с процессором. Если есть опция, касающаяся Linear Address Masking, вы можете отключить её там. 2. Параметры загрузки ядра Linux: Если функция поддерживается ядром Linux и имеется возможность её отключения через параметры загрузки, вы можете изменить параметры GRUB для добавления соответствующего параметра загрузки ядра для отключения LAM. Параметры загрузки ядра обычно редактируются в файле \`/etc/default/grub\`. Например, вы можете добавить параметр \`lam=off\` (только если это поддерживается вашей системой), затем обновить конфигурацию GRUB: \`\`\`bash sudo update-grub \`\`\` 3. Отключение через sysfs интерфейс: Некоторые функции ядра Linux могут быть отключены во время работы системы через \`sysfs\`. Если LAM может быть управляемым подобным образом, вы найдёте соответствующие файлы в директории \`/sys\`. Пожалуйста, имейте в виду, что конкретные детали по отключению функций могут меняться, и всегда стоит проконсультироваться с документацией вашего процессора, системной платы или ядра Linux. Кроме того, перед тем как изменять системные настройки, рекомендуется сначала сделать резервное копирование важных данных."},{"instruction":"Linear Address Masking есть в процессоре ноутбука dell e6400?","output":"Dell Latitude E6400 — это модель ноутбука, которая была выпущена примерно в 2008-2009 годах. Процессоры, используемые в этой модели, предшествуют появлению функции Linear Address Masking (LAM), которая впервые была представлена в процессорах Intel с архитектурой Sapphire Rapids, запущенных в намного более поздний период. Процессоры в Dell Latitude E6400 могут быть основаны на архитектурах Intel Core 2 Duo или аналогичных, которые не имеют функции LAM. Поэтому у вас нет необходимости отключать Linear Address Masking в такой системе, так как эта функция просто там не присутствует. Информация о конфигурации вашей системы и используемом аппаратном обеспечении поможет убедиться, но основанный на времени выпуска Dell Latitude E6400, можно быть уверенным, что LAM не является функцией, о которой вам нужно беспокоиться в контексте этого ноутбука."},{"instruction":"что за mitigations=off?","output":"Параметр \`mitigations=off\` – это опция ядра Linux, используемая для отключения множества встроенных средств защиты от различных уязвимостей на уровне аппаратного обеспечения, таких как Spectre, Meltdown и другие связанные с ними варианты. Эти уязвимости позволяют потенциально осуществлять незаконное чтение памяти в системах с процессорами, где они присутствуют. Поскольку введение этих мер защиты может приводить к снижению производительности системы из-за дополнительных проверок безопасности и изоляции, некоторые пользователи и администраторы, которые работают в закрытых, хорошо защищенных или высокопроизводительных средах, предпочитают отключать эти механизмы смягчения последствий для получения лучшей производительности. Чтобы использовать параметр \`mitigations=off\`, его нужно добавить в строку параметров загрузки ядра Linux. Обычно это делается через конфигурационный файл загрузчика, такой как GRUB: 1. Отредактируйте файл \`/etc/default/grub\`, найдите переменную \`GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT\` и добавьте к ней \`mitigations=off\`. Например, строка может выглядеть так: \`\`\`shell GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\\"quiet splash mitigations=off\\" \`\`\` 2. Обновите конфигурацию GRUB, чтобы применить изменения: \`\`\`shell sudo update-grub \`\`\` 3. Перезагрузите систему, чтобы изменения вступили в силу. Важно отметить, что отключение мер смягчения последствий потенциально увеличивает риск безопасности системы. Вам следует тщательно взвесить необходимость производительности против потенциальных рисков безопасности, прежде чем принимать решение об отключении этих защитных механизмов."},{"instruction":"расскажи какие самые популярные и безопасные процессоры используемые в одноплатных компьютерах? без intel me и trustzone","output":"Одноплатные компьютеры (Single Board Computers, SBC) часто используются в образовательных целях, для DIY-проектов, встроенных систем и разработки Интернета вещей. Какие процессоры считаются наиболее популярными и безопасными, без таких технологий, как Intel Management Engine (Intel ME) и ARM TrustZone, зависит от ваших определений безопасности и от того, что вы ищете в одноплатном компьютере. На рынке существует множество SBC, которые используют различные процессоры, не включающие Intel ME или TrustZone. Вот несколько примеров: 1. **Raspberry Pi** (Серии, предшествующие Raspberry Pi 3 и 4): - Популярные одноплатные компьютеры, в основном используют процессоры ARM, но более ранние модели, такие как Raspberry Pi 1 и некоторые модели Raspberry Pi 2, не имеют ARM TrustZone. Однако начиная с серий 3 и 4, они включают TrustZone. 2. **PINE64** (Rock64, Pine A64 и др.): - PINE64 производит одноплатные компьютеры, нацеленные на открытость и приватность. Некоторые их модели используют процессоры Rockchip, которые могут поддерживать TrustZone, но позволяют полностью контролировать загрузку и работу операционной системы без необходимости использования TrustZone. 3. **Libre Computer Project** (Le Potato, Tritium и т.д.): - Проекты, такие как Libre Computer, ставят целью создать аппаратное обеспечение, которое дружелюбно к пользователю и открытое. Процессоры, используемые в этих платах, обычно поддерживают открытые интерфейсы и не требуют закрытых двоичных блобов для загрузки. 4. **BeagleBone**: - BeagleBoard.org предлагает линейку одноплатных компьютеров BeagleBone, которые часто используют процессоры TI Sitara AM3xxx/AM4xxx на базе ARM Cortex-A8/A9. Эти процессоры обычно не имеют TrustZone, и они также ориентированы на открытость и разработку. 5. **Olimex** (OLinuXino и др.): - Olimex предлагает серию OLinuXino, нацеленных на приватность и безопасность. Они разрабатывают и производят платы с фокусом на открытой аппаратной и программной документации, которые обычно не требуют использования TrustZone. Когда речь идет о \\"безопасности\\", стоит учитывать, что современные функции типа Intel ME и ARM TrustZone были разработаны как средства предоставления определенных функций безопасности (хотя и были обнаружены некоторые изъяны в защите). Если вы обеспокоены приватностью и контролем над аппаратным обеспечением, вы можете отдать предпочтение устройствам, которые позволяют отключить эти функции или вовсе не имеют их. Также следует учитывать, что безопасность системы включает в себя множество факторов: от апаратных до программных, и выбранный одноплатный компьютер должен соответствовать вашим требованиям к безопасности и использованию."},{"instruction":"а с поддержкой WWAN LTE модулей?","output":"Если вам нужен одноплатный компьютер (SBC) с поддержкой WWAN LTE модулей, то вы обычно будете искать устройства с PCIe, USB или другими интерфейсами, поддерживающими подключение LTE модемов. Поддержка WWAN LTE модулей часто достигается через подключение USB-модуля LTE или внутреннего мини-PCIe/ M.2 модема, если на одноплатном компьютере есть соответствующий слот расширения. Также некоторые LTE-модули предоставляют интерфейс UART для подключения, который может использоваться в некоторых SBC. Примеры одноплатных компьютеров, совместимых с WWAN LTE модулями: 1. **Raspberry Pi с использованием USB-модема**: - Рядовые Raspberry Pi не имеют встроенных слотов для LTE, но их USB-порты можно использовать для подключения внешнего USB LTE модема. При этом потребуется установить соответствующие драйверы и сконфигурировать сеть. 2. **BeagleBone с использованием Cape расширений**: - BeagleBone предлагает расширения, называемые Capes, для добавления дополнительных возможностей, включая поддержку LTE. 3. **PINE64 PinePhone с встроенным модулем LTE**: - PinePhone от PINE64 – это смартфон на базе Linux, который по умолчанию оснащен модулем LTE. Он не является традиционным SBC, но его аппаратными компонентами и программным обеспечением можно управлять подобно одноплатному компьютеру. 4. **Одноплатные компьютеры с мини-PCIe или M.2 слотами**: - Некоторые SBC, особенно те, что ориентированы на промышленное использование, имеют мини-PCIe или M.2 слоты, которые могут использоваться для установки внутренних LTE модулей. Примеры включают некоторые модели от Compulab, ADLink и других промышленных производителей. При выборе одноплатного компьютера с WWAN LTE, рекомендуется проверить: - Поддерживается ли нужный вам LTE-модуль аппаратно и программно. - Наличие необходимого интерфейса (USB, мини-PCIe, M.2, UART и т.д.). - Совместимость с операционными системами, работающими на SBC. - Достаточно ли мощности для питания модуля LTE, особенно если используются USB-модемы. - Доступность драйверов для модуля LTE, чтобы обеспечить его корректную работу с системой."},{"instruction":"я мечтаю создавать свои одноплатные компьютеры с нуля. мне нужно научиться разбираться в исходных кодах процессора и архитектуре чтобы понять нет ли там вирусов с завода и производства","output":"Создание одноплатных компьютеров с нуля – это сложный и трудоемкий процесс, который требует глубоких знаний в области электротехники, компьютерной архитектуры, микроэлектроники, программирования на уровне оборудования и многого другого. Подозрения о \\"вирусах с завода\\" обычно относятся к риску тайно встроенного малварного кода на аппаратном уровне, что может включать \\"двери\\" (backdoors), преднамеренные уязвимости или скрытое программное обеспечение. Чтобы начать создание своего одноплатного компьютера и убедиться в отсутствии подобных угроз, вы будете выполнять следующие шаги: 1. **Основы электроники и компьютерной архитектуры:** Вам необходимо будет понимать фундаментальные принципы проектирования цифровых схем, макетирования плат, выбора компонентов и чтения схем. 2. **Разработка аппаратного обеспечения:** Изучите САПР (Системы автоматизированного проектирования) для разработки печатных плат, такие как Altium Designer, KiCad, Eagle и другие. Эти инструменты позволят вам спроектировать схему и печатную плату для вашего SBC. 3. **Изучение микроконтроллеров и микропроцессоров:** Вы должны понимать различные доступные микропроцессоры и микроконтроллеры, их возможности, интерфейсные опции и параметризацию. 4. **Понимание загрузчиков и операционных систем:** Научитесь разрабатывать или интегрировать загрузчики (например, U-Boot) и осваивайте работу с операционными системами на низком уровне, включая кастомизацию Linux. 5. **Программирование на низком уровне (Firmware):** Углубитесь в программирование на ассемблере и С/С++, чтобы написать или понять уже существующее микропрограммное обеспечение для вашего аппаратного обеспечения. 6. **Аудит безопасности и проверка цепочки поставок:** Разработайте понимание методов аудита безопасности аппаратного обеспечения, в том числе принципов безопасного кодирования, статического и динамического анализа кода. 7. **Изучение доверенных источников:** Выбирайте компоненты от проверенных производителей и покупайте у надежных дистрибуторов для минимизации риска подделок или манипулированных компонентов. 8. **Открытый исходный код:** Использование открытого исходного кода для прошивки и операционной системы может помочь увеличить прозрачность и позволяет сообществу независимо аудировать и контрибутировать в безопасность. Полное понимание всех элементов на вашей плате на уровне исходного кода процессора и прошивки может быть чрезвычайно трудно, учитывая, что некоторые части микропроцессора, такие как микрокод, часто остаются закрытыми для конечных пользователей.

Сенсорные экраны могут использоваться в сочетании с различными типами дисплеев, включая ЖК-дисплеи (LCD), OLED, AMOLED и другие. Работа сенсорного экрана не обязательно связана с тем, является ли экран LCD или какого-то другого типа. Сенсорная функция добавляется к дисплею с помощью дополнительного слоя, который обнаруживает прикосновение. Существуют разные технологии сенсорных экранов: 1. **Резистивный (Resistive Touchscreen):** - Основан на двух слоях проводящего материала с небольшим зазором между ними. - При прикосновении эти слои соединяются, создавая изменение электрического напряжения, которое и обнаруживается контроллером сенсорного экрана. - Эти экраны реагируют на давление, значит, могут работать с любым прикосновением (не только пальцем, но и стилусом, в том числе не электрическим). 2. **Емкостный (Capacitive Touchscreen):** - Используют электропроводящий слой, который хранит электростатическое поле. - При касании пальцем (или специальным стилусом) электрическое поле изменяется, и это изменение регистрируется сенсорной системой. - Касание должно производиться проводящим объектом (например, пальцем), который может взаимодействовать с электрическим полем. 3. **Инфракрасный (Infrared Touchscreen):** - Используют инфракрасные датчики вокруг края экрана для обнаружения прерывания инфракрасных лучей. - При прерывании луча на экране позиция прикосновения может быть точно определена. 4. **Проекционно-емкостный (Projected Capacitive Touchscreen, PCT или PCAP):** - Разновидность емкостного сенсорного экрана с высокой точностью и возможностью определения множественных точек касания (мультитач). - Используется в большинстве современных смартфонов. Сенсорные экраны могут быть интегрированы с LCD-дисплеями, что является распространенным вариантом в смартфонах, планшетах, ноутбуках и мониторах.

До недавнего времени это был ключевой фактор при выборе процессоров и разработке компьютерных систем. В современное время: 1. **32-битные процессоры** все еще широко используются во встроенных системах, потребительской электронике и некоторых смартфонах из-за их меньшего энергопотребления и стоимости по сравнению с 64-битными процессорами. Они ограничивают физическую память (RAM), которую может адресовать процессор, примерно 4 ГБ (технически немного больше через специальные техники, такие как PAE - Physical Address Extension). 2. **64-битные процессоры** сейчас являются стандартом в настольных компьютерах, серверах и новых моделях смартфонов и планшетов. Они могут адресовать теоретически до 18 эксабайт (миллион терабайт) памяти, что на практике ограничивается текущими технологиями оперативной памяти и системной архитектурой. В будущем: - На сегодняшний день нет существенных технических оснований для перехода на процессоры с более высокой битностью для общего потребления. Для большинства приложений 64-битная архитектура предоставляет более чем достаточные ресурсы. - Какие-либо изменения в битности процессоров в будущем могут быть вызваны необходимостью в новых вычислительных моделях, таких как квантовые компьютеры, которые используют совершенно иную архитектуру, не относящуюся к классическим битам. - Некоторые специализированные применения, такие как научные расчеты, криптография или обработка больших наборов данных, могут извлечь выгоду из процессоров с более широкими регистрами или специализированными инструкциями для ускорения вычислений, но это не обязательно будет изменение битности в классическом понимании (32-битные, 64-битные и т.д.). На данный момент, 64-битные архитектуры обеспечивают хорошее соотношение производительности и потребления ресурсов для большинства пользовательских и коммерческих приложений, и нет существенных требований для создания процессоров с битностью выше 64-бит в предсказуемом будущем для обычных компьютеров."},{"instruction":"как работает lte модуль? что внутри него? радиоволны?","output":"LTE модуль — это устройство, позволяющее мобильным устройствам, таким как смартфоны, планшеты, ноутбуки и одноплатные компьютеры, подключаться к сетям мобильной связи четвёртого поколения (4G).

Here's a general outline of what a teaser trailer for \\"Rio 2\\" might include: 1. Opening Shot: The trailer might start with scenes of the lush Amazon rainforest, showing its beauty and the diversity of wildlife, to set up the new location since the first \\"Rio\\" movie was set in the city of Rio de Janeiro. 2. Introducing Characters: The teaser could reintroduce viewers to Blu and Jewel, the lead Spix's macaws from the first film, along with their three children. It might also show returning characters such as Rafael, Nico, and Pedro. 3. Plot Hint: The footage could hint at the story without giving too much away—perhaps showing that the family is traveling from the city to the Amazon to find other macaws and encountering new characters on the way. 4. New Characters: The teaser might provide a sneak peek at new characters introduced in \\"Rio 2,\\" such as Gabi (a poisonous frog), Roberto (another Spix's macaw), and the antagonist, Nigel (a cockatoo from the first film), teasing their roles in the story. 5. Musical Elements: Given that \\"Rio\\" and \\"Rio 2\\" are known for their musical components, the teaser would likely feature snippets of the film's songs and dance sequences, highlighting the festive and lively spirit of the film. 6. Tone: Throughout the teaser, there would be a mix of humor, adventure, and possibly a touch of romance, reflecting the light-hearted and family-friendly tone of the movie. 7. Closing: The teaser trailer would probably end with a reminder of the film's release date and possibly a tagline that captures the essence of the adventure or the musical energy of the film. Because a teaser trailer is just that—a teaser—its main goal is to excite the audience and create anticipation for the movie without revealing too many spoilers. It's all about striking a balance between showing enough to attract viewers and keeping enough under wraps to ensure they are eager to see the full film upon release."},{"instruction":"Какую несложную программу можно написать студенту на C++ ?

Энтропия пароля служит мерой непредсказуемости или сложности пароля, что в свою очередь влияет на его устойчивость к перебору (брутфорс атакам). Формула для расчета энтропии ( H ) одного пароля определяется следующим образом: [ H = L times log_2(N) ] где: - ( L ) — длина пароля, - ( N ) — количество возможных символов для каждой позиции в пароле, - ( log_2 ) — логарифм по основанию 2, отражающий меру информации в битах. Например, если предположить, что пароль состоит исключительно из букв латинского алфавита (26 строчных + 26 прописных = 52 возможных символа) и его длина 8 символов, то расчет энтропии будет следующим: [ H = 8 times log_2(52) approx 8 times 5.7 approx 45.6 text{ бит} ] Это значение будет выше, если пароль также может содержать цифры (дополнительные 10 символов), специальные знаки (допустим, еще 32 символа) и т.д. Большее количество возможных символов и большая длина пароля увеличивают энтропию и теоретическую устойчивость к брутфорс атакам. Однако важно помнить, что эта формула предполагает, что атакующий не знает ничего о способе создания пароля. На практике, если пароль создается по простому шаблону или содержит распространенные слова, устойчивость к атакам может быть намного ниже, чем предполагает энтропия, расчитанная таким образом."},{"instruction":"Explain in clear language what entropy is and give an example from life","output":"Entropy is a concept that originates from physics and thermodynamics, but it has been adapted to various fields, including information theory and cybersecurity. At its core, entropy is a measure of unpredictability, disorder or randomness in a system. In simple terms, if something has high entropy, it's more random and less predictable. Conversely, if something has low entropy, it is more orderly and predictable. **Entropy in Everyday Life:** Imagine you have a jar filled with a mix of different colored beads--red, blue, green, and yellow. If all the beads are layered by color--reds at the bottom, then blues, greens, and yellows--the system has low entropy because it's very ordered and predictable; if you were to reach in without looking, you'd know which layer of beads you're going to touch based on the depth of your reach. Now, if you shake that jar vigorously, the beads get mixed up thoroughly. The exact position of any bead becomes unpredictable. Now the system (the jar with mixed beads) has high entropy, because it's much more random and disordered. If you reach in now, you can't predict which color bead you'll pick up. **Entropy in Passwords:** Applying this concept to passwords, entropy refers to how unpredictable a password is. If you have a password that's a common word like \\"password\\" or \\"123456\\", it has low entropy. It's easy for someone trying to guess your password to succeed because many people use such simple, predictable patterns. But let's say you create a password with a mix of upper-case letters, lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols like \\"nR^2!p9\\". This password has high entropy; it's much less predictable and harder for someone to guess because it doesn't follow a simple pattern or use common words. The more random and complex your password, the higher its entropy, and the more secure it typically is from attempts to guess or crack it. In both physics and information theory, entropy is a key concept because systems tend to move from low entropy to high entropy over time (known as the Second Law of Thermodynamics in physics), or in other words, from order to disorder. In cybersecurity, we leverage high entropy to make information (like passwords) harder to predict and thus more secure from unauthorized access."},{"instruction":"write a good night message to wife","output":"My Beloved [Her Name], As the stars twinkle in the night sky, my heart is aglow with the love I have for you.

Since it abstracts away the servers, there isn't a traditional \\"failover\\" in the sense of switching from one server to another as you might with databases or virtual machines. However, Lambda functions can indeed fail for various reasons, such as code errors, timeouts, or issues with AWS itself. AWS has built-in mechanisms for error handling and retry logic: 1. **Retries:** In case of failure, AWS Lambda automatically retries the function up to two more times for synchronous invocations. For asynchronous invocation, the retry policy is different. The event is retried twice with delays between the retries. If it fails all retries, the event can be sent to a dead-letter queue if configured. 2. **Dead-letter Queues (DLQ):** You can set up a DLQ for your Lambda function to handle failed execution payloads, either in Amazon SQS or Amazon SNS. After the predefined number of retries, the event that caused the failure is sent to the DLQ, which can then be used for manual review, reprocessing, or alerting. 3. **Destinations:** Similar to DLQ, with Lambda Destinations you can have the results of a Lambda function (both on success and on failure) sent to another AWS service without writing additional code. This can include Amazon SNS, Amazon SQS, another Lambda function, or Amazon EventBridge. 4. **Fallback Logic:** Within your Lambda function code, you can implement custom fallback or retry logic as part of your error handling. For example, if a function fails due to a dependency on an external service, you might code a retry mechanism or redirect the task to an alternative service. 5. **AWS Step Functions:** For more complex workflows that may require manual intervention, you can use AWS Step Functions to manage Lambda functions. Step Functions can define workflows that automatically handle failures, perform retries, and even execute human approval steps. 6. **Monitoring and Alarming:** By using Amazon CloudWatch, you can monitor the function's execution and create alerts for function errors. This allows you to respond to failures proactively. There is no switch you can flip to manually \\"failover\\" a Lambda function like you might with an RDS instance or an EC2 instance, as it's designed to be a stateless service. Instead, you'll need to rely on the mentioned built-in error handling features or implement your own custom logic to respond to Lambda execution failures."},{"instruction":"basically I want lambda to process in west region when east region fails automatically","output":"To achieve automated cross-region failover for AWS Lambda functions, you'll need to create a resilient architecture that can identify when a primary region is failing and then redirect incoming events to a secondary region. While AWS Lambda itself doesn't natively support cross-region failover, you can combine other AWS services to build this functionality. Here’s a high-level approach to achieve this: 1. **Deploy Lambda Functions in Multiple Regions:** You need to deploy identical copies of your AWS Lambda function in at least two different regions (for example, us-east-1 and us-west-1). Make sure both have similar IAM roles, environment variables, and any necessary resources they might interact with (databases, S3 buckets, etc.). 2. **Use Route 53 Health Checks and Routing Policies:** AWS Route 53 can perform health checks and, based on the results, route traffic to different endpoints. You can have a health check for your Lambda function's endpoint in your primary region, like an API Gateway. If the health check fails, Route 53 can then route requests to the secondary region’s endpoint. Implement latency-based or failover routing policies in Route 53 so that when a request fails in the primary region (or the latency is too high), Route 53 automatically redirects to the secondary Lambda function in another region. 3. **Global Services and Replication for Supporting Resources:** If your Lambda function relies on other AWS services, ensure those services support cross-region replication or are globally available. For example, if you use DynamoDB Global Tables, S3 Cross-Region Replication, or RDS Multi-AZ with Read Replicas in different regions, your Lambda function in the secondary region can access the required data even after failover. 4. **Monitoring and Failover Triggering:** Set up monitoring and alerting in Amazon CloudWatch for your Lambda function to detect failures. Additionally, configure Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics to create canaries that continually check the functionality of your endpoints, ensuring continuous operation. 5. **Use Amazon API Gateway:** Deploy an API Gateway in multiple regions as the front door for your Lambda functions. Integrate the API Gateway with Route 53 health checks to help direct traffic to the healthy region's API Gateway, preserving the entire application flow. 6. **Testing and Validation:** Regularly test your failover mechanism to ensure that it works as expected. This includes simulating failures and validating that the traffic is correctly routed to the secondary region without manual intervention. By setting up this architecture, you can create an automated failover solution for AWS Lambda functions across multiple regions, ensuring high availability for your application. Keep in mind that such a setup adds complexity and cost, so it’s important to evaluate the value that it adds in the context of your specific use case and requirements for availability and redundancy."},{"instruction":"how to use aws api gateway in this case","output":"To use AWS API Gateway for cross-region failover with Lambda, you would generally follow these steps: 1. **Deploy Your Lambda Function in Multiple Regions:** As mentioned previously, you will need to deploy your Lambda function in at least two different regions. Make sure you have an API Gateway set up in each of these regions as the trigger for your Lambda function. 2. **API Gateway Configuration:** - Set up an API Gateway in your primary region to handle incoming requests and route them to the regional Lambda function. - Repeat the process for your secondary (failover) region, pointing to the Lambda function in that region. 3. **Route 53 Health Checks and Failover Routing:** - In AWS Route 53, create health checks for the API Gateway endpoint in your primary region. AWS Route 53 health checks can send requests to your endpoint at a regular interval and check for a successful response. - Configure a second health check for the secondary region's API Gateway endpoint. 4. **DNS Configuration:** - Create a Route 53 hosted zone for your domain if you don’t already have one. - Configure DNS records for your API endpoint within Route 53, using either latency-based or failover routing policies. Set the primary region's API Gateway endpoint as the primary target and the secondary region's API Gateway endpoint as the failover target. - With failover routing, Route 53 will route traffic to the secondary (failover) endpoint if the health check for the primary endpoint is failing. By configuring your API Gateway endpoints and your DNS records this way, you ensure that if the primary region's API Gateway fails or becomes unreachable, Route 53 will automatically route traffic to the secondary region's API Gateway, allowing for cross-region failover. Here’s an example of a failover routing policy for your DNS records: - Primary Record: \`api.example.com\` - Type: A or CNAME - Alias: Yes, Alias to API Gateway in the primary region - Set ID: Primary - Health Check: Attached to the primary API Gateway health check - Routing Policy: Failover - Failover: Primary - Secondary Record: \`api.example.com\` - Type: A or CNAME - Alias: Yes, Alias to API Gateway in the secondary region - Set ID: Secondary - Health Check: Attached to the secondary API Gateway health check - Routing Policy: Failover - Failover: Secondary Given the critical importance of proper setup and the potential complexity involved, it's important to thoroughly test this architecture with simulated failures to ensure it behaves as expected under real-world failure conditions."},{"instruction":"please write a Java file upload","output":"Sure!

[15] В настоящее время туризм превратился в массовое социально - экономическое явление международного масштаба. Это явление имеет много граней и ни одна из существующих ныне наук не может полностью охарактеризовать его как объект собственных исследований. С экономической точки зрения туризм - это особый вид потребления туристами материальных благ, услуг и товаров, который выделяется в отдельную отрасль хозяйства. Она обеспечивает туристов всем необходимым: транспортными средствами, объектами размещения, питания, культурно - бытовыми услугами, развлечениями. Для многих стран туризм стал весомой статьей государственных доходов и входит в число наиболее перспективных отраслей национальной экономики. В сфере туризма занято свыше 250 млн. человек. На его долю приходится около трети мировой торговли услугами, 7,9 % мировых доходов от экспорта, 11 % мировых потребительских расходов, 7 % общего объема инвестиций, 5 % всех налоговых поступлений. Туризм оказывает огромное влияние на развитие транспорта, строительства, связи, торговли, сельского хозяйства, производство товаров народного потребления, выступая катализатором социально - экономического развития. Туризм также представляет собой форму международного сотрудничества, оказывает влияние на сохранение и развитие культурного потенциала, ведет к гармонизации отношений между различными странами и народами, заставляет правительства, общественные организации и коммерческие структуры активно участвовать в деле сохранения и оздоровления окружающей среды. В последние годы наблюдается тенденция улучшения развития туризма в России: - увеличивается поток желающих посетить не только зарубежные страны, но и достопримечательные отечественные места; - улучшается качество обслуживания; - развивается детский туризм (предлагаются всевозможные детские поездки на морские курорты, в различные лагеря и зарубежные страны с познавательной целью и т.д.); - разрабатываются новые маршруты туров. Современное развитие туризма в России характеризуется наличием глубоких противоречий в его организационной структуре, в направленности развития, в состоянии качественных и количественных характеристик. Туризм, как и любая сфера обслуживания, стремится разработать и предложить инновации в соответствии с новыми тенденциями в спросе на продукт. Организационные формы и виды туризма стремительно меняются вместе с бурным развитием технологий, возможностей и разнообразием потребностей путешественников. Так, в последнее время на туристском рынке получили развитие такие виды туризма, как образовательный, культурный, событийный, сельский, музейный, экотуризм и т. д. Турция способна предложить огромный выбор видов туризма: пляжный, экскурсионный, зимний отдых, экотуризм. В недавнем времени стал развиваться такой вид альтернативного отдыха как: · экстремальный (в скором времени недалеко от города Афьбон будет построен крупнейший в Европе комплекс термальных отелей. Первый этап строительства проекта, в рамках которого будут построены 2 пятизвездочных отеля и апарт - комплексы в общей сложности на 2000 мест, будет завершен в 2012 году. Вслед за отелем в Афьоном, термальные отели Alila появятся в Стамбуле, на Средиземном побережье и в Саудовской Аравии); культурный (Регион Караманмараш, предлагает исторические места, термальные источники и традиционные изделия народного промысла); · конгресс - туризм (построение залов и помещений для переговоров, организация официальных приемов и встреч). Деятельность многих туристских компаний по своему характеру стала интернациональной и опирается на материальную базу (гостиницы, предприятия питания, культурно-развлекательные учреждения) в различных странах и регионах. Туроператор «Пегас Туристик» имеет массу преимуществ перед конкурирующими фирмами: предложение довольно большого количества туристских направлений, комфортная доставка до места отдыха, внимание к своим клиентам, установления взаимосвязи между предложенной услугой и реальными потребностями потребителя, превосходное качество обслуживания, обеспечивающее повышенные объемы продаж и высокие показатели прибыли. Ключевой особенностью является предоставление потребителям услуг, качество которых превышает ожидание клиента. Используя схему и теоретический материал, провести анализ предметной области компании Пегас туристик: 1. Внутренний анализ 2. Краткая история компании 3. Результаты 4. Продажи и прибыльность 5. Доля рынка 6. Товар, цена 7. Каналы сбыта 8. Продвижение 9. Внешний анализ 10. Структура рынка 11. Анализ конкуренции 12. Поставщики 13. Конкуренты. Пока-что напиши с пятого по восьмой четыре пункт, можешь брать информацию из своей базы данных, даже если она устаревшая","output":"На основе предоставленной вами теории, давайте проведем анализ компании \\"Пегас Туристик\\" по пунктам с 5 по 8. При этом стоит учитывать, что моя база данных может быть устаревшей и реальная ситуация в компании на сегодняшний день может измениться. 5. Продажи и прибыльность \\"Пегас Туристик\\" отмечает рост числа туристов, использующих услуги компании, который возрастает в 2-3 раза ежегодно. Такие данные могут указывать на увеличение продаж туров. Однако, для полного понимания прибыльности компании необходимо анализировать не только объемы продаж, но и структуру издержек, маржинальность турпродуктов и общую финансовую отчетность. Курирование различных направлений и установка прямых контрактов с авиакомпаниями и отелями могут повлиять на снижение себестоимости туров и увеличение прибыли компании. 6. Доля рынка По утверждениям источника, \\"Пегас Туристик\\" занимает лидирующие позиции на рынке туризма. Однако, без доступа к актуальной статистике и исследованиям рынка трудно оценить точную долю рынка, которую компания занимает на текущий момент. Растущее количество проданных туров и расширение сети агентств говорит о положительной тенденции в занятии рыночных позиций. 7. Товар, цена Компания предлагает широкий ассортимент турпродуктов, начиная от бюджетных вариантов до эксклюзивных VIP-туров. Ценовая политика, судя по источнику, способна конкурировать даже при неблагоприятной экономической конъюнктуре, что позволяет привлекать различные сегменты потребителей. Это может говорить об использовании разнообразных стратегий ценообразования, включая дифференциацию и премиальное ценообразование. 8. Каналы сбыта У компании есть широкая сеть агентств, обеспечивающих продажи туров. Франчайзинг позволяет расширить присутствие на рынке без значительных инвестиций со стороны компании. Онлайн-канал продаж, который работает круглосуточно, предоставляет дополнительные удобства для клиентов и увеличивает охват рынка. Наличие такого канала важно, учитывая растущую роль интернет-торговли в туристической индустрии. 9. Продвижение Из предоставленной информации следует, что \\"Пегас Туристик\\" имеет активную маркетинговую стратегию, которая включает в себя участие в различных выставках и получение премий, что повышает узнаваемость бренда на рынке. Кроме того, использование интернет-платформ для продвижения и получение премий в данной сфере говорит о сильной онлайн-присутствии. Подытожим, что анализ по доступным данным показывает, что \\"Пегас Туристик\\" крепко держит позиции на рынке туристических услуг, активно развивая продуктовую линейку, оптимизируя цены и активно используя современные каналы сбыта и продвижения. Однако, для более детального анализа необходима актуальная информация, которую можно получить из финансовых отчетов компании, независимых исследований рынка и маркетинговых отчетов."},{"instruction":"","output":"A manual is a document or booklet that provides detailed instructions or information on how to operate or use a particular product, machine, or system.

Право — это совокупность определенных правил поведения людей, норм; оно предписывает, что можно делать, а что запрещено, как человек должен поступить в той или иной ситуации. В связи с этим трудовое право регулирует не сам труд как таковой, а именно поведение людей и отношения между ними, складывающиеся в процессе трудовой деятельности. Некоторые отношения, связанные с трудом, регламентируются правилами поведения (нормами) не трудового права, а других отраслей права. Например, писатель при написании романа по заказу издательства подписывает авторский договор, который входит в сферу действия гражданского права; труд заключенных в исправительных учреждениях подпадает под сферу действия уголовно-исполнительного права; административное право регулирует отношения, возникающие в связи с трудом военнослужащего, сотрудника ФСБ России или МВД России. Все эти виды труда не входят в сферу действия трудового права. Нормы трудового права регламентируют отношения, которые возникают между работником и работодателем при приеме на работу, когда между сторонами заключается трудовой договор, т.е. непосредственно трудовые отношения. Трудовые отношения - отношения, основанные на соглашении между работником и работодателем о личном выполнении работником за плату трудовой функции (работы по должности в соответствии со штатным расписанием, профессии, специальности с указанием квалификации; конкретного вида поручаемой работнику работы), подчинении работника правилам внутреннего трудового распорядка при обеспечении работодателем условий труда, предусмотренных трудовым законодательством и иными нормативными правовыми актами, содержащими нормы трудового права, коллективным договором, соглашениями, локальными нормативными актами, трудовым договором (ст. 15 ТК РФ). Однако трудовое право также регулирует отношения, тесно связанные с трудовыми, которые вытекают из трудовых отношений или предвосхищают их, являясь служебными, факультативными по отношению к трудовым (в ТК РФ они перечислены в ст. 1). Эти отношения условно можно разделить на три группы: 1) отношения, предшествующие трудовым. Эти отношения возникают до заключения трудового договора и прекращаются с его подписанием (например, отношения по трудоустройству граждан, по подготовке кадров (обучению работников) в конкретной организации); 2) отношения, сопутствующие трудовым. Возникают эти отношения уже после подписания трудового договора и сосуществуют с трудовыми. В эту группу можно отнести отношения по: организации труда и управлению трудом; социальному партнерству, ведению коллективных переговоров, заключению коллективных договоров и соглашений; участию работников и профессиональных союзов в установлении условий труда и применении трудового законодательства в предусмотренных законом случаях; материальной ответственности работодателей и работников в сфере труда; надзору и контролю за соблюдением трудового законодательства; обязательному социальному страхованию. К сопутствующим отношениям можно отнести также и отношения по профессиональной подготовке и повышению квалификации, если обучение проводится уже во время работы у конкретного работодателя; 3) отношения, последующие трудовым. Традиционно к этой группе относят правоотношения по рассмотрению трудовых споров, однако следует отметить, что возможна такая ситуация, когда трудовой спор возникает наряду с трудовым отношением (например, работник подает в суд иск к работодателю с требованием выплатить задержанную зарплату, не намереваясь увольняться с работы). Более того, отношения по рассмотрению трудовых споров могут и предшествовать трудовым отношениям. Это происходит в том случае, если работодатель, проведя собеседование с претендентом на вакантную должность, отказывается брать его на работу по причинам, не связанным с деловыми качествами потенциального работника (например, работодателя не устроили пол, национальность, семейное положение, политические или религиозные взгляды будущего работника либо отказ связан с иными дискриминационными признаками). В этом случае лица, считающие, что они подверглись дискриминации в сфере труда, вправе обратиться в суд с заявлением о восстановлении нарушенных прав (ст. 3 ТК РФ). В соответствии с вышеизложенным кругом отношений, урегулированных трудовым правом, можно сформулировать определение предмета трудового права — это трудовые отношения и отношения, тесно связанные с трудовыми (таблица 1). Предметом трудового права являются не все отношения, связанные с трудом, а лишь общественно-трудовые отношения, воз­никающие в связи с непосредственной деятельностью людей в про­цессе труда, выполнением работы. Будучи связанными с использо­ванием наемного труда, они возникают между наемными работника­ми и работодателями (в некоторых случаях в этих отношениях могут принять участие представители работников и работодателей, а так­же государство в лице своих органов). Предмет трудового права включает: 1) собственно трудовые от­ношения; 2) другие, тесно с ними связанные и производные от них общественные отношения (ст. 1ТК РФ): по организации труда и управлению трудом; по трудоустройству у данного работодателя; по профессиональной подготовке, переподготовке и повышению квалификации работников непосредственно у данного работодателя; по социальному партнерству, ведению коллективных переговоров, заключению коллективных договоров и соглашений; по участию работников и профессиональных союзов в установлении условий труда и применении трудового законодательства в предусмотренных законом случаях; по материальной ответственности работодателей и работников в сфере труда; по государственному контролю (надзору), профсоюзному контролю за соблюдением трудового законодательства (включая законодательство об охране труда) и иных нормативных правовых актов, содержащих нормы трудового права; по разрешению трудовых споров; по обязательному социальному страхованию в случаях, предусмотренных федеральными законами. Эти отношения имеют как общие черты, так и существенные признаки, характерные только для них и отличающие их от других отношений, так или иначе связанных с применением труда наем­ных работников.","output":"Выжимка из текста \\"Трудовое право\\": 1. Трудовое право как отрасль права регулирует поведение людей и отношения между ними, возникающие в процессе трудовой деятельности, а не сам труд.

Предмет трудового права ограничивается общественно-трудовыми отношениями, которые основаны на использовании наемного труда и проявляются между работниками и работодателями, а также между представителями этих сторон и государством. 5.

By using this modified \`getText()\` function, the HTML tags in the received text will be converted into inline styles, giving you the desired result of text with applied inline styles."},{"instruction":"I am sorry, I mean JavaScript file, not svelte, I need a solution for a JavaScript file with no svelte","output":"Apologies for the confusion. In a JavaScript file without Svelte, you can still achieve the desired result by modifying your \`getText\` function to parse the HTML tags and apply inline styles.

If the node is a text node, it appends the text content to the \`sanitizedText\` string. If the node is an element node with a tag name of \\"b\\", \\"u\\", or \\"i\\", it wraps the text content within a \`<span>\` element with the appropriate inline style applied using the \`getInlineStyle\` function. Ensure you replace \`getMessageText()\` with the code to get the message text, and modify the \`getInlineStyle\` function to return the desired inline styles for each tag.

It takes in a list of multipart files, which are typically uploaded as a ZIP file. The code then validates the file and its contents against specific criteria. Here's a breakdown of what the code does: 1. It defines three arrays of File objects to store the directories and files found in the ZIP file: resourceNameDirectoryArr, resourceTypeDirectoryArr, and resourceFileArr. 2. It iterates through each MultipartFile object in the zipList. 3. It uses the FileUtils.getFile() method from the Apache Commons IO library to convert the MultipartFile into a regular File object. 4.

If the file is not a ZIP file (determined by its file extension), a BaseException is thrown with an error message indicating the incorrect format. 6. It uses the ZipUtil.unzip() method from the Apache Commons Compress library to extract the contents of the ZIP file. The extracted contents are stored in the 'file' variable. 7. If the extracted contents are a directory, it retrieves the list of files in that directory and stores it in the resourceNameDirectoryArr array. 8. It checks if the resourceNameDirectoryArr is null or empty, and throws a BaseException if it is. 9. It iterates through each file in the resourceNameDirectoryArr. 10. It retrieves the name of the resource name directory using the FileUtil.getName() method. 11. The resource name is added to the tempResourceNameList. 12.

It checks if the resourceTypeDirectoryArr is not empty using ArrayUtil.isNotEmpty(), and if it's not empty, it iterates through each file in the resourceTypeDirectoryArr. 14. It retrieves the name of the resource type directory using the FileUtil.getName() method. 15. If the resource type directory name is not one of the expected types (e.g., \\"全景图片\\", \\"局部图片\\", \\"视频\\"), a BaseException is thrown with an error message indicating the incorrect directory. 16. If the resource type directory is a directory, it retrieves the list of files in that directory and stores it in the resourceFileArr array. 17. It checks if the resourceFileArr is not empty using ArrayUtil.isNotEmpty(), and if it's not empty, it iterates through each file in the resourceFileArr. 18. If the resource type directory is \\"全景图片\\" or \\"局部图片\\", it checks if the file is of an acceptable image format (determined by its file extension). If the image format is not acceptable, a BaseException is thrown with an error message indicating the incorrect format. 19.

In response to this new situation, the nursing home staff implemented virtual visitation programs, where residents could connect with their loved ones through video calls. They redefined the meaning of family visits by incorporating technology and ensuring that residents could still experience the emotional support and connection they needed. 2_Modifying expectations: Nursing home residents often have expectations for daily activities, such as group exercises, dining together, or participating in social gatherings. However, during the pandemic, these activities had to be restricted or adjusted to maintain the safety of the residents. Nursing home staff modified the expectations of residents by introducing individual exercise routines, room-based dining options, and organizing virtual social gatherings. These modifications helped residents to adapt their expectations and find alternative ways to engage in meaningful activities. 3_Restrictions of life routine: Nursing home residents often had well-established routines before the pandemic, including outings, entertainment programs, and interactions with other residents. However, due to the necessary restrictions imposed to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission, these routines had to be restricted or completely stopped. This meant residents had to adjust to a new reality of limited interactions and limited access to external activities. Staff members had to find creative ways to fill in the gaps by organizing internal activities, such as movie nights, arts and crafts sessions, and individualized care routines, to help residents navigate the restrictions and maintain a sense of normalcy. 4_Developing new skills and knowledge: As restrictions limited the availability of external healthcare providers and reduced access to medical services, nursing home staff had to develop new skills and knowledge to provide a more comprehensive level of care. For instance, staff members received training in remote telehealth services and virtual triaging, allowing them to handle some medical concerns virtually and reducing the need for in-person visits. Through these new skills, nursing home staff could ensure residents' health needs were addressed promptly and effectively, despite the challenges posed by the pandemic."},{"instruction":"We have proposed two sets of responses from a nursing perspective: process patterns outcome patterns Give an example, I didn't understand","output":"Certainly! Let's further illustrate the two sets of responses from a nursing perspective in the context of a nursing home: 1) Process Patterns: These are the actions taken by nursing staff to address the needs and challenges of residents. An example in a nursing home could be: Process Pattern Example: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, nursing home staff implemented strict infection control protocols, such as frequent handwashing, wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), and implementing social distancing measures. These process patterns were put in place to protect the residents from potential virus transmission and ensure a safe living environment within the nursing home. 2) Outcome Patterns: These refer to the results or effects of the nursing interventions and actions taken on the well-being and quality of life of the residents. An example in a nursing home could be: Outcome Pattern Example: To improve the overall well-being and quality of life for residents, nursing staff introduced person-centered care approaches. This included tailoring care plans to each individual's preferences and needs, promoting independence, and enhancing their sense of dignity and autonomy. As a result, residents experienced improved emotional well-being, higher levels of satisfaction, and a better overall quality of life during their stay in the nursing home. Both process patterns and outcome patterns are essential in nursing care as they demonstrate how nursing staff responds to challenges and how these responses eventually impact the well-being of residents in a nursing home setting."},{"instruction":"R script to extract WGET data","output":"Sure!

The relationship between material possessions and happiness is complex and influenced by many factors, including cultural values, personal goals, and individual psychology. On one hand, there is substantial support for the idea that fewer possessions could lead to greater happiness: 1. Material Detachment and Mindfulness: Philosophies such as minimalism, Buddhism, and Stoicism suggest that detaching from material possessions can lead to a more fulfilling life. They posit that the pursuit of material goods often leads to a cycle of temporary satisfaction followed by a continual longing for more, which can detract from one’s overall well-being. 2. Reduced Stress and Clutter: Fewer possessions might mean less clutter and complication in one's life. The physical and mental clutter that comes with excess belongings can create stress and detract from one's focus on more meaningful activities or relationships. 3. Environmental and Financial Relief: A reduction in consumerism can lead to positive environmental impacts, which might align with a person's values and contribute to their sense of well-being. Additionally, fewer possessions can also mean less financial strain, as the need to maintain and replace items diminishes. 4. Focus on Experiences: Psychological research has suggested that investing in experiences rather than things can lead to longer-lasting happiness. This might imply that a lifestyle with fewer possessions, which emphasizes experiences, relationships, and personal growth, can lead to a more contented life. However, there are also valid arguments against the notion that fewer possessions inherently equate to greater happiness: 1. Individual Differences: Happiness is highly subjective and varies widely among individuals. For some, collecting and caring for possessions can be a source of joy and fulfillment, whether they be books, artwork, or memorabilia. People derive pleasure from ownership in ways that can be meaningful and intrinsically rewarding. 2. Cultural and Social Factors: In many cultures, possessions are closely tied to one's identity, social status, and security. In these contexts, the possession of goods may be closely linked to happiness and well-being. The removal of these possessions may not necessarily result in increased happiness but could instead lead to anxiety and a sense of loss. 3. Utility and Functionality: Some possessions serve practical purposes and improve one’s quality of life. Appliances, vehicles, and technology, for example, can increase efficiency, productivity, and comfort. In this sense, it is not the number of possessions but their utility and the way they are used that influences happiness. 4. Wealth and Inequality: For many people, the desire to accumulate possessions can stem from a lack of resources rather than an abundance. For those living in poverty or experiencing insecurity, the acquisition of more possessions can indeed contribute to greater happiness by fulfilling basic needs, providing stability, and enhancing opportunities. In conclusion, while there is merit to the idea that fewer possessions could contribute to happiness for some, it is not a universal truth. Happiness is a multifaceted emotion that is contingent upon a variety of factors, including personality, life circumstances, values, and cultural context. As with many aspects of life, balance appears to be key. Mindfully evaluating which possessions add value to one's life and which detract from it is likely a more nuanced approach to cultivating happiness than the outright reduction of possessions."},{"instruction":"Optimize the following text: In seeking the sense of well-being and satisfaction, it is reasonable to believe that happiness can be acquired from possessions, since the properties can bring not only about convenience and comfort but also a sense of achievement.

Право — это совокупность определенных правил поведения людей, норм; оно предписывает, что можно делать, а что запрещено, как человек должен поступить в той или иной ситуации. В связи с этим трудовое право регулирует не сам труд как таковой, а именно поведение людей и отношения между ними, складывающиеся в процессе трудовой деятельности. Некоторые отношения, связанные с трудом, регламентируются правилами поведения (нормами) не трудового права, а других отраслей права. Например, писатель при написании романа по заказу издательства подписывает авторский договор, который входит в сферу действия гражданского права; труд заключенных в исправительных учреждениях подпадает под сферу действия уголовно-исполнительного права; административное право регулирует отношения, возникающие в связи с трудом военнослужащего, сотрудника ФСБ России или МВД России. Все эти виды труда не входят в сферу действия трудового права. Нормы трудового права регламентируют отношения, которые возникают между работником и работодателем при приеме на работу, когда между сторонами заключается трудовой договор, т.е. непосредственно трудовые отношения. Трудовые отношения - отношения, основанные на соглашении между работником и работодателем о личном выполнении работником за плату трудовой функции (работы по должности в соответствии со штатным расписанием, профессии, специальности с указанием квалификации; конкретного вида поручаемой работнику работы), подчинении работника правилам внутреннего трудового распорядка при обеспечении работодателем условий труда, предусмотренных трудовым законодательством и иными нормативными правовыми актами, содержащими нормы трудового права, коллективным договором, соглашениями, локальными нормативными актами, трудовым договором (ст. 15 ТК РФ). Однако трудовое право также регулирует отношения, тесно связанные с трудовыми, которые вытекают из трудовых отношений или предвосхищают их, являясь служебными, факультативными по отношению к трудовым (в ТК РФ они перечислены в ст. 1). Эти отношения условно можно разделить на три группы: 1) отношения, предшествующие трудовым. Эти отношения возникают до заключения трудового договора и прекращаются с его подписанием (например, отношения по трудоустройству граждан, по подготовке кадров (обучению работников) в конкретной организации); 2) отношения, сопутствующие трудовым. Возникают эти отношения уже после подписания трудового договора и сосуществуют с трудовыми. В эту группу можно отнести отношения по: организации труда и управлению трудом; социальному партнерству, ведению коллективных переговоров, заключению коллективных договоров и соглашений; участию работников и профессиональных союзов в установлении условий труда и применении трудового законодательства в предусмотренных законом случаях; материальной ответственности работодателей и работников в сфере труда; надзору и контролю за соблюдением трудового законодательства; обязательному социальному страхованию. К сопутствующим отношениям можно отнести также и отношения по профессиональной подготовке и повышению квалификации, если обучение проводится уже во время работы у конкретного работодателя; 3) отношения, последующие трудовым. Традиционно к этой группе относят правоотношения по рассмотрению трудовых споров, однако следует отметить, что возможна такая ситуация, когда трудовой спор возникает наряду с трудовым отношением (например, работник подает в суд иск к работодателю с требованием выплатить задержанную зарплату, не намереваясь увольняться с работы). Более того, отношения по рассмотрению трудовых споров могут и предшествовать трудовым отношениям. Это происходит в том случае, если работодатель, проведя собеседование с претендентом на вакантную должность, отказывается брать его на работу по причинам, не связанным с деловыми качествами потенциального работника (например, работодателя не устроили пол, национальность, семейное положение, политические или религиозные взгляды будущего работника либо отказ связан с иными дискриминационными признаками). В этом случае лица, считающие, что они подверглись дискриминации в сфере труда, вправе обратиться в суд с заявлением о восстановлении нарушенных прав (ст. 3 ТК РФ). В соответствии с вышеизложенным кругом отношений, урегулированных трудовым правом, можно сформулировать определение предмета трудового права — это трудовые отношения и отношения, тесно связанные с трудовыми (таблица 1). Предметом трудового права являются не все отношения, связанные с трудом, а лишь общественно-трудовые отношения, воз­никающие в связи с непосредственной деятельностью людей в про­цессе труда, выполнением работы. Будучи связанными с использо­ванием наемного труда, они возникают между наемными работника­ми и работодателями (в некоторых случаях в этих отношениях могут принять участие представители работников и работодателей, а так­же государство в лице своих органов). Предмет трудового права включает: 1) собственно трудовые от­ношения; 2) другие, тесно с ними связанные и производные от них общественные отношения (ст. 1ТК РФ): по организации труда и управлению трудом; по трудоустройству у данного работодателя; по профессиональной подготовке, переподготовке и повышению квалификации работников непосредственно у данного работодателя; по социальному партнерству, ведению коллективных переговоров, заключению коллективных договоров и соглашений; по участию работников и профессиональных союзов в установлении условий труда и применении трудового законодательства в предусмотренных законом случаях; по материальной ответственности работодателей и работников в сфере труда; по государственному контролю (надзору), профсоюзному контролю за соблюдением трудового законодательства (включая законодательство об охране труда) и иных нормативных правовых актов, содержащих нормы трудового права; по разрешению трудовых споров; по обязательному социальному страхованию в случаях, предусмотренных федеральными законами. Эти отношения имеют как общие черты, так и существенные признаки, характерные только для них и отличающие их от других отношений, так или иначе связанных с применением труда наем­ных работников.","output":"Выжимка из текста для конспекта: 1. **Трудовое право** – это отрасль права, регулирующая отношения и поведение людей в процессе трудовой деятельности. 2. Особенности трудового права: - Регламентирует не сам труд, а взаимоотношения в контексте трудовой деятельности. - Отделяет трудовые отношения от отношений, регулируемых другими отраслями права (напр. гражданским, уголовно-исполнительным, административным правом). 3. Основные положения трудовых отношений: - Основываются на соглашении между работником и работодателем о личном выполнении работы за плату. - Предписывают подчинение работника внутреннему трудовому распорядку и предусматривают обязанности работодателя по созданию условий труда. 4. Три группы отношений в рамках трудового права: - **Предшествующие трудовым**: связаны с трудоустройством и подготовкой кадров до подписания трудового договора. - **Сопутствующие трудовым**: возникают после заключения трудового договора, включают организацию труда, социальное партнерство, надзор и контроль за соблюдением законодательства, профессиональное обучение и страхование. - **Последующие трудовым**: обычно связаны с рассмотрением трудовых споров, как во время, так и до или после трудовой деятельности. 5. Предмет трудового права включает: - Трудовые отношения. - Отношения по организации труда, трудоустройству, обучению, социальному партнерству, участию в установлении условий труда, материальной ответственности, контролю за соблюдением законодательства, рассмотрению трудовых споров и обязательному социальному страхованию. 6. Отличия трудовых отношений: - Имеют характерные признаки, отличающие их от других видов отношений, связанных с трудом наемных работников.

Найдите отношение площадей ромба и параллелограмма, если отношение диагоналей параллелограмма равно 15","output":"Для решения этой задачи вспомним свойства параллелограммов и ромбов. Пусть диагонали параллелограмма равны d_1 и d_2, при этом d_1 = 15 * d_2, где d_1 - большая диагональ. Опустим из вершин ромба перпендикуляры на стороны параллелограмма. Так как стороны ромба параллельны диагоналям параллелограмма, эти перпендикуляры, опущенные к противоположным сторонам параллелограмма, равны и образуют две пары одинаковых треугольников внутри параллелограмма (они будут прямоугольные треугольники). Получается, что с каждой стороны ромб \\"отрезает\\" по треугольнику от параллелограмма. Рассмотрим одну из диагоналей ромба. Она будет равна d_2, так как параллельна и равна меньшей диагонали параллелограмма. Другая диагональ ромба будет равна части большей диагонали параллелограмма. Обозначим эту часть как x, тогда весь большой отрезок будет равен (15 * d_2 - x). Площадь параллелограмма равна произведению его диагоналей, умноженному на синус угла между ними, который в данном случае является также углом между диагоналями ромба (так как они параллельны): S_parallelogram = 0.5 * d_1 * d_2 * sin(α) = 0.5 * 15 * d_2^2 * sin(α) Площадь ромба тоже равна половине произведения его диагоналей: S_rhomb = 0.5 * d_2 * (15 * d_2 - x) * sin(α) Теперь найдем отношение площадей ромба и параллелограмма: S_rhomb / S_parallelogram = [0.5 * d_2 * (15 * d_2 - x) * sin(α)] / [0.5 * 15 * d_2^2 * sin(α)] = (d_2 * (15 * d_2 - x)) / (15 * d_2^2) = (15 * d_2 - x) / (15 * d_2) Мы знаем, что d_2 - это половина меньшей диагонали параллелограмма, и она равна половине диагонали ромба. Однако, нам нужно понять значение x. Если ромб касается всех сторон параллелограмма, это означает, что x равно d_2 (так как другая сторона ромба также будет касаться большей диагонали параллелограмма и отсекать равную меньшей диагонали часть). Таким образом, вторая диагональ ромба будет равна разности большей и меньшей диагоналей параллелограмма (15d_2 - d_2 = 14d_2). Теперь можем подставить x = d_2: S_rhomb / S_parallelogram = (15 * d_2 - d_2) / (15 * d_2) = 14 * d_2 / (15 * d_2) = 14 / 15 Итак, отношение площадей ромба и параллелограмма равно 14/15."},{"instruction":"Теория: «Пегас Туристик» является одним из крупнейших туроператоров на территории Росси и стран СНГ.

[15] В настоящее время туризм превратился в массовое социально - экономическое явление международного масштаба. Это явление имеет много граней и ни одна из существующих ныне наук не может полностью охарактеризовать его как объект собственных исследований. С экономической точки зрения туризм - это особый вид потребления туристами материальных благ, услуг и товаров, который выделяется в отдельную отрасль хозяйства. Она обеспечивает туристов всем необходимым: транспортными средствами, объектами размещения, питания, культурно - бытовыми услугами, развлечениями. Для многих стран туризм стал весомой статьей государственных доходов и входит в число наиболее перспективных отраслей национальной экономики. В сфере туризма занято свыше 250 млн. человек. На его долю приходится около трети мировой торговли услугами, 7,9 % мировых доходов от экспорта, 11 % мировых потребительских расходов, 7 % общего объема инвестиций, 5 % всех налоговых поступлений. Туризм оказывает огромное влияние на развитие транспорта, строительства, связи, торговли, сельского хозяйства, производство товаров народного потребления, выступая катализатором социально - экономического развития. Туризм также представляет собой форму международного сотрудничества, оказывает влияние на сохранение и развитие культурного потенциала, ведет к гармонизации отношений между различными странами и народами, заставляет правительства, общественные организации и коммерческие структуры активно участвовать в деле сохранения и оздоровления окружающей среды. В последние годы наблюдается тенденция улучшения развития туризма в России: - увеличивается поток желающих посетить не только зарубежные страны, но и достопримечательные отечественные места; - улучшается качество обслуживания; - развивается детский туризм (предлагаются всевозможные детские поездки на морские курорты, в различные лагеря и зарубежные страны с познавательной целью и т.д.); - разрабатываются новые маршруты туров. Современное развитие туризма в России характеризуется наличием глубоких противоречий в его организационной структуре, в направленности развития, в состоянии качественных и количественных характеристик. Туризм, как и любая сфера обслуживания, стремится разработать и предложить инновации в соответствии с новыми тенденциями в спросе на продукт. Организационные формы и виды туризма стремительно меняются вместе с бурным развитием технологий, возможностей и разнообразием потребностей путешественников. Так, в последнее время на туристском рынке получили развитие такие виды туризма, как образовательный, культурный, событийный, сельский, музейный, экотуризм и т. д. Турция способна предложить огромный выбор видов туризма: пляжный, экскурсионный, зимний отдых, экотуризм. В недавнем времени стал развиваться такой вид альтернативного отдыха как: · экстремальный (в скором времени недалеко от города Афьбон будет построен крупнейший в Европе комплекс термальных отелей. Первый этап строительства проекта, в рамках которого будут построены 2 пятизвездочных отеля и апарт - комплексы в общей сложности на 2000 мест, будет завершен в 2012 году. Вслед за отелем в Афьоном, термальные отели Alila появятся в Стамбуле, на Средиземном побережье и в Саудовской Аравии); культурный (Регион Караманмараш, предлагает исторические места, термальные источники и традиционные изделия народного промысла); · конгресс - туризм (построение залов и помещений для переговоров, организация официальных приемов и встреч). Деятельность многих туристских компаний по своему характеру стала интернациональной и опирается на материальную базу (гостиницы, предприятия питания, культурно-развлекательные учреждения) в различных странах и регионах. Туроператор «Пегас Туристик» имеет массу преимуществ перед конкурирующими фирмами: предложение довольно большого количества туристских направлений, комфортная доставка до места отдыха, внимание к своим клиентам, установления взаимосвязи между предложенной услугой и реальными потребностями потребителя, превосходное качество обслуживания, обеспечивающее повышенные объемы продаж и высокие показатели прибыли. Ключевой особенностью является предоставление потребителям услуг, качество которых превышает ожидание клиента.

Ông có tư tưởng ủng hộ phong trào công nhân và sự phát triển của chủ nghĩa xã hội nói chung, và điều này có thể được chứng minh qua các tác phẩm và ý kiến ​​của ông. 1. Trong tác phẩm \\"Các nguyên tắc của kinh tế chính trị\\" (1848), Mill đã giới thiệu khái niệm về \\"tổ chức hợp tác\\" (cooperative organization), trong đó công nhân sẽ cùng nhau sở hữu và quản lý các phương tiện sản xuất. Ông cho rằng, tổ chức hợp tác có thể giải quyết các vấn đề xã hội và kinh tế, và làm tăng quyền tự chủ của công nhân. 2. Mill cũng ủng hộ việc tăng cường quyền lợi của công nhân thông qua các biện pháp pháp lý và chính sách xã hội. Ông được ghi nhận với việc nguyên tắc \\"người hưởng lợi trực tiếp\\" (principle of direct benefit), trong đó công nhân được khuyến khích tham gia vào các hoạt động công cộng và chính trị để đảm bảo quyền lợi của họ được đảm bảo. 3. Mill cũng đã lên án các tình trạng bất công xã hội và kỷ luật công nhân. Ông cho rằng công nhân không nên phải chịu sự kiểm soát từ các chủ sở hữu tư nhân mà cần được đảm bảo quyền tự do và công bằng trong quyền sở hữu và lao động. 4. Trong tác phẩm \\"Tự do\\" (1859), Mill đã bào chữa quyền tự do cá nhân và cho rằng xã hội nên tôn trọng quyền tự quyết và sự khác biệt cá nhân. Ông cho rằng phát triển chủ nghĩa xã hội đòi hỏi các quyền tự do cơ bản được đảm bảo và xã hội phải tạo ra một môi trường cho mỗi cá nhân phát triển toàn diện. Từ những điểm trên, chúng ta có thể thấy rằng John Stuart Mill có tư tưởng ủng hộ phong trào công nhân và sự phát triển của chủ nghĩa xã hội.

Discuss, with examples, how organizational design models like the Star Model of J. R. Galbraith can meet the strategic needs of corporations.","output":"The Star Model of J.R. Galbraith is a widely recognized organizational design model that helps align organizational structure with corporate strategies. It emphasizes the interdependence of various elements within an organization and provides a framework for making design choices to meet strategic needs. Let's discuss how the Star Model can enable corporations to implement their strategies effectively with the help of examples. 1. Strategy: The first element of the Star Model is a strategy, which provides direction and sets goals for the organization. By understanding the strategic objectives, the organizational structure can be designed to support the chosen strategy. For example, if a company's strategy is to be an innovative leader in the market, it may require a flat, decentralized structure that empowers employees to make quick decisions and fosters an entrepreneurial culture. 2. Structure: The organizational structure determines how work is divided, coordinated, and controlled within an organization. The choice of structure should align with the strategic objectives. For instance, a multinational company with a strategy to expand globally may adopt a divisional structure, where divisions are organized geographically to manage operations effectively in different regions. 3. Processes: Processes are the flow of work that transforms inputs into outputs. The Star Model suggests that processes need to be aligned with the chosen strategy. For example, if a company's strategy is to deliver highly customized products, it needs agile and flexible processes that can handle frequent changes and customization requests from customers. 4. Rewards: The reward system motivates and reinforces desired behaviors and outcomes within an organization. It should be designed to support the strategy and encourage employees to contribute to its success. For instance, if a company's strategy is to be cost-focused, it may implement a performance-based reward system that rewards employees for cost-saving initiatives or efficiency improvements. 5. People: People are the employees of an organization and play a vital role in executing the strategy. The Star Model suggests that the right people should be in the right roles to support the strategic objectives. For example, if a company wants to enhance its digital capabilities as part of its strategy, it may hire employees with relevant skills or provide training to existing employees to develop digital expertise. By utilizing the Star Model, organizations can align their structure, processes, rewards, and people with their strategic needs. This alignment ensures that the implementation of corporate strategies is supported by an appropriate organizational design. It helps create a coherent and cohesive system where all elements work together to achieve the desired outcomes. Overall, the Star Model provides a holistic approach to organizational design and enables corporations to effectively execute their strategies by aligning various elements of the organization. It ensures that the structure, processes, rewards, and people are designed to support the strategic direction, ultimately enhancing the organization's chances of success."},{"instruction":"(In a school on a floating island, years after the still on-going peace treaty between the Alliance and the Horde started...)

Историй компании началась в последней четверти ХХ века, а именно компания основана в 1994 году. «Пегас Туристик» создан на основе инвестиций основного владельца - Рамазана Акпынара. Центральный офис расположен в Москве. И их девиз остался неизменным: «Гость - прежде всего». В сеть «Пегас Туристик» входит около 10 000 агентств, 500 из них работают по системе франчайзинга. Компания имеет собственные принимающие офисы в странах: Турция, Египет, Таиланд, Китай и Израиль. Своим успехом компания обязана партнерам, персоналу и конечно же самим отдыхающим. Турфирма «Пегас Туристик» на сегодняшний день является общепризнанным лидером мирового туризма и путешествий. Компания предлагает отдых на лучших курортах и отелях, чье число составляет 2500. Предоставляет туры в самые красивые места 18 стран мира: Турция, Египет, Тунис, Кипр, Италия, Андорра, Израиль, Таиланд, Индонезия, ОАЭ, Таиланд, Греция, Вьетнам, Индия, Хорватия, Испания и многие другие зрелищные и приятные места. Число туристов, использующих услуги данного турагенства с каждым годом возрастает в 2-3 раза, это является неопровержимым подтверждением качества, профессионализма и лояльности её сотрудников.[15] К примеру, желающих отдохнуть в \\"турецком направлении\\" с каждым годом становится на 30-50% больше. В настоящее время компания подобрала все самые популярные у российских туристов гостиницы, различных ценовых категорий, так - же «Пегас Туристик» обеспечил быстрые и надежные авиаперелеты лидерами российских авиакомпаний таких, как «Аэрофлот», «Трансаэро» и «Turkish Airlines». Не смотря на шаткую экономику поддерживает цены способные конкурировать с другими турагенствами. На сегодняшний день в России существует 610 филиалов компании, которые находятся более чем в 209 городах страны, среди них Москва, Санкт-Петербург, Ростов-на-Дону, Тольятти, Сыктывкар, Омск, Самара, Барнаул и другие. Самый первый региональный офис \\"Пегаса\\" был открыт в Киеве в 2004 году.[13] Компания является одним из признанных лидеров в своей сфере, о чем свидетельствует большое количество наград: · Международная премия «Моя Планета» Номинация \\"Мой любимый туристический оператор\\" Москва, 2011; PEGAS Touristik - Лидер рынка «Книга ТОП-листов» за 2010 -2011гг. Журнал «Деловой квартал». Екатеринбург; · ВК \\"Красноярская ярмарка\\" Диплом за многообразие туристических продуктов, представленных на рынке Красноярского края. Красноярск, 2011; · «National Tourism Award 2009-10» Премия Министерства по Туризму Индии в категории: «Лучший иностранный туроператор по Индии»; · Интернет-портал Mail.ru проводит голосование по первой национальной премии «Туристический интернет проект года». Компания получила премии в двух категориях: 1) Лучший сайт туроператора, действующего в России. 2) Открытие года в области электронного туризма.; · Presented by Ministry of Tourism Arab Republic of Egypt; · 17-я Московская Международная выставка Путешествия и туризм Диплом, что компания \\"Пегас Туристик\\" была удостоена высокой оценки Организационного комитета за профессионализм и активную роль в продвижении индустрии туризма в России, Москва, 2010 год; · XIII ежегодная международная премия \\"Лидеры Туриндустрии\\" Диплом \\"За успехи в туроператорской деятельности направление Турция\\". Москва 2009 год «Пегас Туристик» постоянно следит за разнообразием собственных турпродуктов, прокладывает маршруты в новые страны, в различных направлениях. «Пегас Туристик» способен предложить оптимальный турпродукт для абсолютно любой категории людей, в независимости от их социального и семейного положения. Так же данный туроператор может предложить свои услуги в организации групповых, индивидуальных, корпоративных, спортивных и VIP туров. Приобретение или заказ туров может осуществляться непосредственно в офисах «Пегас Туристик» или на сайте компании 7 дней в неделю, 24 часа в сутки в режиме онлайн, что очень удобно для потребителя. Туры так же, могут приобретаться в рассрочку или в кредит. Преимущества туроператора: - широкие возможности в поиске подходящего тура; - рейсы на комфортных лайнерах; - дипломированные экскурсоводы и гиды; современный и выгодный для туристов автопарк на предлагаемых курортах; - безупречная организация поездки и подготовка обслуживания; - комфортное и безопасное проживание в отелях; - гарантированно качественные и оптимальные варианты поездки.[15] В настоящее время туризм превратился в массовое социально - экономическое явление международного масштаба. Это явление имеет много граней и ни одна из существующих ныне наук не может полностью охарактеризовать его как объект собственных исследований. С экономической точки зрения туризм - это особый вид потребления туристами материальных благ, услуг и товаров, который выделяется в отдельную отрасль хозяйства. Она обеспечивает туристов всем необходимым: транспортными средствами, объектами размещения, питания, культурно - бытовыми услугами, развлечениями. Для многих стран туризм стал весомой статьей государственных доходов и входит в число наиболее перспективных отраслей национальной экономики. В сфере туризма занято свыше 250 млн. человек. На его долю приходится около трети мировой торговли услугами, 7,9 % мировых доходов от экспорта, 11 % мировых потребительских расходов, 7 % общего объема инвестиций, 5 % всех налоговых поступлений. Туризм оказывает огромное влияние на развитие транспорта, строительства, связи, торговли, сельского хозяйства, производство товаров народного потребления, выступая катализатором социально - экономического развития. Туризм также представляет собой форму международного сотрудничества, оказывает влияние на сохранение и развитие культурного потенциала, ведет к гармонизации отношений между различными странами и народами, заставляет правительства, общественные организации и коммерческие структуры активно участвовать в деле сохранения и оздоровления окружающей среды. В последние годы наблюдается тенденция улучшения развития туризма в России: - увеличивается поток желающих посетить не только зарубежные страны, но и достопримечательные отечественные места; - улучшается качество обслуживания; - развивается детский туризм (предлагаются всевозможные детские поездки на морские курорты, в различные лагеря и зарубежные страны с познавательной целью и т.д.); - разрабатываются новые маршруты туров. Современное развитие туризма в России характеризуется наличием глубоких противоречий в его организационной структуре, в направленности развития, в состоянии качественных и количественных характеристик. Туризм, как и любая сфера обслуживания, стремится разработать и предложить инновации в соответствии с новыми тенденциями в спросе на продукт. Организационные формы и виды туризма стремительно меняются вместе с бурным развитием технологий, возможностей и разнообразием потребностей путешественников. Так, в последнее время на туристском рынке получили развитие такие виды туризма, как образовательный, культурный, событийный, сельский, музейный, экотуризм и т. д. Турция способна предложить огромный выбор видов туризма: пляжный, экскурсионный, зимний отдых, экотуризм. В недавнем времени стал развиваться такой вид альтернативного отдыха как: · экстремальный (в скором времени недалеко от города Афьбон будет построен крупнейший в Европе комплекс термальных отелей. Первый этап строительства проекта, в рамках которого будут построены 2 пятизвездочных отеля и апарт - комплексы в общей сложности на 2000 мест, будет завершен в 2012 году. Вслед за отелем в Афьоном, термальные отели Alila появятся в Стамбуле, на Средиземном побережье и в Саудовской Аравии); культурный (Регион Караманмараш, предлагает исторические места, термальные источники и традиционные изделия народного промысла); · конгресс - туризм (построение залов и помещений для переговоров, организация официальных приемов и встреч). Деятельность многих туристских компаний по своему характеру стала интернациональной и опирается на материальную базу (гостиницы, предприятия питания, культурно-развлекательные учреждения) в различных странах и регионах. Туроператор «Пегас Туристик» имеет массу преимуществ перед конкурирующими фирмами: предложение довольно большого количества туристских направлений, комфортная доставка до места отдыха, внимание к своим клиентам, установления взаимосвязи между предложенной услугой и реальными потребностями потребителя, превосходное качество обслуживания, обеспечивающее повышенные объемы продаж и высокие показатели прибыли. Ключевой особенностью является предоставление потребителям услуг, качество которых превышает ожидание клиента. Задание: по предоставленной информации а таже собственной базе (пускай и не актуальной) сделать 1) вступление и 2) вывод","output":"**Вступление:** Туристическая индустрия постоянно эволюционирует, приспосабливаясь к меняющимся запросам путешественников и всегда в поиске новых перспективных направлений и путей удовлетворения потребностей клиентов. Единственный неизменный фактор в этой постоянно изменяющейся отрасли – стремление к высокому уровню услуг и клиентоориентированности. В этом контексте, компания \\"Пегас Туристик\\", основанная в 1994 году, зарекомендовала себя как один из ведущих туроператоров на пространстве России и стран СНГ. За годы своего существования, благодаря вложениям основного владельца Рамазана Акпынара, компания выросла до масштабов международной сети с центральным офисом в Москве и обширной сетью агентств, включая систему франчайзинга. Подтверждением ее успеха служат тысячи агентств, охватывающих различные города и регионы, награды за профессионализм в туротрасли, и стремительно растущее число туристов, которые доверяют \\"Пегас Туристик\\" организацию своего отдыха. **Вывод:** Индустрия туризма является значительной составляющей мировой экономики и социокультурного обмена между странами. Рассматриваемая компания \\"Пегас Туристик\\" демонстрирует не только богатый спектр предоставляемых услуг, но и способность адаптироваться к динамично меняющимся условиям рынка и всегда идти навстречу ожиданиям клиентов, что делает её одним из ключевых игроков в туристической отрасли. Благодаря своему стремлению к инновациям, качественному обслуживанию и постоянному расширению маршрутной сети, \\"Пегас Туристик\\" удерживает лидирующие позиции и способствует процветанию туристической отрасли как на внутреннем, так и на международном уровне."},{"instruction":"(x-5) (x^2 +4x +4 ) = 8 (x+2) нужно найти x","output":"Для того, чтобы найти x, нам нужно решить уравнение, распределить скобки и привести уравнение к виду, в котором можно будет найти корни. Давайте постепенно разберём уравнение: (x - 5)(x^2 + 4x + 4) = 8(x + 2) Сначала раскроем скобки в левой части уравнения. Помним, что x^2 + 4x + 4 является полным квадратом (x + 2)^2. x(x^2 + 4x + 4) - 5(x^2 + 4x + 4) = 8(x + 2) Теперь раскроем скобки: x^3 + 4x^2 + 4x - 5x^2 - 20x - 20 = 8x + 16 Объединяем подобные слагаемые: x^3 - x^2 - 16x - 20 = 8x + 16 Переносим все слагаемые в левую часть: x^3 - x^2 - 16x - 20 - 8x - 16 = 0 Объединим подобные слагаемые: x^3 - x^2 - 24x - 36 = 0 Теперь необходимо решить кубическое уравнение x^3 - x^2 - 24x - 36 = 0. Кубические уравнения можно решить аналитически, но это может быть не так просто. Вместо этого мы можем использовать методы нахождения корней, например теорему о рациональных корнях, если они существуют. Теорема о рациональных корнях говорит нам, что если у уравнения есть рациональные корни, то они должны быть делителями свободного члена, в данном случае 36, с разными знаками (+/-). Попробуем подставить некоторые из этих делителей для проверки: Рассмотрим x = 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, ... и т.д. В данном случае, поскольку мы имеем константу с множителем -36, корни могут быть также значениями: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±9, ±12, ±18, ±36. Подставим некоторые из этих значений (так как решение вручную может быть трудоемким, на практике было бы проще использовать калькулятор или программу для нахождения корней). Если не удалось найти рациональных корней таким методом, следующим шагом могло бы быть использование метода Руффини или кардано для решения кубического уравнения или прибегнуть к численным методам (например, использовать поиск корней в программном обеспечении). Для упрощения решения предлагается использование компьютерной алгебры или калькулятора для нахождения корней кубического уравнения."},{"instruction":"давай вручную","output":"Попробуем решить уравнение вручную, используя делители свободного члена. Итак, мы имеем уравнение: x^3 - x^2 - 24x - 36 = 0 По теореме о рациональных корнях делителями свободного члена 36 могут быть ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±9, ±12, ±18, ±36. Мы можем последовательно проверить каждое из этих чисел, подставляя их в уравнение вместо x и посмотреть, обращается ли уравнение в ноль. Прежде чем пробовать все возможные варианты, заметим, что коэффициент -24 перед x предполагает, что один из корней может быть положительным, чтобы уравнение могло обратиться в ноль, так как сумма других слагаемых трудно получить большую положительную величину. Начнем с проверки корней, начиная с наименьшего положительного делителя: x = 1: 1^3 - 1^2 - 24(1) - 36 = 1 - 1 - 24 - 36 = -60 ≠ 0 Продолжаем с x = 2: x = 2: 2^3 - 2^2 - 24(2) - 36 = 8 - 4 - 48 - 36 = -80 ≠ 0 Продолжаем с x = 3: x = 3: 3^3 - 3^2 - 24(3) - 36 = 27 - 9 - 72 - 36 = -90 ≠ 0 Теперь попробуем x = 4: x = 4: 4^3 - 4^2 - 24(4) - 36 = 64 - 16 - 96 - 36 = -84 ≠ 0 Если мы продолжим этот метод и наткнемся на корень уравнения, мы сможем затем упростить уравнение, разделив его на (x - этот корень), и решить получившееся квадратное уравнение. Если корень не обнаруживается среди предложенных делителей, возможно, уравнение имеет иррациональные или комплексные корни. Поскольку перебор может быть очень трудоемким, я предлагаю использовать численные методы или калькулятор онлайн для нахождения корней. Если всё же необходимо продолжить решение вручную, следует перебрать оставшиеся варианты делителей, но этот процесс может быть долгим и иметь большой риск ошибки. Однако давайте попробуем следующий делитель, к примеру, x = -2: x = -2: (-2)^3 - (-2)^2 - 24(-2) - 36 = -8 - 4 + 48 - 36 = 0 Мы нашли корень! x = -2 является корнем уравнения. Теперь мы можем разделить на (x + 2) чтобы упростить уравнение и решить получившееся квадратное уравнение. Поделим исходное уравнение на (x + 2) и найдем оставшиеся корни."},{"instruction":"найди","output":"Для того чтобы найти оставшиеся корни уравнения после того, как мы нашли один корень (x = -2), нам нужно разделить оригинальный многочлен на многочлен (x + 2). Это можно сделать с помощью деления многочленов в столбик, но в данном случае можно заметить, что наш оригинальный многочлен уже содержит фактор (x^2 + 4x + 4), который является квадратом (x + 2): x^3 - x^2 - 24x - 36 = 0 (x - 5)(x^2 + 4x + 4) = 0 (x - 5)((x + 2)(x + 2)) = 0 У нас есть разложение многочлена, где (x + 2) входит как квадрат. У нас уже есть один корень x = -2, который соответствует множителю (x + 2), и теперь мы можем увидеть, что второй множитель (x - 5) дает нам второй корень. Мы можем вывести корни из уравнения: x + 2 = 0 x = -2 x - 5 = 0 x = 5 Теперь мы нашли все корни уравнения. Один корень был найден методом подбора (x = -2), и тот же корень учитывается дважды, так как он кратный (x + 2)^2. Второй корень получен из второго множителя (x - 5), и он равен x = 5. Итак, у уравнения x^3 - x^2 - 24x - 36 = 0 есть следующие корни: x = -2 (кратность 2) и x = 5."},{"instruction":"<!-- 同一客户集中度限额查询优化 --> <select id=\\"listPagecustomConcentration_NEW_YH\\"

?","output":"John Stuart Mill (1806-1873) không phải là một nhà ủng hộ Chủ nghĩa xã hội theo định nghĩa mà Karl Marx đã định hình. Tuy nhiên, ông là một nhà tư tưởng tiến bộ và một nhà cải cách xã hội, người đã bày tỏ những quan điểm có tính chất đồng cảm với nhu cầu và đấu tranh của tầng lớp công nhân, cũng như một số khái niệm liên quan đến Chủ nghĩa xã hội. Dưới đây là một số điểm cần lưu ý khi thảo luận về quan điểm của Mill: 1. Đồng cảm với giai cấp lao động: Trong các tác phẩm của mình, Mill thể hiện sự đồng cảm với người lao động và mối quan tâm đối với điều kiện làm việc của họ. Ông nhận thức được sự mất cân bằng quyền lực giữa người sở hữu và người làm công, và ông ủng hộ nhu cầu của công nhân để cải thiện điều kiện sống và làm việc của họ. 2. Ủng hộ quyền lợi của công nhân: Mill ủng hộ các quy định nhằm bảo vệ người lao động, như giới hạn giờ làm việc và điều kiện an toàn tại nơi làm việc, cũng như quyền tổ chức và đình công của công nhân. 3. Quan tâm tới sự phân phối công bằng của tài sản: Trong \\"Principles of Political Economy\\" (Nguyên lý Kinh tế Chính trị), Mill nêu ra sự bất công trong phân phối tài sản và thu nhập, và đề xuất cần có sự cải thiện trong việc phân phối tài nguyên và cơ hội kinh tế. 4. Khám phá mô hình lao động hợp tác: Mill quan tâm đến mô hình lao động hợp tác, nơi công nhân có quyền sở hữu và quản lý việc sản xuất. Ông coi đây là một hướng đi tích cực, góp phần tạo ra sự ổn định xã hội và công bằng kinh tế. 5. Ảnh hưởng của các tư tưởng Chủ nghĩa xã hội: Mill có sự ảnh hưởng từ các nhà tư tưởng Chủ nghĩa xã hội tiểu tư sản như Charles Fourier và Robert Owen, cũng như các nhà Kinh tế học xã hội như Henry George. Các quan điểm của Mill về các cải cách xã hội phản ánh một số ý tưởng cơ bản của Chủ nghĩa xã hội, dù ông không hoàn toàn chấp nhận tất cả các khái niệm của hệ thống này. Tóm lại, trong khi John Stuart Mill không phải là một nhà Chủ nghĩa xã hội theo định nghĩa thông thường, ông đã bày tỏ những quan điểm ủng hộ sự cải thiện địa vị và điều kiện sống của người lao động, khám phá giải pháp nhằm hướng tới một xã hội công bằng hơn, điều này có thể được xem như là đồng cảm với một số mục tiêu của phong trào công nhân và một phần của ý thức hệ Chủ nghĩa xã hội."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const a=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return a?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(a)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(a)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},q={class:"card-container"},P={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],B={key:0},F={key:1};function R(a,e,h,p,n,s){const m=g("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",q,[(o(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(o(),k(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(o(),i("div",P,' No results found for "'+c(n.searchQuery)+'".
