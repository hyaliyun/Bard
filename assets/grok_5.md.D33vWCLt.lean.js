The film suffers from a weak plot that tries to encompass multiple genres, only to end up lacking a consistent tone.  The ensemble of usually charismatic actors fails to save the sinking ship, as their performances are tragically hampered by the poor script. Instead of establishing emotional connections and dive into meaningful character development, the film forces its characters into mind-numbingly predictable situations. Visually, the movie appears as if it is assembled in a haphazard manner, with noticeably shoddy editing and unremarkable cinematography. The soundtrack does little to help, often feeling mismatched and intrusive.  In conclusion, \\"Dullsville: Lost in Boredom\\" is a film that squanders valuable potential and leaves its viewers feeling robbed of their time.

Don't dye or otherwise process your hair in the weeks leading up to the bleaching. Bleaching your hair will work better and cause less damage if your hair is strong and unprocessed. If your hair is damaged or processed, then you are better off going to a salon. Strengthen your hair in the following ways:  Use a natural shampoo and conditioner. Avoid products containing sulfates, which dry out your hair. Avoid chemical-laden hair sprays, gels, straightening products, and other hair products. Don't apply heat to your hair with a straight iron, blow dryer, or other heating appliance. To bleach your hair with peroxide, you'll need the following materials. Gather them together and set them up on a table in your kitchen or bathroom:  A 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. Any higher than 3% and you risk hair loss when applying. Not fun! A clean, empty spray bottle. You can buy a new one at the drugstore, or use an old one. If you use an old one, wash it out thoroughly. If you're going to store the peroxide, keep it in a dark bottle and away from light. Hair clips. Cotton balls. A towel. Gloves. Aluminum foil, if you plan to do highlights. Shower cap, if you plan to bleach your whole head of hair. On the day you plan to bleach your hair, wash and condition it as normal to make sure the oils and grime caused by natural wear and styling products don't interfere with the peroxide.  Condition well with a good natural conditioner. Bleaching your hair with peroxide can dry it out, and conditioner will protect it during the process. Let your hair air-dry instead of blow drying it. Pat it dry with a towel to keep it from dripping, comb it out gently, and let it dry for about thirty minutes. Hair that is a little wet will take the hydrogen peroxide better.","output":"The article provides a comprehensive guide on how to effectively prepare, strengthen, and bleach hair using a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution while minimizing damage and promoting healthier hair, along with a list of needed materials and precautions in the process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The reviewer acknowledges that there were some moral lessons present in the story and that it provoked some thought and conversation. However, they also mention several criticisms, such as finding the acting and dialogue to be mediocre and feeling overwhelmed by the religious tones of the film. Furthermore, they felt that the religious themes were not necessary for the movie and were heavy-handed. The reviewer even goes as far as advising recovering Christians to avoid the film, as it may make them feel ill.  These negative aspects of the review seem to outweigh the positives, which leads to the conclusion that the sentiment overall is negative.

Today, we are going to talk about something fun and exciting - luxury car deals!  Imagine fancy, shiny cars with soft, comfy seats, and lots of buttons and gadgets inside. These cars are called luxury cars because they are very special and look super cool. People usually enjoy driving these cars because they look nice and drive smoothly. Sometimes, car makers or the people who sell cars have special offers called \\"deals\\". These deals make it easier for people to buy luxury cars. When there is a luxury car deal, it's like a SALE just like you would see on toys or clothes in a store. It means people can buy these fancy cars for a little less money. Now, let me tell you why these luxury car deals are happening. One reason is that there are new car models coming. The car-maker people want to make room for the new models, so they offer deals on the current models to make them more attractive to people. This way, more people will buy the older models, and then there will be space for the new cars. Another reason is the changing of the seasons. When the weather starts to get either colder or warmer, people might want different types of cars. So, the car sellers make deals on the luxury cars to encourage people to buy them during specific times of the year. Now you know what luxury car deals are all about! Remember, these deals happen to make fancy cars a little more affordable for people to buy.

Bio: john mulvihill -lrb- born 1 july 1945 -rrb- is an irish former labour party politician . he was a teachta d√°la -lrb- td -rrb- for cork east from 1992 to 1997 . a plant operator , mulvihill was elected to d√°il √âireann for cork east during the swing to labour at the 1992 general election . like some other labour tds elected in 1992 , he lost his seat at the 1997 general election . his seat was taken by david stanton of fine gael . mulvihill again unsuccessfully contested the 2002 , 2007 and 2011 general elections . he was a local councillor for the midleton local electoral area on cork county council from 1991 to 2014 . his son john mulvihill , jnr was a member of cobh town council and a former mayor of cobh . The answer is:","output":"John Mulvihill is an Irish individual who was notably involved in politics. Born on July 1, 1945, Mulvihill was previously aligned with the Labour Party of Ireland, hence categorizing him as a former Labour Party politician.  One of the key roles Mulvihill held in Irish politics was as a Teachta D√°la (TD) for Cork East. A TD is a member of D√°il √âireann, the lower house of the Oireachtas which is the Irish Parliament. This position signifies that Mulvihill was involved in legislative work and had a role as a representative of the Cork East area. He served in this capacity from 1992 to 1997. Before entering politics, Mulvihill worked as a plant operator. His political career began when he stood and got elected in the general elections of 1992. This period marked a significant swing to the Labour Party and it appears that Mulvihill's election was a part of this wider political shift. However, like some of his Labour peers, he lost his seat in the subsequent general elections held in 1997. His seat was taken over by David Stanton, a member of the Fine Gael Party, a center-right to liberal-conservative political party in Ireland. Despite this loss, Mulvihill attempted and stood in the general elections of 2002, 2007, and 2011, although he was unsuccessful in these attempts. In addition to his TD role, Mulvihill also served as a local councillor within the Midleton Local Electoral Area under the Cork County Council. He dutifully served in this role for a considerable period spanning from 1991 to 2014. Lastly, information can be inferred about his family as well. Mulvihill's son, aptly named John Mulvihill Junior, followed in his father's political footsteps. The younger Mulvihill served as a member of the Cobh Town Council, and at one point held the prestigious title of Mayor of Cobh. This contributes to our understanding of the Mulvihill family's significant involvement in the political landscape of their community and Ireland."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Craig watches TV and sleeps all day while Neil is out working two jobs.","output":"As the sun cracked the horizon, heralding a new day, life went on in the small, bustling town. Somewhere, in a neatly bricked house with a well-manicured lawn, Craig yawned, stretching his arms above his head, sinking deep into the inviting comfort of his recliner. The house still held the remaining hints of the previous night's dinner, and the musty aroma of the fireplace that had been lit to create a warm, cozy ambiance. Instead of clearing the table and washing the dishes left behind, Craig felt the lure of the television taking hold. The large flat screen was mounted on the wall, framed by an arrangement of family photos, mementos, and paintings that brought personality and life to their modest home. Oblivious to the world outside, Craig mindlessly flicked through channels, watching snippets of news, reality shows, and sitcom reruns with equal disinterest. The world outside was distant ‚Äì the chattering of the birds and the low rumbling of morning commuters barely managed to penetrate the fog of disinterest that had settled around the house. Meanwhile, Neil, a man with the weary look of someone wearing far more than just the weight of his years on his shoulders, trudged through his first job at the local supermarket. Packed with patrons eager to get the day over with, the supermarket cacophony punctuated the atmosphere with the clamor of carts, scanners, and ever-present small talk. With deft, well-rehearsed movements, Neil rang up each item in rapid succession and fluently asked the rehearsed question, \\"Would you like assistance with your bags?\\" a smile clinging to his lips despite his growing sense of exhaustion. But as the supermarket's hands edged toward closing time, Neil couldn't afford any respite. Instead, he traded his uniform to become a dishwasher at a popular restaurant, a place known for its hearty portions and good vibes. In contrast to the monotony at the supermarket, the kitchen was a battleground of pots, pans, and dishes piling high with endless expectations. Neil scrubbed and scoured diligently, cleaning away the remnants of forgotten meals, his hands pruned and aching from their hours-long sojourn in hot soapy water. But no matter how tired or worn his body and soul felt, the thought of their shared home was what spurred him on. Back at the house, the sun had begun to dip low, casting warm, golden light through the windows. Craig, still ensconced in his recliner, awoke with a start, his nap-induced stupor only temporarily alleviated. Outside, children played and laughed, their parents casting watchful eyes over their raucous games. As the day slid toward evening, Craig couldn't help but think about their life together and the yawning divide that had grown between himself and Neil, the thick veil of apathy that loomed larger than ever. Though they once had shared their dreams and hopes for the future, the divide between those dreams and their reality had grown increasingly insurmountable. That evening, when Neil's weary footsteps finally echoed in the hallway and he entered the house with the weight of the world sagging his shoulders, he was met with a sight he hadn't dared to expect. Craig had washed the dishes, the counters now gleamed with a renewed sense of cleanliness and purpose, and dinner was being reheated on the stove. A feeble smile tugged at Craig's heartstrings as Neil's face shed the exhaustion of the day, replaced by surprise and, perhaps, a renewed hope. In that moment, without a word between them, they understood that change wouldn't come all at once. Though classed as unremarkable moments, the small steps they had taken that day had come to be an incandescent flicker of hope, a promise that the path ahead could be brighter. As Neil sat down to eat and Craig eased into his role as his partner's support system, they knew that this was the first step in reigniting their dreams and walking toward a shared destiny."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: Two old buddies are sent to Japan to get back results of a genetic research containing videotape, which is stolen by the black suited ninjas at the beginning of the movie. First they just have to learn some ninja skill, because \\"only ninja can beat the ninja.\\" Sakura killers tries hard to be enjoyable ninja-flick but fails that badly. The whole movie is just so hollow and predictable that is hard to say anything good about it: Same plot has been seen in different variations dozens of times before, characters are too briefly drawn, direction is dull and script doesn't offer anything surprising, even in the ending scene, which by itself reduced movie's (trash)value. Even 80's ninja-flick-fan, who understands the esthetic of trash-movies, is hard to find this movie even barely enjoyable. It simply doesn't offer anything new to viewer, neither in visual level nor in plot. Shurikens are thrown and katanas are swinging, but it's not enough to lead the movie direction it meant to be and recurred similar fighting scenes numbs even the most calloused viewer after the first 30 minutes.

The series originated with A Wrinkle in Time, written in 1959 to 1960 and turned down by 26 publishers before Farrar, Straus & Giroux finally published it in 1962. A Wrinkle in Time won the Newbery Medal and has sold over 6 million copies. The sequel, A Wind in the Door, takes place the following year but was published over a decade later, in 1973. A Swiftly Tilting Planet, set ten years after A Wrinkle in Time, followed in 1978. The fourth title of the quintet, Many Waters, was published in 1986, but takes place several years before A Swiftly Tilting Planet. This is readily apparent from the fact that Sandy and Dennys Murry are in high school as of Many Waters, but refer to their college studies at the time of A Swiftly Tilting Planet; and from Meg's unmarried status as of Many Waters.

Background: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3‚àí) and phosphates (PO4‚àí) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

In The Archers, which river flows through Ambridge?","output":"The river that flows through Ambridge in the long-running British radio drama series, The Archers, is called the River Am. The Archers, first broadcasted in 1951, is set in the fictional village of Ambridge located in the equally fictional county of Borsetshire, which is said to be situated in the English Midlands. The River Am is a vital geographical feature within the show, playing an essential role in the village's agricultural and local community life. Several water-related activities such as fishing, boating, and riverside walks are referenced in the series, highlighting the Am's significance to Ambridge and its inhabitants. Furthermore, the river serves as a location for various storylines and character development, often witnessing crucial plot points and scenes. In addition to the River Am, Ambridge features other quintessential English countryside elements, such as farms, independent shops, a church, a village hall, a pub, and several local businesses. These contribute to the vibrant rural setting of the show, contextualizing the everyday lives of The Archers' characters. The Archers is a significant cultural and social fixture in British radio history, touching upon various themes such as agriculture, village politics, family dynamics, and contemporary social issues. The show has managed to maintain its relevance in current times by adapting to societal changes while staying true to its original premise.

To my relief, my new compatriots quickly confirmed that I had acted appropriately in the arena of refreshments, then Dan took one look at my vintage World War 2 backpack and told me the exact Allied campaign in which it had been utilized, as well as the year the Swiss switched over from canvas to leather shoulder straps. A crush began to blossom in the springtime of my heart. He said, ‚ÄúC‚Äômon. You guys are gonna love this place.‚Äù We hiked, rather arduously, albeit enjoyably, up a rocky, switchback trail for about an hour, to arrive, astonished, at an altitudinous landscape, the likes of which I had only previously seen in an Ansel Adams calendar. The ‚Äúswimming hole‚Äù was but one perfect basin in a series of boulder-strewn pools that had been created over the millennia by a small creek burbling ever deeper into the granite hill. One deep, round hole, complete with cascading waterfall, allowed for a 20-foot cliff-dive into its emerald water. Having spent most of my life in the relatively flatter environs of the Midwest, this magical setting Dan had gifted upon us fairly beggared my imagination. It seemed much more suited to a scene in which Bilbo Baggins might be found engaged in a chin-wag about finger-jewelry with a thin, lisping, somewhat amphibious chap, than one in which seven men in their 30‚Äôs lay about sipping cold cervezas. However other-worldly it might have seemed, we were not in a fantasy. We were simply in the place where Dan had taken us. Soon thereafter, Dan visited my woodshop, pointing out all the right materials and jigs, and we giggled like cub scouts over a myriad of jack planes, spokeshaves, bandsaws, and especially my 1943 Delta drill press, the clear ‚Äúhottie‚Äù amongst my arsenal of machines. Curves for days. We had a drawn-out discussion about floor sweeping techniques. No shit. Once again, he knew more about my tools and their inner workings than I could ever hope to learn, for you see, this man is lovingly obsessed with all of the implements mankind has created, using nothing but ingenuity and elbow-grease. He is fully enraptured, and luckily for us, he has a penchant to make us see what he sees as well. Dan Winters is in love with a telephone pole! It sounds silly until you see the picture he has taken of it. Then you say, ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶Jesus. Wow.‚Äù A suspension bridge, a firearm, a salad fork or an engine will possess him until he has taken it into the embrace of his lens and spun it about the dance floor for all of us to countenance, until we have perceived the message and realized the poignant beauty that caused him to pick up his camera in the first place. The many-colored layers of his talent and his fascination do not stop at leather saddles, hand tools and carburetors. Dan‚Äôs portraits of human beings, from anonymous citizens to luminaries, are deceptively simple renderings of personality and nuance. They are pregnant with pathos. I‚Äôve never seen photos of celebrities that made them seem like such, well, human beings. He suggests that the viewer really think about the person depicted, in a different way than we‚Äôve been taught by modern fashion. His haunting plates of honey bees are shot with the efficient scrutiny of the entomologist combined with a surrealist‚Äôs elan. The works on paper are laced with specific meaning and emotional truth, in turns beautiful, humorous, and chilling. He takes on sumi-e black ink painting and writes an entire poem with three strokes of his brush. The longer I‚Äôve known Dan Winters, the more I am astonished at the breadth of his ability to convey relevant and powerful emotions with his images. I‚Äôve seen Dan break into a sweat simply from the enthusiasm he feels for a conversational topic. Our world, and the people living in it, excite him. He will not be contained. When he‚Äôs shooting, Dan begins to behave like a hound who has caught wind of a coon. His pulse quickens and his eyes are never still, evaluating the light, the composition, the subject, until he locks in through the lens and then his eye never wavers. He makes photographs in the same spirit with which he‚Äôll drive you to Lockhart, Texas in his cherry 1964 Chevy pickup, give you a tour of the three greatest barbecue joints in the world, then actually show you how to eat the barbecue. ‚ÄúTake a bite of brisket. Amazing, right? Now take a little bite of the jalapeno. Right?‚Äù Right, indeed. Dan Winters is a genius at tasting life who loves to share his gifts with the people, and that makes you and I a couple of lucky bastards. 1,000 words. Insufficient.

In 1642 a Cambodian Prince named Ponhea Chan became King Ramathipothei  after overthrowing and assassinating the previous King. Malay Muslim merchants in Cambodia helped him in his takeover, and he subsequently converted to Islam from Buddhism, changed his name to Ibrahim, and married a Malay woman. He then started a war to drive out the Dutch East India Company, by first starting a massacre in the capital of the Dutch, commandeering two of their ships, and killing 35 Dutch employees of the Company in addition to the Company's ambassador. On the Mekong River, the Cambodians defeated the Dutch East India Company in a mostly naval war from 1643-44 with the Cambodian forces suffering 1,000 dead, and the Dutch forces suffering 156 dead out of 432 soldiers and multiple Dutch warships fell into Cambodian hands. The Dutch East India Company ambassador who was killed along with his men was Pierre de Rogemortes, and it was not until two centuries later that European influence in Cambodia could recover from the defeat inflicted on the Dutch. This Muslim Cambodian King was ousted and arrested by the Vietnamese Nguyen lords after Ibrahim's brothers, who remained Buddhists, requested Vietnamese help to restore Buddhism to Cambodia by removing him from the throne.

The story is set in Rome the early 4th century AD, during the time of the persecution of Christians under the Roman Emperor Diocletian. The heroine of the book is Fabiola, a young beauty from a noble Roman family. She is spoiled by her father Fabius, who cannot deny her anything. Fabiola seems to have everything, including a superior education in the philosophers, yet under the surface, she is not content with her life. One day, in a fit of rage, she attacks and wounds her slave girl Syra, who is a secret Christian. The proud, spoiled Roman girl is humbled by Syra's humility, maturity and devotion to her in this situation, and a slow transformation begins, which finally culminates in her conversion to Christianity, brought on by Syra and of her own cousin Agnes, whom she adores and dotes on. Another thread of the story deals with the young boy Pancratius, a pious Christian and son of a martyr, who is himself preparing for martyrdom. Pancratius' nemesis is Corvinus, a bullying schoolmate who is irritated by the young Christian's saintliness. He does everything to bring him and the Christian community of the catacombs of Rome down. This includes the orchestrating of the lynching of their former teacher Cassianus, who is secretly Christian. Yet Pancratius shows his enemy the meaning of Christian forgiveness when he saves his life shortly after Corvinus had Cassianus killed. Another major villain in the story is the enigmatic Fulvius, an apparently rich young man from the East who soon reveals himself to be a hunter of Christians who turns them in to the authorities for money. His aim on the one hand is to gain the hand of either Fabiola or Agnes, and on the other hand, to uproot the Christian community in Rome.

All the traders knew this wouldn't be a typical sleepy August Monday.      Minutes after the opening bell, the Dow fell a staggering 1089 points, its biggest ever points drop. One floor trader complained his shirt was soaked with sweat after the early plunge in stocks.      Another, Stephen Guilfoyle from Deep Value, told me the US markets were 'bordering on the edge of panic but not quite there yet.' He can remember the crash of 1987 and said this didn't feel as bad.      Indeed by late morning, US markets were showing some resilience, leading Mark Otto of J Streicher to conclude that Monday's big market moves in the US were similar to the 'flash crash' of 2010, when billions of dollars were wiped off some of the world's biggest companies in a matter of minutes, only to recover almost as quickly.

Currencies and commodities are also falling sharply, because those markets rely heavily on strong demand from China.      Without strong reassurances from officials in China, investors have not had much reason to buy.      Analysis: Karishma Vaswani, Asia business correspondent      Beijing's official mouthpiece has called it China's \\"Black Monday\\".      The Shanghai Composite tumbled by 8.5%, its biggest fall since 2007. That plunge wiped out this year's gains as investors refused to buy into the Chinese government's repeated attempts to shore up confidence.      Everyone wants to know what the Chinese government is going to do next to shore up shares and confidence in the economy.      The smart money is on the central bank reducing interest rates and injecting a semblance of consumer confidence into the markets.      That is what many had hoped would happen over the weekend.      But at each point in what appears to be an ever-deepening Chinese slowdown, the government has seemed slow to react.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption India did not escape the global sell-off with the main index falling nearly 6%      Beijing's latest intervention, to allow its main state pension fund to invest in the stock market, failed to calm traders' fears, both in China and abroad.      Over the past week, the Shanghai index fell 12%, adding up to a 30% drop since the middle of June.      The sharp fall sparked a global sell-off, with the Dow Jones in the US losing 6%, while the FTSE 100 posted its biggest weekly loss this year, of 5%.      Earlier this month, the Chinese central bank devalued the yuan in an attempt to boost exports.      European investors worry that a cheaper Chinese currency will make European exports less competitive.      In other developments: ||||| NEW YORK A near-9 percent dive in China shares sent world stocks and commodity prices tumbling on Monday, and U.S. stocks ended a volatile day with the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq composite indexes sliding into correction territory.      After dropping more than 1,000 points, or almost 7 percent, at Wall Street's open, the Dow Jones industrial average cut its losses but still finished down 3.6 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 index closed down 3.9 percent for the day and was 11 percent lower than its May record high.      The benchmark S&P; index has accumulated 9.95 percent of losses in just five sessions.      A key measure of U.S. equity volatility, the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, shot above the 50 mark for the first time since 2009, dropped back near 30 and then rose to 40.      Some U.S. investors went bargain hunting after the dip, causing at least some of the accelerated selling toward the day's end, according to Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.      \\"It's a very risky proposition to take things home overnight in this kind of a market. If you got a profit that quick, it's often safer to take a small profit than run the risk,\\" said Frederick, \\"If things don't settle down in China we could have another ugly open tomorrow.\\"      Hong Kong's Hang Seng index futures were down 2 percent and Nikkei futures were down 6 percent, suggesting there may be more losses in store when trading resumes in Asia on Tuesday.      European stocks closed off 5.4 percent after Asian shares slumped to three-year lows when a three-month-long rout in Chinese equities threatened to get out of hand.      U.S. markets had some reprieve after Europe closed but then pushed back down toward early lows in late afternoon.      The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 588.40 points, or 3.57 percent, at 15,871.35. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 77.68 points, or 3.94 percent, at 1,893.21. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 179.79 points, or 3.82 percent, at 4,526.25.      U.S. traders had rushed for the exits in Monday's first half-hour of trading when deepening concerns about a China-led global economic slowdown and tumbling commodities prices followed a 5 percent decline in the S&P; and Dow on Thursday and Friday.      \\"Anybody with a pulse was nervous when the market opened,\\" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.      Monday's trading volume exceeded 14 billion shares, double the 7 billion daily average for the month to date, calculated by BATS Global Markets. In comparison, about 10.6 billion shares changed hands in Friday's selloff.      Oil prices settled sharply down after plunging to six-and-a-half year lows. Safe-haven U.S. government and German bonds, as well as the yen and the euro, rallied as currency concerns kicked in due to China's recent currency devaluation.      U.S. crude settled down 5.5 percent at 38.24 a barrel after falling as low as 37.75 earlier. Brent settled off 6 percent at 42.69 after falling as low as 42.51, taking both under January's lows for the first time. Worries about weaker demand from normally resource-hungry China added to global supply glut concerns.      The S&P;'s energy sector was the weakest performer, with a 5.2 percent decline for the day.      Copper, seen as a barometer of global industrial demand, hit a six-year low, and nickel fell sharply.      GREAT FALL OF CHINA      The slump in Chinese stocks was their worst performance since the depths of the global financial crisis in 2007 and wiped out what was left of 2015's gains, which in June stood at more than 50 percent.      Many traders had hoped Beijing would take support measures, such as an interest rate cut, over the weekend after China's main stock markets slumped 11 percent last week.      With serious doubts emerging about the likelihood of a U.S. interest rate rise this year, the dollar was down 1.6 percent against other major currencies after falling as much as 2.5 percent earlier in the day.      The Australian dollar fell to more than six-year lows and many emerging market currencies also plunged, while the frantic dash to safety pushed the euro to a seven-and-a-half month high of more than 1.17.      MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 5.4 percent to a more than three-year low. Tokyo's Nikkei ended down 4.6 percent and Australian and Indonesian shares hit two-year troughs.      London's FTSE 100, with its large number of global miners and oil firms, ended down 4.7 percent for its 10th straight decline - its worst run since 2003.      The MSCI all world stock index was off 3.8 percent at the end of the U.S. session.

Stocks tumbled across Asia on Monday as investors shaken by the sell-off last week on Wall Street unloaded... (Associated Press)      The decline threatened to weigh anew on global markets after last week's Chinese losses triggered a worldwide selloff.      The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 8.5 percent to close at 3,209.91 points, its biggest one-day loss since an 8.8 percent decline on Feb. 27, 2007. The index is down 38 percent from its June 12 peak and just under 1 percent below its closing on Dec. 31, last year's final trading day.      The slump has inflicted heavy losses on small investors, souring many on stock ownership and threatening to disrupt Communist Party plans to use the market to raise money for reforms of state industry.      \\"It feels like the end of the world,\\" said Pan Chong, a social media specialist. He said he invested 50,000 yuan (7,900) in April, made 40 percent and then saw the market wipe out those gains.      \\"The so-called correction will finally become a long-term bear market,\\" said Pan, 25. \\"So I'm considering selling all my shares as soon as possible.\\"      The Chinese benchmark soared more than 150 percent starting in late 2014 after state media said shares were inexpensive, which led investors to believe Beijing would shore up prices if needed. Urged on by state media, millions of novice investors rushed into the market.      Prices faltered and then plunged after an unrelated change in banking regulations in June led investors to question whether Beijing's support might be weakening. The market index fell 30 percent, prompting Beijing to intervene by barring big shareholders from selling and promising state-owned brokerages and pension funds would buy.      Beijing's initiatives helped to calm markets. But after the state-owned company charged with buying shares to prop up prices announced it would not intervene every day, the Shanghai index fell 11.5 percent last week.      The declines come at a time when exports, manufacturing and other Chinese industries are weakening, leaving little economic foundation for higher share prices.      The latest fall probably was triggered by poor performance at publicly traded companies, said Guo Tianyong, a professor at the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing.      The government reported last week that profits at state-owned companies contracted by 2.3 percent in July from a year ago, compared with a 0.1 percent contraction through June.      \\"We shouldn't doubt the government's ability to rescue the market. If they want, they could push up the stock index to 5,000, but it is not necessary for the government to play an excessive role,\\" said Guo. \\"It still would be better for the market itself to play its role.\\"      Beijing's surprise Aug. 11 devaluation of its yuan added to investor jitters. They worry the change will lead to money flowing out of China, reducing credit available for trading. The central bank has responded by pumping extra money into credit markets.      The ruling party wants to use the markets to raise money for state companies to reduce debt loads and modernize. The party also wants to encourage stock ownership as a way for families to save for retirement, reducing demand for social spending. But small investors whose holdings have plunged in value say they will no longer buy shares.      Lu Zhen, 29, an employee at a financial firm, said the value of his shares rose by 250,000 yuan (40,000) over the first half of the year. But he said since the June downturn, he has lost that and an additional 150,000 yuan (24,000).      \\"This is definitely the end of a bull market,\\" Lu said.      ___      AP researchers Dong Tongjian and Yu Bing contributed to this report. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"This text describes a significant drop in global stock markets in response to fears of a Chinese economic slowdown.

The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, 1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.During the 1930s, parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practice. This period was known as the Dust Bowl, throughout which areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall, strong winds, and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl. Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.In 1995, Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P.

Given the question \\"What will happen to Jordan?\\", is \\"call his girlfriend to tell her he loves her\\" a valid answer? A:","output":"To determine if \\"call his girlfriend to tell her he loves her\\" is a valid answer to the question \\"What will happen to Jordan?\\", let's break down the steps and reasoning. Step 1: Understand the given situation Kai heard rumors that Jordan's girlfriend is planning a break up. Step 2: Consider Kai's action Kai wants to give Jordan a heads up about the potential break up. Step 3: Analyze the question asked The question is \\"What will happen to Jordan?\\", which is asking for a potential outcome of the situation for Jordan. Step 4: Evaluate the given answer \\"Call his girlfriend to tell her he loves her\\" is an action that Jordan might take upon learning about the rumor. Step 5: Determine if the answer is valid While calling his girlfriend may be an action Jordan might take in this situation, it doesn't directly answer what will happen to him. The question seems to be focused on the outcome for Jordan (e.g., will he feel sad? will he try to do something to prevent the break up?) rather than on what actions he might take.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Timmons was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of a minister. He had a sister, Eleanor. Both of his parents, and several aunts and uncles, played the piano. From an early age Timmons studied music with an uncle, Robert Habershaw, who also taught McCoy Tyner. Timmons moved to New York in 1954. He played with Kenny Dorham in 1956, making his recording debut with the trumpeter in a live set in May of that year. He went on to play and record with Chet Baker in 1956-57 (bassist Scott LaFaro was part of this band for a time), Sonny Stitt in 1957, and Maynard Ferguson in 1957-58. He also recorded as a sideman with hornmen Curtis Fuller, Hank Mobley, and Lee Morgan, all for Blue Note Records in 1957.  Timmons became best known as a member of Art Blakey's band the Jazz Messengers, which he was first part of from July 1958 to September 1959, including for a tour of Europe. He was recruited for the Messengers by saxophonist Benny Golson, who said that \\"He was inventive, [...] He could play bebop and he could play funky - he could play a lot of things, and I thought it was the element that Art needed. He hadn't had anybody quite like Bobby, who could go here or go there, rather than walking in a single corridor.\\" By late 1958 Timmons was sharing bandmate Morgan's East Sixth Street apartment and the pair had bought a piano, allowing Timmons to practice and Morgan to work on composing. From around the time he joined Blakey, Timmons, along with some of his fellow band members, was a heroin user. After leaving Blakey, Timmons joined Cannonball Adderley's band, in October 1959.  Timmons was also known as a composer during this period: The Encyclopedia of Jazz states that his compositions \\"Moanin'\\" (from the 1958 album of the same title), \\"This Here\\", and \\"Dat Dere\\" \\"helped generate the gospel-tinged 'soul jazz' style of [the] late '50s and early '60s.\\" The first was written when Timmons was first with Blakey; the others were composed when he was with Adderley. \\"This Here\\" (sometimes \\"Dis Here\\") was a surprise commercial success for Adderley: recorded in concert in 1959, it was released as part of The Cannonball Adderley Quintet in San Francisco album while the band was still on tour, and they discovered its popularity only when they arrived back in New York and found crowds outside the Village Gate, where they were due to play.  Timmons was reported to be dissatisfied with the money he had received from \\"This Here\\", and was enticed in February 1960 into leaving Adderley and returning to Blakey's band by the offer of more pay. Timmons then appeared on further well-known albums with the drummer, including A Night in Tunisia, The Freedom Rider and The Witch Doctor. His own recording debut as sole leader was This Here Is Bobby Timmons in 1960, which contained his first versions of his best-known compositions. In the same year, he played on recordings led by Nat Adderley, Arnett Cobb, and Johnny Griffin, among others; on the first of these, Work Song, Timmons did not appear on all of the tracks, because he had been drinking heavily. Did he record any albums at that time?","output":"Yes, Timmons recorded several albums during that time.

Given those answer options, answer the question: If I tell you that Powering an electrical device with a battery requires electron flow, and ask you the question \\"electron flow allows a battery to do what?\\", is the correct answer \\"power an electrical device\\"? A:","output":"Yes, the correct answer is \\"power an electrical device.\\" When you state that \\"Powering an electrical device with a battery requires electron flow,\\" you are implying that electrons are fundamental to the operation of a battery. Thus, when you ask the question \\"electron flow allows a battery to do what?\\" it logically follows that the answer would be \\"power an electrical device.\\" To provide a more detailed explanation, it is important to understand how batteries work. A battery is a device that stores chemical energy and converts it into electrical energy. This conversion occurs through a chemical reaction that takes place within the battery's cells, which contain two different electrodes: the anode (negative) and the cathode (positive). The battery also contains an electrolyte, which is an ion-conducting substance that facilitates the flow of charge between the anode and the cathode. When an electrical device is connected to a battery, a closed circuit is created. As a result, electrons are released from the anode and begin flowing in the circuit. These electrons travel to the cathode through the electrical device, effectively powering it. The electrolyte allows for the flow of ions from the anode to the cathode as well, which helps maintain electrical neutrality within the battery. The chemical reactions occurring in the battery will continue until either the chemical reactants are exhausted or the electrical circuit is broken. In summary, the correct answer is \\"power an electrical device\\" because the electron flow is what allows a battery to provide the required electrical energy to operate the connected device. This flow of electrons, facilitated by the chemical reactions within the battery, is responsible for generating the electrical current that drives the device's various components. Without this electron flow, a battery would not be able to serve its primary function: supplying power to an electrical system."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Abdoulaziz Keita proved to be the hero for Guinea as he saved a spot kick before stepping up to score the winner. Guinea are now through to face DR Congo in the semi-finals on Wednesday in Kigali. The opening ten minutes set the tone for the rest of the game as both sides started slowly and neither managed a shot on target. Both sides then sent headers wide first from Guinea's Kile Bangoura and then minutes later by Zambia captain Chris Katongo. With 20 minutes left to play Guinea's Ibrahima Sory Sankhon saw his free kick deflected onto the woodwork. Captain Chris Katongo thought he had won the game with six minutes left to play but his effort was disallowed for offside. One of the better chances in extra-time fell to Zambia's Adrian Chama as he took the ball into the area but was denied by a good save from Abdoulaziz Keita in the Guinea goal. With neither side able to break the deadlock the game was decided by penalties. Katongo, who scored when he helped Zambia win the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, had his effort saved by Keita. Guinea then scored their first effort and Buchizya Mfune then got Zambia on the board. Things were then levelled up when Jacob Banda saved Sankhon's shot, both sides then scored to keep things level.

Fifty years ago most movies were silent. A man called Walt Disney made a cartoon mouse that could talk his movies. He named his mouse Mickey Mouse. People, both young and old, were very excited at the talking mouse. Children loved to see their friend, because he brought joy and laughter to them. Mickey was a clean mouse right from the beginning. Perhaps this is one reason why people hate real mice and love Mickey Mouse. In his early life Mickey made some mistakes. People were angry. They wrote to Disney and said that they did not want Mickey to do silly things. So Disney made a new animal named Donald Duck. He also made a dog called Pluto.

Question: What instrument is used to measure the specific gravity (or relative density) of liquids such as beer and wine? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the question The question asks for an instrument that measures the specific gravity (or relative density) of liquids, specifically beer and wine. Step 2: Recall relevant knowledge From my knowledge database, I know that specific gravity is the ratio of the density of a substance to the density of a reference substance, usually water. It is used to determine the concentration of alcohol or sugar content in liquids such as beer, wine, and various other beverages. Step 3: Identify the instrument and justify the choice The instrument used to measure the specific gravity of liquids, especially in the context of beer and wine production, is a hydrometer.  Step 4: Explain the choice and use of the instrument A hydrometer is a glass instrument that consists of a weighted bulb at the bottom and a calibrated scale at the top. It is designed to float in a liquid and allows you to measure the specific gravity by observing the level at which the liquid's surface intersects the calibrated scale. The reason a hydrometer is suitable for measuring specific gravity in liquid mixtures like beer and wine is because it gives a quick and relatively accurate indication of the changes that occur in the liquid, such as sugar and alcohol content, as fermentation proceeds. This enables the person testing the specific gravity to make adjustments as necessary during production.

Donald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign. ‚ÄúIt was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,‚Äù Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival ‚Äúprobably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o‚Äôclock in the morning.‚Äù It was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump‚Äôs personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim. Trump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally. Those numbers are in keeping with a general trend of late that has seen the president‚Äôs poll ratings improving, perhaps in part because of the strong economy.

Summarize: Michael Sandford, 20, from Dorking, Surrey, was accused of trying to grab a police officer's gun to shoot Mr Trump at a Las Vegas rally on 18 June. He pleaded guilty to being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and disrupting an official function. His plea means he could be deported and his sentence reduced. Sandford previously pleaded not guilty to charges of disrupting government business and official functions, being an illegal alien and possession of a gun and had been due to stand trial later this month. He may have faced up to 20 years in a US prison if he had been convicted at trial. He is due to be sentenced on 13 December. At a court in Nevada, he acknowledged he had been treated in the past for mental illness. Entering his pleas, he said: \\"I tried to take a gun from a policeman to shoot someone with, and I'm pleading guilty.\\" His mother Lynne Sandford and the family's UK lawyer visited him in jail for the first time last week to persuade him to sign the plea agreement. Mrs Sandford said: \\"Even though he has signed the plea agreement, which should be the best option, it won't necessarily happen that way. \\"The judge at sentencing can either agree with what is in the plea bargain or he can totally overthrow that and impose a punishment of his own.\\" She added that her son told her he was \\"incredibly sorry and remorseful for everything,\\" adding: \\"Everybody says this is not him - this is so opposite to what he is.\\" Sandford's lawyers said he suffers seizures, obsession-compulsion anxiety and autism spectrum disorders. His mother said he was recently diagnosed as having had a psychotic episode at the time of the incident and should serve any sentence in a UK psychiatric hospital.

Question: How many songs by Frankie Laine were on the 10-inch LP released by Columbia Records in 1956? Context: Eventually the 12-inch (300 mm) 33 1‚ÅÑ3 rpm LP prevailed as the predominant format for musical albums, and 10-inch LPs were no longer issued. The last Columbia Records reissue of any Frank Sinatra songs on a 10-inch LP record was an album called Hall of Fame, CL 2600, issued on October 26, 1956, containing six songs, one each by Tony Bennett, Rosemary Clooney, Johnnie Ray, Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, and Frankie Laine. The 10-inch LP however had a longer life in the United Kingdom, where important early British rock and roll albums such as Lonnie Donegan's Lonnie Donegan Showcase and Billy Fury's The Sound of Fury were released in that form. The 7-inch (175 mm) 45 rpm disc or \\"single\\" established a significant niche for shorter duration discs, typically containing one item on each side. The 45 rpm discs typically emulated the playing time of the former 78 rpm discs, while the 12-inch LP discs eventually provided up to one half-hour of recorded material per side.

He was born in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico to Mexican parents, which suggests that he is likely a Mexican citizen by birth.  However, there are ways he could also be a natural-born U.S. citizen, even if he was born in Mexico. For example, if his parents were American citizens who were living in Mexico at the time of his birth, he might have received U.S. citizenship at birth. Alternatively, he may have acquired U.S. citizenship if his parents became naturalized U.S. citizens while he was still a minor. The term \\"Mexican-American\\" typically refers to individuals of Mexican descent living in the U.S., but it doesn't automatically imply U.S. citizenship, let alone natural-born citizenship. Furthermore, being based in Santa Ana, California can suggest residence, but it doesn't necessarily mean U.S. citizenship either. The phrase ‚ÄúMexican-American‚Äù often refers to nationality, heritage or cultural identification, but not necessarily legal citizenship.

Q:This article: India's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700 mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400 mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains. According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal. Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient often leads to severe floods and course changes. Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea. Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh. India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.The Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall.

Under the guise of enhancing cognitive abilities and making them smarter, healthier, and more successful, the company manages to persuade both the town authorities and parents to partake in this \\"once-in-a-lifetime\\" opportunity. The story follows a group of five children: John, who aspires to be an artist; Jane, a passionate young mathematician; Jacob, a promising athlete; Lily, a shy bookworm; and Mark, a tech prodigy. As the experiment begins, the children are given a daily pill to take, which they are constantly reminded is the key to their success. Initially, the drugs seem to be working as promised. The children show significant improvement in their respective fields, and the town quickly becomes a shining example of progress. However, as the months pass, the side effects of the experiment become more apparent. Their personalities begin to change, making them passionate and driven, but also more aggressive and detached from emotions. Friendships start to deteriorate, ambitions turn into obsessions, and the once-harmonious town starts to fray. When the mysterious disappearance of Dr. Samantha Grey, the local pediatrician overseeing the administration of the drugs, is revealed, a few family members grow suspicious. Jane's father, who is a local journalist, begins to delve deeper into Invicare's experiments. In doing so, he uncovers that the real purpose of the drug is to produce a generation of manipulable superhumans, capable of dominating industries and ensuring the corporation's profits rise indefinitely. As the conspiracy unfolds, the group of five friends, all now distant from one another, are forced to recognize their dilemma. With the help of Dr. Grey, who had gone into hiding after stumbling upon the corporation's true intentions, they gradually come together. The doctor, in an act of defiance, creates a counter-drug to reverse the negative effects of the drug and gradually deprogram the children to regain their true selves. They must rely on one another to escape the clutches of Invicare's henchmen and reveal the truth about the experiment. As the climax of the film, the small group orchestrates a protest at their school, with the support of the wider community, forcing Invicare to abandon the experiment. The company's unethical practices are exposed, and justice is served. Throughout the ordeal, the children regain the friendships they had lost and learn valuable lessons about the importance of solidarity, staying true to oneself, and the consequences of unbridled ambition. In the end, Harborside becomes a symbol of hope in the face of corporate greed, and the children emerge stronger than before, understanding that their talents and abilities are what define them, not the drugs consumed."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? Possible answers: A. Herbs grow really well in pots which can be placed near a window. Just start from seed, they grow extremely well with little care needed. Just keep the soil in the pot damp. Test the soil with your finger, if it's damp at 2 inches down, you don't need to water yet.; B. Herbs grow really well in pots which can be placed near a window. Just start from seed, they grow extremely well but care is needed. Just keep the soil in the pot very nearly dry. Test the soil with you finger, if it's dry at 2 inches down, you don't need to water yet.;","output":"Solution A is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning. In both solutions, the suggestion to grow herbs in pots near a window provides a viable alternative for those who do not have access to actual soil. However, the main difference between the two solutions lies in the care and watering instructions for the potted herbs. Solution A emphasizes keeping the soil damp, which generally correlates to proper plant care and healthy growth. When the soil is moist, it provides the necessary hydration and nutrients for the plants, and testing the soil with a finger for dampness at 2 inches depth is a good rule of thumb for determining if the plants need watering. A damp environment at this depth ensures that the herbs' roots are accessing the water they need while also promoting healthy root growth. Allowing the soil to dry out too much, as suggested in solution B, can cause the herbs to wilt or become too stressed, potentially leading to failure in growing the garden successfully. Furthermore, solution A mentions that the herbs grow extremely well with little care needed, generally speaking, many herbs, such as basil, parsley, and mint, are characterized by their hardiness and adaptability to different growing conditions. They can usually thrive with minimal care once they are established, making it a reasonable and realistic assumption. In contrast, Solution B advises maintaining the soil very nearly dry and holding off watering until the soil is dry at 2 inches down. While some herbs, such as rosemary or thyme, may prefer well-drained soil, keeping the soil consistently very nearly dry may deprive the plants of the moisture necessary for their survival and growth. Furthermore, the statement in solution B that implies herbs require close care contradicts the generally accepted knowledge about the low maintenance nature of many herbs. In summary, Solution A is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning because it offers better conditions to ensure the successful growth of an herb garden without actual soil. It takes into account the need for the moisture that is more supportive of plant growth, development and overall low maintenance characteristics of many herbs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As she mentions in the passage, she is \\"really pregnant,\\" and with pregnancy, many women experience a variety of symptoms and discomforts that can affect their overall well-being. These symptoms can include nausea, fatigue, back pain, heartburn, and other issues that can make daily life more challenging. However, on this particular day, the narrator is feeling more energetic and healthier than usual. She is able to go for a pleasant walk and enjoy the beautiful day, which indicates that her usual pregnancy-related discomforts are not as bothersome as they generally are. This unexpected improvement in her health stands out to her, prompting her to express gratitude and appreciation to God for the blessing of a more comfortable day.

Its inventor Friedrich Fr√∂bel lived in Thuringia and founded the world's first Kindergartens there in the 19th century. The Thuringian primary school takes four years and most primary schools are all-day schools offering optional extracurricular activities in the afternoon. At the age of ten, pupils are separated according to aptitude and proceed to either the Gymnasium or the Regelschule. The former leads to the Abitur exam after a further eight years and prepares for higher education, while the latter has a more vocational focus and finishes with exams after five or six years, comparable to the Hauptschule and Realschule found elsewhere in Germany.

Choices:  - slowly  - quickly  - symmetrically  - easily  A: A:","output":"Easily Reactive elements can combine more easily with other elements. To provide a deeper understanding, let's take a closer look at what reactive elements are and how reactivity works in chemical reactions. Reactivity is a chemical property that describes the tendency of an element to undergo chemical changes when it comes into contact with other elements or compounds. Highly reactive elements are more likely to form compounds and engage in chemical reactions, whereas less reactive elements are more likely to resist changes to their structure and remain in their elemental state. Reactivity depends on several factors, including the number of valence electrons (electrons in the outermost electron shell) and the atomic structure of an element. Elements can be grouped into various categories depending on their reactivity. Some well-known examples include: 1. Alkali metals (Group 1 elements in the periodic table), such as lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K), are highly reactive. These metals have one valence electron, which is readily lost in chemical reactions. Their reactivity increases down the group because it becomes easier to lose that electron as the atomic size increases. 2. Alkaline earth metals (Group 2 elements), including magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca), are also reactive but less so than alkali metals. They have two valence electrons, which can be lost during chemical reactions. Similar to alkali metals, their reactivity also increases down the group. 3. Halogens (Group 17 elements), such as fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), and bromine (Br), are highly reactive nonmetals with seven valence electrons. They readily accept an electron to achieve a stable electron configuration, leading to frequent participation in chemical reactions. In a chemical reaction, highly reactive elements, like those mentioned above, are more likely to combine with other elements as they aim to achieve stable electron configurations by losing, gaining, or sharing electrons. Since reactive elements are more prone to engage in chemical reactions, they can be said to combine more easily with other elements. In contrast, less reactive elements, such as noble gases (Group 18 elements) like helium (He), neon (Ne), and argon (Ar), have a full set of valence electrons and are already in a stable electron configuration. As a result, they are reluctant to participate in chemical reactions and are less likely to combine with other elements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Movie plot title: Confessions Movie plot: Junior high school teacher Yuko Moriguchi (Takako Matsu) announces to her class that she will resign before spring break. Moriguchi reveals that because the HIV-positive biological father of her daughter Manami was ill, she used to bring Manami (Mana Ashida) to school with her. One day, after school, she returned to the room where Manami was but found her gone. Her daughter was later found drowned in a school swimming pool. She then explains that two pupils in her class, whom she dubs \\"Student A\\" and \\"Student B\\", have murdered her four-year-old daughter. She had found a small bunny purse amongst Manami's belongings which should not have belonged there, which led her to question Shuya, one of her students. Shuya, who immediately admitted killing Manami, mocked her compassionate reaction to his feigned expression of remorse with \\"just kidding\\". Having revealed their identities, she explained that because the killers, as minors, are protected by the Juvenile Law of 1947, turning them in wouldn't make a difference. So to exact revenge on them, she admits injecting her late daughter's biological father's HIV-contaminated blood in the milk cartons of the two students who she claimed to have murdered her daughter.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - city - man made - indoors - town - artificial A:","output":"Spending time in nature is essential for the overall health and well-being of individuals. The most suitable option to answer the above question is \\"get out of city\\" and \\"indoors.\\" However, all options contribute in some way to the understanding of why it's crucial to spend time in nature. Getting out of the city: Cities are densely populated urban environments that often lack an abundance of natural landscapes and green spaces. Noise, air pollution, intense traffic, and the constant hustle and bustle of everyday city life can heavily contribute to stress and fatigue. Escaping to a natural environment, such as a forest, beach, or national park, can allow individuals to experience fresh air, tranquility, and a mental reset that's vital for overall health. Exploring nature outside of town: Similar to the city, smaller towns may not have multiple green spaces or natural landscapes within their borders. Getting out of town to immerse oneself in nature is an excellent way of connecting with the environment and renewing one's perspective on life. Stepping away from man-made and artificial surroundings: Man-made and artificial environments often do not provide the same benefits as natural surroundings. Natural landscapes offer diverse ecosystems that promote biodiversity and the opportunity to observe and interact with wildlife in their native habitats. Stepping away from artificial environments allows individuals to appreciate nature on a deeper level. Spending time outdoors instead of indoors: Being indoors for extended periods can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and an increased risk of physical and mental health issues. By stepping outside and spending time in nature, individuals can engage in physical activities such as walking, hiking, or swimming that promote cardiovascular health, increased energy, and enhanced mood. In conclusion, spending time in nature by getting out of the city, town, or artificial environment and stepping outdoors is crucial for mental, emotional, and physical well-being.

Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: Since '82 Federal Chancellor (elected by \\"constructive vote of no confidence\\" against former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, Social Democratic Party (SPD); reelected 1983, 1987, 1991 and 1994). This makes Helmut Kohl the longest-serving chancellor of the Federal Republic, passing by Konrad Adenauer, the first chancellor, this October. Sentence: The Federal REpublic will be less stable without Helmut Kohl.","output":"The text does not provide sufficient information for us to conclude whether the sentence \\"The Federal Republic will be less stable without Helmut Kohl\\" is true or false.  While the text highlights Helmut Kohl's tenure as the longest-serving chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany and mentions several instances of his re-election, it does not provide any details about his specific accomplishments or policies during his time in office. Therefore, we cannot make a determination about the potential impact of his absence on the stability of the Federal Republic. Furthermore, the concept of 'stability' is broad and can refer to various aspects including political, economic, or social stability. The text does not provide specific indications of how Helmut Kohl contributed to any of these aspects of stability. The sentence in question is making an inference that cannot be substantiated based on the information provided in the text. To fully assess the claim, it would require further information detailing Kohl's roles, policies, effects on domestic and foreign affairs, his impact on Germany's economy, and responses from the public and political sphere to his leadership. Understanding the specific context in which Kohl operated and the specific contributions he made can provide a more grounded analysis of the potential impact of his absence on the stability of the Federal Republic. We must remember that the stability of a country depends on many factors, and while the leadership of a long-serving chancellor can certainly be impactful, it is not the sole determinant of a country's stability. Other factors like the political system, international relations, social issues, and economic conditions can all play significant roles in determining a country's stability.        So, in conclusion, based on the information provided in the text, it's inconclusive to confirm the truthfulness of the sentence: \\"The Federal Republic will be less stable without Helmut Kohl.\\""},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Jordan looked high and low for his lost puppy but could not find it.  Given the context: How would Jordan feel afterwards? Options are: i. jordan doesnt give up; ii. pessimistic about the dog being found; iii. optimistic about finding the cat; Answer:","output":"Answer: ii. pessimistic about the dog being found In the given scenario, Jordan has been searching high and low for his lost puppy but has not been able to find it. This experience is undoubtedly disheartening and frustrating for Jordan, as losing a pet can evoke strong emotional responses, such as sadness, worry, and a sense of responsibility for the well-being of the lost animal. Given the three options provided, the most fitting description of how Jordan would feel after this exhaustive search is \\"pessimistic about the dog being found.\\" This is because, after putting in considerable effort without any success, it is reasonable to assume that Jordan may begin to feel less hopeful about the chances of finding his puppy. In this state of mind, he might start to believe that the prospects for locating his dog are bleak, and this pessimism can take a toll on his emotional well-being. On the other hand, the first option states that \\"Jordan doesn't give up.\\" Although this option may seem plausible, it is not a description of how Jordan would feel after the experience; rather, it highlights a characteristic or attitude Jordan may adopt during the search. As the question asks how Jordan would feel \\"afterwards,\\" this option does not accurately focus on his emotional state. Lastly, the third option refers to Jordan being \\"optimistic about finding the cat.\\" This is not a valid answer, as it strays from the context provided and does not pertain to Jordan's lost puppy. The question specifically asks about feelings regarding the lost dog, not any other animal, making this choice irrelevant to the scenario. In conclusion, based on the given context and options provided, it can be inferred that Jordan would likely feel pessimistic about his dog being found after trying his hardest and not yielding the desired outcome. This feeling of pessimism captures the emotional toll that losing a pet and being unable to locate it can have on a person."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: Although some of the references to actors, films and politicians are a little dated (only those old enough will remember Bill Clinton playing sax), this was an excellent series of cartoons that I happily watched as a 20 year old on a Saturday morning whilst nursing the obligatory hangover.20 years later and the humour has stood the test of time.

I now have a very happy 6 year old who has 5 DVDs of laugh-out-loud cartoon fun.Shame one of the disks doesn't work (even though new)!

Answer the following question: SEOUL ‚Äî South Korean Foreign Minister Kang, Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korea jointly made the decision to suspend combined military exercises scheduled for August, but would not confirm if her government was given advanced notice before U.S. President Trump announced his intention to cancel the drills, after he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. ‚ÄúWe have made it clear that this is a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum at this point, but they are not irreversible. They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,‚Äù said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the ‚Äúcomplete denuclearization‚Äù of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the ‚Äúwar games‚Äù that he said were both enormously expensive and ‚Äúprovocative,‚Äù as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea‚Äôs commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site.

This directly addresses the question and gives a specific year for the initial settlement of the island. To offer an in-depth understanding, it is essential to understand the historical context and additional details related to the settlement. Saint Helena, an island located in the South Atlantic Ocean, is considered one of the most remote inhabited places globally. It measures about 122 square kilometers (47 square miles) and is part of a British Overseas Territory which includes Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha. Saint Helena is most famous for being the site of Napoleon Bonaparte's exile and eventual death. The English East India Company was granted a charter by Oliver Cromwell in 1657 to govern Saint Helena and establish a fort and a permanent garrison on the island. The goal was to strategically use it as a supply depot and a reprieve for ships traveling from Europe to Asia and back, given its location in the middle of the trade route. A ship named the 'Constantinople Merchant' arrived in 1659, carrying the first English settlers, Captain John Dutton, his crew, and civilian planters, marking the beginning of the settlement. The population of Saint Helena grew over time as settlers, soldiers, and slaves arrived from various parts of the world. The island's early population consisted of people mainly from Britain as well as African slaves brought there from places like Cape Verde Islands, Gold Coast, and the west coast of Africa. Later, indentured laborers and slaves from India and Madagascar were also brought over to the island. Today, the island's population stands at about 4,250 inhabitants, primarily descended from the original settlers, soldiers, and slaves. The unique and diverse mix of early settlers has resulted in a rich cultural and historical heritage on the island, making it a fascinating place to study and visit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this article and answer this question Coming off their bye week, the Patriots traveled to Candlestick Park to face the 49ers in the first of two straight West Coast games for the Patriots. After a 49ers punt on their first series started the game, Cassel's second pass of the game was intercepted by linebacker Takeo Spikes to give the 49ers the ball at the Patriots' 45-yard line. On the next play, 49ers quarterback J. T. O'Sullivan threw an interception of his own, this one to Meriweather at the Patriots' 4-yard line. A three-and-out for the Patriots on their ensuing drive ended in a 35-yard Chris Hanson punt that gave the 49ers the ball at the Patriots' 30-yard line to begin their next drive. A defensive holding penalty on Patriots cornerback Deltha O'Neal on third down extended the drive, leading to a 16-yard touchdown catch by running back Frank Gore that gave the 49ers a 7-0 lead. On the Patriots' next drive, a fumbled snap by Cassel set up 3rd and 8 from the Patriots' own 34-yard line; Cassel then threw a deep pass to Moss, which was caught at the 49ers' 21-yard line and run in for a 66-yard touchdown that tied the game at 7-7. A 38-yard Isaac Bruce reception from O'Sullivan on the 49ers' ensuing possession backed the Patriots' defense up to their own 22-yard line, and two plays later, O'Sullivan and Bruce again connected on a pass, this one a touchdown from 6 yards out to give the 49ers a 14-7 lead. An exchange of punts brought the teams into the second quarter, where on the third play of a Patriots drive Cassel threw his second interception of the day, this one to Nate Clements on the 49ers' 6-yard line on a deep pass intended to Moss. The 49ers went three-and-out, leading to a 13-play, 40-yard Patriots drive where a third down sack of Cassel in the red zone set up a 35-yard Gostkowski field goal that trimmed the 49ers' lead to 14-10. The 49ers punted again on their next possession, giving the Patriots the ball on their own 20-yard line with just over three minutes remaining in the first half. 11 plays later, the Patriots faced a 2nd and goal from the 49ers' 2-yard line, where a Faulk touchdown run gave the Patriots a 17-14 lead at halftime. On the Patriots' opening possession of the second half, Cassel was sacked to begin the drive, and then again was sacked nine plays later on third down to force the Patriots to punt. Two plays later, O'Sullivan was intercepted by safety Rodney Harrison to give the Patriots the ball at the 49ers' 24-yard line. The Patriots reached the 49ers' 1-yard line, but were denied the end zone twice by the 49ers, setting up fourth down from the 2-yard line. Faulk took the direct snap on the play and ran in for his second touchdown of the game, giving the Patriots a 24-14 lead. Following a 49ers punt, an 8-play Patriots drive resulted in a 40-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots lead to 27-14 early in the fourth quarter. Starting from their own 20-yard line, the 49ers began an 11-play drive that ended on a 5-yard touchdown catch by Bruce from O'Sullivan that cut the Patriots' lead to 27-21. The Patriots responded with a 10-play series of their own; six plays into the drive, Faulk caught a second-down pass and was originally deemed to be down short of the first down, but the Patriots challenged the play and Faulk was found to have gained the necessary first down yardage. An offensive pass interference penalty on Moss set up a 3rd and 20 that the Patriots did not convert; Gostkowski then hit a 49-yard line field goal to extend the Patriots' lead to 30-21. A third-down sack of O'Sullivan led to a fourth-down interception by O'Neal that gave the Patriots the ball with 2:45 remaining in the game. The 49ers used all of their timeouts during the Patriots' next possession, and after a Patriots punt, the 49ers failed to convert on fourth down to give the Patriots the ball to end the game.

Paragraph: Life for the partners of Cates, Katalinic & Lund holds little of the glamour one might expect from a career in law. Instead of lunches at LutÔøΩÔøΩce, they caucus at the Palace Diner in Queens. Wooing clients means passing out fliers on street corners, not securing box seats at Madison Square Garden. To make ends meet, one partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse. Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab. A sign of failure, of a feeble economy, perhaps? Hardly. They are heeding the call of a growing pool of law schools, which are for the first time pointing graduates in a new direction and teaching them how to get there. Forget the lure of large firms, the security of a government post. Here is how to grapple \\"in the service of justice,\\" as many of the schools put it, instead. Convinced that corporate largess and government programs barely dent the nation's legal needs, the law schools are urging graduates to buck tradition, pass up big salaries and ignore mushrooming student debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply start their own, all with an eye toward charging no more than their clients can afford. This is not pro bono legal work; it is \\"low bono,\\" a term the schools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they are training students for. While its practitioners do charge for their services, they are also dead set on turning no one away - or at least as few as possible. \\"When you go into this kind of social justice law, it's really brutal and you're almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple of years before there's a light at the end of the tunnel,\\" said Fred Rooney, director of the Community Legal Resource Network at City University of New York School of Law, from which the lawyers of the newly formed Cates, Katalinic & Lund graduated last May. \\"But if our graduates don't do it, the millions of people who cannot access justice in this country will continue to soar.\\" The movement, primly called the consortium, started four years ago by CUNY, Northeastern University, the University of Maryland and St. Mary's Law School in Texas.

Context: Meetings for worship and study are held at Kingdom Halls, which are typically functional in character, and do not contain religious symbols. Witnesses are assigned to a congregation in whose \\"territory\\" they usually reside and attend weekly services they refer to as \\"meetings\\" as scheduled by congregation elders.

I prefer the dermatologist's treatments for acne rather than the over-the-counter treatments, because the","output":"dermatologist's treatments are more personalized, effective, and backed by scientific research. Firstly, the dermatologist's treatments are personalized to an individual's specific skin type, acne severity, and lifestyle factors. Over-the-counter (OTC) treatments, on the other hand, are designed to cater to a wide range of consumers and might not be suitable for everyone. A dermatologist will conduct a thorough skin examination, consider the patient's medical history, and possibly run some tests to identify the underlying causes of the acne. Based on these factors, the dermatologist can formulate a unique treatment plan that directly targets the root causes of the acne, and not just the symptoms. Moreover, the efficacy of the treatments prescribed by a dermatologist is often higher than that of OTC treatments. Dermatologists have access to a wide range of treatments, such as prescription topical creams that contain retinoids, antibiotics, or azelaic acid, and oral medications like antibiotics, hormonal therapies, or even isotretinoin for severe cases. These prescription medications often have a higher concentration of active ingredients and are more rigorously tested for their efficacy, ensuring that patients receive the most effective treatment possible. OTC treatments, on the other hand, may not be as potent or effective due to their lower concentrations of active ingredients. In addition to personalized solutions and increased efficacy, dermatologist's treatments are also backed by scientific research and professional expertise. A dermatologist undergoes extensive training in the field of skin care and is better equipped to choose the latest, evidence-based treatments for acne. They are also able to monitor the progress of the treatment, make necessary adjustments to ensure optimal results, and identify any potential side effects early on, minimizing the risk of complications. OTC treatments, while being widely available and affordable, might not have the same level of professional oversight and may result in individuals struggling to find the right product through a trial-and-error process. This lack of guidance may lead to further skin complications or extended periods of unsuccessful treatments. Lastly, a dermatologist is also proficient in the use of advanced acne treatments such as chemical peels, microdermabrasion, laser therapies, or even light therapy. These treatments are typically not available over-the-counter and can provide a more comprehensive approach to tackling severe or persistent cases of acne. These treatment options also signify the dermatologist's ability to adapt and cater their approach to an individual's needs and provide a more holistic acne management plan. In summary, the dermatologist's treatments for acne are preferred over over-the-counter treatments due to their ability to provide personalized solutions, increased efficacy, professional expertise, and access to a wider range of advanced treatment options. These factors contribute to a more targeted approach towards addressing the root causes of acne and achieving long-lasting results, improving the overall skin health and well-being of individuals who choose to invest in professional dermatological care."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The reason I'm giving this two stars was because my problem was resolved.  Food wasn't bad, staff was alright and not completely to blame...  but the reason I'm writing a review at all is because of a situation that, in my mind, really should not have happened.  (Edit: For clarity, I ordered this online for delivery.  Why?  Because how often do you come across a Subway that delivers?)  Let's first take a moment to discuss a BLT.  Pretty simple sandwich, right?  BLT: Bacon Lettuce Tomato; a sandwich so bold, so forthright that it needs no further explanation.  Adding things to it is on you, of course, so when I ordered Subway's BLT I kept that in mind, assuming there would be no issues with such a simple base.  What I end up with is my order... sans the lettuce and tomato.  I couldn't make this up: A BLT without lettuce and tomato.  Normally, I'm the type of person who kind of shrugs off minor mistakes (mostly because I'm too hungry and the food is still consumable), but 1/3 of my sandwich is completely missing; I was too hungry NOT to do anything about it.  A phone call to the store has me talking with the manager, telling me about the standard subway policies.  Basically, the only standard on the sandwich is the meat, and everything is up to you.  So... there really is not point in even telling them the name of the sandwich you want and adding to that--you have to name what's in it and what you want added to that.  I fail to see the logic in having pre-constructed sandwiches at all.  So unless you're in the restaurant guiding them step-by-step on how to make your sandwich, you'll pretty much have to tell them, \\"Yes, I want bacon AND lettuce AND tomato in my BLT.\\" (For future ref: if you really want bacon in your BLT, you're going to have to order double meat, or you'll just end up with the essence of bacon.  Those little slivers of bacon really don't cut it.)  I'd go into things about using common sense even if Subway's policies say otherwise... but then I'd be breaking Yelp's review guidelines. (;  I'm also not going to talk about the sub shop within walking distance that stays open until 3am and seems to have it together (as far as BLTs go.)","output":"The given review is negative.

The user expresses their frustration about the lack of key ingredients in their sandwich. 4. They explain the inconvenience of having to call the store and follow policies that don't make sense to them. 5. The user is critical about Subway's default inclusion of only the meat and expects a certain level of common sense from the staff. 6. They mention the comparison with another nearby sub shop that has a better understanding of what the user is looking for, which further emphasizes their discontent with this particular experience.

We were both in great anger. \\"Never set foot in this house again!\\" stormed Father. With tears welling up in my eyes, I rushed out of the flat and ran along the street. The street lights were shining, causing rather sad-feeling. I wandered aimlessly. A young father who held a child in his arms walked past me. I felt as if I saw my childhood from another space: happy and carefree. But now... I don't know whether it is because I have grown up or because Dad is getting old. We differ in our ways of thinking.

It feels like there is an iron door between us that can never be opened. I wandered in the streets, without a destination in mind. My heart was frozen on this hot summer night. As I walked on there were fewer and fewer people on the streets, until I had only the street lights to keep me company. When I finally reached the high-rise apartment block in which I lived, I saw that the light was still on. I thought to myself: \\"Is Father waiting for me, or is he still angry with me?\\" In fact, it was nothing. Perhaps, Dad was throwing away some of his old stamps. Perhaps he thought they were useless. I never had the courage to tell him that I liked collecting stamps. I can't stand his outrageous   words: \\"I can't throw you away, let alone these old papers?\\" All the lights were off except Father's. Dad was always like this.

Does the term grow mean the same thing in both these sentences?","output":"Yes, the term \\"grow\\" means the same thing in both of these sentences. It refers to the process of improving or increasing gradually, especially in size, quantity, or complexity. In both instances, the term is used to describe the process of a living organism developing, adapting, and expanding in size, through various stages of its life cycle. In the first sentence, \\"Corn doesn't grow here,\\" the term \\"grow\\" indicates that the environment or conditions in this particular area are not suitable for the cultivation and development of corn. This could be because of factors such as climate, soil composition, or other agricultural considerations. Here, \\"grow\\" is used to describe the failure of the corn plant to thrive and reach its full potential in this specific location. In the second sentence, \\"In these forests, mushrooms grow under the trees,\\" the term \\"grow\\" is again used to describe the development and expansion of a living organism, in this case, mushrooms, as they progress through their life cycle. In this context, the mushrooms are thriving under the trees in the forest, where the environmental conditions, such as shade, moisture, and availability of nutrients, are suitable for their growth and proliferation. It is important to note that while the term \\"grow\\" means the same fundamental process in both sentences, the actual growth process for corn and mushrooms differs biologically. Corn is a type of cereal plant that relies on photosynthesis and nutrients from the soil, while mushrooms are fungi that obtain their nutrients through the decomposition of organic matter. Regardless of these biological differences, in both sentences, \\"grow\\" denotes the same essential process of development and expansion of a living organism under suitable conditions."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

First, let's put -1362 * z and 1344 * z together, just like adding or subtracting the number of chocolates: (-1362 * z) + (1344 * z)  Now, since they both have \\"z\\" (the chocolates), we can write it like this: (-1362 + 1344) * z When we subtract -1362 from 1344, we get: -18 * z So now our equation looks like this: 72 = -18 * z To find out what z (number of chocolates) is, we can simply divide 72 by -18, like this: 72 / -18 = z When we do the division, we get: z = -4 So, there are -4 chocolates in \\"z\\". It's a bit weird to think of negative chocolates, but in math, we can have negative numbers. So our final answer is z = -4."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Or do you see many other things, such as singing birds, colorful plants and wild flowers? The forest is a whole of its own. It is full of many different living things. But even though they are all different, they have one thing in common: they all need each other in order to live on. The trees feed the forest \\"people\\" by making food in their leaves; by using sunlight to join water and minerals from the soil and air. Their deep network of roots joins the soil together and stops it from dying out, making it possible for living things to live in it. Human beings are like the living things in the forest. We need one another in order to live. We need the farmers to grow our food, railroad and truck drivers to bring it to our shops and clerks  to sell it to us. We need people to prepare our food and cook it and others to take our waste things away. Then, of course, we need doctors, nurses, government leaders, mailmen, telephone operators, and many others. We also need other human beings in another way. We need people for friendship, to talk over our problems, exchange ideas. Think how lonely and unhappy you would be if you lived all alone.

Former Wizards owner Irene Pollin wouldn't have a problem with name changing back to Bullets The Washington Wizards will conjure images of the franchise‚Äôs more successful past this season with a new, retro, red-white-and-blue motif. The uniforms will feature horizontal stripes, a ‚Äúdc‚Äù logo with a touch reminiscent of the hands that formed the ‚Äúl‚Äôs‚Äù in Bullets jerseys, and even a little basketball. Since taking over as majority owner of the Wizards, Ted Leonsis has made it his mission to move forward while maintaining a connection with the past. The one thing Leonsis has thus far refrained from doing is changing the name back to the Bullets, however, despite pleas from many fans to do just that. Those calls may get a bit louder after Abe Pollin‚Äôs widow and former Wizards‚Äô co-owner said recently she wouldn‚Äôt object to such a change. ‚ÄúI respect my husband‚Äôs wishes. I love him very much. I miss him terribly. If the fans want to change it back ‚Äî hey, why not?‚Äù Irene Pollin said. ‚ÄúTo me, it‚Äôs what do the fans want? What‚Äôs going to please them? To me, they‚Äôre the ones who support, care.‚Äù Abe Pollin changed the name from Bullets to Wizards in 1997, partly because he didn‚Äôt want the team to be associated with gun violence. Leonsis has consistently made public comments that he has no plans of going back to the Bullets. Leonsis declined comment when asked to respond last week, but when the Wizards unveiled their new look last May, he told WJFK (106.7 FM) that a name change is ‚Äúalmost like a grandstanding thing. I mean, it‚Äôs a cheap way to get people to support you.‚Äù He was asked again in October and told WTOP (103.5 FM), ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no name change that‚Äôs being contemplated.‚Äù The Bullets made four trips to the NBA Finals in the 1970s, winning the championship in 1978, then went through a period of mediocrity during the 1980s and 1990s. The team has missed the playoffs in 10 of their 14 seasons as the Wizards, advancing to the second round just once. The possibility of the name going back perhaps became more remote when Gilbert Arenas and Javaris Crittenton were suspended during the 2009-10 season for bringing guns to the locker room. But Leonsis, who started attending Bullets games as a student at Georgetown University, has mostly been reluctant for fear of insulting his predecessors ‚Äî especially since Abe Pollin died just two years ago ‚Äî and a desire to stay politically correct. Leonsis has written on his blog and said in interviews that many fans have also expressed that sentiment to him when arguing for a need to avoid calling the team the Bullets. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt agree with that,‚Äù Pollin said. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt up to me to change it. It was really my husband. He was very uncomfortable. I think he got really upset when our friend, Yitzhak Rabin, was murdered. And I think it bothered him that the team he was involved with had a name like Bullets.‚Äù Rabin, the prime minister of Israel, was assassinated in Nov. 1995, a few months after Abe Pollin announced that he was considering a name change for the franchise he bought for 1 million in 1964. The Baltimore Bullets were named after a 234-foot brick factory, the Phoenix Shot Tower, where bullets and cannons were produced from 1828 to 1892. ‚ÄúWhen we bought the team, it had that name. It was ‚Äòfaster than a speeding bullet.‚Äô That was the idea,‚Äù Irene Pollin said. ‚ÄúBut at the time, the name bullet didn‚Äôt really signify violence and death. It was just a fast projectile, really. Which is a really different idea than a bullet that kills. Maybe it can be thought of again as a speeding projectile, but I doubt that Ted would want to change the name back.‚Äù The Bullets moved to the Washington area in 1973 but held on to the name for nearly a quarter-century before the switch that coincided with the move to the arena now known as Verizon Center. Some fans and former players have never accepted the change. ‚ÄúI like the name Wizards. You know why? I named it,‚Äù Irene Pollin said with a laugh. ‚ÄúFor one thing, Washington Bullets is euphonious. Baltimore Bullets has the [alliteration]. But Washington, I thought it needed it‚Äôs own thing. We were changing it to something with a ‚ÄòW‚Äô that sounded good with the name Washington. That‚Äôs why. There was a contest. But actually, what‚Äôs interesting, I say I named it, but in the contest, people did come up with the Wizards name. So it wasn‚Äôt just me.‚Äù Pollin has attended one game since selling the team to Leonsis, sitting next to him for the home opener last season. She plans to attend the home opener against the New Jersey Nets on Monday, but has mostly maintained a low profile since representing the franchise at the NBA draft lottery and wearing her late husband‚Äôs championship ring as the Wizards won the rights to select John Wall with the No. 1 overall pick. Pollin was excited when Leonsis re-branded the franchise with a design reminiscent of better times for the organization. ‚ÄúI like the look of it and I think the reason I like it is, because it has a lot of good memories,‚Äù Pollin said. ‚ÄúWe won the championship. It could be other colors. But it doesn‚Äôt matter, there are a lot of people in Washington that remember that and remember that as a really fun time. And really, I like that idea. ‚ÄúLook, he owns the team, he can do whatever he wants,‚Äù Pollin said of Leonsis. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Irene Pollin, the former Wizards owner and widow of Abe Pollin, has stated she wouldn't object to the team changing its name back to the Bullets if fans desired it.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. ‚Äì One in 25 patients in US hospitals gets a new infection at the facility, according to the federal health department, and the numbers are three times that in non-industrialized countries, a Chilean researcher tells NPR. Healthcare-acquired infections, as they're known, can lead to longer hospital stays, increased treatment costs, and in some cases, even death, Constanza Correa adds. The CDC director says 200 people per day die of such illnesses. The good news is that Correa and others are testing a simple method that could cut down on such illnesses: Copper bed rails. Copper has been known for millennia as a material that can quickly get rid of bacteria, viruses, and more; in Correa's words, it \\"kills everything.\\" A US study found last year that the rails cut infections from 8.1% to 3.4% of hospital rooms. Correa's team has been replacing bed rails in Chile with copper since last year; so far, they've made the conversion on 150 beds in four hospitals. And \\"bed rails are only the first step. You can have copper IV poles, feeding tables, night tables, even mattress covers.\\" Indeed, an earlier study highlighted at the Blaze investigated copper door handles, toilet seats, and faucets; researchers found that they had 95% fewer \\"bugs\\" on them than standard equipment, the Daily Mail reported in 2008. More recently, researchers in Germany have been exploring the possibilities of copper; they found a 50% reduction in microbes, Deutsche Welle reports. (Another metal may work wonders against superbugs.) Expand this summary.","output":"Healthcare-acquired infections (HCAIs) pose a significant threat to patients across the globe, with the US alone witnessing a new infection in one in every 25 hospital patients, according to the federal health department. HCAIs can lead to prolonged hospital stays, higher treatment costs, and even death in certain cases, with 200 people reportedly dying every day from such illnesses in the US. Developing countries face even more severe numbers, with infection rates triple that of industrialized countries, as stated by Chilean researcher Constanza Correa.  However, a simple method using copper in hospital bed rails has shown potential in reducing these infections. Copper is renowned for its antimicrobial properties, which can quickly eliminate bacteria, viruses, and other infectious agents. A U.S. study found that the incorporation of copper in bed rails cut infection rates from 8.1% to 3.4% of hospital rooms.  Taking inspiration from this study, Correa and her team have been working on replacing bed rails in Chile with copper since last year. Their efforts currently span 150 beds across four hospitals. Correa believes that bed rails are merely the first step in a broader campaign to leverage copper's antimicrobial properties in medical infrastructure. She envisions enhancing various hospital equipment, such as IV poles, feeding tables, night tables, and mattress covers, with copper. Prior research has also highlighted the benefits of using copper in preventing infections. A study featured on the Blaze investigated copper door handles, toilet seats, and faucets. These surfaces were found to have 95% fewer \\"bugs\\" than their non-copper counterparts, as reported by the Daily Mail in 2008. More recently, researchers in Germany discovered a 50% reduction in microbes on copper surfaces.  With the effectiveness of copper against infections already proven, further implementation of solutions that incorporate the metal could help to curb the threat and widespread impact of HCAIs. The ongoing research and adaptation process has the potential to save lives, reduce recovery time, and ensure safer hospital environments for both patients and healthcare professionals. Additionally, by cutting infection rates, these copper-enhanced solutions can also contribute to lowering treatment costs, leading to a more efficient and effective healthcare system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown to justify the process: 1. An enzyme in saliva begins to break down carbohydrates: The process of digestion starts in the mouth with the enzyme in saliva (amylase) initiating the breakdown of carbohydrates.   2. Food is squeezed down the esophagus when you swallow: The process of swallowing helps move the food bolus down the esophagus via a series of muscular contractions called peristalsis. 3. Acid and enzymes in the stomach break the food down: In the stomach, hydrochloric acid and enzymes (such as pepsin) further break down the food, particularly proteins, into more basic nutrients. 4. Releases nutrients: As food is broken down into smaller particles, nutrients are released and made available for further breakdown and absorption. 5. Food is then pumped into the small intestine: The partially digested food, called chyme, moves into the small intestine where the majority of digestion and absorption occurs. 6. Fluid and enzymes from the liver and pancreas are pumped into the small intestine: The liver and pancreas release bile and pancreatic juices, respectively, into the small intestine to aid in the breakdown of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. 7. Help break food into the smallest molecules: The bile and enzymes continue to break down the food particles into their smallest molecular components, such as amino acids, simple sugars, and fatty acids, making them ready for absorption. 8. Nutrients pass through the wall of the small intestine: The vital nutrients, now in their simplest form, pass through the villi and microvilli which line the walls of the small intestine, where they are absorbed. 9. Nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream: The final step is the absorption of these nutrients into the bloodstream, where they can be transported to cells throughout the body to provide energy, support growth, and maintain overall health."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the winter its fur is white or creamy white. It has a long bushy tail, a short nose and small, curled back ears. It has short legs and thick fur. Its short legs and nose, thick fur and small ears are adaptions that help it survive in cold climates. Because its legs are so short and its ears and nose are small, they are less exposed to the cold. The arctic fox also has thick fur and hair on its paw pads that help keep it warm. When the arctic fox is sleeping, it protects its nose from the cold by curling its bushy tail around its body. The arctic fox is about three feet long and weighs between five and fifteen pounds. Males are larger than females. Diet The arctic fox is an opportunities eater. It will eat just about whatever it comes across. It eats small mammals like lemmings   and it also eats birds, insects and eggs. In fact, in the winter it often follows polar bears and wolves and eats their leftover kill. In the summer the arctic fox will carry extra food to its den and store it under rocks to eat later. The arctic fox sometimes even makes its own freezer by digging a hole in the permafrost   and storing its food there. A major source of food for the arctic fox is the lemming. In fact, the arctic fox population often peaks every four years in a cycle that follows lemming population changes. Life Cycle The arctic fox mates between February and June. The female builds a new den and gives birth to between six and twelve dark--furred kits. Both the female and the male will take care of the young kits. The male will guard the den and bring food to the den for the mother and the kits. The kits are weaned   when they are between two and four weeks old and then they will start to leave the den.

If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.  Now, I have a new situation: Two medical school students named Dan and Bob learned about the human immune system. Dan studied more about the subject, and became very interested to pursue it more in the future.  Answer this question please: Which student learned that the infected skin area may become painful?

The hypothesis suggests that Mameluke period designs were of poor quality. However, the premise describes Sabeel Qait Bey as an example of \\"fine design and craftsmanship\\" from the Mameluke period, which indicates that there were high-quality designs during this time. To further explore this topic, it is important to understand the Mameluke period and its artistic achievements. The Mamluks were a powerful military caste that ruled Egypt and the Levant between the 13th and early 16th centuries. The Mamluk period saw the creation of various architectural and artistic masterpieces, many of which are considered among the finest in Islamic art and architecture. The Mamluk period marked a time of great artistic production, and many craftsmen, architects, and artisans played a significant role in shaping the region's aesthetic values. It was during this time that many elegant buildings, such as mosques, educational institutions, and public facilities like Sabeel Qait Bey, were constructed. Sabeel Qait Bey, which is mentioned in the premise, is a fine example of Mamluk craftsmanship. This ornate kiosk dates back to the 15th century and is attributed to Sultan Qait Bey, one of the last Mamluk rulers in Egypt. The kiosk, meant to provide fresh water to visitors, showcases the intricate designs and high level of skill that Mamluk architects and artisans had. This contradicts the hypothesis, which claims that Mamluk period designs were of poor quality. There might have been some design elements or structures from the Mamluk period that were not as well-crafted as others. Nevertheless, it is essential to consider that there is a wide range of quality in any period or style. The hypothesis stating that all Mamluk period designs were of poor quality is an over-generalization that undermines the achievements and contributions of Mamluk artisans. In conclusion, based on the premise provided and the historical and contextual knowledge of the Mamluk period, it is not possible to assert that the hypothesis is true. Sabeel Qait Bey serves as a testament to the fine design and craftsmanship from the Mamluk era, contradicting the idea that Mamluk designs were of poor quality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate this to English?","output":"The Kosovar Parliament refuses to adopt a law for the conservation of cultural monuments in the historical center of Prizren, despite the fact that the initiative is taken from the Ahtisaari plan for independence. In this statement, it is mentioned that the Parliament of Kosovo, the legislative branch of the country's government, is not willing to pass a legislation aiming at preserving the historical and cultural landmarks located within the central area of Prizren, an ancient city in Kosovo. Prizren is known for its rich cultural history and significance, making the conservation of its monuments an important matter. Remarkably, this refusal comes despite the fact that the initiative for the conservation law stems from the Ahtisaari plan. The Ahtisaari plan, or the Comprehensive Proposal for the Kosovo Status Settlement, is a plan formulated by former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, who had been appointed by the United Nations to oversee negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo regarding the status of Kosovo. The proposal was presented in 2007 and mainly focuses on promoting autonomy, democracy, human rights, and protection and preservation of the cultural heritage in Kosovo. This plan has served as a framework for Kosovo's independence since its declaration in 2008. The refusal of the Kosovar Parliament to adopt this particular law thus raises concerns about the preservation of Prizren's historical center, as well as the country's commitment to protecting its cultural assets. It also highlights potential issues regarding the implementation of the principles outlined in the Ahtisaari plan. It is essential for the Parliament to reconsider this decision and work towards the conservation and protection of the cultural heritage in Prizren. This would not only contribute to the preservation of the city's unique character and identity but would also demonstrate adherence to international commitments and the principles of independence proposed by the Ahtisaari plan.

Tocqueville asserted that the values that had triumphed in the North and were present in the South had begun to suffocate old-world ethics and social arrangements. Legislatures abolished primogeniture and entails, resulting in more widely distributed land holdings. This was a contrast to the general aristocratic pattern in which only the eldest child, usually a man, inherited the estate, which had the effect of keeping large estates intact from generation to generation. In America, in contrast, landed elites were less likely to pass on fortunes to a single child by the action of primogeniture, which meant that as time went by, large estates became broken up within a few generations which, in turn, made the children more equal overall. It was not always a negative development, according to Joshua Kaplan's interpretation of Tocqueville, since bonds of affection and shared experience between children often replaced the more formal relation between the eldest child and the siblings, characteristic of the previous aristocratic pattern. Overall, in the new democracies, hereditary fortunes became exceedingly difficult to secure and more people were forced to struggle for their own living. This rapidly democratizing society, as Tocqueville understood it, had a population devoted to \\"middling\\" values which wanted to amass, through hard work, vast fortunes. In Tocqueville's mind, this explained why America was so different from Europe. In Europe, he claimed, nobody cared about making money. The lower classes had no hope of gaining more than minimal wealth, while the upper classes found it crass, vulgar, and unbecoming of their sort to care about something as unseemly as money; many were virtually guaranteed wealth and took it for granted. At the same time in America, workers would see people fashioned in exquisite attire and merely proclaim that through hard work they too would soon possess the fortune necessary to enjoy such luxuries. Despite maintaining with Aristotle, Montesquieu, and others that the balance of property determined the balance of power, Tocqueville argued that, as America showed, equitable property holdings did not ensure the rule of the best men. In fact, it did quite the opposite. The widespread, relatively equitable property ownership which distinguished America and determined its mores and values also explained why the American masses held elites in such contempt.  Question: \\"How were the American lower class's views of wealth and fine possessions different from those of the European lower class?\\" Response: \\"American lower class found wealth and fine possessions morally good while European lower class deemed it immoral\\" pick from the following. (I) no (II) yes Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"(II) yes The response correctly answers the question because it highlights the difference between the American and European lower class's views on wealth and fine possessions.

What is this text about?","output":"This text is about the unfortunate crash of the Genesis space capsule that occurred in the Utah desert, resulting in the loss of its valuable payload, which included billions of solar particles collected from the sun. The incident took place on a Wednesday and marked a disappointing end to an otherwise successful three-year scientific journey. The Genesis mission was designed to collect and return samples of solar wind, a stream of charged particles ejected from the sun's outer layers. These samples are invaluable scientific resources for better understanding the composition of the sun, exploring the birth and early evolution of our solar system, and providing further insight into the elemental and isotopic make-up of the solar wind. The space capsule was expected to make a safe return to Earth by deploying a parachute for a controlled descent. However, due to some last-minute complications, the parachute system failed, ultimately leading to the crash in the Utah desert. It is important to note that before this unfortunate event, the mission was considered near-flawless, with the space capsule having successfully performed its intended functions throughout the three-year journey. The crash of the Genesis space capsule was not only a significant setback to the scientific community, but it also underscored the importance of space mission reliability and the inherent risks associated with space exploration.

The used to play together outside in the yard till one day Barb's parents found out that she had sickle cell anemia. They haven't played together since.  But I can use this background: Some individuals have a specific mutation in the primary sequence of their hemoglobin molecules that causes them to aggregate, resulting in a deformation of their red blood cells. This abnormality is genetic in nature. A person may inherit the gene from one parent and have sickle cell trait (only some of the hemoglobin is hemoglobin S), which is usually not life-threatening. Inheriting the gene from both parents will result in sickle cell disease, which is a very serious condition.  What is an answer for this question: Which girl had hemoglobin S in her blood? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Barb is the girl with hemoglobin S in her blood. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that Barb was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia, a genetic condition caused by a mutation in the hemoglobin molecules of an individual's red blood cells.  Sickle cell anemia is characterized by the presence of hemoglobin S, an abnormal type of hemoglobin that causes red blood cells to become misshapen and sickle-shaped, leading to various health complications. The description of Barb's sudden change in lifestyle and inability to continue playing with Ann suggests that she has been affected by the symptoms of sickle cell disease, which may include fatigue, frequent infections, and episodes of pain. In the provided background information, it is explained that inheriting the gene for hemoglobin S from one parent results in sickle cell trait, whereas inheriting the gene from both parents leads to sickle cell disease. Since Barb has been diagnosed with sickle cell anemia, which is synonymous with sickle cell disease, she must have inherited the gene from both of her parents.

The problem having been contained, Sherman is given an update by his assistant, Jason (John Ales), about their latest project an experimental formula that reconstructs the DNA of an obese person to make weight-loss easy. It seems that their fattest hamster, Shelley, has lost 3 ounces, proving that the serum works. Jason suggests increasing the amount Shelley is fed, but the ever-kindly Sherman argues against it, saying it could be dangerous.He then has an unpleasant meeting with Dean Richmond (Larry Miller). The Dean tells him that the incident with the hamsters has cost the science department most of its funding. Harlan Hartley (James Coburn) is the school's last remaining wealthy alumnus and is planning to award a 10 million grant to the college; Klump is warned not to alienate him as well.After class, Sherman meets and instantly falls in love with the lovely Miss Carla Purty (Jada Pinkett), a chemistry graduate student teaching a class across the hall, who is a big fan of his work. Later that night, Sherman dines with his portly family (most of whom are also played by Murphy) and argues with them about obesity. Cletus, his ravenous father, starts his habit of randomly passing gas. Treating this disgraceful procedure religiously, he breaks wind to the point where he has soiled himself (6 times). Sherman is hurt by the comments his father, Cletus, makes, but Sherman's mother, Anna, tells him that he is \\"beautiful inside and out,\\" prompting Sherman to attempt to ask Carla out on a date, which she accepts.While watching Lance Perkins on TV giving one his speeches of motivation, Sherman falls asleep... Answer:","output":"The woman that the Professor falls in love with is Miss Carla Purty (Jada Pinkett)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Let me explain before I get called irresponsible, or incapable of having a dog, or incompetent, My dog is my baby, since the day I got her we've been inseparable. I learned from this mistake and have taken every precaution to prevent it from happening again. She was uninjured luckily, but I was freaking traumatized. I have a SUUUUPPPPEEEERRR long driveway, so I usually drive my truck to the end to check my mail, and on this particular day, I was out in my yard playing with Roxie, I saw the mailman drive by through my fence, and so we walked back to the house, I grabbed my keys, and off we went. This wasn't too long ago, maybe May, so it's hot, typical North Carolina weather, maybe 92 and some change, so my windows are down, because I drive a 13 year old black truck, so it's hot as hell, and it makes it hard to breathe. The AC works, it just takes time to kick in, and number 5 (my highest AC setting) does not work. As I'm driving down, I'm going maybe 5 miles an hour. I'm petting Roxie with my right hand when I feel her jerk out of my reach and I hear a bush rustle, I look to the passenger side, slam on brakes (because the last thing I want is to hurt my baby) and put the truck in park. Sure enough, my mom and her Chihuahua were out in the front yard, and Roxie, being her playful self jumped out and ran.

The hierarchy could refer to a broad range of possibilities, such as an organizational chart for a government agency, a specific part of an organization's chain of command, or any ordered system related to government policy. If we knew more specifics about the hierarchy in question, we might be able to draw a more concrete conclusion about the hypothesis. Furthermore, the phrase \\"entire chain of command\\" suggests the hypothesis is referring to a comprehensive hierarchy. We cannot confirm from the given premise that the published hierarchy in OMB Bulletin 94-01 was indeed complete or exhaustive. It might have been a partial representation, focused on specific aspects or functional areas, or part of a larger series of bulletins providing more context. To conclude, based on the premise alone, we cannot definitively determine whether the hypothesis \\"The OMB Bulletin 94-01 had the list of the entire chain of command\\" is true. Additional information specifying the nature and context of the hierarchy published in the bulletin is necessary to make a more well-informed judgment. It would be appropriate to explore the contents of OMB Bulletin 94-01 and relevant historical context to determine if the published hierarchy addresses the entire chain of command, or if it provides partial or specific information about the chain of command within the context of the bulletin's purpose."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

With 38 songs in the Top 10 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary charts, Diamond has sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling musicians of all time. Neil Diamond has been touring around the world consecutively for 50 years. Neil Diamond 50 - 50th Anniversary Collection Diamond was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1984 and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011. Diamond was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a Jewish family descended from Russian and Polish immigrants. His parents were Rose (nee Rapaport) and Akeeba \\"Kieve\\" Diamond, a dry-goods merchant. He grew up in several homes in Brooklyn, having also spent four years in Cheyenne, Wyoming, where his father was stationed in the army. In Brooklyn he attended Erasmus Hall High School and was a member of the Freshman Chorus and Choral Club, along with classmate Barbra Streisand. They were not close friends at the time, Diamond recalls: \\"We were two poor kids in Brooklyn. We hung out in the front of Erasmus High and smoked cigarettes.\\" After his family moved he then attended Abraham Lincoln High School, and was a member of the fencing team. Also on the team was his best friend, future Olympic fencer Herb Cohen.  For his 16th birthday, he received his first guitar. When he was 16, and still in high school, Diamond spent a number of weeks at Surprise Lake Camp, a camp for Jewish children in upstate New York, when folk singer Pete Seeger performed a small concert. Seeing the widely recognized singer perform, and watching other children singing songs for Seeger that they wrote themselves, had an immediate effect on Diamond, who then became aware of the possibility of writing his own songs. \\"And the next thing, I got a guitar when we got back to Brooklyn, started to take lessons and almost immediately began to write songs,\\" he said. He adds that his attraction to songwriting was the \\"first real interest\\" he had growing up, besides helping him release his youthful \\"frustrations\\".  Diamond also used his newly developing skill to write poetry. By writing poems for girls he was attracted to in school, he soon learned it often won their hearts. His male classmates took note and began asking him to write poems for them which they would sing and use with equal success. He spent the summer following his graduation as a waiter in the Catskills resort area. There he first met Jaye Posner, who would years later become his wife.  Diamond next attended New York University as a pre-med major on a fencing scholarship, again on the fencing team with Herb Cohen. He was a member of the 1960 NCAA men's championship fencing team. Often bored in class, he found writing song lyrics more to his liking. He began cutting classes and taking the train up to Tin Pan Alley, where he tried to get some of his songs heard by local music publishers. In his senior year, when he was just 10 units short of graduation, Sunbeam Music Publishing offered him a 16-week job writing songs for 50 a week (equivalent to about US405 per week, in 2017 dollars), and he dropped out of college to accept it.

Here is an article: I have a working definition of power, which came to me in an anecdote about Prince. One night at the end of last summer, according to someone who was there, Prince, the elusive chanteur, went to a concert in New York. Twenty minutes into the show, he decided he wanted McDonald‚Äôs French fries. Fifteen minutes after that, McDonald‚Äôs French fries were served to him on a white china plate. He ate standing up. Power like that has no uniform. In the late 1970s and 1980s, white-collar women began to dress for the power they wanted, not the power they had. Suits were gray, maybe navy. Collars were white. Jackets were double-breasted, the better to hide a pair of breasts. If uniformity was the object of ‚Äò‚Äòpower dressing,‚Äô‚Äô the prototype was Katharine Hepburn: a woman for whom pockets seemed invented; who embodied the whole idea of a tall order; whose tomboy √©lan and gun-moll humor, in combination with a number of custom suits, made her the ultimate midcentury working girl. As Hepburn once said of Humphrey Bogart, ‚Äò‚ÄòHe‚Äôs a real man, nothing feminine about him.‚Äô‚Äô A powerful woman couldn‚Äôt have much feminine about her either. This spring, the codes have been switched. ‚Äò‚ÄòUnisex‚Äô‚Äô no longer means ‚Äò‚Äòmannish,‚Äô‚Äô but rather glamorously bisexual in a fin-de-si√®cle way. ‚Äò‚ÄòNine to five‚Äô‚Äô means ‚Äò‚Äònine a.m. to five a.m.,‚Äô‚Äô which means daywear looks a lot like Saturday-night wear. I‚Äôm not sure ‚Äò‚Äòappropriate‚Äô‚Äô means anything. Here‚Äôs a list I made of looks you should try right now (unless it‚Äôs actually a list of things Prince once wore that I love): Harley-ready leather, head-to-toe polka dots, oversize white shirts with black thigh-high stockings, brassy or brocaded jackets over Elizabethan frills, silk suits in violet or orange. What Hepburn in the ‚Äô50s was to women at work in the ‚Äô80s, Prince in the ‚Äô80s ‚Äî half-freaky, half-ladylike, and always a bit overdressed ‚Äî is to us now. The new looks may be too loud to confer real authority, but with the right attitude, and if no one else at your office reads this article, you may just look so extraordinary as to seem irreplaceable. Gucci is leading the craze. Last January, a hitherto-unknown designer, the 43-year-old Alessandro Michele, was promoted from inside the fashion house to become its creative director and the toast of the industry. His spring 2016 women‚Äôs wear show was, accordingly, a lesson in rapid advancement, as well in the charms of unexpectedness. Secretary dresses and skirts with matching blouses ‚Äî pussy-bowed, preposterously colored, embroidered ‚Äî got louder and sheerer as the show went on, proving that outfits can be as open-concept as offices. Trousers came purposefully, imperfectly creased, perhaps to remind us that if women on the make are no longer ironing men‚Äôs clothes, we‚Äôre also short of time to iron our own. In the mid 1990s, the Chicago Tribune‚Äôs ‚Äò‚ÄòWomen at Work‚Äô‚Äô columnist, Carol Kleiman, proposed that a woman fed up with sexist style rules should dress for a casual Friday, ‚Äò‚Äòlike a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger, preferably in a very bright color (I prefer shocking pink), with comfortable boots,‚Äô‚Äô since in an outfit like this, ‚Äò‚Äòno one will dare mess with you by suggesting a list of dress-down clothes to wear to work.‚Äô‚Äô Kleiman would have loved the opening look at Louis Vuitton: a pink leather moto on a pink-haired model, paired with an embellished kilt and flatforms. If the ‚Äò‚Äòpower suit‚Äô‚Äô circa Tom Ford at Gucci was lean and mean and made a gal look like a neo-noir detective, the new or alternative suiting is versatile and mismatched, the look of a superhero halfway through a costume change: satin blazers with cargo pants in monochrome (Ford, at his namesake label), deconstructed tweeds with raw-edged leather and biker boots (Lanvin) or Converse and sequins (Marc Jacobs). I‚Äôm personally craving a navy pinstripe two-piece (Versace), the skirt knee-length and frayed with a careless high slit, the jacket left unzipped over a navel-baring Oxford in computer blue. If we‚Äôre always working as late as we say we are, we might as well dress for Friday like it‚Äôs Saturday night. Or like it‚Äôs a lucky Sunday morning. For spring, lingerie was the rage at Balenciaga, where Alexander Wang showed nothing that wasn‚Äôt pure white; at Givenchy, where Riccardo Tisci maxed out the potential of black and white crepe-back satin and point-de-gaze lace; and even at C√©line, where Phoebe Philo showed a few loose-cut slips. Call it bedroom-to-boardroom dressing, a fad so oddly romantic as to be totally uncool ‚Äî though Prince, no stranger to lace, would likely say otherwise. To be cool, Prince told Rolling Stone in 1990, ‚Äò‚Äòall you have to ask yourself is, ‚ÄòIs there anybody I‚Äôm afraid of?‚Äô If not, then you‚Äôre cool.‚Äô‚Äô Maybe it‚Äôs enough to be fearless, redundant to be fearsome; men have tended, anyway, to be afraid of the women they don‚Äôt scare. Certainly ‚Äî I‚Äôm not being facetious here ‚Äî one way to suggest you have nothing to fear at work, on the subway or on the street is to dress every inch the soft target. A decade after ‚Äò‚ÄòThe Woman‚Äôs Dress for Success Book‚Äô‚Äô (1977) by John T. Molloy, the best-selling guide to Hepburnesque professionalism at work, the author complained to The Los Angeles Times that businesswomen ‚Äò‚Äòfluff out‚Äô‚Äô at the top. ‚Äò‚ÄòThey wear conservative clothing for 10 promotions,‚Äô‚Äô he said, ‚Äò‚Äòthen deny that they were tough as nails to get there and start dressing like Madame Bovary.‚Äô‚Äô If Molloy meant to suggest that women who run with the wolves shouldn‚Äôt wear sheep‚Äôs clothes, he may have had a point, though I‚Äôd say the clothes he recommended ‚Äî those ‚Äò‚Äòboring but powerful‚Äô‚Äô separates in colorless cotton and wool ‚Äî were considerably more sheepish than those he mocked, asking: ‚Äò‚ÄòCan you imagine a man wearing an orange suit?‚Äô‚Äô Luckily, today you can. Of course, Molloy did not consider the odds that a woman ‚Äî in a matching tangelo pant and blazer from Altuzarra‚Äôs spring show, perhaps ‚Äî has been denying herself risk or frivolity in her sartorial choices for years, and only now is no longer in denial; the probability that a woman whose success depends on being seen as ‚Äò‚Äòone of the guys‚Äô‚Äô might, upon getting there, look around and say, Wait, I take it back.

Michael Winner's long-serving personal assistant has told how he died peacefully in her arms. Dinah May, 59, said the film director and food critic had died quietly after she told him his friends 'in heaven are waiting for you'. The former model and Miss Great Britain was Mr Winner's personal assistant for 35 years. Her notoriously outrageous and straight-talking boss would famously shout 'DINAH!' whenever he needed anything. Miss May's loyalty to her boss meant she nursed him through his deteriorating health and became his carer in his final months. She said she had gone to change his dressings as he lay on a coma on the day he died in January when she spoke to him. 'I was just holding his hand and I was saying, \\"What are you holding on for? You said goodbye to everybody, everyone in heaven is waiting for you\\" and suddenly his breath started to change and he took his last breath and that was it,' she told the Sunday Times. She added it was 'heartbreaking' to watch him die. 'He had gone through hell and to see it any longer... No, he had to go. I felt so sorry for him, it was tragic,' she said. Mr Winner left her ¬£300,000 and the ¬£1.2‚Äâmillion Kensington flat he owned in which she lived rent-free. But it was revealed last week he owed ¬£12million in debts which has dramatically shrunk his estate to ¬£4.75million. As a result, Miss May has received a tax bill for ¬£150,000 and has been told there is a ¬£600,000 loan on the flat which she will also have to pay. She said: ‚ÄòMichael was great fun but oh, what a complete mess. He always promised me a pension. If he saw me crying because I was worried about the future, he told me not to worry because I was well taken care of in his will. 'And of course I believed him. Towards the end he kept writing and rewriting his¬† will. We used to joke it was like the hokey-cokey. One day someone¬† was in, the next day they were out.¬† I suppose that was because he knew the money was running out. ‚ÄòMichael made it clear that his bequests to me should be clear of inheritance tax and gift tax and that if there was any, his estate should pay it. He wrote that down, had it documented and gave me a copy. 'It was all done legally. It‚Äôs with my lawyer who has been contesting everything with the executors and Michael‚Äôs lawyers. If I had to meet these bills, I would have to sell the flat ‚Äì and then where would I live?'

The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we‚Äôre inactive until the next day. The reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten. There is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits. So even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn‚Äôt actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of ‚Äònormal‚Äô evening eating. Advice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants‚Äô diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period. Eating at night a waistline hazard So did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern.

In this scenario, all we know is that there is a person kneeling next to a car, and there are pieces of wood underneath the car. This premise doesn't give us any clear information about what the person is doing or their intentions.

However, based on the premise, we cannot confirm this is the case. Several scenarios and interpretations can be drawn from the given premise, and the hypothesis is just one of them.

Justifying the step: To continue an existing story, it's imperative to comprehend its themes in order to stay true to the existing plot. In their small apartment, Kayla and Megan sipped coffee as they sat on the couch with their laptops. As they worked on their respective blogs, Kayla couldn't help but notice Megan's focused gaze on her own screen. Megan had traveled to numerous exotic places, capturing the essence of different cultures and landscapes in a way that made readers feel as if they were there on the journey with her. Step 2: Introduce contrasting elements to make the story engaging. Justifying the step: Introducing contrasting elements and adding further depth to the characters helps to create an interesting dynamic. Despite their different approaches to blogging, both Kayla and Megan respected each other's work. Kayla admired Megan's spontaneity and ability to connect with her audience through personal stories, while Megan appreciated the intellectual depth and rigorous research that went into Kayla's blog. Their mutual support and enthusiasm for each other's work made their friendship stronger. Step 3: Introduce obstacles or challenges to the plot. Justifying the step: Introducing obstacles and challenges in a story keeps readers engaged while providing opportunities for character development. One day, during a conversation over lunch, Kayla mentioned a world-renowned anthropology conference that was to take place in two months. This conference was an incredible opportunity for her to showcase some of her most groundbreaking research.

Step 4: Show character growth and progression. Justifying the step: Showcasing character growth and development allows readers to connect with characters and relate to their day-to-day struggles.

In the same vein, Kayla would gain firsthand exposure to various cultures at the travel event, which would only deepen her understanding and enrich her research.

As the two friends sat side by side in the closing moments of their respective events, they exchanged knowing smiles.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday slammed China's militarization of disputed South China Sea islands, insisting that weapons systems recently deployed in the area were meant to intimidate and coerce Beijing's neighbors. The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Last week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea. Mattis on Saturday referred to that disinvitation as an \\"initial response\\" to China, but he did not outline any additional steps that might be taken. \\"The U.S. will continue to pursue a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, cooperating when possible and competing vigorously where...

Antonio Ramiro Romo (born April 21, 1980) is an American football television analyst and former quarterback who played 14 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Eastern Illinois University, where he won the Walter Payton Award in 2002, and led the Panthers to an Ohio Valley Conference championship in 2001. He signed as an undrafted free agent with the Cowboys in 2003. Beginning his career as a holder, Romo became the Cowboys' starting quarterback during the 2006 season. On September 7, 2008, Romo led the Cowboys to a 28-10 win over the Cleveland Browns in their season opener. Romo completed 24 of his 32 passes for a total of 320 yards and one touchdown. After the game, Romo required 13 stitches for a large gash on his chin that occurred during the third quarter when linebacker Willie McGinest hit him in the chin with his helmet. The NFL fined McGinest 7,500 for the hit.  On September 15, Romo led the Dallas Cowboys to a 41-37 win against the Philadelphia Eagles in the second game of the 2008 season. Romo completed 21 of his 30 passes for a total of 312 yards and three touchdowns. The 54 combined points scored by the Cowboys and Eagles in the first half were the second most points scored in a half during a Monday Night Football game.  Romo and the Cowboys won their third straight before losing to the Washington Redskins, falling to 3-1. Following a win against the Cincinnati Bengals, Romo was injured in a loss to the Arizona Cardinals.

The Manchus' continued dominance was ensured by an ethnic quota for top bureaucratic appointments. Hong Taiji's reign also saw a fundamental change of policy towards his Han Chinese subjects. Nurhaci had treated Han in Liaodong differently according to how much grain they had, those with less than 5 to 7 sin were treated like chattel while those with more than that amount were rewarded with property. Due to a revolt by Han in Liaodong in 1623, Nurhachi, who previously gave concessions to conquered Han subjects in Liaodong, turned against them and ordered that they no longer be trusted; He enacted discriminatory policies and killings against them, while ordering that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen (in Jilin) before 1619 be treated equally as Jurchens were and not like the conquered Han in Liaodong. Hong Taiji instead incorporated them into the Jurchen \\"nation\\" as full (if not first-class) citizens, obligated to provide military service. By 1648, less than one-sixth of the bannermen were of Manchu ancestry. This change of policy not only increased Hong Taiji's manpower and reduced his military dependence on banners not under his personal control, it also greatly encouraged other Han Chinese subjects of the Ming dynasty to surrender and accept Jurchen rule when they were defeated militarily. Through these and other measures Hong Taiji was able to centralize power unto the office of the Khan, which in the long run prevented the Jurchen federation from fragmenting after his death. Question: When did a Han revolt occur?","output":"A Han revolt occurred in Liaodong in 1623. This event led Nurhaci, the leader of the Jurchen at the time, to change his policy towards the conquered Han Chinese in Liaodong.

In contrast, Hong Taiji, who succeeded Nurhaci, adopted a different approach and incorporated the Han Chinese into the Jurchen \\"nation\\" as full citizens, obligated to provide military service. This shift in policy not only increased Hong Taiji's manpower but also encouraged other Han Chinese subjects of the Ming dynasty to surrender and accept Jurchen rule when they were defeated militarily.

However, this depends on the nature of the decision and whether Quinn is directly involved in the outcome. If the decision has significant consequences for Quinn or if they have a close relationship with the person involved, they may be less likely to forget about the situation entirely. B: Carried out If Quinn supported one's decision, it can be inferred that they believe it was the right choice and would want to see it carried out. If Quinn has a role in the implementation of the decision or if they feel responsible for the outcome, they may want to ensure that the decision is properly executed.

Rusescu, three squadrons of the 6th Cavalry Regiment of the 4th Brigade entered Budapest. Until midday on 4 August 400 Romanian soldiers with two artillery guns held Budapest. Then the bulk of the Romanian troops arrived in the city and a parade was held through the city center in front of the commander, Gen.  Mo≈üoiu. Romanian forces continued their advance into Hungary and stopped at Gy≈ër. The incursion of Romania into Hungary caused the heaviest fighting of the war. The Romanian army casualties were 123 officers and 6,434 soldiers--39 officers and 1,730 soldiers killed, 81 officers and 3,125 soldiers wounded, and three officers and 1,579 soldiers missing in action. As of 8 August the Romanians had captured 1,235 Hungarian officers and 40,000 soldiers, seized 350 guns--including two with a caliber of 305¬†mm--332 machine guns, 52,000 rifles and 87 airplanes.

Provide a detailed answer so user don‚Äôt need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the background: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.  and the situation: When studying the kinetic-molecular theory, two teams of students did and experiment. Team A heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first, team B heated a can of soup, but vented it first.  Answer the following question: Which team lead a less safer experiment? A:","output":"Team A led a less safe experiment because they heated the can of soup without venting it first. This allowed the pressure inside the can to build up due to the increase in kinetic energy of the air molecules and the potential boiling of the soup, which could eventually lead to the can exploding. Venting the can, as Team B did, allows the pressure inside to escape and lowers the risk of explosion, making their experiment safer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What song has been covered by the Grateful Dead on their album Postcards of the Hanging?, using the article: Among Dylan's contemporaries, Phil Ochs was impressed by Highway 61, explaining: \\"It's the kind of music that plants a seed in your mind and then you have to hear it several times. And as you go over it you start to hear more and more things. He's done something that's left the whole field ridiculously in the back of him.\\" In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine described Highway 61 as \\"one of those albums that changed everything\\", and placed it at number four in its list of \\"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\". The Rolling Stone list of \\"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\" ranked \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\", \\"Desolation Row\\" and \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" at number 373, number 187, and number one, respectively. In 2012, The Best 100 Albums of All Time book ranked Highway 61 Revisited as the greatest album of all time. The album was included in Robert Christgau's \\"Basic Record Library\\" of 1950s and 1960s recordings‚Äîpublished in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981)‚Äîand in Robert Dimery's 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.Most of the songs on Highway 61 Revisited have remained important, in varying degrees, to Dylan's live performances since 1965. According to his website, he has played \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" over 2,000 times, \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" more than 1,700 times, \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\" over 1,000 times, and most of the other songs between 150 and 500 times.The influence of the songs on Highway 61 Revisited can be heard in many cover versions. \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" has been recorded by artists including the Rolling Stones, on their live album Stripped, David Bowie and Mick Ronson on Heaven and Hull, Johnny Winter on Raisin' Cain, and Jimi Hendrix at the Monterey Pop Festival. My Chemical Romance's version of \\"Desolation Row\\" was featured in the film Watchmen in 2009.

It is thus to be distinguished from diurnal and nocturnal behavior where an animal is active during the hours of daylight or the hours of darkness respectively. The term is not precise, however, as some crepuscular animals may also be active on a moonlit night or during an overcast day. The term matutinal is used for animals that are only active before dawn, and vespertine for those only active after sunset.  - Tennessee (\\"Tanasi\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States. Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, and Arkansas and Missouri to the west. The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state, and the Mississippi River forms the state's western border. Tennessee's capital and second largest city is Nashville, which has a population of 654,610. Memphis is the state's largest city, with a population of 655,770.  - Kansas is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States. Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita. Kansas is named after the Kansa Native American tribe, which inhabited the area. The tribe's name (natively \\"\\") is often said to mean \\"people of the wind\\" or \\"people of the south wind\\", although this was probably not the term's original meaning. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - Nebraska is a state that lies in both the Great Plains and the Midwestern United States. The state is bordered by South Dakota to the north, Iowa to the east and Missouri to the southeast, both across the Missouri River, Kansas to the south, Colorado to the southwest and Wyoming to the west. Its area is just over 77,220 sq mi (200,000¬†km) with almost 1.9 million people. Its state capital is Lincoln. Its largest city is Omaha, which is on the Missouri River.  - Florida (Spanish for \\"land of flowers\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Alabama and Georgia, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Straits of Florida and Cuba. Florida is the 22nd most extensive, the 3rd most populous, and the 8th most densely populated of the U.S. states. Jacksonville is the most populous municipality in the state and is the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Miami metropolitan area is Florida's most populous urban area. The city of Tallahassee is the state capital.  - The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards.  - The Mekong giant catfish, \\"Pangasianodon gigas\\" (, ; /\\"try riec\\"/), is a very large, critically endangered species of catfish (order Siluriformes) in the shark catfish family (Pangasiidae), native to the Mekong basin in Southeast Asia and adjacent China. In Thai folklore, this fish is regarded with reverence, and special rituals are followed and offerings are made before fishing it.  - The Ictaluridae , sometimes called ictalurids , are a family of catfish native to North America , where they are important food fish and sometimes as a sport fish . It includes about 51 species . They include fish commonly known as bullheads , madtoms , channel catfish , and blue catfish .  - Loricariidae is the largest family of catfish (order Siluriformes), with 92 genera and just over 680 species to date, with new species being described each year. Loricariids originate from freshwater habitats of Costa Rica, Panama, and tropical and subtropical South America. These fish are noted for the bony plates covering their bodies and their suckermouths. Several genera are sold as \\"plecos\\", notably the suckermouth catfish, \\"Hypostomus plecostomus\\", and are popular as aquarium fish.  - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.  - Ictalurus is a genus of North American freshwater catfishes. It includes the well-known channel catfish (\\"Ictalurus punctatus\\") and blue catfish (\\"Ictalurus furcatus\\").  - Corydoras is a genus of freshwater catfish in the family Callichthyidae and subfamily Corydoradinae. The species usually have more restricted areas of endemism than other callichthyids, but the area of distribution of the entire genus almost equals the area of distribution of the family, except for Panama where \\"Corydoras\\" is not present. \\"Corydoras\\" species are distributed in South America where found east of the Andes to the Atlantic coast, from Trinidad to the R√≠o de la Plata drainage in northern Argentina. Species assigned to \\"Corydoras\\" display a broad diversity of body shapes and coloration. \\"Corydoras\\" are small fish, ranging from in SL.  - The wels catfish (or ; \\"Silurus glanis\\"), also called sheatfish, is a large species of catfish native to wide areas of central, southern, and eastern Europe, in the basins of the Baltic, Black, and Caspian Seas. It has been introduced to Western Europe as a sport fish and is now found from the United Kingdom all the way east to Kazakhstan and China and south to Greece and Turkey. It is a scaleless freshwater fish recognizable by its broad, flat head and wide mouth. Wels catfish can live for at least fifty years and have very good hearing to compensate for their poor sight.  - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.  - Channel catfish (\\"Ictalurus punctatus\\") is North America's most numerous catfish species. It is the official fish of Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Tennessee, and is informally referred to as a \\"channel cat\\". In the United States, they are the most fished catfish species with approximately 8 million anglers targeting them per year. The popularity of channel catfish for food has contributed to the rapid expansion of aquaculture of this species in the United States.  - Detritivores, also known as detrivores, detritophages, detritus feeders, or detritus eaters, are heterotrophs that obtain nutrients by consuming detritus (decomposing plant and animal parts as well as feces). There are many kinds of invertebrates, vertebrates and plants that carry out coprophagy. By doing so, all these detritivores contribute to decomposition and the nutrient cycles. They should be distinguished from other decomposers, such as many species of bacteria, fungi and protists, which are unable to ingest discrete lumps of matter, but instead live by absorbing and metabolizing on a molecular scale (saprotrophic nutrition). However, the terms detritivore and decomposer are often used interchangeably.   - Candiru (English and Portuguese or \\"candir√∫\\" in Spanish), \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\", also known as ca√±ero, toothpick fish, or vampire fish, is a species of parasitic freshwater catfish in the family \\"Trichomycteridae\\" native to the Amazon Basin where it is found in the countries of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.  - Callichthyidae is a family of catfishes (order Siluriformes), called armored catfishes due to the two rows of bony plates (or scutes) running down the length of their bodies. This family contains some of the most popular freshwater aquarium fish, such as the species of \\"Corydoras\\".  - The blue catfish (\\"Ictalurus furcatus\\") is the largest species of North American catfish, reaching a length of and a weight of . The average length is about 2546 in (64117¬†cm). The fish can live to 20 years. The native distribution of blue catfish is primarily in the Mississippi River drainage, including the Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Arkansas Rivers, and the Rio Grande, and south along the Gulf Coast to Belize and Guatemala. . These large catfish have also been introduced in a number of reservoirs and rivers, notably the Santee Cooper lakes of Lake Marion and Lake Moultrie in South Carolina, the James River in Virginia, Powerton Lake in Pekin, Illinois, and Springfield Lake in Springfield, Illinois. This fish is also found in some lakes in Florida. The fish is considered an invasive pest in some areas, particularly the Chesapeake Bay. Blue catfish can tolerate brackish water, thus can colonize along inland waterways of coastal regions.  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel.  - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City.  - Catfish (or catfishes; order Siluriformes or Nematognathi) are a diverse group of ray-finned fish. Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the Pira√≠ba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\". There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus \\"Corydoras\\", are important in the aquarium hobby. Many catfish are nocturnal, but others (many \\"Auchenipteridae\\") are \\"crepuscular\\" or \\"diurnal\\" (most \\"Loricariidae or\\" \\"Callichthyidae\\" for example).  - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.

Chauvetia multilirata is a species of sea snail , a true gastropod mollusk in the Buccinidae family , the marine whelks .","output":"The two sentences from Wikipedia provided convey similar information but are not exactly the same in meaning. Let's analyze each sentence to understand the subtle differences: Sentence 1: \\"Chauvetia multilirata is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Buccinidae, the true whelks.\\" In this sentence, Chauvetia multilirata is described as a species of sea snail that belongs to the class of marine gastropod molluscs. Furthermore, it is specified that it is a member of the family Buccinidae, which consists of the true whelks. The sentence offers a more hierarchical categorization of the species, starting from the sea snail group, moving on to gastropod molluscs, and ending with the family Buccinidae. Sentence 2: \\"Chauvetia multilirata is a species of sea snail, a true gastropod mollusk in the Buccinidae family, the marine whelks.\\" This sentence also identifies Chauvetia multilirata as a species of sea snail, but it emphasizes its characteristics as a \\"true\\" gastropod mollusk within the Buccinidae family. Here, the term \\"marine whelks\\" is used interchangeably with the term \\"true whelks,\\" establishing a link between the marine environment and the whelks. This sentence does not follow the same hierarchical structure as the first one, and the focus is more on the relation between Chauvetia multilirata and being a marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Buccinidae. In summary, while both sentences convey the fact that Chauvetia multilirata is a sea snail species and a gastropod mollusk in the Buccinidae family, the first sentence provides a hierarchical categorization of the species, while the second sentence emphasizes its marine environment and its true characteristics as a gastropod mollusk.

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence. Input: In 2014-15 there were 33,781 cases of children, aged 10 and under, needing the removal of one or more teeth - a rise of 3% on the previous year. The Chief Dental Officer for NHS England, Sara Hurley, described the figures as \\"disappointing\\". She said children in England drank more sugary drinks than anywhere in Europe. \\"Even though people understand the impact of a sugary diet so many children have advanced tooth decay - a highly preventable disease,\\" said Ms Hurley. \\"We are also creating a legacy of obesity and significant health problems. \\"If we are to get serious about tackling this then prevention is the key,\\" she added. Since 2011-12 there has been a steady rise in the number of children needing tooth extractions, according to statistics collated by the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC). Over the four-year period there were 128,558 cases in total of children having teeth removed because of decay. And the 2014-15 figures show a 9.8% rise from the 30,761 recorded in 2011-12. Prof Nigel Hunt from the Royal College of Surgeons said: \\"An almost 10% increase in the number of children being admitted to hospital for tooth extraction due to decay over a four-year period is unacceptable.\\" \\"The need for tooth extraction continues to be the number one reason why five to nine-year-old children are admitted to hospital.\\" He also said that poor oral health education was another reason for the rise. The figures also showed a wide regional variance across England. For example, in 2014-15 the rate of tooth extractions in Yorkshire and the Humber was 894.5 for every 100,000 people (6,413 episodes). That was more than five times the rate recorded in the East of England, which was 164.5 per 100,000 population (1,328 episodes). The authors of the HSCIC study said: \\"Nationally, there is a strong correlation between area deprivation and the rate of tooth extraction.\\" \\"As deprivation increases so does the rate of tooth extraction.\\" London had the most children needing hospital admission as an inpatient for tooth decay, with 8,362 cases. In the North West, there were 6,672 cases, and 6,413 in Yorkshire and Humber. The shadow public health minister, Andrew Gwynne, described the figures as \\"disturbing\\". \\"The government should be standing up for parents, particularly those living in more deprived communities, and helping them to tackle tooth decay,\\" he said. A Department of Health spokesperson said: \\"Children's teeth are dramatically healthier than they were 10 years ago, but we still know there is more to do.\\" \\"We are radically changing NHS dentistry, so that dentists will be paid for keeping the nations' teeth healthy, rather than just for treating problems as they arise.\\" The figures over the past four years break down as follows: Tooth decay is caused by plaque collecting, in particular, around the gum line, the edges of fillings and the grooved surfaces of the teeth. Plaque is made up of food debris, saliva and bacteria normally present in the mouth. The acids generated by bacteria breaking food down can begin to attack tooth enamel within 20 minutes of a meal. If plaque is allowed to collect over time it will harden into tartar. Both tartar and plaque contain acids which, over time, can dissolve the protective, hard, enamel coating of the tooth and create holes, or cavities. Most cavities form over a period of months, or even years. They are usually painless, but they can grow very large and damage the much softer internal structures of the tooth such as the dentin and the pulp, which is found at the core. If they remain untreated, they can kill the nerve and blood vessels of the tooth, and ultimately the tooth itself. The most obvious sign of tooth decay is toothache, particularly after hot or cold food or drinks. Pits or holes may also be visible in the teeth. Plaque and tartar also irritate the gums, and lead to a gum disease called gingivitis.

Article: Two days after his on-stage outburst at the iHeartRadio festival made headlines, Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong has announced he will undergo treatment for substance abuse.      The band broke the news Sunday evening on their Facebook page, posting a message that read:      \\"Billie Joe is seeking treatment for substance abuse. We would like everyone to know that our set was not cut short by Clear Channel and to apologize to those we offended at the iHeartRadio Festival in Las Vegas. We regretfully must postpone some of our upcoming promotional appearances.\\"      At press time, it's not clear just what appearances will be scrapped in support of the band's ¬°Uno! album (out Tuesday), or if Armstrong's treatment will effect Green Day's just-announced tour, which is set to kick off in November. A rep for the band could not be reached for comment by MTV News.      Armstrong launched into a rant during Green Day's Friday-night performance at iHeartRadio after being told that the band needed to wrap up their set, shouting \\"I'm not f---ing Justin Bieber, you motherf-----s. You've got to be f---ing joking ... I got one minute left.\\" Green Day then smashed their instruments before departing the stage.      And earlier this month, Green Day were also forced to cancel a concert in Italy after Armstrong was hospitalized.

In the first quarter, the Falcons got straight to work as Matt Ryan completed a 42-yard touchdown pass to Roddy White. In the second quarter, Matt Bryant's 51-yard field goal extended the lead for Atlanta. As the first half was closing, Buffalo blocked Atlanta's field goal and things got crazy as a couple of Bills possessed the ball, but they could not manage to get it into the end zone. In the third quarter, Atlanta extended their lead even more as Marty Booker caught a 12-yard touchdown pass from Ryan. Things got better for the Falcons as Buffalo running back Fred Jackson fumbled the ball, which led Lawrence Sidbury to return it for an 11-yard defensive touchdown as he dragged a few Buffalo players. The Bills finally got on the board as kicker Rian Lindell nailed a 42-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Ryan re-connected with White for a 5-yard touchdown pass, as it was too late for the Bills to catch up. how many yards did Bryant extend?","output":"Matt Bryant extended the lead for the Atlanta Falcons by making a 51-yard field goal in the second quarter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To determine whether the conclusion of the hypothesis can be drawn from the given premise, let's break down and analyze each statement: Premise: \\"Utah looks like my dream come true.\\" In this statement, the person is expressing that Utah appears to possess the qualities or characteristics they desire, or that it satisfies their expectations in some way. This could relate to various aspects, such as landscape, culture, or personal goals. The key phrase is \\"looks like,\\" which means that there might still be room for uncertainty or that they haven't fully experienced Utah yet. Hypothesis: \\"Utah is a place of my fantasies.\\" This statement suggests that Utah is an ideal location or a place where the person's dreams and fantasies come to life. It seems to emphasize the imaginative and aspirational qualities of Utah for the person, rather than focusing on specific, concrete factors. Now, the question is whether we can conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. Based on the analysis, it appears that the premise and hypothesis are closely related. Both statements convey a positive perception of Utah and imply that it meets the person's desires or expectations. However, there are slight differences in emphasis and wording. The premise focuses on the appearance or resemblance of Utah to the person's dreams, whereas the hypothesis highlights the fantastical, idealized nature of Utah. The premise contains a hint of uncertainty with the phrase \\"looks like,\\" whereas the hypothesis presents a more assertive impression that Utah is indeed the place of the person's fantasies. Although these differences exist, it is plausible to argue that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is likely to be true as well. This conclusion is based on the assumption that when someone finds a location to be their \\"dream come true,\\" it implies that the place embodies the qualities they fantasize about and aspire to experience. However, it is essential to consider both the limitations of language and subjective interpretation. The premise and hypothesis might hold slightly different meanings for different people or could be reliant on individual emotions or experiences. As a result, while it is possible to deduce a connection between the premise and hypothesis, one must bear in mind the subjective nature of such statements and the impact of personal context on arriving at a definitive conclusion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Terry Eugene Bollea was born in Augusta, Georgia on August 11, 1953, the son of construction foreman Pietro \\"Peter\\" Bollea (December 6, 1913 - December 18, 2001) and homemaker and dance teacher Ruth V. (nee Moody; 1922 - January 1, 2011). He is of French, Italian, Panamanian, and Scottish descent. When he was one and a half years old, his family moved to Port Tampa, Florida. As a boy, he was a pitcher in Little League Baseball. Hogan remained WWF World Heavyweight Champion for four years (1,474 days). In front of 33 million viewers, however, Hogan finally lost the title to Andre on the February 5 episode of The Main Event after a convoluted scam involving \\"The Million Dollar Man\\" Ted DiBiase and Earl Hebner (who assumed the place of his twin brother Dave Hebner, the match's appointed referee). After Andre delivered a belly to belly suplex on Hogan, Hebner counted the pin while Hogan's left shoulder was clearly off the mat. After the match, Andre handed the title over to DiBiase to complete their business deal. As a result, the WWF World Heavyweight Championship was vacated for the first time in its 25-year history because then WWF President Jack Tunney decreed the championship could not be sold from one wrestler to another. At WrestleMania IV, Hogan participated in a tournament for the vacant WWF World Heavyweight Championship to regain it; he and Andre were given a bye into quarter-finals, but their match resulted in a double disqualification. Later that night in the main event, Hogan came to ringside to stop Andre interfering which helped \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage defeat Ted DiBiase to win the title.  Together, Hogan, Savage, and manager Miss Elizabeth formed a partnership known as The Mega Powers. After Savage became WWF World Heavyweight Champion at WrestleMania IV, they feuded with The Mega Bucks (Andre the Giant and Ted DiBiase) and defeated them at the main event of the first SummerSlam. They then went on to feud with Slick's Twin Towers: Akeem and Big Boss Man.  In mid-1988, Hogan wrestled at house shows in singles competition with his \\"War Bonnet\\", a red and yellow gladiator helmet with a fist-shaped crest. This was notably used to give Bad News Brown his first WWF loss at a Madison Square Garden house show before it was discarded altogether. The War Bonnet gimmick was revisited in the WWE's online comedy series Are You Serious? in 2012.  The Mega Powers began to implode due to Savage's burgeoning jealousy of Hogan and his paranoid suspicions that Hogan and Elizabeth were more than friends. At the Royal Rumble in 1989, Hogan eliminated Savage from the Royal Rumble match while eliminating Bad News Brown, which caused tension, only to be eliminated by The Twin Towers himself. In early 1989, the duo broke up while wrestling The Twin Towers on the February 3 episode of The Main Event, when Savage accidentally collided with Miss Elizabeth during the match, and Hogan took her backstage to receive medical attention, temporarily abandoning Savage, who slapped Hogan and left the ring, where Hogan eventually won the match by himself.

Context: The Raid on Le Havre was a two-day naval bombardment of the French port of Le Havre early in July 1759 by Royal Navy forces under Rear-Admiral George Rodney during the Seven Years' War, which succeeded in its aim of destroying many of the invasion barges being gathered there for the planned French invasion of Great Britain. Hypothesis: The Royal Navy is part of Great Britain's military.","output":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that the Royal Navy is part of Great Britain's military from the given context. Here is a detailed explanation to support this hypothesis: Contextual Analysis: The context provided outlines an historical event known as the Raid on Le Havre, which took place in July 1759 during the Seven Years' War. The Royal Navy, led by Rear-Admiral George Rodney, conducted a naval bombardment on the French port of Le Havre to destroy the invasion barges that were being gathered by the French for a planned invasion of Great Britain. To frame the hypothesis, it is essential to have a clear understanding of the role the Royal Navy played during this event and its connection with Great Britain. The Royal Navy: The Royal Navy is the principal naval warfare and maritime service branch of the British Armed Forces, which is responsible for the defense of the United Kingdom, its overseas territories, and various other interests. It originated in the early 16th century and has been a significant component of the British military throughout history, including the Seven Years' War, when the Raid on Le Havre occurred. In the given context, the Royal Navy's operation under Rear-Admiral George Rodney had a clear objective: to destroy French invasion barges intended to attack Great Britain. Considering that the Royal Navy was operating to protect Great Britain's interests, it is reasonable to conclude that it was (and still is) an integral part of Great Britain's military. Great Britain's Military: Great Britain's military (or the British Armed Forces) refers to the combined military organizations of the United Kingdom, responsible for the nation's defense and the protection of its people and interests. The military is composed of various branches, including the British Army, the Royal Air Force, and the Royal Navy. Hypothesis: Given the role of the Royal Navy in the Raid on Le Havre and its connection to the British Armed Forces, we can confidently draw the hypothesis that the Royal Navy is part of Great Britain's military. Its responsibility during the event in question was to neutralize the threat posed by the French invasion plans, demonstrating its commitment to the defense of Great Britain and acting on behalf of the nation's interests. Therefore, the hypothesis is consistent with the information provided in the context: Hypothesis: The Royal Navy is part of Great Britain's military."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium in time for the 1993‚Äì94 season, thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators. This capacity had to be reduced further during Champions League matches to accommodate additional advertising boards, so much so that for two seasons, from 1998 to 2000, Arsenal played Champions League home matches at Wembley, which could house more than 70,000 spectators. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Where did Arsenal play matches because of increased seating capacity?","output":"Arsenal played their matches at Wembley Stadium because it could house more than 70,000 spectators, which is a larger seating capacity than their previous stadium, Highbury.

I did not receive what I ordered and it look over two weeks to receive the order. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? The answer is:","output":"This product review conveys a negative sentiment. The reasons for this classification are evident through several statements made by the reviewer, which express dissatisfaction with various aspects of their experience with the seller. We can analyze these aspects in detail to better understand the reasoning behind the negative sentiment. Firstly, the title of the review, \\"Seller was a disappointment,\\" clearly expresses that the reviewer had an unfavorable experience with the seller. This statement serves as an overview of the reviewer's sentiment, and the word \\"disappointment\\" itself is associated with dissatisfaction, portraying negative emotions. Next, the reviewer explicitly states, \\"I will not purchase from this seller again.\\" This declaration indicates that their experience was unsatisfactory to a degree that the reviewer does not intend to conduct business with the said seller in the future. This stark statement further reinforces the negative sentiment of the review. The review continues to elaborate on the reasons for the dissatisfaction. The primary concern expressed is that the reviewer \\"did not receive what I ordered.\\" This means that the reviewer did not get the product they had expected or paid for, which understandably creates frustration and disappointment. This issue speaks to the seller's reliability, implying that the seller may have delivered the wrong item or misrepresented the product. Either way, this situation suggests a lack of attention to detail or, worse, dishonesty on the seller's part. Additionally, the reviewer mentions that \\"it took over two weeks to receive the order.\\" This statement implies that the shipping time was longer than the reviewer had anticipated. Long wait times for delivery can significantly impact customer satisfaction, as many consumers expect prompt shipment in today's fast-paced world. The tardy delivery time adds another layer of dissatisfaction to the reviewer's experience with the seller and contributes to the negative sentiment portrayed in the review. In conclusion, the product review in question undoubtedly conveys a negative sentiment. This conclusion is supported by the review's title, the reviewer's declaration of not intending to purchase from the seller again, and the specific issues reported with receiving the wrong item and a prolonged delivery time. The reviewer's experience was far from ideal, leading to the expression of dissatisfaction and disappointment with the seller, ultimately giving a negative impression to other potential customers who may come across this review."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The character was created by writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane and made his first appearance in Detective Comics #58 in December 1941. The Penguin is one of Batman's most enduring and well-known foes, known for his distinctive appearance, sharp wit, and criminal genius. The Penguin, as his name suggests, is often depicted as a short, rotund man wearing a tuxedo, top hat, monocle, and carrying an umbrella that conceals various gadgets and weapons. His waddle-like walk and bird-like features, along with his penchant for using birds in his criminal pursuits, earned him the nickname \\"The Penguin\\". Oswald Cobblepot is a man who embraces his outward appearance and uses it as one of his many tools in his villainous endeavors. Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot was born into a wealthy family but faced many challenges in his early life. His father died of bronchial pneumonia, and his overprotective mother made him carry an umbrella constantly to shield him from rain and illnesses. He was mercilessly teased and bullied by his peers because of his short stature and odd appearance. Soon after his mother's death, Oswald lost the family fortune forcing him to survive in the harsh streets of Gotham City. These early struggles fueled Oswald's desire for power and wealth, ultimately leading him down the path of crime. Despite his odd appearance, The Penguin is a highly intelligent and cunning criminal mastermind, often organizing and leading vast criminal empires. He is also an expert at manipulating both his enemies and allies. Unlike many of Batman's other adversaries, The Penguin does not possess any superhuman abilities or powers. Instead, he relies on his intellect, wealth, and an array of weapons hidden within his ever-present umbrella. Some of these weapons include bladed tips, firearms, electric shock devices, and even explosive rockets. Throughout his appearances in various Batman comics and other media, The Penguin has been portrayed in varying ways, from a simple thief to a high-stakes criminal mastermind. He has been known to control underground criminal networks, manage nightclubs, and even dabble in the world of politics. Despite his ruthless nature, Oswald Cobblepot is a man of culture and sophistication, enjoying fine food, music, and art. The Penguin has also appeared in various television shows, films, and video games. Some of the most notable portrayals of this character include Burgess Meredith in the 1960s Batman television series and its accompanying movie, Danny DeVito in the 1992 film Batman Returns and Robin Lord Taylor in the recent Gotham television series. In each of these iterations, The Penguin has been depicted as a calculating and devious adversary, challenging Batman and his allies with his elaborate schemes and criminal enterprises. In conclusion, Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot, better known as The Penguin, is a timeless and unforgettable Batman villain whose distinctive appearance, ruthless intelligence, and penchant for using avian-inspired methods in his criminal pursuits have made him an enduring and formidable foe for the Dark Knight and his allies. His various portrayals throughout history have showcased his remarkable adaptability as a character and his unique place within the Gotham City's criminal underworld."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The beggar, who had been loudly describing himself as \\"a cripple\\", leaps up, only to be restrained by Porter. (\\"Shut up!

He asks for a cigarette from the waitress at the counter, and then steals the packet of cigarettes from the waitress after paying the bill. (He does a lot of smoking in this movie.)

Overwhelmed by the situation, the guilt she feels for betraying Porter, and the weight of her addiction, Lynn decides to end her life. Porter discovers her lifeless body and is devastated by her death. Lynn's death serves as a turning point in the movie and acts as a catalyst for Porter's determination to seek revenge against his betrayers and reclaim the money that was stolen from him.

Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Tim enjoys the snow.\\"?","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it cannot be definitively concluded that Tim enjoys the snow. However, it can be inferred that Tim and his friends appreciate the beauty that the snow brings to the surroundings during their mountain climbing adventure. The paragraph states that Tim and his friends decide to continue climbing the mountain despite the sudden snowfall. This suggests that the group is not deterred by the unexpected weather conditions and are able to adapt to the change in the environment. Instead of focusing on any potential inconvenience that the snow may have caused, the paragraph highlights the fact that the snowfall enhances the scenery's beauty. This implies that Tim and his friends might feel a sense of awe or appreciation when they witness the snow transforming the landscape around them. The group's decision to carry on with their climb could be an indicator of their resilience and willingness to make the most of the situation, regardless of whether they enjoy the snow or not. It is important to note that this paragraph does not provide direct evidence pointing to Tim's personal feelings or preferences about the snow. There is no mention of Tim's specific reaction to the snowfall or any indication that he derives pleasure or enjoyment from the experience.

In general, however, if Casey has helped Ash by getting his car fixed, it is unlikely that Ash would want to \\"punch Casey\\". Typically, an act of kindness or help, such as taking the initiative to repair someone's damaged property, is met with gratitude, not hostility or violence. So, from the information given, \\"punch Casey\\" seems like an invalid or unlikely response from Ash. Instead, Ash might want to thank Casey, reimburse the repair expenses, or discuss the accident and how the car got damaged."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The author consistently uses strongly negatively charged language and expressions throughout their review, which highlights their intense dissatisfaction with the movie. Firstly, the author describes the movie as \\"a 90-minute Ramones concert with brief periods of stupidity and absolute boredom.\\" This statement is negative, as it suggests that the movie is lacking in engaging content and mainly filled with uninteresting musical performances. Secondly, the phrase \\"What kind of high school is this anyway?\\" conveys a sense of disbelief and confusion, implying that the movie's setting and portrayal of high school life is unrealistic and unrelatable. The author then provides a warning to potential viewers: \\"Unless you are a major Ramones fan, DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT waste your time like I did.\\" The use of capital letters and repetition emphasizes the strength of their negative feelings, implying that watching this movie would be a significant waste of time for anyone who is not specifically interested in the Ramones. Describing the movie as \\"utterly unwatchable from start to finish,\\" the author uses hyperbolic language to further emphasize their negative opinion. The alternative title suggestion, \\"Ramone Fever,\\" reinforces the idea that the movie caters to a very narrow audience of Ramones enthusiasts, while providing little value to anyone else. Noting that \\"there is not a plot to be found in this flick\\" and \\"as far as teen comedies go, you are scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one,\\" the author criticizes the film's lack of narrative structure and its inferiority compared to other films in its genre. In summary, the sentiment of this passage is decidedly negative, as the author expresses strong dissatisfaction with the movie's content, structure, and appeal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Some people like to let their rabbits roam freely in their home. This may not be an option for you, however.","output":"In such cases, providing your dwarf rabbit with an indoor cage is essential for their safety and comfort. When choosing a cage, take into consideration the following aspects: 1. Size: Dwarf rabbits may be small in stature, but they still require a good amount of space to move around, play, and explore. Select a cage that is at least four times the size of your rabbit when they are fully stretched out. Ideally, the height of the cage should be tall enough to allow your rabbit to stand up on their hind legs without their ears touching the top. 2. Flooring: Wire flooring can be detrimental to your rabbit's feet, causing discomfort and even injuries. Opt for a cage with a solid floor, and provide a soft, absorbent bedding like paper pulp or aspen shavings for optimal comfort and cleanliness. 3. Enrichment: Rabbits are intelligent, curious creatures that can become bored and stressed if not provided with ample opportunities for entertainment and mental stimulation. Fill their cage with a variety of toys like chew blocks, tunnels, and hanging toys to keep them engaged and content. 4. Litter box: House training your rabbit will help maintain a cleaner living environment. Place a litter box with rabbit-safe litter in a corner of the cage and encourage your rabbit to use it by placing a small amount of their waste in the box. 5. Food and water: Provide a balanced diet of hay, rabbit pellets, and fresh vegetables daily. Prevent spillage and contamination by using a sturdy food dish and a sipper water bottle. 6. Cleaning and maintenance: Clean and sanitize your rabbit's cage, litter box, food dish, and water bottle regularly to minimize the risk of bacteria buildup and illness. Replace soiled bedding frequently and be vigilant about monitoring your rabbit's health. Aside from the indoor cage, it's also important to give your dwarf rabbit adequate exercise and social interaction. Dedicate at least one or two hours per day to let them out of the cage for some supervised playtime and bonding. Create a safe and enriching play area within your home, rabbit-proofing any hazards such as electrical cords or toxic plants. Lastly, be sure to visit a veterinarian experienced in rabbit care for regular check-ups and vaccinations. Regular grooming, nail trimming, and dental care are also essential to keep your dwarf rabbit healthy, comfortable, and happy. By providing your rabbit with proper housing, a balanced diet, exercise, and attention, you'll ensure a long, fulfilling life for your small furry companion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to get a medical marijuana id card  Find out if your condition is covered.  Medicinal marijuana is prescribed for a wide variety of conditions, spanning from physical ailments to mental health issues. However, what conditions qualify you for a medical marijuana card, known as qualifying conditions, vary widely from state to state.","output":"To begin the process of obtaining a medical marijuana ID card, it is essential to first familiarize yourself with the specific qualifying conditions outlined in your state's legislation. These may include, but are not limited to, chronic pain, cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, Crohn‚Äôs disease, multiple sclerosis, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and Parkinson‚Äôs disease. Some states may also provide access to medical marijuana for anxiety, depression, and other mental health conditions, while others may be more restrictive in their allowances. After confirming that your condition is covered within your state's guidelines, the next step involves obtaining a recommendation from a licensed healthcare professional. Search for a qualified doctor in your area who specializes in medical marijuana treatment and schedule an appointment to discuss your symptoms, condition, and how cannabis may be of assistance. Remember that not all healthcare practitioners are supportive of medical marijuana, so it may be necessary to research and find a doctor open to this form of treatment. During your appointment, be prepared to discuss your medical history, present symptoms, any previous treatments or medications you have tried, and how these options have affected your condition. The doctor will evaluate your condition and determine if medical marijuana is an appropriate treatment option for you. If the physician deems that medical marijuana would be a beneficial treatment for your condition, they will provide you with a signed recommendation or certification, depending on your state's requirement. Once you have received the necessary documentation from your healthcare provider, the next step is to complete an official application for a medical marijuana ID card. The application process varies by state and may include online registration, mailing in a paper application, or visiting a designated government office in person. Be sure to carefully follow the instructions provided by your state's regulatory agency or medical marijuana program to ensure a smooth application process. In addition to the recommendation or certification from your doctor, the application typically requires personal identification documents (such as a driver‚Äôs license or state-issued ID), proof of residency, a passport-sized photo, and payment of an application fee. The fee varies depending on your state of residence and may be waived or reduced for applicants who demonstrate financial hardship. Once your application has been submitted and reviewed, your state's medical marijuana program or regulatory agency will determine whether to approve or deny your request for a medical marijuana ID card. Approval times vary by state but typically range from a few days to a few weeks. If your application is approved, you will receive your medical marijuana ID card either through mail or in person, depending on your state's procedures. With your medical marijuana ID card in hand, you can now visit a licensed dispensary in your state to purchase cannabis products that cater to your specific medical needs. It is crucial to follow your state's regulations regarding purchase limits, possession limits, and authorized consumption methods to maintain compliance with the law and ensure that your medical marijuana usage is both safe and legal. Regular consultation with your healthcare provider is also advisable to monitor your progress, adjust dosage if necessary, and to answer any questions or concerns you may have about your medical marijuana treatment. In summary, getting a medical marijuana ID card involves understanding your state's qualifying conditions, obtaining a recommendation from a licensed healthcare professional, completing the necessary application procedures, and abiding by state-specific regulations surrounding medical cannabis use. Remember that knowledge of your state's laws and open communication with your healthcare provider are imperative in successfully obtaining and utilizing a medical marijuana ID card for your health and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Organized crime is a category of transnational, national, or local groupings of highly centralized enterprises run by criminals who intend to engage in illegal activity, most commonly for money and profit. Some criminal organizations, such as terrorist groups, are politically motivated. Sometimes criminal organizations force people to do business with them, such as when a gang extorts money from shopkeepers for so-called \\"protection\\". Gangs may become disciplined enough to be considered \\"organized\\". A criminal organization or gang can also be referred to as a mafia, mob, or crime syndicate; the network, subculture and community of criminals may be referred to as the underworld.  - Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade.  - The Five Families refers to the five major New York City organized crime families of the Italian American Mafia. The term was first used in 1931, when Salvatore Maranzano formally organized the previously warring factions into what are now known as the Bonanno, Colombo, Gambino, Genovese, and Lucchese crime families, each with demarcated territory, organizationally structured in a now-familiar hierarchy, and having them reporting up to the same overarching governing entity. Initially (in the summer of 1931), that governing entity was a \\"capo di tutti capi\\" (boss of all bosses), but that September the role was replaced by The Commission, which continues to govern American Mafia activities in the United States and Canada.  - Rhode Island, officially the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. Rhode Island is the smallest in area, the eighth least populous, and the second most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states, following New Jersey. Its official name is also the longest of any state in the Union. Rhode Island is bordered by Connecticut to the west, Massachusetts to the north and east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south via Rhode Island Sound and Block Island Sound. The state also shares a short maritime border with New York.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - Carlo \\"Don Carlo\\" Gambino (August 24, 1902¬† October 15, 1976) was an Italian-born American gangster heavily involved in La Cosa Nostra. Translated as 'this thing of ours', \\"LCN\\" is otherwise known as the American Mafia. He is notable for being boss of the Gambino crime family, which is still named after him. After the 1957 Apalachin Convention he unexpectedly seized control of the Commission of the \\"American Mafia\\". Gambino was known for being low-key and secretive. In 1937 Gambino was convicted of tax evasion but had his sentence suspended. He lived to the age of 74, when he died of a heart attack in bed \\"in a state of grace,\\" according to a priest who had given him the Last Rites of the Catholic Church. He had two brothers, Gaspare Gambino, who later married and was never involved with the Mafia and is not to be confused with another Gaspare Gambino who was a mafioso in Palermo, and Paolo Gambino who, on the other hand, had a big role in his brother's family.  - Anthony Megale ( August 1 , 1953 -- July 21 , 2015 ) , also known as \`\` The Genius '' , \`\` Tony Connecticut '' , \`\` Machiavelli '' , \`\` Mac '' , \`\` The Brain '' , \`\` Mr. T '' , and \`\` Gas Man '' was a Connecticut mobster who became the acting underboss of the Gambino crime family .  - The American Mafia, often referred to as the Italian Mafia or Italian Mob, (commonly shortened to the Mafia or Mob) and also known as the Italian-American Mafia, La Cosa Nostra (LCN), or the American Cosa Nostra, is an influential, highly organized Italian-American criminal society. The organization is often referred to by members as Cosa Nostra (\\"our thing\\"). It originated and developed from the original \\"Mafia\\" or \\"Cosa nostra\\", the Sicilian Mafia, though eventually encompassing other non-Sicilian Italian-American gangsters and organized crime groups of Italian origin in the United States and, to a lesser extent, Canada. The father of American organized crime is generally considered to be Sicilian-American criminal Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano.  - The Gambino crime family (pronounced ) is one of the \\"Five Families\\" that dominates organized crime activities in New York City, United States, within the nationwide criminal phenomenon known as the Mafia (or \\"Cosa Nostra\\"). The group, which went through three bosses between 1910 and 1957, is named after Carlo Gambino, boss of the family at the time of the McClellan hearings in 1963, when the structure of organized crime first gained public attention. The group's operations extend from New York and the eastern seaboard to California. Its illicit activities include labor and construction racketeering, gambling, loansharking, extortion, money laundering, prostitution, fraud, hijacking, pier thefts, and fencing.  - Money laundering is the process of transforming the profits of crime and corruption into ostensibly 'legitimate' assets. In a number of legal and regulatory systems, however, the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial and business crime, and is sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system (involving things such as securities, digital currencies, credit cards, and traditional currency), including terrorism financing and evasion of international sanctions. Most anti-money laundering laws openly conflate money laundering (which is concerned with \\"source\\" of funds) with terrorism financing (which is concerned with \\"destination\\" of funds) when regulating the financial system.  - Connecticut is the southernmost state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. Connecticut is also often grouped along with New York and New Jersey as the Tri-State Area. It is bordered by Rhode Island to the east, Massachusetts to the north, New York to the west, and Long Island Sound to the south. Its capital city is Hartford, and its most populous city is Bridgeport. The state is named for the Connecticut River, a major U.S. river that approximately bisects the state. The word \\"Connecticut\\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an Algonquian word for \\"long tidal river\\".  - Underboss (also capo bastone or sotto capo) is a position within the leadership structure of Sicilian and American Mafia crime families. The underboss is second in command to the boss. The underboss is sometimes a family member, such as a son, who will take over the family if the boss is sick, killed, or imprisoned.  - Extortion (also called shakedown, outwrestling, and exaction) is a criminal offense of obtaining money, property, or services from an institution, through coercion. It is sometimes euphemistically referred to as a \\"protection racket\\" since the racketeers often phrase their demands as payment for \\"protection\\" from (real or hypothetical) threats from unspecified other parties. Extortion is commonly practiced by organized crime groups. The actual obtainment of money or property is not required to commit the offense. Making a threat of violence which refers to a requirement of a payment of money or property to halt future violence is sufficient to commit the offense. Exaction refers not only to extortion or the demanding and obtaining of something through force, but additionally, in its formal definition, means the infliction of something such as pain and suffering or making somebody endure something unpleasant.  - The Connecticut River is the longest river in the New England region of the United States. Flowing roughly southward for through four U.S. states, the Connecticut rises at the U.S. border with Quebec, Canada, and discharges at Long Island Sound. Its watershed encompasses five U.S. states and one Canadian province   via 148 tributaries, 38 of which are major rivers. Discharging at per second, the Connecticut produces 70% of Long Island Sound's fresh water.    What entity does 'anthony megale' has the relation 'occupation' with?

Here are possible answers to this question: - anxiety - happiness - insights - inspiration - wisdom  I believe the correct choice is \\"insights\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"Insights. Step 1: Understand the context of the question. The question describes a man who enjoys sitting quietly by himself. Step 2: Analyze the purpose of his action. The man believes that sitting quietly helps him come up with his best something about things, which means this activity is somehow beneficial for his thought process. Step 3: Compare the possible answers with the context and purpose. - Anxiety: This option does not make sense because sitting quietly by himself is an enjoyable activity for the man, and anxiety is a negative emotion. - Happiness: While the man enjoys the activity, it is more about helping him produce better ideas or thoughts about various things, rather than generating happiness. - Insights: This option fits well with the context because insights are valuable realizations that can be sparked by quiet contemplation, and the man believes this activity leads to his best thoughts. - Inspiration: This option is also somewhat aligned with the context, but it tends to focus on creativity or motivation, whereas the question seems to emphasize better understanding or realizations. - Wisdom: Wisdom is the accumulation of knowledge over time, and while sitting quietly might contribute to it, the immediate outcome of the activity is more likely insights rather than acquiring wisdom. Step 4: Justify the answer. I believe the correct choice is \\"insights\\" because the context suggests that the man gains valuable realizations and thoughts from engaging in quiet contemplation, and insights represent momentary breakthroughs or understandings which can stem from such activity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He didn't look safe; he looked poor and hungry. He could see that she was frightened, standing out there in the cold. He knew how she felt. He said, \\"I am here to help you, ma'am. Why don't you wait in the car where it's warm? By the way, my name is Bryan Anderson.\\" Well, all she had was a flat tire, but for an old lady, that was bad enough. Bryan crawled under the car looking for a place to put the jack, skinning his knuckles a time or two. Soon he was able to change the tire. But he had to get dirty and his hands hurt. As he was tightening up the lug nuts, she rolled down the window and began to talk to him. She told him that she was from St. Louis and was just passing through. She couldn't thank him enough for coming to her aid. Bryan just smiled as he closed her trunk. The lady asked how much she owed him. Any amount would have been all right with her. She already imagined all the awful things that could have happened, had he not stopped. Bryan never thought twice about being paid. This was not a job to him. This was helping someone in need, and God knows there were many people who had given him a hand in the past. He had lived his whole life that way, and it never occurred to him to act any other way.

The reasoning behind this is as follows: 1. Reduced water volume: Less rainfall means there will be a reduced volume of water in streams and rivers. This will decrease the erosive force of the water, thus slowing down the rate of erosion. Consequently, the process of cutting into soil and bedrock becomes less effective. 2. Slower erosion process: With less water in the streams and rivers, the water flow will also be reduced, and this will consequently slow down the erosion process. As a result, the formation of new, larger ravines will be less likely to occur. 3. Less sediment transportation: Less rainfall means less water available to carry sediment downstream, which is a crucial part of the erosion process. The reduced transportation of sediments slows down erosion rates and leads to fewer and smaller ravines. In summary, less rainfall in a year will have a negative impact on both the formation of new ravines and the enlargement of existing ones due to the reduced erosive force of water and the slower erosion process. This will result in fewer and smaller ravines over time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don‚Äôt need to search outside to understand the answer. A friend asked me to answer this question: What is Syra's real name?, using the article: The story is set in Rome the early 4th century AD, during the time of the persecution of Christians under the Roman Emperor Diocletian. The heroine of the book is Fabiola, a young beauty from a noble Roman family. She is spoiled by her father Fabius, who cannot deny her anything. Fabiola seems to have everything, including a superior education in the philosophers, yet under the surface, she is not content with her life. One day, in a fit of rage, she attacks and wounds her slave girl Syra, who is a secret Christian. The proud, spoiled Roman girl is humbled by Syra's humility, maturity and devotion to her in this situation, and a slow transformation begins, which finally culminates in her conversion to Christianity, brought on by Syra and of her own cousin Agnes, whom she adores and dotes on. Another thread of the story deals with the young boy Pancratius, a pious Christian and son of a martyr, who is himself preparing for martyrdom. Pancratius' nemesis is Corvinus, a bullying schoolmate who is irritated by the young Christian's saintliness. He does everything to bring him and the Christian community of the catacombs of Rome down. This includes the orchestrating of the lynching of their former teacher Cassianus, who is secretly Christian. Yet Pancratius shows his enemy the meaning of Christian forgiveness when he saves his life shortly after Corvinus had Cassianus killed. Another major villain in the story is the enigmatic Fulvius, an apparently rich young man from the East who soon reveals himself to be a hunter of Christians who turns them in to the authorities for money. His aim on the one hand is to gain the hand of either Fabiola or Agnes, and on the other hand, to uproot the Christian community in Rome.

When I open and realised it was an opportunity to ask you a  question, I though long and hard about it. The reasons being is that most of the little people in a company  of this size never really get their voices heard on any issue,  and being a contractor make it even harder  so why would this be any different. Another concern was,  will a person like yourself really have time in your  busy schedule to read and answer every e-mail, phone call all or written correspondence he receives from an employee. But Mr Skilling I am taking the chance that you yourself  can hear this voice . My question to you this morning is very important to me and I am quite sure to many others like myself. I would like to know  why is it that Enron spend so much money, training and time on contractors like myself, only to turn around and hire someone else to do the same job that the contractors are doing already. Wouldn't it be easier  and cheaper to offer the job to the contractor, or just give them the opportunity to accept or decline the offer.? Mr. Skilling I think that  Enron is a great company to work for because of all the information, that I have learned in my eight months of employment. But like most company their is always room for improvements. Also Mr. Skilling this is not a pitch for employment, it just a question of concern. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Like all surgical procedures, breast augmentation carries risks. Some are severe, while some less so, but it is important to know what risks you are taking, for bigger boobs:  Nerve damage in the breast may cause numbness in the nipples or breast tissue; an inability to feel anything. These effects can be permanent. Complications with future mammography. Breast implants make breast-cancer screening more difficult and demand an x-ray technician experienced in working with implants. Your doctor may also require additional tests with each checkup including an ultrasound and an MRI. Do not forget, these procedures are the result of cosmetic surgery, unlikely to be covered by insurance.  Your scars will be firm and pink for at least six weeks. They may remain the same size for several months, or even appear to widen. After several months, your scars will begin to fade, though they will never disappear completely. Capsular contracture refers to a painful complication in which scar tissue hardens around the implant and squeezes, which can result in shape changes in the breasts, breasts that are hard to the touch, and pain. Additional surgery is required to deal with capsular contracture. Some women suffer severe infections one to two weeks after surgery. In rare cases, the implant will have to be surgically removed. You may experience excessive bleeding following the surgery, along with swelling and pain. Again, additional operations will be needed if this happens. Implants can break or leak. Beyond factory defects, many things can cause the implants to break and leak inside your body. These activities include exercise, injury and even normal day-to-day movement. Ruptured implants are a controversial topic and more can be written about the subject. In general, what happens when an implant breaks depends on the kind of implant:  If a saline-filled implant breaks, the implant will deflate in a few hours and the salt water will be absorbed and naturally expelled by the body. If a silicone-gel filled implant leak or break, the elastic silicone gel may remain within the implant shell, or may escape into the breast. A leaking silicone gel implant may not be noticeable except through expensive tests like an MRI. Thus women with silicone breast implants are advised to visit with their plastic surgeon every year, to make sure they are still functioning properly.   Your new breasts may be slightly different from one another, potentially in both size and shape. Engage in your regular day to day activities. Routine activity or injury can cause damage, resulting in the implants leaking or breaking. Additional surgery will be necessary to remove the implant or replace it. There is no evidence that implants change your ability to nurse an infant, or change anything about your pregnancy. It is possible, however, that the pregnancy will alter your body enough that the implants will have to be replaced for aesthetic reasons. Summary:","output":"Breast augmentation is a surgery to make boobs bigger, but it has risks. Sometimes it can cause numbness or trouble feeling in the breast area. It can be harder to check for breast cancer and may need extra tests which insurance might not cover. There will be scars for a while, and sometimes the body can get a painful problem around the implant needing more surgery. Infections and bleeding can also happen, which might need more operations. Implants can break or leak inside the body, and it's important to check them regularly. The new breasts might look slightly different, but implants shouldn't change nursing a baby or pregnancy, though some changes might need new implants for looks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Twenty years later, Flynt (Woody Harrelson) and his younger brother, Jimmy (Brett Harrelson) run the Hustler Go-Go club in Cincinnati. With profits down, Flynt decides to publish a newsletter for the club, the first Hustler magazine, with nude pictures of women working at the club. The newsletter soon becomes a full-fledged magazine, but sales are weak. In 1975, after Hustler publishes nude pictures of former first lady Jackie Kennedy Onassis, sales take off.Flynt becomes smitten with Althea Leasure (Courtney Love), a stripper who works at one of his clubs. With Althea and Jimmy's help, Flynt makes a fortune from sales of Hustler. With his success comes enemies - as he finds himself a hated figure of anti-pornography activists. He argues with the activists, saying that \\"murder is illegal, but if you take a picture of it you may get your name in a magazine or maybe win a Pulitzer Prize\\". \\"However\\", he continues, \\"sex is legal, but if you take a picture of that act, you can go to jail\\". He becomes involved in several prominent court cases, and befriends a young lawyer, Alan Isaacman (Edward Norton). In 1975, Flynt loses a smut-peddling court decision in Cincinnati but is released from jail soon afterwards on a technicality. Ruth Carter Stapleton (Hanover), a Christian activist and sister of President Jimmy Carter, seeks out Flynt and urges him to give his life to Jesus. Flynt seems moved and starts letting his newfound religion influence everything in his life, including Hustler content.In 1978, during another trial in Georgia, Flynt and Isaacman are both shot by a man with a rifle while they walk outside a courthouse. Isaacman recovers, but Flynt is paralyzed from the waist down and uses a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Wishing he was dead, Flynt renounces God.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Makes water acidic - Kills fish - Kills the soils in trees - Leaves are also harmed. Answer:","output":"The missing first step in this process is the release of pollutants into the air, particularly sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are the primary agents responsible for the formation of acid rain. The process can be detailed as follows: 1. Release of pollutants: The burning of fossil fuels, like coal, oil, and gasoline, as well as other industrial processes, can release large amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere. These pollutants are mainly emitted by power plants, factories, and vehicles. 2. Makes water acidic: Once in the atmosphere, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides can react with water, oxygen, and other substances to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). These acids then mix with rain, snow, fog, or hail, creating acid rain, which has a pH level lower than normal rainwater. 3. Kills fish: Acid rain can lead to the acidification of rivers, lakes, and ponds, causing harm to aquatic life. When the pH levels in these bodies of water become too low, it can be toxic for fish and other aquatic organisms. In addition to direct harm, acidification can also cause a chain reaction in the ecosystem, disrupting delicate food webs. For example, it can kill smaller organisms that serve as food for fish, ultimately impairing their survival. 4. Kills the soils in trees: Acid rain can also have harmful effects on terrestrial ecosystems, particularly in forests. It can leach essential nutrients, like calcium and magnesium, from the soil, making it less fertile. Additionally, acid rain can release aluminum from the soil, which can be toxic for trees and plants. This can result in weak root systems and reduced ability to absorb nutrients and water, leading to stunted growth, decay, or even death. 5. Leaves are also harmed: Furthermore, acid rain can cause direct harm to the foliage of trees and plants by breaking down the protective waxy coating on leaves. Once this coating is damaged, the leaves become more vulnerable to infections, diseases, and other stresses. The loss of foliage can lead to reduced photosynthesis, limiting the plant's ability to produce energy and making it more susceptible to harm from temperature fluctuations and other environmental factors. Overall, the missing first step in the process, the release of pollutants into the air, is crucial for understanding the cascade of negative impacts associated with acid rain, which affects both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Implementing strategies to reduce the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, as well as promoting the use of cleaner energy sources, can play a significant role in mitigating the detrimental effects of acid rain on the environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"Town seal (matrix) of N√°chod from 1570\\" be a reasonable answer?","output":"In the 1800s, letters were sealed in various ways to ensure their confidentiality and prevent tampering. The \\"Town seal (matrix) of N√°chod from 1570\\" is not a reasonable answer for this specific question, as it refers to a specific town seal from a much earlier time period. However, seals and wax were used extensively during the 1800s for sealing letters. Here is a detailed explanation of the methods used to seal letters during the 1800s: 1. Wax Seals: Wax seals were the most common method for sealing letters. Sealing wax was melted using a wax stick, which often had a wick running through it like a candle, or by holding a small piece of wax over a flame from a candle or lamp. The melted wax was then dripped onto the folded paper or envelope, and a metal seal or stamp, known as a seal matrix or signet, was pressed into the soft wax to create an impression. This method ensured that the letter was securely closed and could only be opened by breaking the wax seal. Wax seals could feature initials, family crests, or other personal symbols, indicating the sender and verifying the letter's authenticity. 2. Wafer Seals: Wafer seals were another option for securing letters and were made from a thin, adhesive material resembling a modern stamp. Wafers, usually composed of a mixture of gum arabic, flour, and water, were moistened and placed between the folded paper or envelope flaps. Pressure was then applied, either by hand or using a sealing device, to bond the paper together. Similar to wax seals, wafer seals could have impressions or simple designs on their surface. 3. Embossed Seals: In addition to wax and wafer seals, embossing was occasionally used to secure letters. This method involved placing the folded paper or envelope between two dies or plates with raised designs. When pressure was applied, the designs were impressed upon the paper, creating a seal that joined the two surfaces together. Like wax seals, embossed seals could serve as a mark of authenticity or personal identity. 4. Adhesive Envelopes: By the mid-1800s, the invention and wide distribution of adhesive envelopes made sealing letters more convenient. These envelopes often included a strip of adhesive gum on the flap that could be moistened and pressed closed, sealing the letter inside. 5. Postal Seals: Finally, it's important to mention postal seals, which were employed by postal authorities to verify and secure official correspondence. Postal seals could be made of wax, wafers, or embossed paper, much like personal seals, but they usually featured designs or inscriptions unique to the postal service. In conclusion, while the \\"Town seal (matrix) of N√°chod from 1570\\" is not a direct answer to how letters were sealed in the 1800s, it could be considered a precursor to many of the sealing methods used during that time period. The 1800s saw the use of wax seals, wafer seals, embossed seals, adhesive envelopes, and postal seals to secure and authenticate written correspondence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, each sentence demonstrates a different context and tense in which the action of giving is taking place. In the first sentence, \\"What will you give her for her birthday?\\", the word \\"give\\" is used in its simple future tense, meaning the action of giving will occur sometime in the future. The context here is a birthday celebration and involves contemplating or deciding on a suitable gift or present for the person in question. The usage of \\"give\\" signifies that the gift is intended as a thoughtful and heartfelt gesture to celebrate the individual's special day. On the other hand, in the second sentence, \\"She gave a pair of shoes to her husband for their anniversary\\", the word \\"give\\" is used in its simple past tense form, \\"gave.\\" This indicates that the action of giving has already taken place in the past. The context in this instance is an anniversary celebration, and the focus is on a particular gift, the pair of shoes, being given as a token of love, appreciation or commitment between the wife and her husband. In summary, while the word \\"give\\" retains the same core meaning in both sentences, the context, tense, and circumstances in which the act of giving occurs differs.

Mutations are natural. Some mutations are harmful. In this case, the organism may not live to reproduce. The trait will not be passed onto offspring. Others variations in traits have no effect on survival. Can some mutations be good for a living thing? Other mutations can have great benefits. Imagine being the first moth that can blend into its background. It would have a better chance of survival. A living thing that survives is likely to have offspring. If it does, it may pass the new trait on to its offspring. Thats good news for the offspring. The offspring may be more likely to survive.

Hess, says that a long summer vacation doesn't make sense in today's world. This summer, 50 million kids will spend much time talking online, watching TV, playing video games and asking older brothers or sisters to take them to the supermarket. They will also be putting their academic futures at risk. During much of the 20th century, many Americans worked in factories that did not need a college degree but still offered a high salary. Also, in the 19th century, there was no air condition. And poor hygiene   meant that crowded schools had health risks. Things have changed. For today's students, academic skills are key to future success. Many countries don't give kids an American-style summer vacation. They offer no more than seven consecutive   weeks of vacation. Most American school districts offer up to 13 weeks. To compete in global marketplace, Americans must be prepared to go up against international competitors. Summer vacation also causes challenges for today's families. In the 1960s, more than 60% of families had a stay-at-home mum. Now, two-thirds of American children live families where every adult works. For these families, summer vacation can be more burden than break. Someone must watch the kids. But the biggest problem may be how summer vacation hurts academic achievement. Scientist have found that disadvantaged students lose important ground in the summertime. A school year can allow time-limited teachers to conduct richer and more imaginative lessons. Schools would have more time for sports, languages, music and the arts. Question: According to the text, who will benefit from a long school year? Answer: Answer:","output":"According to the text, both students and families would benefit from a longer school year. Students would benefit academically, as a longer school year allows time-limited teachers to conduct richer and more imaginative lessons, and schools would have more time for sports, languages, music, and the arts. Disadvantaged students, in particular, would benefit as they tend to lose important ground during the summer months. Families would also benefit, especially those where every adult works, as the long summer vacation can be more of a burden than a break, requiring arrangements for childcare and supervision. Furthermore, a longer school year would better prepare American students to compete in the global marketplace against international competitors who typically have shorter summer vacations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The second effect mentioned is the risk of animals dying from smoke inhalation. In this scenario, since no fire occurs, animals would not be exposed to smoke and therefore would face no risk of dying from smoke inhalation. The supposed perturbation, which refers to the prevention of a forest fire, would have a significant positive effect on this second outcome, reducing the chance of smoke inhalation deaths to effectively zero.

The kids suddenly turn against everything around them and trash the apartment to complete annihilation. The kids are called \\"Destruction Incorporated\\", a bunch of self-imposed derelicts who terrorize a sleepy Florida town. They are led by the near-psychotic Dexter, his pal Denny, Denny's girlfriend Bitsy, and their friend Lummox. Their reason for forming this so-called \\"destruction crew\\" is as Dexter states: \\"just for the hell of it.\\" Dexter, Denny, Bitsy, and Lummox stop at a local neighborhood bar for a few drinks when the bartender becomes irritated with their shenanigans and orders them to be quiet to which they respond by beating up the owner. Afterwards, Dexter and a few of the Destruction crew pile into Dexter's 1967 white Mustang car and drive around town terrorizing and harassing the locals. One teenybopper steals a lady's newspaper and sets fire to it. A man is splashed painted when a few other youths throw paint at him. Also, a police officer is contemptuously taunted. At a corner coffee shop, the overly zealous teens engage in a bloody fist fight with another teenager, named Doug, who used to know Dexter and was part of his gang before walking away years ago. As result of the rumble, the group begins to trash the place. The proprietor threatens to call the police, but is cut short when one of the teenyboppers punches him in the face.

Article: Below are some tips for women traveling alone.  Exercise hotel safety There are many ways you can make a solo stay at a hotel safer. At cheek-in, you might consider asking for a room near the elevator so you won't need to walk down long, potentially ill-lit hallways to reach your room. When filling out guest registration forms, consider using your first initial instead of your name, and skip the\\" Mrs/Miss/Mr\\" check box. Additionally, make sure the clerk writes down your room number instead of saying it out loud. This will prevent anyone nearby from knowing where to find you later. Arrive during the day Arrive in new cities during the day. Areas around bus and train stations can be scary and/ojr deserted, and small towns tend to shut down early. Veteran solo traveler Mara Rothman of San Francisco notes that plenty of beautiful towns can appear mysterious at night, and locals who are genuinely trying to help you can appear unnecessarily threatening. Arriving during the day means you'll be able to find a place to stay and get to know where you are before dark. Keep your documents safe  If you choose to wear a money belt, use it for storage and not as a purse. Constantly reaching under your shirt for money draws attention to it, and tends to defeat the purpose. Instead,keep your passport, extra stores of money, and other important documents well hidden, and use a bag or purse for carrying daily spending money. Dress appropriately To avoid attracting unwanted attention, dress as conservatively as the women you see around you. This doesn't necessarily mean wearing the traditional dress, as that can sometimes have the opposite result. A good rule of thumb is to dress modestly. Think knee-length or longer skirts. Bare arms, shoulders, and legs are considered risked in some countries, so do the research before you go and once you're there. Note which body parts the local women cover and do the same.

This ambitious project has the potential to transform educational practices and generate numerous benefits for the students, teachers, and the community alike.  In a recent development, plans for this new institution have been backed \\"in principle,\\" meaning that the basis for implementing the concept has received initial support. Stakeholders have recognized the potential advantages this innovative approach could bring. This article delves into the proposed \\"all-through\\" super-school, its potential impact, and the next steps needed to make this vision a reality. The \\"All-Through\\" Super-School: A Holistic Approach to Learning An \\"all-through\\" super-school represents a unique and innovative educational concept. The principle behind this idea is to create a fluid, continuous learning experience for pupils between the ages of three and 19. The super-school will effectively replace eight existing schools, merging resources, staff, and students into one cohesive institution. By facilitating age-integrated and interdisciplinary learning experiences, the super-school eliminates traditional barriers and fosters greater collaboration between students of different ages and teachers of various specializations. This model could also promote a smoother transition between the various levels of education, as students progress from early years' learning to primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Potential Impact on Students, Teachers, and the Community There are several benefits that could arise from the implementation of an \\"all-through\\" super-school in the Tregaron area. 1. Enhanced Learning Environment: Combining resources and expertise from multiple schools will likely result in a well-rounded, comprehensive educational experience for students. They would have access to a range of high-quality faculties, facilities, and educational opportunities that may not have been available in smaller, separate institutions. 2. Improved Collaboration: Teachers and staff members would have the opportunity to collaborate on a larger scale, sharing best practices, resources, and ideas to create a more effective and cohesive curriculum. Furthermore, students would learn from a diverse group of teachers, acquiring different perspectives and knowledge to develop a well-rounded skill set. 3. Efficient Use of Resources: Consolidating resources from eight schools would lead to more efficient use of infrastructure, finances, and staffing. Funds previously allocated to separate institutions could be combined and used to improve resources and facilities, ultimately delivering better education and support for all involved. 4. Stronger Sense of Community: An \\"all-through\\" super-school could foster a stronger sense of community and shared identity for students, staff, and parents alike. With a larger, more diverse group of individuals involved, there would be increased opportunities for extracurricular activities, collaborations, and community events that bring people together. Next Steps With the plans backed \\"in principle,\\" the next move would be to explore the necessary steps to finalize the proposal and secure funding for the project. In-depth consultations will likely take place with stakeholders, including parents, teachers, students, and local authorities. These consultations will aim to address concerns, gather feedback, and refine the proposal to ultimately benefit all parties involved. Additionally, research into similar successful \\"all-through\\" super-schools, both nationally and internationally, will help to inform the development of the Tregaron area's unique institution. Ultimately, the goal is to create a blueprint for a state-of-the-art educational facility that meets the needs and aspirations of the local community. Conclusion The proposed \\"all-through\\" super-school in the Tregaron area presents an exciting opportunity to reimagine traditional educational practices. By uniting eight existing schools into one, the project could lead to increased collaboration, resource efficiency, and a cohesive learning environment for students and staff alike. While the plans have been backed \\"in principle,\\" further consultation, research, and planning will be crucial in bringing this visionary educational model to life."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction. Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can. While answering think step-by-step and justify your answer. In this task you are given an anecdote, which recount a complex ethical situation. The question you are given is, has the author of the anecdote acted ethically? answer this question with \\"RIGHT\\" or \\"WRONG\\". My friend and two of my friend's friends are going camping.  They usually rent an RV but can't afford one this year so they're driving and bringing tents.  They have invited me. I'm totally down to go, but I really want to rent an RV (which I can afford, but it would be a splurge) because there's no way I'll be able to comfortably sleep in a tent and I hate sharing public showers. I have a bad back and difficulty adjusting to unfamiliar sounds at night so a white noise machine in an RV is a must. I also can't fall asleep in the same room as anyone I'm not close to, and I'm not close to this group but they are truly lovely people. AITA if I don't offer to share the RV with them, even if it's big enough to?  They are lovely people but they are slobs about their living environment and I don't want them making the RV gross (tracking mud/sand/whatever in etc) or costing me a deposit.  Should I just skip this trip?  I'm imagining possibly being hit up for refrigerator space, showers, and sleeping spots (especially if it's a bigger/nicer RV and/or if the weather goes south) and I'm just super uncomfortable with the idea.","output":"To determine if the author of the anecdote has acted ethically, let's consider some key aspects: 1. The author has a legitimate reason for wanting an RV, as they have a bad back and difficulty sleeping in new environments. 2. The friends have not expressed an expectation for the author to share the RV if they rent it. 3. The friends are aware of their own budget limitations and have decided on bringing tents instead. 4. The author is concerned about the cleanliness and possible damage to the RV caused by sharing it with friends. Considering these points, it seems that the author has a valid reason to rent an RV for their comfort and well-being. The author's friends have not set an expectation for the author to share the RV. Furthermore, the author is concerned about potential issues arising from sharing it with others. In this situation, the author can opt not to share the RV with their friends and still act ethically. The author's reasons for not sharing are based on personal needs and concerns. However, it is advised that the author communicate their reasons to their friends so that there are no misunderstandings. So, the author's decision to not share the RV is ethically RIGHT as long as they communicate their reasons to their friends."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

(CNN) -- Sevilla have sacked coach Manolo Jimenez after their disappointing home draw to bottom-club Xerez on Tuesday extended the club's winless run to seven games. Despite lying fifth in the Spanish Primera Liga table, Sevilla were knocked out of the lucrative European Champions League by Russian side CSKA Moscow last week. Jimenez had also secured a Copa del Rey final against Atletico Madrid but it wasn't enough to save the 46-year-old's job. The club's sporting director Ramon Rodriguez admitted the decision had been difficult but said he had \\"done what I had to.\\" He told the club's official Web site: \\"It was an unavoidable situation and we had to find a solution, and the pain that it brings. \\"Tuesday was the end of the story but the decision comes from the image and dynamics of the team. Without doubt we are grateful to Manolo. He is an excellent professional, he has made all this possible and impossible.

We are fighting for important things.\\" Xerez's injury-time equaliser on Tuesday meant Sevilla's last league success was against Real Mallorca back in February. Ironically, it is Mallorca who occupy the much-coveted fourth spot in the table that guarantees Champions League football next season.

Imagine you have a favorite pond where you love to swim, but one day you go there and see that there's much less water than before. This could be because of a drought. During a drought, plants get very thirsty because they don't get enough water to drink. This makes it hard for them to grow and stay healthy, so sometimes they turn brown and dry. Animals, like your pets and birds, also get thirsty and have a harder time finding water to drink. This can make it difficult for them to survive. People also need water to drink, cook, and clean, so when there is less water, we might have to be more careful with how much we use. We might need to take shorter showers or water our gardens less. Droughts can happen when it's very hot and sunny and there's not enough rain. It's important for all of us to help take care of our environment and save water where we can, so there is enough for everyone and everything to share."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: If you‚Äôve ever seen travel photos of Venice or been to Venice yourself, you‚Äôre probably familiar with the Rialto Bridge. The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the ‚Äúeighth wonder of the world.‚Äù The version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there‚Äôs been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice‚Äôs major waterway. The Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge. Beginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge‚Äôs construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge. Andrea Palladio‚Äôs design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte‚Äôs. Question: Andrea believes that: Options: - grand canal issues - Bridge issue - not enough information - waterway issue Answer:","output":"Andrea believes that there are bridge issues, specifically related to creating a design that could accommodate larger boats passing underneath while also addressing the other limitations mentioned (sloped shores, having shops atop the bridge).

Washington was born in a black slave family in Virginia of the USA in 1856, seven years before slavery was abolished   by Abraham Lincoln in January, 1863. He wrote a book about his life called Up From Slavery, which was published in 1901. In the book, he said that he had no choice but to work in a coal mine when he was 16 years old. He had no chance to go to school. He heard two coal miners talking about a school for black children which was called the Hampton Institute. He determined that he would go there. He gave up his job and told other members of his race that he was going to school across the state. The older people had spent their best years as slaves and were poor. However, some gave Booker some pocket money or a handkerchief. Hardly had anyone expected any of their race to leave home to attend a boarding school. He took a train to Richmond, Virginia, where he ran out of money. It was 82 miles from the Hampton Institute. He slept under a wooden sidewalk . He helped unload pigs and iron from a ship for some money and when he had enough, he continued his journey, arriving at school with 50 cents. This diligence  pushed him to graduate and become a teacher at the Hampton Institute. When he was 25 years old, he was asked to start a new school for black children in Alabama. called the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute.

Although  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

They get their name (sea robin) from the orange ventral surface of the species in the Western Atlantic (\\"Prionotus carolinus\\") and from large pectoral fins, which, when swimming, open and close like a bird's wings in flight. The large surface area of the fins also permits the fish to glide short distances above the water surface, much like a flying fish.  - The scaly gurnard , Lepidotrigla brachyoptera , is a searobin of the family Triglidae , found around New Zealand including the Kermadec Islands , at depths of between 35 and 300 m. Its length is up to 15 cm.  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu.  - The Exocoetidae are a family of marine fish in the order Beloniformes class Actinopterygii. Fish of this family are known as flying fish. About 64 species are grouped in seven to nine genera. Flying fish can make powerful, self-propelled leaps out of water into air, where their long, wing-like fins enable gliding flight for considerable distances above the water's surface. This uncommon ability is a natural defense mechanism to evade predators.  - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.  - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \\"Southern Alps\\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it.

After a year of intense deliberation and research, the American Government made a tough decision. As the President eyed the generals and scientists huddled around the table, he commanded gravely, \\"Due to unforeseen consequences and the scale of risk involved, I hereby authorize you to discontinue any further tests concerning Operation C.H.U.D., effective immediately.\\" This action set as Fact 1: US Government has ordered the branch of US Military to stop all proceedings regarding the highly confidential and dangerous C.H.U.D. project. Operation C.H.U.D., short for Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers, was a top-secret project conducted in the bowels of the Pentagon. In this project, the Pentagon's bio-research unit had stumbled upon enzymes taken from monstrous, genetically mutated creatures dwelling in the city's sewer system. Astonishingly, these enzymes, when injected into trained soldiers, transformed them into killing machines, vastly more effective and resilient than ordinary men. This was the basis of Fact 2: enzymes taken from sewer-dwelling creatures from C.H.U.D. make hyper-effective killing machines in the army. Despite the government's shutdown, an unforeseen factor played into the mix. Bud Oliver, a codename assigned to the last remaining specimen of the C.H.U.D. project, was being kept classified from even the highest levels of government. The elusive Bud Oliver was carefully hidden away in the cellar of the Center for Disease Control office situated in a small American town.

One day, a lively trio of bungling local teenagers broke into the CDC, hoping to uncover the secrets rumored to be contained within the drab-looking building. They stumbled upon the hidden lab and, to their shock, laid eyes on Bud Oliver. A brash decision led them to free Bud, who they perceived as a fellow victim of the government‚Äôs machinations, unaware of the potential disaster they were setting in motion. This revealed Fact 4: a trio of bungling teenagers from the same small American town steal Bud from the CDC facility, setting into motion what might be an unfathomable disaster. However, the spirited, genetically enhanced Bud had other plans. While his liberators intended to get him to safety, Bud slipped away into the labyrinth of sewerage and tunnels. Now loose in the city, he remembered the vile experiments and the strength they granted him. Filled with newfound vengeance, he decided to take matters into his hands. He sought refuge in the sewers and started using the leftover enzymes to create what would serve as his vengeance upon those who had made him a monster. This forms Fact 5: Bud escapes to forge an army of C.H.U.D.s, threatening not only the security of the small town but potentially of the entire nation. Thus unfolds the tale of doomed ambition, adolescent recklessness, and a monstrous uprising. The small American town transformed into a suspenseful battlefield overnight, setting the stage for an epic clash between the human race and the horror that lurked beneath. The shocking sequence of events unprecedentedly unleashed by the C.H.U.D. project turned an ordinary town into the crucible for all-out warfare of survival."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: The first scientific and literary journals were established during the Enlightenment.  A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Pick from: [1]. yes. [2]. no.","output":"[2]. no. The first scientific and literary journal appeared in the year 1665. Known as Journal des s√ßavans, it was published in France by Denis de Sallo. The journal was established to keep readers informed about recently published books, scholarly debates, and various opinions spanning across diverse topics from scientific discoveries to legal issues. Journal des s√ßavans marks a significant milestone in the history of media, as it paved the way for future scholarly works to be published and disseminated among the academic community, as well as the public. The format facilitated communication among scholars and enabled the sharing of their work within the broader scientific community, thereby fueling collaboration, discussion, and further exploration. Shortly after the Journal des s√ßavans made its debut, another significant periodical emerged in London. In 1665, the Royal Society began publishing Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, the world's first and longest-running scientific publication. Edited by Henry Oldenburg, an influential scientific figure of the time, the journal aimed to foster communication among scientists, detailing experiments, observations, and discourses across various disciplines. These early scientific and literary journals laid the groundwork for the modern scientific literature landscape that exists today. They enabled scholars to build upon the work of their predecessors, fostering intellectual growth within various disciplines. The establishment of these journals contributed significantly to the progress of scientific knowledge and understanding during the Enlightenment period and beyond.

Use evidence from the fact that boiling is when liquids are heated above their boiling point to answer this question: \\"What happens when hexane's temperature goes above 70 degrees celsius?\\"","output":"When the temperature of hexane, a hydrocarbon with the chemical formula C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÑ, goes above 70 degrees Celsius, it starts to boil. To understand why this occurs and what exactly happens during boiling, let us look at the evidence from the boiling phenomenon that we observe in liquids when they are exposed to heat. Boiling is a process where a liquid's molecules gain enough thermal energy to overcome the attractive forces holding them in the liquid state, and they eventually transition into a gaseous state. This change typically occurs when the liquid reaches a specific temperature known as its boiling point. Hexane has a boiling point of approximately 69 degrees Celsius (156.2 degrees Fahrenheit). Therefore, when hexane reaches 70 degrees Celsius, it has exceeded its boiling point, and we can expect the following events to take place: 1. Absorption of heat energy: As the hexane's temperature increases, the thermal energy of its molecules increases. This added energy allows the hexane molecules to become more active and move more freely. 2. Formation of vapor bubbles: When hexane reaches its boiling point, its vapor pressure equals the surrounding atmospheric pressure. This balance of forces enables vapor bubbles to begin forming within the liquid. As a result, the hexane molecules convert from the liquid phase to the gaseous phase, leading to vapor bubble formation. 3. Rising vapor bubbles: The vapor bubbles formed in the liquid rise towards the surface of the hexane due to their lower density compared to the surrounding liquid. As these vapor bubbles rise, the gaseous hexane molecules continue to absorb energy from the heat source, further promoting the boiling process. 4. Breaking of vapor bubbles: Upon reaching the surface of the liquid, the vapor bubbles break, and the gaseous hexane molecules escape into the atmosphere. This release of energy results in the distinctive boiling sound that we often associate with boiling liquids. 5. Evaporation and mass loss: As the hexane molecules are released into the atmosphere, they evaporate and cause a mass loss from the initial liquid hexane state. If the heat source continues to expose the remaining hexane to temperatures above 70 degrees Celsius, the boiling process will continue, gradually reducing the overall amount of hexane in the container until all of it has evaporated. In conclusion, when hexane's temperature reaches and exceeds 70 degrees Celsius, it begins to boil. The boiling process allows the hexane's molecules to absorb heat energy, form vapor bubbles, rise to the surface, break, and be released as gas in the atmosphere. This transition from a liquid to a gaseous state results in the evaporation of hexane and a corresponding mass loss."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The system's launch represented not only a new product, but also a reframing of the severely damaged home video game market segment as a whole. The video game market crash of 1983 had occurred in significant part due to a lack of consumer and retailer confidence in video games, which had in turn been due partially to confusion and misrepresentation in the marketing of video games. Prior to the NES, the packaging of many video games presented bombastic artwork which exaggerated the graphics of the actual game. In terms of product identity, a single game such as Pac-Man would appear in many versions on many different game consoles and computers, with large variations in graphics, sound, and general quality between the versions.

Q:Ann decided to candy half of the fruit he received as a gift. She kept the other half to eat fresh and do juicing. She candied ginger, plums pears, and she didn't candy apples, oranges apricots and bananas.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which fruit contains more crystallized sugar, plums or apricots?  Hint: Sugaring is a food preservation method similar to pickling. Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.  The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.  A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant. A:","output":"Plums contain more crystallized sugar than apricots.  To answer this question, we need to look at the information provided in the paragraph. Ann decided to candy half of the fruit he received as a gift, which includes ginger, plums, and pears. She didn't candy apples, oranges, apricots, and bananas. Since sugaring is a process to preserve food by dehydrating and packing it with sugar, we need to focus on the fruits that were candied. Given that plums were candied and apricots were not, plums will contain more crystallized sugar than apricots."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The poem is considered one of the most famous examples of Romanticism in English poetry. A copy of the manuscript is a permanent exhibit at the British Museum in London.  - Romantic poetry is the poetry of the Romantic era, an artistic, literary, musical and intellectual movement that originated in Europe toward the end of the 18th century.

He wrote the poems \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" and \\"Kubla Khan\\", as well as the major prose work \\"Biographia Literaria\\". His critical work, especially on Shakespeare, was highly influential, and he helped introduce German idealist philosophy to English-speaking culture. Coleridge coined many familiar words and phrases, including suspension of disbelief. He was a major influence on Emerson and American transcendentalism.  - The term suspension of disbelief or willing suspension of disbelief has been defined as a willingness to suspend one's critical faculties and believe the unbelievable; sacrifice of realism and logic for the sake of enjoyment. The term was coined in 1817 by the poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who suggested that if a writer could infuse a \\"human interest and a semblance of truth\\" into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgement concerning the implausibility of the narrative. Suspension of disbelief often applies to fictional works of the action, comedy, fantasy, and horror genres.

His religious sentiment and association with John Newton ( who wrote the hymn \`\` Amazing Grace '' ) led to much of the poetry for which he is best remembered . His poem \`\` Light Shining out of Darkness '' gave English the phrase : \`\` God moves in a mysterious way / His wonders to perform .

These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or‚Äîin some cases‚Äîfor several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.\\"?","output":"Question: According to the passage, what are some reasons for extra-pair copulation among socially monogamous bird species, and what mechanisms are in place to facilitate this behavior?

Article: A team of British surgeons has carried out Gaza's first organ transplants for a long-term plan to train local medical staff to perform the operations. Two patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital. Ziad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. \\"We were desperate,\\" said Matouk. The UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. \\"We are very satisfied with the results,\\" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital. Skaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow. The Shifa is working with the Gaza ministry of health on a plan to train its doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and laboratory technicians... Question: What is the beginning of the cooperation between the Royal Liverpool hospital and Gaza? Answer: Answer:","output":"The beginning of the cooperation between the Royal Liverpool Hospital and Gaza started about a year ago when Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool Hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa Hospital in Gaza. The anaesthetist outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis due to unreliable power supply, difficulty in importing spare parts for their aging dialysis machines, and often scarce supplies of consumables. To address these challenges and train local medical staff in performing organ transplants, a team from the Royal Liverpool Hospital, led by Dr. Hammad, made an exploratory trip to Gaza in April and subsequently carried out Gaza's first kidney transplants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Kunkuri is the coldest region in Nichghat during the summer and Pandrapat is the hottest region in Upper Ghat during winter .","output":"No, these two statements do not mean the same thing. In fact, they are complete opposites. Let's break down both statements to analyze the differences clearly: Statement 1: \\"Kunkuri is the hottest region in Nichghat during the summer and Pandrapat is the coldest region in Upper Ghat in the winter.\\" In this statement, the following information is given: 1. Kunkuri is the hottest region during the summer in Nichghat - This indicates that out of all the regions within the area of Nichghat, Kunkuri experiences the highest temperatures during the summer months.   2. Pandrapat is the coldest region in Upper Ghat during winter - This means that when compared to other regions in Upper Ghat, Pandrapat records the lowest temperatures during the winter months. Statement 2: \\"Kunkuri is the coldest region in Nichghat during the summer and Pandrapat is the hottest region in Upper Ghat during winter.\\" This statement provides the following information: 1. Kunkuri is the coldest region during the summer in Nichghat - Unlike the first statement, this indicates that Kunkuri has the lowest temperatures in Nichghat during the summer months, making it the coldest region within the area. 2. Pandrapat is the hottest region in Upper Ghat during winter - Contrary to the first statement, this suggests that out of all the regions in Upper Ghat, Pandrapat experiences the highest temperatures during the winter months. In conclusion, the two statements convey opposite meanings. The first statement implies that Kunkuri is very hot in the summer, while the second statement suggests it is quite cold during the same season. Likewise, the first statement portrays Pandrapat as a cold region in winter, while the second statement claims it is warmer in the same period."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here's a detailed explanation: 1. The outer layers that break away from the red giant create a shell-like expanding structure called a planetary nebula. This is a colorful and glowing cloud of ionized gas that continues to expand into space over time. The expelled outer layers contain elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and heavier elements, which are products of the nuclear fusion that took place within the red giant. The release of these elements contributes to the enrichment of the interstellar medium, which in turn fuels the formation of new stars. 2. As for the remaining core, it undergoes cooling and compression, eventually becoming a dense, compact object known as a white dwarf. A white dwarf no longer undergoes nuclear fusion, as the core temperatures and densities are insufficient to support any further fusion processes. Instead, it is supported against gravitational collapse mainly due to electron degeneracy pressure. 3. Over the course of millions to billions of years, the white dwarf will continue to radiate away its residual thermal energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation, thus gradually cooling down. This causes the white dwarf to slowly fade and lose its luminosity. 4. Eventually, the white dwarf will become so cold that it no longer emits significant amounts of radiation. At this point, it is referred to as a black dwarf. However, this stage is purely theoretical, as the timescales for a white dwarf to cool down to become a black dwarf are much longer than the current age of the universe (approximately 13.8 billion years). This means that no black dwarfs are expected to exist in the universe yet. To summarize, the last step in the process after a red giant loses its outer layers and only the inner core remains involves the formation of a white dwarf and a planetary nebula. The expelled layers enrich the interstellar medium, potentially contributing to the formation of new stars, while the white dwarf gradually cools down over an extensive period, eventually becoming a black dwarf in the far, distant future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Batman and Robin head back to Commissioner Gordon's office, where they deduce that the tip was a set-up by the United Underworld, a gathering of four of the most powerful villains in Gotham City (Joker, Penguin, Riddler, and Catwoman). The United Underworld equip themselves with a dehydrator that can turn humans into dust (an invention of Schmidlapp, who is unaware he has been kidnapped), a submarine made to resemble a penguin, and their three pirate henchmen (Bluebeard, Morgan and Quetch). It is revealed the yacht was really a projection. When The Dynamic Duo return to a buoy concealing a projector, they are trapped on the buoy by a magnet and targeted by torpedoes. They use a radio-detonator to destroy two of the missiles, and a porpoise sacrifices itself to intercept the last one. Catwoman, disguised as Soviet journalist \\"Miss Kitka\\", helps the group kidnap Bruce Wayne and pretends to be kidnapped with him, as part of a plot to lure Batman and finish him off with another of Penguin's explosive animals (not knowing that Wayne is Batman's alter-ego). After Wayne escapes captivity, Penguin disguises himself as the Commodore and schemes his way into the Batcave along with five dehydrated henchmen. This plan fails when the henchmen unexpectedly disappear into antimatter once struck: Penguin mistakenly rehydrated them with toxic heavy water, used to recharge the Batcave's atomic pile. Ultimately the Duo are unable to prevent the kidnapping of the dehydrated United World Organization's Security Council. Giving chase in the batboat to retrieve them (and Miss Kitka, presumed by the duo as still captive), Robin uses a sonic charge weapon to disable Penguin's...

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who Mrs. Hinckley threatens to evict?, using the article: After the end of World War II, Peter Kuban, a Hungarian displaced person and survivor of the Nazi concentration camps, stows away on a ship bound for New York City. However, he is spotted and held for the authorities. When they arrive, he claims that he qualifies for entry under an exception for those who helped Allied soldiers during the war, but all he knows about the paratrooper he hid from the enemy is that his name is Tom and he plays clarinet in a jazz band in New York City's Times Square.The immigration authorities led by Inspector Bailey say that without better documentation he must be sent back to Europe. He jumps off the ship, breaking some ribs, and starts searching for Tom. He encounters an unemployed ex-factory worker named Maggie Summers. When she steals a coat in a restaurant, Peter helps her elude the police. They go to her apartment, where she tends his injury as best she can and learns his story. When her landlady, Mrs. Hinckley, threatens to evict her for being behind on her rent, Peter gives her all the money he has. Eddie Hinckley, the landlady's  son, barges in and tries to get amorous with Maggie. Peter bursts out of hiding and starts fighting him, but gets the worst of it. Maggie knocks Eddie out with a chair and flees with Peter.  The Hinckleys notify the police. Meanwhile, Tom sees Peter's picture on the front page of a newspaper. He wants to go to the immigration department, but his girlfriend Nancy persuades him to attend an important audition instead. Tom impresses band leader Jack Teagarden, but leaves abruptly to try to help Peter., what would be the answer ?

Walking down the street while eating a snack: Some people might find it acceptable since you are not impeding anyone else's path, and you are taking care of your hunger needs without causing a scene. In fast-paced urban settings, this is often quite common. 2. Eating food at a park or open public area: In this scenario, eating in public is generally more accepted, as parks often have designated picnic areas, and it is understood that people will consume food and drinks in outdoor spaces. However, others might frown upon eating in public due to reasons like: 1. Cultural differences: In some cultures, it is inappropriate or considered rude to eat in public places, as it might be seen as a lack of manners or discipline. 2. The type of food being consumed: Some people might be sensitive to the smell or appearance of certain foods and might find it off-putting when someone is eating that food in public. 3.

Here are the steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. The like terms in this equation are the terms that involve the variable l, which are -69*l and 5*l. (-69 * l) + (5 * l)  = (- 69 + 5) * l = -64 * l So now our equation is: -64 * l = -704 Step 2: Isolate the variable l by dividing both sides by -64. To get l by itself, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -64: (-64 * l) / -64 = -704 / -64 This simplifies to: l = 11 So, the solution to the equation -69*l + 5*l = -704 is l = 11."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- Jo-Wilfried Tsonga ended Roger Federer's hopes of winning a record-equaling seventh Wimbledon title on Wednesday as the French 12th seed staged a stunning fightback to reach the semifinals. Federer appeared to be cruising into the last four after winning the first two sets, but Tsonga inflicted the Swiss world No. 3's first defeat from that vantage point in 179 grand slam matches. It was only the third time in the 29-year-old's glittering career that the 16-time grand slam champion had surrendered a two-set lead. Tsonga, ranked 19th in the world, triumphed 3-6 6-7 (3-7) 6-4 6-4 6-4 on Centre Court, serving out to love as he earned a clash with second seed Novak Djokovic. The Serbian, who beat Tsonga in the 2008 Australian Open final, ended the dream run of Australian 18-year-old Bernard Tomic. Tsonga defeated Federer for just the second time in six meetings, their first on grass. \\"It was amazing. I played unbelievable. It's never easy to come back against Roger.

Background: Tool is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California. Formed in 1990, the group's line-up includes drummer Danny Carey, guitarist Adam Jones, and vocalist Maynard James Keenan. Justin Chancellor has been the band's bassist since 1995, replacing their original bassist Paul D'Amour. Tool has won three Grammy Awards, performed worldwide tours, and produced albums topping the charts in several countries. Context: The following year, at a time when alternative rock and grunge was at its height, Tool released their first full-length album, Undertow (1993). It expressed more diverse dynamics than Opiate and included songs the band had chosen not to publish on their previous release, when they had opted for a heavier sound. The band began touring again as planned, with an exception in May 1993. Tool was scheduled to play at the Garden Pavilion in Hollywood but learned at the last minute that the venue belonged to L. Ron Hubbard's Church of Scientology, which was perceived as a clash with \\"the band's ethics about how a person should not follow a belief system that constricts their development as a human being.\\" Keenan \\"spent most of the show baa-ing like a sheep at the audience.\\"  Tool later played several concerts during the Lollapalooza festival tour, and were moved from the second stage to the main stage by their manager and the festival co-founder Ted Gardner. At the last concert of Lollapalooza in Tool's hometown Los Angeles, comedian Bill Hicks introduced the band. Hicks had become a friend of the band members and an influence on them after being mentioned in Undertow's liner notes. He jokingly asked the audience of 10,000 people to stand still and help him look for a lost contact lens. The boost in popularity gained from these concerts helped Undertow to be certified gold by the RIAA in September 1993 and to achieve platinum status in 1995, despite being sold with a censored album cover by distributors such as Wal-Mart. The single \\"Sober\\" became a hit single by March 1994 and won the band Billboard's \\"Best Video by a New Artist\\" award for the accompanying stop motion music video.  With the release of Tool's follow-up single \\"Prison Sex\\", the band again became the target of censorship. The song's lyrics and video dealt with child abuse, which sparked controversial reactions; Keenan's lyrics begin with: \\"It took so long to remember just what happened. I was so young and vestal then, you know it hurt me, but I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive ... I've got my hands bound and my head down and my eyes closed and my throat wide open.\\" The video was created primarily by guitarist Adam Jones, who saw it as his \\"surrealistic interpretation\\" of the subject matter. And while some contemporary journalists praised the video and described the lyrics as \\"metaphoric\\", the American branch of MuchMusic asked Keenan to represent the band in a hearing. It deemed the music video too graphic and obscene, and MTV stopped airing it after a few showings.  In September 1995, the band started writing and recording their second studio album. At that time Tool experienced its only lineup change to date, with bassist D'Amour leaving the band amicably to pursue other projects. Justin Chancellor, a member of former tourmates Peach, eventually replaced D'Amour, having been chosen over competitors such as Kyuss's Scott Reeder, Filter's Frank Cavanaugh, Pigmy Love Circus's E. Shepherd Stevenson, Jane's Addiction's Eric Avery and ZAUM's Marco Fox. Question: Were there any other singles from the album? Answer:","output":"Yes, there were other singles from Tool's album Undertow besides \\"Sober\\" and \\"Prison Sex.\\" The third single from the album was \\"Intolerance,\\" released in 1994. While it did not achieve the same level of commercial success as \\"Sober\\" and \\"Prison Sex,\\" \\"Intolerance\\" still contributed to the overall impact of the album and showcased the band's distinct sound and style at the time. The lyrics seem to address a person or group carrying a sense of self-righteousness, showcasing the band's propensity for deep thematic exploration. Undertow was a critical and commercial success, with the singles connecting with fans and critics alike. The band's blend of progressive and alternative metal, coupled with thoughtful, introspective lyrics, made the album a standout in the early 1990s music scene. Undertow's success helped cement Tool as a major force in the world of rock and paved the way for their future efforts, such as their highly acclaimed albums √Ünima (1996), Lateralus (2001), and 10,000 Days (2006)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

She has a fascination with panthers, but animals don't seem to like her very much. When Oliver brings her a Siamese kitten as a gift, for example, the cat hisses at Irena, so they return to the pet store and exchange it for a bird. While in the pet store, Irena's presence sets all the animals to caterwauling. Several weeks later, the bird dies in fear when Irena reaches for it in its cage.Irena is haunted by a tale from her country that tells how the people of her village were witches, devil worshippers, and, under strong emotions like jealousy or anger, could change into panthers. She refers to them as the 'cat people.' Oliver takes it as a folktale, but Irena takes it for real, so real that she refuses to sleep with her husband because she believes that she might kill him.Oliver suggests that Irena see a psychiatrist, so she goes to see Dr Louis Judd [Tom Conway], who was recommended to Oliver by his co-worker, Alice Moore [Jane Randolph].

The equation is: 0 = -3445*m - 489*m - 62944 First, let's combine the terms with m: 0 = (-3445 - 489) * m - 62944 Now, add 3445 and 489: 0 = -3934 * m - 62944 Now, we need to solve the equation for m. To do that, let's move the constant term (62944) to the other side of the equation by adding 62944 to both sides: 62944 = -3934 * m Now, to find the value of m, we will divide both sides of the equation by -3934: m = 62944 / -3934 Now, let's do the division: m = -16 So, the value of m that makes the equation equal to zero is -16."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency ‚Äì and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress ‚Äì which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . .  that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the ‚Äútop-of-mind‚Äù because everything that happens... Question: How long can someone multitask for before becoming stressed out?

What is the answer they should choose between \\"Runner\\" and \\"Office Worker\\"? Logic test: A person that is running will wind up sweating more in a normal day than an office worker because they are (A) exercising more (B) exercising less Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the logic test, the answer your students should choose between \\"Runner\\" and \\"Office Worker\\" is \\"Runner.\\" The logic test states that a person who is running will wind up sweating more in a normal day than an office worker. This is due to the fact that the runner is exercising more (Option A) as compared to the office worker who is exercising less (Option B).  To further understand the logic behind this answer, let's analyze both options in detail: Option A - Exercising More: A runner, by definition, is someone who engages in running as a form of exercise, sport, or hobby. Running is an aerobic activity that involves continuous, rhythmic movements of large muscle groups. This type of exercise increases heart rate, respiration, and circulation, causing the body to generate more internal heat. In order to maintain a safe internal temperature, the body produces sweat, which cools the body as it evaporates from the skin's surface. Runners generally spend a significant portion of their day training and exercising, which increases the likelihood of sweating more than an office worker. Option B - Exercising Less: An office worker, on the other hand, generally spends a majority of their day sitting at a desk or workstation, engaging in tasks that involve limited physical exertion. This sedentary lifestyle often involves less aerobic exercise and muscle movement, leading to a lower overall energy expenditure. Consequently, office workers typically generate less internal heat and have a reduced need for sweating to regulate body temperature. Based on this analysis, the logical conclusion is that a runner will indeed sweat more in a normal day than an office worker due to the greater level of physical exertion involved in their daily activities. As such, the answer your students should choose is \\"Runner,\\" which corresponds with Option A: exercising more."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

If you live near a water park, you might think about getting a season pass. This way you can go as often as you like. Check to see if there are any water parks around you. Many are indoor facilities. So even if it isn't warm enough where you live to swim outdoors, you can enjoy swimming in a temperature controlled area. The prices are usually good. For example, one ticket to Water World, a water park, is only 5. Some teens like to get a part time job over the summer to make some pocket money. Older teens shouldn't have much trouble finding jobs. An idea is to get some teens together to form your own summer job business. You can walk dogs, bring in the newspapers, feed the cats, collect rubbish, water flowers, etc. Being that it's summer, many people go on vacation and could use someone to look after their houses while they're away. You can also think about other jobs you can do for them. Teens love freedom. Sure you would like to get to such places as the small, movie theaters, the zoo, the beach, picnic, bowling and local amusement park instead of staying home all summer. Then a summer bus pass will be helpful. Check to see if your area has one for you teens. Such a pass costs only 10 for the whole summer.

What are the worst examples of false advertising you've seen? Did you fall prey to their claims? Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome. I still feel for her. I wish I had contact information, so I could touch base, and express those thoughts personally. But that's the most personally resonant version of false advertising affecting someone that I've seen. Question: What is probably true about R? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"R was likely a victim of false advertising and felt deceived by the \\"miracle cure\\" company's claims about their shoe inserts which promised weight loss.

To say the least he was annoying. He'd take the liberty to hide my backpack, borrow my books without consent, doodle scandalous stuff on my notebooks with a pen and yada yada. So one day, I was showing this cool trick I learned on an anatomy program on the TV to a couple of classmates who used to sit around me. The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed. And then, I saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes. Cool, What I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist. He without batting an eye, asked what I was doing, but then I started beating the desk with my other hand and made squeaking noises while pushing his hand against my throat harder with every turning head. And voil√†! Every one in the class (including the teacher) thought he was smothering me. After a few ifs and buts between him and the teacher, he was summoned at the principal‚Äôs chambers, from where, later he was sent home, where presumably judging from the look on his face for the next few days, he was beat to crap by his folks.

Context: When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. ‚ÄúIt is the key to self improvement!‚Äù, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don‚Äôt quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here‚Äôs the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let‚Äôs face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don‚Äôt share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: ‚ÄúI might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better‚Äù. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.

The local paper, Winterset Madisonian, reported on page 4 of the edition of May 30, 1907 that Wayne weighed 13 lbs. (around 6 kg.) at birth. His middle name was soon changed from Robert to Mitchell when his parents decided to name their next son Robert. Wayne's first color film was Shepherd of the Hills (1941), in which he co-starred with his longtime friend Harry Carey. The following year, he appeared in his only film directed by Cecil B. DeMille, the Technicolor epic Reap the Wild Wind (1942), in which he co-starred with Ray Milland and Paulette Goddard; it was one of the rare times he played a character with questionable values.  In 1949, director Robert Rossen offered the starring role of All the King's Men to Wayne. Wayne refused, believing the script to be un-American in many ways. Broderick Crawford, who eventually got the role, won the 1949 Oscar for best male actor, ironically beating out Wayne, who had been nominated for Sands of Iwo Jima.  He lost the leading role in The Gunfighter (1950) to Gregory Peck due to his refusal to work for Columbia Pictures because its chief, Harry Cohn, had mistreated him years before when he was a young contract player. Cohn had bought the project for Wayne, but Wayne's grudge was too deep, and Cohn sold the script to Twentieth Century Fox, which cast Peck in the role Wayne badly wanted but for which he refused to bend.  One of Wayne's most popular roles was in The High and the Mighty (1954), directed by William Wellman, and based on a novel by Ernest K. Gann. His portrayal of a heroic copilot won widespread acclaim. Wayne also portrayed aviators in Flying Tigers (1942), Flying Leathernecks (1951), Island in the Sky (1953), The Wings of Eagles (1957), and Jet Pilot (1957).  He appeared in nearly two dozen of John Ford's films over twenty years, including She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), The Quiet Man (1952), The Wings of Eagles (1957), and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962) with James Stewart: the first movie in which he called someone \\"Pilgrim\\". Ford's The Searchers (1956), is often considered to contain Wayne's finest and most complex performance. He named his youngest son Ethan after the character.

Teenager Alan Abernathy (Gregory Smith) signs off for a shipment of the toys at his family's toy store without his father's consent. He and delivery driver Joe activate the leaders for each group - Archer (Frank Langella) for the Gorgonites and Chip Hazard (Tommy Lee Jones) for the Commando Elite.

Answer:","output":"Yes, both Planter's Punch and Monkey Gland cocktails do contain grenadine. Grenadine is a sweet, red syrup made traditionally from pomegranate juice and sugar, often used in mixed drinks to add both flavor and color. Planter's Punch is a classic tropical cocktail made with a combination of dark rum, lime juice, pineapple juice, orange juice, simple syrup, and grenadine.

However, now it seems that smart. seals have caught on to the trick and are using it to their advantage to catch fish! To find out if that is true, a team of researchers from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland selected a group often young grey seals that had neither encountered the ocean nor been exposed to any kind of acoustic tags. The researchers then placed the seals one at a time, inside a pool that contained 20 foraging boxes, only two of which housed fish -- one with tags and the other without. Each seal was allowed to explore the boxes twenty separate times. In order to ensure that mammal was not depending on its memory, the fish were moved to different boxes each time. At first, there was no difference in the amount of time it took the seals to discover the tagged and untagged fish. However, after they had been in the pool a few times, they started locating the tagged fish much faster. To confirm that this indeed was the case, there searchers conducted a second experiment using two boxes -- one with pieces of fish and the other with just acoustic tags. Sure enough, the seals were all attracted to the one that was sending out signals. While this experiment involved only seals, the researchers believe that other marine mammals may also be using the information to catch prey. Sadly, predators like sharks that have been tagged by scientists may be negatively affected, as pings they emit could warn their prey of their presence. Besides potentially messing up nature's food chain, the \\"dinner bell\\" effect of the acoustic tags could also mean that the conclusions reached by previous fish studies may not be correct. Now that the secret is out, scientists will have to come up with another way to conduct their studies -- one that is not detectable by the crafty marine animals. Question: After doing the two experiments the researchers most probably concluded that   _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"seals can really make use of the acoustic signals to prey\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"seals can really make use of the acoustic signals to prey.\\" After conducting the two experiments, the researchers found that the seals were able to locate the tagged fish much faster and were attracted to the box sending out acoustic signals.

The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Ch≈´goku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.The Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind.

During the birth of her younger son, Farrow began bleeding badly. Dr. Paris managed to solve the problem in a delicate procedure. \\"Twenty years ago, she probably would have died,\\" he says. Today, when he performs school sports physical examinations for the Farrow boys, 10 and 11, he is always reminded that lives are changed forever by doctors just doing their jobs. To be a mix of country doc and somewhat adventurer, the 55-year-old family physician moved to Hailey after completing his residency . He hoped to practice medicine there and ski at nearby Sun Valley. Unfortunately, the only job opening was for an emergency-room doctor in Missoula, Montana, 300 miles away. Dr. Paris took it. \\"I'd ski all day and then drive all night to be in Missoula for a 48-hour shift,\\" he recalls. \\"I'm lucky to be alive.\\" Knowing he couldn't keep up with his eight-hour commute , he began taking flying lessons. In 1981, Dr. Paris joined a small medical practice in Hailey, a former mining town with a population at the time of 2,109. As Hailey grew in the shadow of Sun Valley's booming popularity, Dr. Paris's own practice expanded to seven physicians, including his wife, Kathryn Woods, who is also a family doctor. They met in 1986 at a certification exam in Denver when, in a room full of men in stodgy suits, Woods arrived wearing a Lycra biking outfit and carrying the front wheel of her bicycle (which she couldn't lock up outside).

A low rating reflects negatively on any business and even more so for a restaurant, as it greatly influences the potential customers' decision-making when selecting a dining option. The Phoenix, with its poor rating, might struggle to attract new customers and maintain a loyal customer base, which could affect its overall revenue generation and success. It is important for the management of The Phoenix to closely examine customer feedback and reviews to address the specific concerns raised by customers and work on improving the overall dining experience. Potential areas of improvement may include enhancing food quality, flavor consistency, portion sizes, presentation, staff training, and service delivery. 3. Location: Riverside area The Phoenix is situated in the riverside area, which can impart a picturesque and serene environment to its customers. Restaurants with proximity to natural attractions, such as picturesque rivers, lakes, or oceans, often provide a unique dining experience enhanced by the scenic views. The riverside location offers an excellent opportunity for The Phoenix to capitalize on the ambiance and provide customers with comfortable outdoor seating arrangements, potentially drawing more patrons to enjoy their meals while taking in the calming views and sounds of the nearby river. A riverside location can potentially attract not only local residents but also tourists who wish to experience a pleasant dining experience in a natural setting. Therefore, investing in creating a welcoming and comfortable atmosphere that complements the location can be an asset for the restaurant. In conclusion, The Phoenix is a riverside Indian cuisine restaurant that seemingly has certain areas that require significant improvement, especially considering the low customer rating of 1 out of 5. An immediate action plan should be implemented to identify and address the root causes of the unsatisfactory rating to ensure a better customer experience. The riverside location, if utilized effectively, can be a USP for The Phoenix, which could help turn its fortunes around in the competitive food and restaurant industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Jack Doyle. New rights to flexible working will ‚Äòmake workers happier‚Äô and improve their productivity, a minister has claimed. From today, all 30million workers in Britain will get the right to ask for flexible hours ‚Äì instead of just parents and carers. Liberal Democrat business minister Jo Swinson said it was a ‚Äò1950‚Äôs mindset‚Äô which said workers actually needed to be in the office to get their work done. From today, all 30million workers in Britain will get the right to ask for flexible hours - instead of just parents and carers. But employment lawyers predicted a huge surge in the number of workplace grievances and rising ‚Äòresentment‚Äô between workers who get what they want and those who lose out. And business groups reminded employees that the ‚Äòwork still needs to be done‚Äô. The new right is expected to lead to a huge shift in employment practices in firms where flexible working is not yet allowed. It allows workers to demand part time hours, compressed hours, working from home or job sharing. Miss Swinson, who has just returned from maternity leave said: ‚ÄòSometimes, because this has been a right to request that only parents have had, that can create, in some workplaces, a bit of tension when parents get special treatment.‚Äô She said workers could benefit with compressed hours, commuting outside rush hour and or working from home. ‚ÄòEmployers often find that this leads to employees being much more motivated, productive, less likely to leave. So that cuts down their staff recruitment costs. It really can be a win-win‚Äô, she told the Independent on Sunday. ‚ÄòYou get staff that are happy and more productive and the employers benefit from that as well. And lots of businesses are very positive about this. ‚ÄòWe live in a globalised society, we have technology which enables us to be doing work not just from physically being there at the workplace but actually doing so at different times of the day and from different places. ‚ÄòAnd rather than it staying stuck in a 1950s mind-set that being at work is about physically being somewhere and it‚Äôs about long hours and that ‚Äòpresenteeism‚Äô culture, actually it‚Äôs about achieving what you‚Äôre supposed to do in your job and doing that in the most effective way. Liberal Democrat business minister Jo Swinson said it was a '1950's mindset' which said workers actually needed to be in the office to get their work done. ‚ÄòSo flexibility isn‚Äôt a special case; flexibility is just the way that organisations work and they recognise that they can benefit from that.‚Äô But employment lawyers said the new rules could lead to a raft of new complaints from those who lose out. Fraser Younson, an employment law specialist and partner at the law firm Squire Patton Boggs, said: ‚ÄòWe‚Äôve already started to see an increase in the number of grievances filed by people who feel they are having to make up the work of colleagues working flexibly because they have children. ‚ÄòWith everyone able to request flexible working, the number of grievances is only set to rise.‚Äô A survey by the firm found 84pc of employers expect the new right to cause resentment among staff. More than half predict the change will adversely affect the day-to-day running of businesses. Companies have the right to refuse a request for flexible working if there is a valid business reason, such as the changes creating extra costs. There are also concerns about how the new rules will work ‚Äì as requests will be considered in the order they are received and not on merit. The new right is expected to lead to a huge shift in employment practices in firms where flexible working is not yet allowed. It allows workers to demand part time hours, compressed hours, working from home or job sharing. As a result, someone wanting time off for a lie in or a hobby could win out simply if they get their request in first. Employers have been told they cannot judge applications on merit and should ‚Äòpull the names out of a hat‚Äô if two people ask for the same thing and both cannot be accommodated. Mr Younson added: ‚ÄòIt says all requests should be considered equally but what if one request is from a parent and one is from an athlete who wants to train every day?‚Äô. Experts have also warned some workers may come to see the rules as a ‚Äòright to have‚Äô instead of a right to ask. Under the existing rules, around three out of five requests are granted and a further one in four after negotiation with employers. Neil Carberry, the CBI director for employment and skills, welcomed the new rules but added: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs important to remember that the work still needs to be done, so businesses will have to manage conflicting requests effectively and they retain the right to say no where the company just can‚Äôt make it work.‚Äô What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article is about how workers in Britain now have the right to ask for flexible working hours. This means they can ask to work part-time, have different hours, work from home, or share their job with someone else. The minister who supports this idea, Jo Swinson, thinks it will make workers happier and help them do their jobs better. But, some people worry it may cause problems between workers who get different schedules and make it difficult for businesses to run smoothly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Text: 10 Things I Hate About You is a 1999 American teen romantic comedy-drama film directed by Gil Junger and starring Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Larisa Oleynik. The screenplay, written by Karen McCullah and Kirsten Smith, is a loose modernization of William Shakespeare's late-16th century comedy The Taming of the Shrew, retold in a late-1990s American high school setting. In the story, new student Cameron (Gordon-Levitt) is smitten with Bianca Stratford (Oleynik) and, in order to get around her father's strict rules on dating, attempts to get bad boy Patrick (Ledger) to date Bianca's ill-tempered sister, Kat Stratford (Stiles). The film is titled after a poem written by Kat about her bittersweet romance with Patrick. Much of the filming took place in the Seattle metropolitan area, with many scenes shot at Stadium High School in Tacoma. Question: was 10 things i hate about you based on shakespeare?","output":"Yes, \\"10 Things I Hate About You\\" is based on William Shakespeare's play \\"The Taming of the Shrew.\\" While the 1999 film is a modern-day adaptation and presents a distinct setting from Shakespeare's original work, many elements of the Bard's comedy can still be found in the movie. The film serves as a loose modernization of the late-16th-century play, retelling the story in a late-1990s American high school setting. The characters in \\"10 Things I Hate About You\\" parallel those from Shakespeare's play. For instance, the Stratford sisters, Bianca and Kat, resemble the original characters, Bianca and Katherina. The film also retains the general premise around navigating strict dating rules, where new student Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) tries to bypass those rules by convincing bad boy Patrick (Heath Ledger) to date the ill-tempered sister, Kat (Julia Stiles). While the script by Karen McCullah and Kirsten Smith creatively adapts the backbone of Shakespeare's comedy, the film connects with a broader range of themes, such as the struggles and life of teenagers in the late 1990s. \\"10 Things I Hate About You\\" is able to entertain, engage, and speak to audiences despite altering the original source material. In conclusion, \\"10 Things I Hate About You\\" is based on William Shakespeare's \\"The Taming of the Shrew,\\" though presented as a loose adaptation. The film features resemblances and parallels that keep the essence of the original play alive while presenting a fresh, modern take on the iconic story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The film is about the marriage of a gynecologist named David and his wife Marianne . The film 's score was composed by Dag Wir√©n .  - Ernst Ingmar Bergman (14 July 1918¬† 30 July 2007) was a Swedish director, writer, and producer who worked in film, television, theatre and radio. He is recognized as one of the most accomplished and influential auteurs of all time, and is most famous for films such as \\"The Seventh Seal\\" (1957), \\"Wild Strawberries\\" (1957), \\"Persona\\" (1966), \\"Cries and Whispers\\" (1972) and \\"Fanny and Alexander\\" (1982).  - The Seventh Seal is a 1957 Swedish drama-fantasy film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. Set in Sweden during the Black Death, it tells of the journey of a medieval knight (Max von Sydow) and a game of chess he plays with the personification of Death (Bengt Ekerot), who has come to take his life. Bergman developed the film from his own play \\"Wood Painting\\". The title refers to a passage from the Book of Revelation, used both at the very start of the film, and again towards the end, beginning with the words \\"And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour\\". Here the motif of silence refers to the \\"silence of God,\\" which is a major theme of the film.  - Fanny and Alexander is a Swedish drama film which was released to cinemas in Sweden on 17 December 1982, written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. The plot focuses on two siblings and their large family in Uppsala, Sweden in the 1900s. It was originally conceived as a four-part TV movie and cut in that version, spanning 312 minutes; a 188-minute cut version was created later for cinematic release, although this version was in fact the one to be released first. The TV version has since been released as a complete film, and both versions have been shown in theaters throughout the world. The 312-minute cut, at five hours and 12 minutes, is one of the longest cinematic films in history.  - Cries and Whispers (lit. \\"Whispers and Cries\\") is a 1972 Swedish film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman and starring Harriet Andersson, Kari Sylwan, Ingrid Thulin and Liv Ullmann. The film is set at a mansion at the end of the 19th century and is about two sisters and a maid who watch over their third sister on her deathbed, torn between fearing she might die and hoping that she will. After several unsuccessful experimental films, \\"Cries and Whispers\\" was a critical and commercial success. It received nominations for five Academy Awards. These included a nomination for Best Picture, which was unusual for a foreign-language film.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'genre' with 'drama film'.

Last Sunday evening, we invited some people home for dinner. I dressed them nicely for the party, and told them that their job was to join Mommy in answering the door when the bell rang. Mommy would introduce them to the guests, and then they would take the guests' coats upstairs and put them on the bed in the second bedroom. The guests arrived. I introduced my two daughters to each of them. The adults were nice and kind and said how lucky we were to have such good kids. Each of the guests made a particular fuss over Kelly, the younger one, admiring her dress, her hair and her smile. They said she was a remarkable girl to be carrying coats upstairs at her age.

And it was a super cool book . There were a lot of things different in the movie , some forgivable , others just plain sucked . What is likely true about the narrator ?","output":"Based on the text provided, we can infer several things about the narrator: 1. Familiarity with the original work: The narrator has most likely read the book \\"I Am Legend\\" and is familiar with its content and storyline. They mention that the book, written about 50 years ago, is \\"a super cool book.\\" This shows their appreciation for the original source material. 2. Disappointment in the adaptation: The narrator expresses dissatisfaction with the movie version, stating that \\"once again Hollywood fucked up a great story.\\" This indicates they hold strong opinions about film adaptations of literary works and possibly have a history of being disappointed with Hollywood's treatment of such stories. 3. Distinct taste in films: The narrator refers to the film as \\"pretty okay,\\" suggesting they had tempered expectations given the adaptation from the book. It implies that they can appreciate aspects of movies even if they don't wholly enjoy them. 4. Critical perspective: The narrator acknowledges that there are discrepancies between the book and the film, with some being \\"forgivable\\" and others being disappointing. This showcases their ability to recognize and critique the differences between adaptations in a mature manner. 5. Possibly a fan of science fiction: Given that \\"I Am Legend\\" is a post-apocalyptic horror novel written in 1954 by Richard Matheson, and that the narrator enjoys the book, it is likely that the narrator is a fan of science fiction or similar genres. They likely have an interest in stories with themes like survival, potential human extinction, and explorations of human nature. 6. Desire for faithful adaptations: Considering their lamentations on Hollywood's mishandling of the story, it is reasonable to assume that the narrator values authenticity and accuracy when it comes to adapting works from one medium to another. They prefer the original ideas and artistic vision to be maintained and respected during the adaptation process. In conclusion, the narrator appears to be a knowledgeable reader who prefers accurate and faithful adaptations of literary works into films and holds strong opinions regarding Hollywood's handling of such adaptations.

Ten minutes after starting to pick up litter, my bag was full! It had cans, bottles, broken glass and newspapers in it. Since that first trip three years ago. I've gone to the forest four times a year to pick up litter. I'm often there for three hours. It makes me feel great to do something for the environment. After each trip, I look at all the litter I've found. If any of it is recyclable , I keep it.I can't understand why people drop litter. But I will keep picking it up until they stop dropping it.

Yes Based on the information provided, we can conclude that Lance's thespian aspirations were actually romantically inspired. Lance had a crush on Becky since the third grade but was too shy to talk to her. When he learned that the lead male in the school play would share a kiss with Becky, who was the main actress, he decided to audition for the part. It's evident that Lance's motivation to be a part of the school play, particularly as the lead male, was driven by his romantic interest in Becky. By securing the role, Lance hoped not only to get the opportunity to share a kiss with her, but also, possibly, to impress her and establish a connection with her that he had been unable to achieve due to his shyness. In this scenario, Lance's aspirations to be a part of the school play were not solely based on an interest in theater or thespian pursuits, but rather, they were motivated by his romantic feelings for Becky.

The Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory is a party divided again today with Member for Daly, Gary Higgins, refusing to attend all meetings, after an alleged homophobic slur against his son by Deputy Chief Minister Dave Tollner. Parliamentary colleagues have confirmed Mr Higgins' stance. He's informed party officials that he does not want to present at future meetings where Mr Tollner be in attendance. According to the NT News, the territory's Deputy Chief Minister is accused of calling Joshua Higgins a 'pillow biter' and 'shirt lifter'. Scroll down for video. NT Minister Dave Tollner has resigned as Deputy Chief and moved to the backbench after calling the son of a Country Liberal Party colleague a 'pillow biter' and a 'shirt lifter' Mr Higgins is a staff member working for Community Services Minister, Bess Price. It's been reported that the verbal attack occurred in the wake of a draft speech having been presented to cabinet ministers. The Chief Minister Adam Giles has bought into the latest scandal to beset his party, calling his deputy's comments 'inappropriate and not acceptable'. Reports in the NT News suggest Health Minister Robyn Lambley was also dragged into the controversy, admonishing Mr Tollner in front of cabinet colleagues and demanding he apologise. Member for Daly, Gary Higgins, has since announced he has accepted Mr Tollner's apology after originally threatening to boycott all Country Liberal Party meetings. 'Mr Tollner has apologised for his comments,' Mr Giles added. 'The Treasurer has told me that he did not intend to cause harm or offence with these comments and I know the individual concerned has accepted Mr Tollner‚Äôs apology.'

'The person in question is a valued staff member and has met with me and expressed a desire to move on and that‚Äôs what we now intend to do,' Mr Giles said.

The new Governor, Sir Richard (Cecil Parker), arrives with his charming and cheery but indolent nephew, the Honorable Charles Adare (Michael Wilding). Charles, who is hoping to make his fortune, is befriended by gruff Samson Flusky (Joseph Cotten), a prosperous businessman who was previously a transported convict, apparently a murderer.

Though the Governor orders him not to go, Charles is invited to dinner at Sam's house. Charles discovers that he already knows Sam's wife, Lady Henrietta (Ingrid Bergman), an aristocrat who was a good friend of Charles' sister when they were all children in Ireland. Lady Henrietta is now a alcoholic who is socially shunned. Sam invites Charles to stay at his house, hoping it will cheer up his wife, who is on the verge of madness. The housekeeper, Milly (Margaret Leighton), has completely taken over the running the household, and is the one who secretly feeds Lady Henrietta alcohol, hoping to destroy her and win Sam's affections.

At a campaign rally in New Hampshire Monday, Trump promised his supporters that, if elected, he would use the executive powers to \\"suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we fully understand how to end these threats.\\" Although the suspected Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, was an American citizen, Trump suggested immigrants from the Middle East can come to the U.S. and radicalize people who are already here, or work to convince them online. \\"The media talks about homegrown terrorism,\\" Trump said. \\"But Islamic radicalism ... and the networks that nurture it are imports from overseas whether you like it or don't like it.\\" Refugees and immigrants from conflict ridden Middle Eastern countries like Syria, Iraq and Libya could \\"be a better, bigger more horrible version than the legendary Trojan horse ever was,\\" Trump said.

There is a polar ice cap and channels that were once filled with water. Curiosity has found evidence of a flowing stream.   Q: What two structures are found on mars?   A: Answer:","output":"The two structures found on Mars are volcanoes and canyons. The Martian surface, as mentioned in the provided paragraph, features a varied landscape that includes various geological formations such as polar ice caps, channels that were once filled with water, and evidence of a flowing stream discovered by the Curiosity rover. Volcanoes on Mars are particularly noteworthy due to their size and prominence. For instance, Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system, is located on Mars. It stretches about 13.6 miles high and 370 miles across, making it nearly two and a half times the height of Mount Everest and comparably sized to the entire country of France. The extreme size of Olympus Mons and other volcanoes on Mars can likely be attributed to the planet's thinner crust and lower gravity, allowing for the prolonged buildup of volcanic materials. Another prominent geological feature on Mars is its vast network of canyons. The most famous is Valles Marineris, a gargantuan canyon system that stretches over 2,500 miles across the Martian surface. It is the largest canyon in the solar system and approximately ten times longer and five times deeper than the Grand Canyon on Earth. The formation of Valles Marineris and similar canyons on Mars still remains a topic of scientific debate, with theories ranging from tectonic activity to erosion caused by flowing water. Overall, the presence of volcanoes and canyons on Mars reveals a rich and diverse geological history for the Red Planet.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Crashes and sinks into a lake.  for the following movie plot:  In a high tech underground facility, senior technicians Gary Sitterson (Richard Jenkins) and Steve Hadley (Bradley Whitford) discuss plans for a mysterious ritual. A similar operation undertaken by their counterparts in Stockholm has just ended in failure. American college students Dana Polk (Kristen Connolly), Holden McCrea (Jesse Williams), Marty Mikalski (Fran Kranz), Jules Louden (Anna Hutchison), and Curt Vaughan (Chris Hemsworth) are spending their weekend at a seemingly deserted cabin in the forest, a cabin recently acquired by Vaughan's cousin. From their underground facility, where they possess significant technological control over the area in which the cabin is situated, Sitterson and Hadley manipulate the teenagers by intoxicating them with mind-altering drugs that hinder rational thinking and increase libido. They take bets from the different facility departments on what kind of monster will attack the teenagers and discuss the failures of similar rituals in other nations. In the cabin's cellar, the group finds many bizarre objects, including the diary of Patience Buckner, a cabin resident abused by her sadistic family. Dana recites incantations from the journal, inadvertently summoning the zombified Buckner family despite Mikalski's warnings. By releasing pheromones, Hadley successfully induces Curt and Jules to have sex. Attacked by the marauding Buckner zombies, Jules is decapitated while Curt escapes to alert the group. Marty, a frequent marijuana smoker, discovers concealed surveillance equipment before being dragged off by one of the Buckners and apparently killed. Later, the Facility workers learn that the ritual in Japan has also ended in failure, ending Japan's streak of success, and confirming that the American ritual is humanity's last hope. It becomes apparent that the ritual involves blood sacrifice. Curt, Holden, and Dana attempt to escape in their RV, but Sitterson triggers a tunnel collapse to hinder their flight.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is correct in the context of sports, but it doesn't provide the full meaning of the term \\"Meister\\" in German. Allow me to give you a detailed and long answer to better understand the meaning and usage of the word \\"Meister.\\" In German, the term \\"Meister\\" is derived from the Old High German word \\"meistar,\\" meaning a master or expert in a field. It can be used to refer to someone who has acquired a high level of expertise or skill in a particular area, and its meaning may vary depending on the context in which it is used. 1. Master or expert: In a general sense, \\"Meister\\" is often used to describe someone who is a master or expert in their profession or field of study. For example, a highly skilled craftsman, artist, or musician could be referred to as a \\"Meister\\" in their respective field.  2. Sports championships: As you mentioned in your question, ‚ÄúMeister‚Äù is also commonly used in sports to refer to the current national, European, or world champion. In this context, \\"Deutscher Meister\\" means the German champion, \\"Europameister\\" is the European champion, and \\"Weltmeister\\" denotes the world champion.  3. Master craftsman or tradesperson: In the professional realm, particularly in skilled trades and crafts, \\"Meister\\" is used to designate a master craftsman or tradesperson. In Germany and other German-speaking countries, certain trades require a person to pass a rigorous examination called the \\"Meisterpr√ºfung\\" to become a \\"Meister.\\" This confers a high level of respect and recognition in their profession as well as the ability to train apprentices and run their own business. 4. Titles and honorifics: The term \\"Meister\\" can also be used as part of a title or honorific for distinguished individuals. For instance, famous composers like Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven are often referred to as \\"Meister\\" in recognition of their mastery and contributions to the field of music. 5. In literature and arts: In literary and artistic contexts, \\"Meister\\" can be used to refer to an influential or masterful work, such as Goethe's \\"Faust,\\" which is often called \\"Goethes Meisterwerk\\" (Goethe's masterpiece).

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Roz Lewis. Kris' first acting role was in Closing Numbers with Jane Asher. When I was boarding at Wells Cathedral School I'd really enjoyed acting, so after I'd flunked my A-levels and spent eight months in Hong Kong, staying with my father who was in the Air Force, I returned to the UK to pursue my dream. By the time I was 19, about six months after I'd finished at Redroofs Stage School in Maidenhead, I went for my first film audition as an actor. I was living in a not very nice part of Maidenhead, renting a room for √Ç¬£38 a week and working in a nightclub while applying for work. The day I went up for the audition in London was very exciting. It was for a Channel 4 film called Closing Numbers with Jane Asher. I hadn't done a film audition before so I met the director Stephen Whittaker and read for him. He said he wasn't entirely sure I was suitable for the role but promised to call me later. As I caught the train back from London to Maidenhead that afternoon I picked up a newspaper that had been left on the seat and it randomly fell open on the horoscopes page. The advice for Aries, my star sign, was sage. 'Something you do today will colour not only the next few days but the months and the years ahead,' it read. I thought, 'Well, that sounds good to me.' I tore out the horoscope, put it in my wallet and went home. In the end I did get the job, and spent three days filming in Bushey near Watford. As it was such a small part, I didn't get a car to pick me up and rather embarrassingly I was late on my first day and kept Jane Asher waiting for 45 minutes. Unfortunately, after Closing Numbers I didn't get another role in film or TV for a long time, but I kept that clipping in my wallet and it became my mantra as a reminder not to give up. I slogged away in rep theatre gradually learning my craft - I didn't feel I had any other options - and when I wasn't acting I'd work in factories just to keep the money coming in. Kris (left) in Closing Numbers in 1993, he believe he owes the role to a horoscope. Then, just as my career began to blossom - much to the relief of my parents, who thought acting was just a passing phase - I lost the clipping. But it had served its purpose, inspiring me to keep plugging away when times were tough. My latest role in Death In Paradise is a fantastic job. Spending six months in a beautiful place like Guadeloupe, working with a great cast and dodging hurricanes is a dream come true. I'd never been a fan of astrology and to be honest I don't believe anyone could make predictions for one-twelfth of the population, but on that day those random words in a newspaper really struck a chord with me. I can still quote them, that's how much of an impression they made. I'd like to think it was my persistence and talent that got me where I am... but who knows, maybe it was written in the stars too. Series three of Death In Paradise is out now on DVD and available to buy from www.bbcshop.com. Write highlights for this article.","output":"This article is about Kris Marshall and his first acting role in the film Closing Numbers with Jane Asher.

He ended up getting the role and kept that horoscope for motivation.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The film opens at a meeting of the Board of Chosen Freeholders of Ocean County, New Jersey in 2005. Ocean County resident and New Jersey police officer Lieutenant Laurel Hester, a 23-year veteran of the police force, has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and expected to live only one year, she wishes to pass on her pension to her domestic partner of five years, Stacie Andree. Although New Jersey counties have the option to extend pension benefits to domestic partners, Ocean County Freeholders will not do this. In protest, the state's LGBT civil rights organization, Garden State Equality, organizes hundreds of people to speak out at each of the Freeholders' meetings. The crowds Garden State Equality organizes get bigger and more vociferous at each meeting.Among those speaking out are Laurel's police colleagues and Ocean County residents, describing Laurel's 25 years of exemplary work for the police department, and petitioning the Freeholders to allow her to pass on her pension to Stacie. Laurel's first police partner, Dane Wells, speaks about her and compares the situation to separate drinking fountains and seats at the back of the bus. Freeholder Joseph Vicari says that although they are \\"anguished\\" by Laurel's case, they are unable to change things because of state legislature and moves for an adjournment. The members of the public present are unhappy with this decision and some begin to chant \\"It's in your power\\".Outside the administration building, news reporter Ida Siegal explains the background to the case. In 2004 New Jersey passed the Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act which allows all gay and lesbian state employees to pass on their benefits, including the pension, to their domestic live-in lovers/partners. According to Siegal, all New Jersey counties can choose whether or not to allow their employees to pass on benefits to their partners.

Answer:","output":"Title Suggestion: \\"Against the Tide: A Fight for Love and Equality\\" This title captures the essence of the movie plot, reflecting the struggle that Lieutenant Laurel Hester has to go through in order to ensure her domestic partner, Stacie Andree, receives the pension benefits she deserves. Set against the backdrop of Ocean County, New Jersey, the story highlights the issues faced by the LGBT community in fighting for equal rights and recognition. The phrase \\"Against the Tide\\" signifies the uphill battle that Laurel and her supporters face while going up against the Ocean County Freeholders, who are reluctant to extend pension benefits to domestic partners. It also symbolizes the collective determination of those involved to challenge societal norms and effect change for the better. The subtitle, \\"A Fight for Love and Equality,\\" emphasizes the driving forces behind the struggle: Laurel's unwavering love for Stacie, and the pursuit of equality for the LGBT community as a whole. This battle isn't only about securing financial security for Stacie but also represents a much larger fight for equal rights in the face of discrimination. Combining these elements, \\"Against the Tide: A Fight for Love and Equality\\" evokes the spirit of resilience, determination, and the power of love in overcoming adversity and injustice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question 2: How could I gain 3300 dollars per year to pay the fees of good education for my 4 year-old son? [I] no; [II] yes; Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1: Why is car ownership so high in San Marino? Answer: Car ownership is high in San Marino primarily due to a combination of factors including its small size, its economic prosperity, and the country's infrastructure. San Marino is a small landlocked state situated within Italy, with a total area of just 61 square kilometers. This makes it one of the smallest countries in the world. Because of this, getting around the country is relatively easy and convenient by car. Public transportation options are limited to a small number of bus routes, which may be less convenient for residents, especially those living outside urban centers. Therefore, owning a car in San Marino is essential for many citizens in order to get around more freely. San Marino boasts a high GDP per capita and a robust economy, primarily driven by tourism, banking, and the manufacturing sector. The country's affluent population enjoys a good standard of living, allowing many residents to be able to afford a vehicle for personal use. Additionally, San Marino has a low population density, which means that there is less traffic congestion, making car ownership more appealing for residents. Finally, San Marino's road infrastructure is well developed, with well-maintained roads and designated parking spaces. This further incentivizes car ownership, as it allows people to easily and comfortably navigate the country by car. Question 2: How could I gain 3300 dollars per year to pay the fees of good education for my 4-year-old son? Answer: There are numerous ways to generate an additional 3,300 per year to cover your child's educational expenses. Here are some potential strategies: 1. Increase your income: You might consider asking for a salary increase at your current job, pursuing additional professional development opportunities to qualify for a higher-paying role, or even scouting for a new job that pays better. 2. Part-time or freelance work: Find part-time or freelance work in your field of expertise, or leverage your hobbies and special skills to create extra income. This could be anything from working in retail during evenings or weekends, offering tutoring or consulting services, or even selling handmade items online. 3. Rent out a room or property: If you own your home and have extra space, consider renting out a room or an unused garage on a long-term basis or through platforms like Airbnb for short-term stays. 4. Invest in a passive income stream: Invest in stocks, bonds, real estate, or mutual funds that generate passive income through dividends or capital gains. 5. Cut back on expenses: Analyze your current budget and identify areas where you can reduce or eliminate spending to save the extra money needed for education fees. This could include cutting back on dining out, switching to a more affordable cable or phone plan, or opting for less expensive entertainment options. To sum up, Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 addresses car ownership in San Marino, while Question 2 is focused on generating additional income to cover educational expenses for a child."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 2014 , factions of the West Papuan independence movement met in Port Villa and agreed to unite as one group , the United Liberation Front of West Papua .  - The Free Papua Movement (Indonesian: Organisasi Papua Merdeka, abbreviated OPM) is a decolonisation organization established during 1965 in the West Papuan or West New Guinea territory which is currently being administrated by Indonesia as the provinces of Papua and West Papua, also formerly known as Irian Jaya.  - Solomon Islands is a sovereign country consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands in Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of . The country's capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal. The country takes its name from the Solomon Islands archipelago, which is a collection of Melanesian islands that also includes the North Solomon Islands (part of Papua New Guinea), but excludes outlying islands, such as Rennell and Bellona, and the Santa Cruz Islands.  - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast.

It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air.  - Java (Indonesian: Jawa; Javanese: ; Sundanese: ) is an island of Indonesia. With a population of over 141 million (the island itself) or 145 million (the administrative region) Census released in December 2015, Java is home to 56.7 percent of the Indonesian population and is the most populous island on Earth. The Indonesian capital city, Jakarta, is located on western Java. Much of Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the center of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally.  - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area.

Since the withdrawal of the Dutch colonial administration from the Netherlands New Guinea in 1962, the implementation of Indonesian governance in 1963 and the formal absorption of West Papua into Indonesia in 1969, the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a militant Papuan-independence organisation, has conducted a low-key guerilla war against the Indonesian state, targeting the Indonesian military and police, as well as engaging in the kidnapping of both non-Papuan Indonesian settlers and foreigners. West Papuans have conducted various protests and ceremonies raising their flag for independence or federation with Papua New Guinea, and accuse the Indonesian government of indiscriminate violence and of suppressing their freedom of expression. Many West Papuans have been killed by the Indonesian military since 1969 and the Indonesian governance style has been compared to that of a police state, suppressing freedom of political association and political expression. The Indonesian Government restricts foreign access to the Papua and West Papua provinces due to sensitivities regarding its suppression of Papuan nationalism.  - An island country is a country whose primary territory consists of one or more islands or parts of islands.

Along with the desire for independence, tensions between Hindus and Muslims had also been developing over the years. The Muslims had always been a minority within the subcontinent, and the prospect of an exclusively Hindu government made them wary of independence; they were as inclined to mistrust Hindu rule as they were to resist the foreign Raj, although Gandhi called for unity between the two groups in an astonishing display of leadership. The British, extremely weakened by the Second World War, promised that they would leave and participated in the formation of an interim government. The British Indian territories gained independence in 1947, after being partitioned into the Union of India and Dominion of Pakistan. Following the controversial division of pre-partition Punjab and Bengal, rioting broke out between Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims in these provinces and spread to several other parts of India, leaving some 500,000 dead. Also, this period saw one of the largest mass migrations ever recorded in modern history, with a total of 12 million Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims moving between the newly created nations of India and Pakistan (which gained independence on 15 and 14 August 1947 respectively). In 1971, Bangladesh, formerly East Pakistan and East Bengal, seceded from Pakistan. What position did Muslims have in the Indian population?","output":"Muslims constituted a minority within the Indian population prior to the partition of the subcontinent.

Is By September, the UN Command controlled the Pusan perimeter, enclosing about 10% of Korea, in a line partially defined by the Nakdong River. a good answer to this question?","output":"Yes, the statement provided is a good answer to the question. The body of water that served as a natural border for the UN command-controlled Pusan perimeter was the Nakdong River. To provide a more detailed response: In the early stages of the Korean War, North Korean forces advanced rapidly into South Korea, nearly conquering the entire Korean Peninsula. However, the United Nations Command (UNC), comprised mainly of American, South Korean, and other allied nations' forces, managed to establish a defensive line known as the Pusan perimeter. The Pusan perimeter was a 140-mile (225-kilometer) long defensive line in the southeastern part of the Korean Peninsula that enclosed about 10% of Korea. This defensive line stretched from the city of Pusan (now Busan) on the southeastern coast, up to the Nakdong River, and to the city of Taegu (now Daegu). The Nakdong River played an essential role in the perimeter by providing a natural border and a strategic advantage to the defending UN forces. At the time, the Nakdong River was approximately 305 miles (490 kilometers) long and flowed through the rugged terrain of South Korea. The river served as a natural barrier against the North Korean forces, making it challenging for them to advance further south. Throughout August and early September 1950, the UN Command fought several battles inside and along the Pusan perimeter to defend it from invasion by the North Korean forces. These battles witnessed fierce combat, and UNC forces relied on the natural protection of the river, terrain, and other barriers to their advantage. By September 1950, the UN Command successfully maintained control of the Pusan Perimeter and managed to hold off the North Korean forces long enough for General Douglas MacArthur to turn the tide of the war with the battle-changing Incheon Landing on September 15, 1950."},{"instruction":"What is the last name of the person that drew a connection between the bust and anti-establishment sentiments?

His limousine driver and a witness to the arrest, Louis Goldblatt, described him as \\"genuinely dumbfounded by the whole affair.\\" Tour manager Eric Barrett said that he looked \\"as if there had been a plane crash\\". Hendrix biographers Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek described the incident as \\"a nightmare which ... plagued\\" him for seven months. According to Redding, \\"the bust knocked any positive feelings Jimi was holding onto out of him\\" and that he was in \\"agonised suspense\\" from the arrest until the trial. In 2012, Plummer wrote: \\"The real possibility of prison hung over Hendrix like a spectre ... a threat to his career and the cause of much brooding and rumination.\\" Journalist Charles Shaar Murray asserted that the incident jeopardized what he described as \\"Hendrix's increasingly fragile peace of mind\\". Two weeks after the arrest, Hendrix told Lawrence: \\"Whatever I have done ... getting hooked on heroin is not one of them.\\" He explained that his fear of needles discouraged him from using the drug and that having known junkies convinced him that it was not something he should get involved with.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: An overall healthy lifestyle, including a healthy and balanced diet, can help you better manage stress and make you feel better in general. Part of eating a balanced diet requires you to make good choices about what kinds of foods you eat and how much you eat in each meal.  For each meal, approximately half of your plate should consist of fruits and vegetables. Most adults should be eating six to eight ounces of grains each day. When you eat grains, choose whole grains instead of refined grains.  Make sure you eat five to six-and-a-half ounces of lean protein each day, depending on your age and sex. That can include tofu, beans, eggs, nuts/seeds, poultry, fish, or lean meat.  Try to limit yourself to five or six teaspoons of oil (or the equivalent) each day. When you do use oils, opt for plant-based oils (like coconut, palm oil, and olive oil), as these have very little if any cholesterol.  Opt for low-fat or fat-free dairy products, and aim to get about three cups of dairy (or non-dairy substitutes) per day. . Your quantity and quality of sleep can affect your ability to cope with stress throughout the day. Make sure you're getting enough sleep each night, and take steps to ensure that the sleep that you get is restful.  Most adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep, though some individuals may need even more sleep to feel fully rested. Follow a sleep schedule, even on weekends and before days off.  Find something to do before bed that relaxes you. Try to make it a nightly ritual. Block light out of your room using thick curtains or blinds. Avoid caffeine in the afternoon and evening, as it can easily interrupt your normal sleep schedule. Alcohol can also affect your sleep. It's best to avoid drinking in order to protect your quality of sleep. Turn off or avoid all electronic products at least 30 minutes before bed. The glare of a cellphone, computer, tablet, or television screen can suppress your body's melatonin production and upset your circadian rhythm.  Keep your room on the cool side, but not so cold that you're uncomfortable. Experts generally recommend keeping your bedroom between 60 and 67 degrees Fahrenheit (15.5 to 19.5 degrees Celsius), but if you need it slightly warmer go with what's most comfortable. Many people believe that indulging in drugs or alcohol will help relieve stress. While the temporary euphoria associated with intoxication may feel relaxing in the moment, it can actually create far more problems than it's worth.  Getting intoxicated instead of working through stressful situations can cause you to have trouble dealing with stress in the future. Over time it reduces your ability to successfully cope with your day-to-day stress. Drinking or doing drugs to cope with stress can quickly lead to addiction and dependency. In addition to addiction, drug and alcohol abuse can also lead to other health problems. Rather than seeking a quick \\"solution,\\" it's best to learn how to cope with stress and find healthier ways to relax and calm down. One of the best lifestyle changes you can make to reduce stress and feel happier in general is to practice gratitude. Practicing gratitude does not mean ignoring your problems or pretending they don't exist. Instead, you work to change the way you approach day-to-day stress.  Any time you find yourself feeling stressed, think about all the things in your life that you have to be grateful for. Think about your family and friends, your health, the beauty of nature, and the personal experiences that helped you become the strong and talented individual you are today. In stressful situations, it may feel like the pressures of work will never let up. You may feel exhausted, anxious, or even angry, and in the moment it may seem like the problems you experienced that day are the most important thing in the world. However, it's important to step back and remember that most of the problems you experience on a day-to-day basis will be quickly forgotten about and won't have any lasting impact on your life.  Ask yourself how important a given problem really is. Consider whether that problem will matter in a day, a week, a month, or a year. Any problems that won't impact your life beyond the short term are generally not worth worrying about. It's a waste of time and energy that could have been spent doing something calming and enjoyable. What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a shorter version of a bigger story or explanation. In this case, to be healthy and feel better, you should eat a balanced diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy. Get enough sleep and create a comfy sleep environment. Stay away from drugs and alcohol, as they can lead to more problems. Practice being thankful for all the good things in your life and remember that many daily problems won't matter in the long run. This will help you manage stress and feel happier."},{"instruction":"Question: Given the following passage  \\"If conditions change, so that the pope judges it safe to make the appointment public, he may do so at any time.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What are the full names of the drummers of Warsaw? , can you please find it?   On 20 July 1976, childhood friends Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook separately attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. Both were inspired by the Pistols' performance. Sumner said that he felt the Pistols \\"destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship\\". The following day Hook borrowed ¬£35 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig; Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. After their schoolfriend Martin Gresty declined an invitation to join as vocalist after getting a job at a factory, the band placed an advertisement for a vocalist in the Manchester Virgin Records shop. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he \\"knew he was all right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in.\\"Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and frontman Pete Shelley have both been credited with suggesting the band name \\"Stiff Kittens\\", but the band settled on \\"Warsaw\\" shortly before their first gig, a reference to David Bowie's song \\"Warszawa\\". Warsaw debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. Tony Tabac played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier. Reviews in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood brought them immediate national exposure. Mason became the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik, and even had Curtis audition. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the sessions: driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when he got out of the car, they drove off.In August...

Please answer the following question: Article: The new university hospital in Trenton, which the Health Minister Victoria Culley has described as a \\"shining example\\" to hospitals all over the country, has been open now for over six months. Having heard several complimentary   comments about the organization and efficiency of the place, I decided to see for myself. In spite of arriving early, I found that there were already long queues at the reception desks. While I was waiting, I looked around and had to admit that it is an impressive building: large and light with marble everywhere. Eventually my turn came and I presented my doctor's letters to the receptionist, who informed me that I was in the X-ray queue and I'd have to go to another queue and start again! I couldn't believe it and asked her if it might be possible to give me an appointment card anyway without making me queue up again. She informed me it was no good arguing with her and I should have read the sign, an almost invisible piece of card saying \\"X-rays\\" just in front of her where very few people can have seen it. No matter how hard I tried to persuade her, she wouldn't give me an appointment card for a blood test, so I started queuing again and finally got the card at 8: 30! I then set off for the blood test room, following the nice new signs until they suddenly stopped and I realized that I was in a part of the hospital that hasn't been finished yet! When I got to the door I saw a notice saying \\"Back in 10 minutes\\". I sat down and waited for 30 minutes before a doctor appeared and told me to come in without, of course, apologizing for keeping me waiting. I asked him why I'd had to wait and he explained he'd had to help out in another ward which was understaffed as a result of a flu epidemic   among the doctors! I got out of the hospital at 9:45 a.m. and breathed a sigh of relief. I'm now waiting for the results. So, Mrs. Culley, a far from rosy picture. Certainly the public should be under no illusions   that things have changed for the better. Perhaps you should visit the hospital as an...

When an animal doesn't eat, it is deprived of the necessary nutrients and energy required for its basic bodily functions and growth.

Is the following statement correct based on the text is it illegal to break out of jail in germany","output":"Based on the text provided, the statement is not entirely correct. In countries like Mexico, Belgium, Germany, and Austria, the philosophy of the law suggests that it is human nature to want to escape, and escapees who do not break any other laws are not charged for anything, and no extra time is added to their sentence.  Specifically, in the case of Germany, it is not considered illegal to break out of jail provided that the escape is non-violent, and the escapee does not commit any other crimes or offenses during the escape attempt. This approach stems from the belief that it is human nature to seek freedom, and therefore, the action of attempting to escape from confinement should not be penalized as long as it is done without causing harm to others or property. However, it is important to note that although the act of breaking out of jail may not be illegal itself, any related actions, such as causing damage to property, using violence against prison personnel or other inmates, or seeking assistance from other inmates or prison officials, would be considered illegal and could lead to additional charges or an extension of the individual's sentence. In summary, while it may not be explicitly illegal to break out of jail in Germany if the escape is non-violent and no other laws are broken, any associated criminal actions taken during or as a result of the escape attempt can still be prosecuted under the law."},{"instruction":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the album that was automatically added to users' iTunes accounts?

However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary.

Rainfall is a crucial aspect of the Earth's water cycle and a significant weather parameter. It directly influences the environment, agriculture, and the availability of water resources in a specific region. When we say that a patch of land gets six inches of rainfall each month, it essentially implies the volume of water that falls on that area in the form of precipitation - mainly rain. In the context of the given options, 'gathered moisture' best describes the amount of rain received by that patch of land. As moisture from various sources such as bodies of water or humidity in the air condenses and accumulates in the atmosphere, it eventually gets heavy enough to fall to the ground due to gravity. This process is called precipitation, and it results in rainfall. The accumulation of six inches of rainfall refers to the vertical height of water expected to have fallen on the ground if all of the rain remains in place and doesn't evaporate, percolate into the soil, or run off due to various factors. It showcases the overall amount of gathered moisture in the form of rainfall that the particular area receives. On the other hand, the terms 'storm', 'quiet', and 'puddles' are not accurate or closely related in this context. A storm can be a complex meteorological event that might bring rain, but it is not a measure of rainfall itself. 'Quiet' is unrelated to the topic since it is a term used to describe a situation with little or no noise. Lastly, 'puddles' refer to small, shallow pools of water formed by rainwater on the ground, but they are more a consequence of rainfall rather than a measurement of the rainfall itself. In conclusion, the statement \\"If a patch of land gets six inches of rainfall each month, then that is the amount of gathered moisture\\" accurately represents the idea that the given figure refers to the quantity of water condensed from the atmosphere and precipitating onto the land during the respective period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Original Sentence: Its minimum annual temperature is and its maximum annual temperature is, with May to October the hottest season. Paraphrased Sentence: Its maximum annual temperature is and its minimal annual temperature is May to October the hottest season. 1. In the original sentence, the information about the minimum temperature is given first, followed by the maximum temperature. In the paraphrased sentence, the order is reversed; the maximum temperature information is given first, followed by the minimum temperature. 2. The original sentence uses the term \\"minimum,\\" while the paraphrased sentence uses \\"minimal.\\" These words have similar meanings and can be used interchangeably in this context, indicating a paraphrase. 3. In the original sentence, the information about May to October being the hottest season is provided with the preposition \\"with,\\" suggesting the additional information related to the temperature range. In the paraphrased sentence, this information is incorporated directly into the sentence without the use of the preposition, but still effectively communicates that May to October is the hottest season. However, it is important to note that the paraphrased sentence suffers from some grammatical issues, making it slightly harder to understand than the original sentence. To improve its readability, it should be restructured: Improved Paraphrased Sentence: Its maximum annual temperature is, and its minimal annual temperature is, with May to October being the hottest season.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"Although the questions \\"How can I attract women?\\" and \\"How can I attract girls?\\" seem to be similar on the surface, they have slightly different connotations. The term \\"women\\" usually refers to adult females, while \\"girls\\" typically describes females who are younger, perhaps in their adolescence or early adulthood. Nonetheless, the basic principles of attraction often apply to both groups, though with certain nuances depending on the specific stage of life and individual preferences. Here is a detailed and long answer to the broader question of attracting females: 1. Self-confidence: Confidence is universally attractive, regardless of gender. Being comfortable in your own skin and displaying self-assurance will make you appealing to others. To boost your self-confidence, focus on cultivating a positive self-image, setting realistic expectations, and working towards personal growth. 2. Good grooming and hygiene: Maintaining good personal hygiene and taking care of your appearance are essential to creating a positive first impression. Shower regularly, wear clean and well-fitted clothes, groom your hair, and trim your facial hair (if applicable). A neat and well-kept appearance demonstrates respect for yourself and others. 3. Body language: Non-verbal communication plays a key role in attraction. Stand tall, make eye contact, smile genuinely, and maintain an open body language. A posture that conveys openness and confidence will make you more approachable and attractive to others. 4. Develop yourcommunication skills: Being able to engage in interesting and meaningful conversations is crucial. Develop your listening skills and show genuine interest in the other person's thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Avoid dominating the conversation or turning it into a monologue. A balance of sharing and listening will make for more engaging interaction. 5. Show genuine interest: To attract someone, it‚Äôs essential to make them feel valued and understood. Ask open-ended questions that encourage her to share more about herself, and genuinely listen to what she has to say. Make an effort to remember details about her and bring them up in future conversations. 6. Sense of humor: A good sense of humor can be incredibly attractive. Make an effort to share light-hearted moments, funny stories, or jokes (while being mindful of her preferences and boundaries). Laughter can help build connections and put others at ease. 7. Self-improvement: Continuously work on improving yourself, both internally and externally. This includes working on your emotional intelligence, pursuing hobbies you enjoy, expanding your knowledge, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. An attractive individual is someone who is always seeking personal growth and self-awareness. 8. Respect and understanding: Always treat women with respect and understanding, regardless of the situation. Demonstrate empathy and be kind, compassionate, supportive, and considerate. Avoid objectifying or degrading remarks. A respectful demeanor is highly attractive. 9. Genuine and authentic: Be true to yourself and avoid trying to put up a fa√ßade to attract others. Authenticity is endearing; don't be afraid to showcase your unique qualities and quirks. Embrace who you are and let others see the real you. 10. Create a sense of mystery: People are often attracted to those who have an air of intrigue or mystery. While it's essential to be open and honest, avoid revealing every detail about yourself too quickly. Allow the other person to discover more about you over time, maintaining an element of curiosity. Keep in mind that attraction is subjective, and what might be appealing to one person might not be appealing to another. While it is important to work on these aspects of personal growth, it is equally important to remember that authentic connections cannot be forced. By being genuine, respectful, and confident, you increase your chances of attracting others who are drawn to these qualities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Running like the wind, roaring like thunder, tigers have long been feared and respected as a king of the animal world. But last week a report said that there are no more than 30 wild tigers left in south China. This was the conclusion of a team of scientists from China's State Forestry Administration and the World Nature Fund. The South China tiger, also known as the Chinese tiger, is native to southern China. In the 1950s, there were over 4,000 tigers found in mountain forests in the country. But due to the destruction of their natural habitat and uncontrolled hunting, it has been pushed on to the list of the world's top ten most endangered species.  Sixty-six of the big cats can be found in the cages of a dozen zoos around China. But they are nothing like their wild cousins. They have lost their natural skills such as hunting and killing. If they were set free they could not look after themselves. \\"Breeding has damaged the quality of the species,\\" said Pei Enle, deputy director of the Shanghai Zoo.  To reintroduce the species into the wild, the country started a programme to send five to ten young tigers to South Africa. Four of them have already arrived. Progress has been made as two elder tigers have recovered some of their instincts  and can hunt wild animals by themselves at the African base. \\"South Africans are very experienced in reintroducing big animals to the wild. The country has very good natural conditions for the tigers to learn in,\\" said Lu Jun, office director of the National Wildlife Research and Development Centre. \\"We tried in Fujian Province, but it was not successful as there was not a complete eco-chain   and there was a lack of space.\\" The tigers should return to China in 2009 when the reservations in Fujian are ready. Question: What is the purpose of sending young tigers to South Africa? Options: A: To help the tigers recover their ability to live in the wild. B: To provide them with a better environment. C: To get the tigers to go on a tour. D: To find a complete eco-chain for them.

Answer based on context: The Th√°i Nguy√™n uprising  in 1917 has been described as  the \\"largest and most destructive\\" anti-colonial rebellion in French Indochina between the Pacification of Tonkin in the 1880s and the Nghe-Tinh Revolt of 1930-31. On 30 August 1917, an eclectic band of political prisoners, common criminals and insubordinate prison guards mutinied at the Thai Nguyen Penitentiary, the largest one in the region.  The rebels came from over thirty provinces and according to estimates, involved at some point roughly 300 civilians, 200 ex-prisoners and 130 prison guards.

Please answer a question about the following article about Czech language: One study showed that Czech and Slovak lexicons differed by 80 percent, but this high percentage was found to stem primarily from differing orthographies and slight inconsistencies in morphological formation; Slovak morphology is more regular (when changing from the nominative to the locative case, Praha becomes Praze in Czech and Prahe in Slovak).

Background: Kenneth Elton Kesey (; September 17, 1935 - November 10, 2001) as Ken Kesey was an American novelist, essayist, and countercultural figure. He considered himself a link between the Beat Generation of the 1950s and the hippies of the 1960s. Context: While still enrolled at the University of Oregon in 1957, Kesey wrote End of Autumn; according to Rick Dogson, the novel \\"focused on the exploitation of college athletes by telling the tale of a football lineman who was having second thoughts about the game.\\" Although Kesey came to regard the unpublished work as juvenilia, an excerpt served as his Stanford Creative Writing Center application sample.  During his Woodrow Wilson Fellowship year, Kesey wrote Zoo, a novel about the beatniks living in the North Beach community of San Francisco, but it was never published.  The inspiration for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest came while working on the night shift with Gordon Lish at the Menlo Park Veterans' Hospital. There, Kesey often spent time talking to the patients, sometimes under the influence of the hallucinogenic drugs with which he had volunteered to experiment. Kesey did not believe that these patients were insane, but rather that society had pushed them out because they did not fit the conventional ideas of how people were supposed to act and behave. Published under the guidance of Cowley in 1962, the novel was an immediate success; in 1963, it was adapted into a successful stage play by Dale Wasserman, and in 1975, Milos Forman directed a screen adaptation, which won the \\"Big Five\\" Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor (Jack Nicholson), Best Actress (Louise Fletcher), Best Director (Forman) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman).  Kesey originally was involved in creating the film, but left two weeks into production. He claimed never to have seen the movie because of a dispute over the 20,000 he was initially paid for the film rights. Kesey loathed the fact that, unlike the book, the film was not narrated by the Chief Bromden character, and he disagreed with Jack Nicholson's being cast as Randle McMurphy (he wanted Gene Hackman). Despite this, Faye Kesey has stated that her husband was generally supportive of the film and pleased that it was made. Question: What year was the novel written?

Initially it was a localized feud between supporters of Gebhard and those of the Catholic core of the Cathedral Chapter. With the election of Ernst of Bavaria as a competing archbishop, what had been a local conflict expanded in scale: Ernst's election guaranteed the military, diplomatic, and financial interest of the Wittelsbach family in the Electorate of Cologne's local affairs. After the deaths of Louis VI, Elector Palatine in 1583¬†and William the Silent in 1584, the conflict shifted gears again, as the two evenly matched combatants sought outside assistance to break the stalemate. Finally, the intervention of Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, who had at his command the Spanish Army of Flanders, threw the balance of power in favor of the Catholic side. By 1588, Spanish forces had pushed Gebhard from the Electorate. In 1588 he took refuge in Strassburg, and the remaining Protestant strongholds of the Electorate fell to Parma's forces in 1589. Question: How many years did it take for the remaining Protestant strongholds to fall to Parma after Gebhard was pushed from the Electorate?

Trivia question: \\"Who wrote the novel The Virgin and the Gypsy\\"\\"?\\" And the answer is?","output":"The novel \\"The Virgin and the Gypsy\\" was written by D.H. Lawrence, or David Herbert Lawrence, who is one of the most influential authors of the 20th century. Born on September 11, 1885, in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, England, D.H. Lawrence came from a working-class background and faced numerous hardships growing up. Despite this, his strong intellectual abilities were recognized early on, paving the way for his future career. He obtained a scholarship to Nottingham High School and later studied at Nottingham University. Lawrence is renowned for his exploration of a wide range of thematic concerns in his works, much of which touched upon human sexuality, emotional health, instinct, and nature, among other themes. These were discussed with unprecedented frankness, which was often deemed as controversial. \\"The Virgin and the Gypsy\\" is one such example. Completed around 1922, it was initially unsuccessful in finding a public publisher due to its explicit content. However, it was eventually published posthumously in 1930, following Lawrence's death in 1930. This novella, from a more significant work that was never completed, brings forth some of Lawrence's classic themes. The story centres on Yvette Saywell, a rector's daughter, who is living in the constrained and convention-bound England of the early 20th century. The chance meeting with a gypsy awakens her sexual and emotional self, leading to a powerful narrative of self-discovery and the breaking of traditional conventions. Like many of D.H. Lawrence's works, \\"The Virgin and the Gypsy\\" was groundbreaking in its portrayal of women's sexuality and desire, which was a taboo subject at the time. Through his vivid and naturalistic writing style, Lawrence elucidated the inner struggles and desires of his characters, garnering significant attention and influencing an array of writers that followed. Despite the controversies surrounding his works, Lawrence's unique approach to addressing often untouched themes had made him a seminal literary figure, and his influence can still be felt today. Overall, D.H. Lawrence's literary contribution is remarkable, and his writing, including \\"The Virgin and the Gypsy,\\" continues to intrigue readers and inspire other writers worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a title for this article: By the CNN Wire Staff updated 5:59 PM EDT, Fri April 20, 2012 (CNN) -- Walgreens will pay governments 7.9 million in a settlement reached amid allegations the drugstore chain illegally paid kickbacks so that prescriptions would be transferred to its pharmacies, the U.S. Justice Department announced Friday. Investigators had been looking into whether Walgreens had given people enrolled in government-run health programs -- such as Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare (for military families) -- 25 gift cards if they moved their prescriptions over to Walgreens' pharmacies, according to a Justice Department news release. Such inducements violate federal law, the department says. The drugstore chain's advertisements typically noted that such offers didn't apply to those insured via Medicaid, Medicare and similar programs. But the government claimed \\"Walgreens employees frequently ignored the stated exemptions on the face of the coupons and handed gift cards to customers who were beneficiaries of government health programs.\\" The government learned of the allegations in lawsuits filed by two whistle-blowers: Cassie Bass, a pharmacy technician who worked at Walgreens in Detroit, and Jack Chin, an independent pharmacist in Florida. Federal prosecutors from California and Michigan, the U.S. Justice Department's commercial litigation branch, the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units and the U.S. Health and Human Service Department's inspector general participated in the joint investigation. Bass and Chin will get about 1.28 million from the United States for their actions under parts of federal and state False Claims Acts statutes, according to the U.S. Justice Department. The federal government will receive just under 7.3 million from Walgreens as part of the settlement, with participating states also receiving some payment from the drugstore chain. \\"This case represents the government's strong commitment to pursuing improper practices in the retail pharmacy industry that have the effect of manipulating patient decisions,\\" said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general with the U.S. Justice Department. On its website, Illinois-based Walgreens describes itself as the nation's largest drugstore chain with sales last fiscal year of 72 billion and 7,847 drugstores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.

If I tell you that Actions can be learned through play, and ask you the question \\"how can an animal learn actions?\\", is the correct answer \\"movement\\"? Answer:","output":"No, the correct answer is not necessarily \\"movement\\". While movement is a large part of learning actions in animals, it's not the entire picture. Understanding how an animal learns actions involves understanding a number of factors: Step 1: Animals learn actions through different methods, like operant conditioning (learning from the consequences of individual actions), classical conditioning (associating a voluntary behavior with a new stimulus), and observational learning (watching and imitating other animals). To justify, these learning methods are widely accepted in cognitive science and have been observed in many different animal species, from dogs to dolphins to birds. Step 2: Play is crucial in animal learning process. During play, animals experiment with different movements and actions, learning what works and what doesn't in a safe, low-risk environment. To justify, play is a common behavior in many different animal species, and it's often associated with learning and development. For example, lion cubs play-fight to learn hunting skills, and human children play games to learn social skills. Step 3: Environmental interactions are also a key part of how animals learn actions. Animals learn how to navigate their environment, find food, and avoid predators through interaction with the world around them. To justify, engaging with the environment provides opportunities for animals to explore and test out new behaviors, which contributes to their learning process. So, in conclusion, \\"movement\\" is only a part of how animals learn actions. Other factors such as learning methods, play, and interaction with the environment also play crucial roles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Title: Flat Earthers and deep denial Review: This is one of the small numbers of books on Shostakovitch which is almost completely unreliable.

It should be in the Black Humour section. It is certainly not scholarship. Answer:","output":"Based on the customer's review, it is evident that he is dissatisfied with the product. The reviewer has expressed criticism and frustration throughout the review, which suggests a strong negative opinion towards the book.  There are several reasons why the reviewer is dissatisfied with the book: 1. The reviewer describes the book as \\"completely unreliable,\\" implying that the information presented in the book is not trustworthy or accurate. 2. The reviewer criticizes the author's ideological stance, stating that the author is part of a group that naively praises the Soviet Union's cultural and political environment. This view may have led to biased or distorted information in the book. 3. The reviewer finds it absurd that this book is still available even after the fall of communism in Europe, suggesting that the ideas in the book are outdated and no longer relevant. 4. Instead of recommending the book, the reviewer explicitly advises potential readers not to \\"touch it with a barge pole.\\" This strong negative suggestion indicates the reviewer's dissatisfaction with the product. 5. The reviewer further emphasizes their dissatisfaction by offering an alternative book recommendation, \\"Semyon Volkov's Testimony.\\" By recommending a different book that presumably offers a more accurate representation of Shostakovich's life, the reviewer is trying to steer potential readers away from the book they are reviewing. 6. Lastly, the reviewer mentions that the book should be in the \\"Black Humour\\" section, indicating that the content of the book is so misguided that it could be considered funny or absurd. This further reflects the reviewer's dissatisfaction with the book and questions its credibility as a scholarly work. In conclusion, the reviewer is clearly dissatisfied with the book due to its unreliability, biased perspective, outdated ideas, and lack of scholarly value.
