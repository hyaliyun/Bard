Therefore, we need to focus on countries or locations that have been involved in conflicts with the US in recent history. 2. Analyze each possible answer:    - Canada: This is an unlikely choice since Canada is a close ally of the US, and there has never been a significant military conflict between the two nations. It is very unlikely that the US would drop bombs on Canada during a war.      - Afghanistan: This is a more likely choice since Afghanistan was a significant battleground during the US-led War on Terror, which began in 2001. The US military conducted numerous bombing campaigns in Afghanistan, targeting terrorist organizations and their infrastructure.    - Aircraft: This answer is irrelevant as the question is looking for a location where the bombs are dropped, not the medium used for dropping bombs.    - Arsenal: This term refers to a collection of weapons or military equipment, not a location. Therefore, this choice cannot be correct.    - Suitcase: This option isn't relevant to the situation as it is not a location where bombs would be dropped. 3. Select the most appropriate answer: Based on the analysis of each possible answer, Afghanistan is the most suitable choice.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  \\"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\\"When Dylan arrived at the studio on January 25, 1966, he had yet to work out the lyrics and title for what was to become the closing track on Blonde on Blonde's first side. With Dylan piecing together the song's sections, and the chorus that gives the song its title only emerging on take five, the session stretched through the night and into the next morning. It was not until the fifteenth take that a full version was recorded. Dylan and the band persisted until they recorded take 24 which closed the session and made it onto the album four months later. Critic Jonathan Singer credits Griffin's piano for binding the song together: \\"At the chorus, Griffin unleashes a symphony; hammering his way up and down the keyboard, half Gershwin, half gospel, all heart. The follow-up, a killer left hand figure that links the chorus to the verse, releases none of the song's tension.\\"\\"One of Us Must Know\\" is a straightforward account of a burned-out relationship. Dissecting what went wrong, the narrator takes a defensive attitude in a one-sided conversation with his former lover. As he presents his case in the opening verse, it appears he is incapable of either acknowledging his part or limiting the abuse: \\"I didn't mean to treat you so bad. You don't have to take it so personal. I didn't mean to make you so sad. You just happened to be there, that's all.\\" \\"One of Us Must Know\\" was the first recording completed for Blonde on Blonde and the only one selected from the New York sessions. The song was released as the first single from the album on February 14, the same day Dylan began to record in Nashville. It failed to appear on the American charts, but reached number 33 in the UK.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: At what number did the album that did not include the man who got rights to The Wall chart in the UK and US?  In 1986, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for what would become Pink Floyd's first album without Waters, A Momentary Lapse of Reason. There were legal obstacles to Wright's re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead, Pink Floyd invited Wright to participate in the coming sessions. Gilmour later stated that Wright's presence \\"would make us stronger legally and musically\\", and Pink Floyd employed him as a musician with weekly earnings of 11,000. Recording sessions began on Gilmour's houseboat, the Astoria, moored along the River Thames. Gilmour worked with several songwriters, including Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, eventually choosing Anthony Moore to write the album's lyrics. Gilmour would later admit that the project was difficult without Waters' creative direction. Mason, concerned that he was too out-of-practice to perform on the album, made use of session musicians to complete many of the drum parts. He instead busied himself with the album's sound effects.A Momentary Lapse of Reason was released in September 1987. Storm Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent from The Wall and The Final Cut, designed the album cover. To drive home that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover, the first since Meddle. The album went straight to number three in the UK and the US. Waters commented: \\"I think it's facile, but a quite clever forgery ... The songs are poor in general ... [and] Gilmour's lyrics are third-rate.\\" Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as a return to the band's top form, Wright disagreed, stating: \\"Roger's criticisms are fair. It's not a band album at all.\\" Q Magazine described the album as essentially a Gilmour solo album.Waters attempted to subvert the Momentary Lapse of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name.

What happens there in the days ahead will have enormous consequences for the U.S. and its role in the Middle East. By Peter Macdiarmid, Getty Images Cairo: Protestors in Tahrir Square on Tuesday. By Peter Macdiarmid, Getty Images Cairo: Protestors in Tahrir Square on Tuesday. If Americans don't care yet, they should. Egypt, after all, is not just any country. It is America's closest Arab ally and the first to have made peace with Israel. The U.S. has depended on the Mubarak regime to advance a number of key security interests, from countering Iran to combating terrorism. It's clear now that the regime's days are numbered. Over the past week, the streets of Egypt have been flooded with people demanding a new government and, in essence, a new way of life. What will a political vacuum in Egypt mean for security and stability in the broader Arab world? Western officials have expressed fears of another Iran, with a Western ally being lost to Islamic fundamentalism. Perhaps a democratically elected government, reflecting widespread anti-Israel feeling, will reassess the Camp David peace treaty of 1979. And what about the oil-rich Persian Gulf countries? If they, too, find themselves embroiled in a struggle with restive populations, then the free flow of oil — long a top U.S. foreign policy priority — could be undermined, with drastic consequences for the global economy. The growing uncertainty has led to a regional stock market crash, rising oil prices and other economic damage. Though President Hosni Mubarak's announcement Tuesday night that he won't seek re-election momentarily calmed things, clashes between his supporters and the crowds in the streets ushered in new unease. This is a critical moment not just for Egypt but also for America. Not only are our interests at stake, but so are our ideals. We might be seeing a pan-Arab democratic revolution. But because of its longtime support of Mubarak, the U.S. faces the hard task of midwifing a transition while staying arm's-length from the waning regime. The Arab world had always been the \\"democratic exception,\\" an authoritarian region in a world of growing freedom and democracy. Now events in Egypt could mark a definitive turning point. The crisis has entered its final phase. Though Mubarak has blinked, his insistence on hanging on until the September elections has been rejected by the thousands in the streets. The military, which receives 1.3 billion in U.S. military assistance, is poised to play kingmaker in this next phase but, so far, has stayed largely neutral. Considering the economic cost, as well as the cost in U.S. credibility, this paralysis cannot continue indefinitely. Regime forces are looking for ways to hold the revolution back, to run out the clock until the elections. The Obama administration, then, has the leverage to push Mubarak more quickly out the door. Up until now, though, the U.S. has been behind the curve. On Jan. 25, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton affirmed that the Egyptian regime was \\"stable.\\" A week later, the country is crumbling. This, presumably, is what happens after three decades of pent-up anger over the indignities of autocratic rule. The Obama administration has since toughened its tone, calling for an \\"orderly transition,\\" but hasn't gone as far as supporting the protesters' one key demand: that Mubarak quit now. More than a week into the crisis, the U.S. is still hedging its bets. Egypt, as the most populous and influential Arab nation, has the potential — with the help of the international community — to become a model for the region. It also has the potential to become a model for something altogether more frightening: a failed state unable to control its own people or territory. If Egypt moves toward democracy, the Obama administration will be remembered for resisting until the final moments. If Egypt reverts to chaos or refashioned autocracy, it will mark the definitive end of the \\"new beginning\\" that Obama promised during his historic Cairo address in 2009. Fortunately for U.S. policymakers, there is still time to pressure Mubarak to step down immediately. The protesters, whose signs are purposely in English, are pleading for such support. Should Americans care? Only if they care about 80 million people who yearn for freedom. Only if they care about U.S. national security interests. Only if they care about a stable Middle East. Only if bloodshed, even in a faraway land, troubles the conscience. The world is watching. Now we will find out just how much the world cares.

I read this background article the other day: During the Cold War, the Arctic became a place where the United States, Canada, and the Soviet Union performed significant research that has been essential to the study of climate change in recent years. A major reason why research in the Arctic is essential for the study of climate change is because the effects of climate change will be felt more quickly and more drastically in higher latitudes of the world as above average temperatures are predicted for Northwest Canada and Alaska. From an anthropological point of view, researchers study the native Inuit peoples of Alaska as they have become extremely accustomed to adapting to ecological and climate variability.[1]  I am facing a new situation today: Two countries situated at different latitudes are exposed to climate change. Iceland is located closer to the North Pole, while Ecuador is located near the Equator.

The answer to this question is:","output":"Based on the information you've provided from the background article, Iceland, being located closer to the North Pole, will likely feel the effects of climate change more quickly and more drastically compared to Ecuador, which is situated near the Equator. This is because higher latitudes of the world, such as the Arctic region, are predicted to experience above-average temperatures and more significant climate alterations as a result of climate change. In contrast, the countries located closer to the Equator might experience the impacts of climate change at a slower pace and to a lesser extent. However, it is essential to keep in mind that this is a general observation and various factors, including local topography, weather patterns, and anthropogenic factors, can influence the extent to which each country is affected by climate change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The mighty fane, with its three massive towers, rises majestically over the red roofs of the town. Its most striking feature is the great Norman screen, running up without buttresses or projections to the parapet and hiding the bases of the square, richly decorated towers of the west front. The plain centre of the screen is the work of Remigius, the first bishop. The rest of it is relieved with rich arcading of Late Norman and Early English periods. The wooden spires which crowned the towers were removed in 1807. In 1192 Hugh of Avalon determined to rebuild the Norman building of Remigius, which an earthquake had shaken. To him we owe the choir and eastern transept. His successors completed the western transept and began the west end of the nave. So much money had to be spent in rebuilding the central tower, which fell in 1239, that the canons could not rebuild the nave entirely, but had to incorporate the Norman end by Remigius. Unfortunately the axis of the west front does not correspond to that of the nave, which is too wide for its height. The low vaulting is a serious defect in the choir built by St. Hugh, but of the superb beauty of the Angel Choir, which encloses his shrine, there can be no doubt. In its richness of sculpture it is one of the masterpieces of Gothic architecture in England. The interior of the cathedral is remarkable for the harmony of its style, which is Lancet-Gothic, and the dim lighting of the nave only adds to its impressiveness.

Donald Trump Will Do 'Right Thing' If He Loses Ivanka Trump does not like to discuss defeat. Her father is “in it to win it,” she says, and she’s “not interested in talking about alternative outcomes.” But if the election doesn’t go to Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the fairness of the electoral process, Ivanka said in a new interview on Wednesday that her father will “do the right thing.” In an interview with TIME Editor Nancy Gibbs at the Fortune Most Powerful Women’s conference, Trump appeared calm and poised but revealed very little about her reaction to her father’s recent campaign struggles. When asked directly about her father’s “locker room” talk, his claims that the election will be “rigged” and the massive gender gap between Trump voters and Hillary Clinton voters, Ivanka Trump mostly gave answers about her closeness with her father, their family business and her own brand. The Most Powerful Women interview was her first major interview since the release of the leaked 2005 audio that revealed Trump bragging that he can “do anything” to women. When asked about the now-infamous audio, Ivanka Trump said the incident was “jarring,” but that her father had apologized. “He recognizes it was crude language, he was embarrassed that he had said those things, and he apologized,” she said. “That’s not language consistent with any conversation I’ve had with him.” She then described her father’s business prowess, calling him very much a “leader of people.” (A Fast Company article published Monday included a statement from Ivanka Trump on her father’s scandals.) She added that she has spoken to her father about his controversial comments, but did not reveal what was said in those conversations. “We talk about it, we have a very open dialogue, and I think that’s one of the things that I respect so much about him, his willingness to listen,” she said. Trump also attempted to distance herself from the campaign’s inner sanctum, saying she resented media portrayals that describe her as a “surrogate” for her father. “I’m not a surrogate, I’m a daughter,” she said. “I’m not the campaign mastermind that people like to portray.” Ivanka has played a prominent role in the campaign, introducing her father at his announcement speech, giving a major primetime address at the Republican National Convention and orchestrating her father’s child care plan. “When people ask me about politics, I talk about what a great dad he was, and what a great businessman he’s been, because that’s what I know,” she said. “Everyone else can debate policy.” Ivanka also says she has been surprised by the level of scrutiny aimed at her and her family since her father began to run for President. “I may have been naïve going into this—nothing in life prepares you for a parent running for president,” she said, before adding that “the media has been vicious.” “The bias is very, very real, and I don’t think I would have said this to you even a year ago,” she continued. “From a media perspective, it’s very hard to get an accurate portrayal of who he is as a person.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"1.

At the station, they meet a hitchhiking cowboy named Tex and the station's perverted owner Alfredo. Tex shows Ryan a route on the map that can get them to a town. A fight soon breaks out between Tex and Alfredo when Tex finds the latter spying on Michelle while she uses the station restroom. As Michelle and Ryan flee from the station in their car, they witness Alfredo apparently killing Tex with a shotgun. As night falls, Ryan and Michelle, having taken the route Tex recommended, become lost. As they begin to bicker, a large truck appears and the driver attacks them.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: The North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust is one of nine in England found to have higher than predicted mortality rates last year. The figures include deaths in hospital, or within 30 days of discharge. North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Trust medical director, Dr David Emerton, said it was \\"reviewing the care of all patients who die\\". Dr Emerton said the figures - higher than expected for the second year running - were skewed by the number of patients treated without being admitted to hospital. Some patients, such as those in care homes nearing the end of their lives, where sent to hospital \\"when not much really can be done\\", he said. The Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC), who compiled the data, says the categorisation does not mean a hospital is failing or unsafe and does not take levels of social deprivation into account. Its figures should \\"instead should be viewed as a 'smoke alarm' which requires further investigation by the trust\\", a spokeswoman said. The SHMI is available from April 2010 and the latest data covers July 2013 to June 2014. The expected risk of the patient dying in hospital, or within 30 days of discharge, is estimated based on the patient's condition, age, sex and how they were admitted to hospital. Dr Mike Smith, from the Patients Association, said the figures should be viewed in the context of the area's poverty and unemployment rate. \\"If people have, locally, a high mortality and morbidity rate, that means to say people are dying more than the rest of the nation and/or are sicker than the rest of the nation, then you mustn't necessarily think it's the hospital's fault,\\" he said. Summary:","output":"A hospital called North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust had more people pass away than they thought would last year. The people in charge are looking into why this happened. They think it might be because some very sick people are being sent to the hospital even though there isn't much that can be done to help them. It's important to remember that this doesn't mean the hospital is bad or unsafe, but they just need to figure out what's going on."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The old subway cars have concrete floors, overhead fans and open windows. The year is 1931. And New Yorkers are stepping onto the brand new R-1 model subway car, built by the American Car & Foundry factory in Berwick, Pennsylvania. Fast-forward 77 years. New Yorkers and tourists are once again boarding these 84,000-pound, 60-foot-long behemoths constructed of riveted steel, with some featuring wicker seats, dangling emergency brake cords, incandescent light bulbs, big exposed overhead fans, and open windows. \\"You come on a","output":"nostalgic journey back in time when you step aboard these vintage R-1 model subway cars,\\" says Michael Glikethe, a New York transit historian. \\"It's a completely different experience from riding today's modern and sleek subway trains.\\" As part of the New York Transit Museum's ongoing efforts to preserve the city's transportation history, these R-1 model subway cars have been meticulously restored to their original condition and are now on display for the public to admire and enjoy. Occasionally, the museum even offers rides on these antique trains, allowing passengers to relive a bygone era of the New York City subway system.  The restoration process was no small task, as each component of the subway cars had to be carefully examined, repaired, or replaced to maintain their historical authenticity. In addition, safety features were updated to meet current standards without interfering with the vehicles' classic appearance. \\"The R-1 model subway cars are a testament to the ingenuity and craftsmanship of the American Car & Foundry factory,\\" says Janelle Bronson, the museum's director. \\"They represent an important chapter in New York City's transportation history and offer a fascinating glimpse into the daily lives of New Yorkers during the Great Depression.\\" The R-1 model subway cars may be a far cry from the air-conditioned, Wi-Fi-enabled trains of today, but they remain a symbol of New York City's enduring spirit and resilience during one of the toughest times in the nation's history. New Yorkers and visitors alike can appreciate the distinctive charm of these vehicles while reflecting on the city's past and progress throughout the decades."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In fact, if experts are to be believed, multitasking is a disastrous idea. One of the opponents of multitasking is Dr. Clifford Nass, a professor at Stanford University. \\"People who multitask frequently are less able to pay attention; they're worse at managing their memory.\\" he said. In his opinion, the loss that we get with multitasking is harmless in some situations, for example, part of doing business in the digital world: but you can't do serious work like writing, thinking or solving an important problem this way. You do worse even as you think you're doing better. All the time the research points to a simple fact: the brain cannot cope. When you stop midway through composing a report to check an email, you force your brain to stop and regroup. It is like pressing the pause button during a movie, meaning the film takes longer to watch. And as for Dr. Nass, the problems extend beyond the brain. Young people who frequently multitask are not as socially and emotionally healthy as those who don't. They just feel more emotionally satisfied and the feeling is so good and they are bound to desire it again. Todd Oppenheimer, a writer said \\"We've become a very short-term society and don't reward people for taking a lot of time on something.\\" He fears we may end up losing the next generation of great thinkers. \\"It's really unfortunate because the long-term challenges of our world -- environmental issues, financial issues -- require people to think wisely about the long-term consequences of what they do.

A: A:","output":"Given the lack of information in the paragraph provided and to answer the question accurately, I must presume the missing context is related to the reproductive process. All gymnosperm species and many eudicot species undergo double fertilization. In these plants, the reproductive process involves the production of male and female gametes, followed by the fusion of the male sperm nucleus with the female egg cell, resulting in the development of a seed. In gymnosperms, this usually occurs in cone-like structures, while in eudicots, it happens within flowers. During double fertilization, two sperm nuclei from the pollen grain enter the ovule – one fertilizes the egg cell, forming a zygote, which eventually develops into the embryo. The other sperm nucleus fuses with two polar nuclei within the central cell, forming a triploid endosperm nucleus. This endosperm nucleus later gives rise to the endosperm, a nutritive tissue that provides sustenance to the developing embryo. So, all gymnosperm species and many eudicot species undergo double fertilization as part of their reproductive process."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly.

A:","output":"Harry Step 1: Understand the given situation and hint The situation presents two students, Harry and Kim, who studied ancient human settlements. Kim studied a 15,000-year-old settlement (before agriculture was invented), while Harry studied a 5,000-year-old village. The hint states that agriculture was invented about 10,000 years ago, providing a more dependable food supply and enabling people to settle in villages and cities.

Scott abandons his family, driving to Florida in his shiny red 1959 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray Racer to find himself. When Scott stops for gas and refreshments, he encounters Tom Wilson (Hutchins), who is on his way to take a job as a waterskiing instructor at a Miami hotel. Scott and Tom make small talk, and a chance remark by Tom gives Scott an idea: He switches identities with Tom so he can find out how people react to him as an ordinary person rather than a millionaire.

Movie title: Journey to the Center of the Earth Context: In the opening scene, Max Anderson (Jean-Michel ParÃ©) is being pursued by a Giganotosaurus. Max then comes across a fissure vent. When he tries to jump across, he falls while calling out the name of his brother. Ten years later, Max's brother volcanologist Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) is visited by Max's son, Trevor's 13-year-old nephew Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson). In a box of items that belonged to Max is a book, Journey to the Center of the Earth by Jules Verne. Notes written by Max are found inside the book. In Trevor's volcanology laboratory, a device shows activity on SnÃ¦fell, a dormant volcano in Iceland. Trevor and Sean travel to Iceland to investigate. They try to contact Icelandic volcanologist SigurbjÃ¶rn Ãsgeirsson, but instead encounter his daughter Hannah Ãsgeirsson (Anita Briem) since her father had died some years earlier.[3] It turns out that SigurbjÃ¶rn and Max were both Vernians, a group of people who believe the works of Jules Verne to be fact and not fiction. Hannah offers to help them climb the volcano. While the group is hiking up the volcano, a lightning storm forces them to take shelter in a cave. The cave entrance collapses, having them trapped in what appears to be an abandoned mine. The trio then rides on out-of-control mine carts, in which the tracks start to branch-off in three ways. Hannah and Trevor get saved from dead-ends and Sean reunites with them. They reach the bottom of a volcanic vent, the floor of the vent breaks, and they begin to fall towards the center of the Earth. The volcanic vent eventually becomes a water slide which drops them safely into a lake in the center of the Earth, which turns out to be a completely separate world contained within the Earth. The group starts seeking a way back to the surface. Along the way, they find evidence that someone had been there a hundred years ago.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write highlights for this article: By. Derek Hunter. Arsene Wenger has backed Jack Wilshere to take the World Cup by storm after revealing the Arsenal star’s rehabilitation from a broken foot will ensure he is in peak condition for England this summer. The 22-year-old has not played since suffering a hairline fracture to his left foot during England’s friendly against Denmark on March 5 — an injury that appeared to threaten his participation in Brazil. But Wenger says the midfielder is likely to return for Arsenal’s clash with West Bromwich on May 5 and that he has already assured England manager Roy Hodgson he should have no worries about naming the playmaker in his squad. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Wilshere and Neymar star in the new Nike ad. On the mend: Jack Wilshere will go to the World Cup in peak condition, according to Arsene Wenger. Ouchy! The Arsenal playmaker has not played since breaking his foot in an international friendly against Denmark. ‘Jack started to jog again this week and I would say two to three weeks until he returns to action,’ said Wenger. ‘I spoke with Roy Hodgson, I told him Wilshere will be available for England. He will be just polished for England. ‘I think he will pick him. I didn’t feel any doubt on that front. Jack can prove himself to be  world class at the World Cup. He can be the positive surprise. Pep talk: Wenger has told England manager Roy Hodgson that Wilshere will be polished for the World Cup. ‘England has a very difficult group but if you come out of a group like that your belief is really strong. They have to deal really well with the situation as they have Italy and Uruguay in the group and they have to get out of there.’ Wenger also believes Wilshere is ready to put his long run of injuries behind him and show his consistency next season. A long-term ankle problem meant he did not make a single appearance during the 2011-12 season and just 35 for club and country the following campaign. Yet Wenger says Wilshere has learned a lot during his lay-offs and is adamant he will prove his doubters wrong when he gets a run of games. Stuttered: Wilshere has had a stop-start season after a succession of niggling injuries. ‘He has been stop-start this year and last season,’ he said. ‘I think we have sorted out the problem and I hope from now on he will be always available. ‘I hope he has stabilised now. We have seen with Lionel Messi recently, who is the best player in the world, that being in and out is the most difficult thing to deal with as you need to be competitive and to do that you need to be playing. ‘He is a football man, Jack. You speak to him about something in the game and he understands straight away. He has a natural football understanding. Not much in it: Wenger insists that Arsenal have not fallen behind Liverpool, despite the league table. ‘He watches the game and analyses very well what happens. While they are injured, these players learn, of course. I think he learns from watching the games, from the problems you can face in the game.’ And Wenger has refuted suggestions Arsenal have fallen behind Liverpool this season, saying that the Reds’ lack of European football has helped them while his side have only struggled due to injuries. ‘We beat them twice this season and they also benefited from a season when they played only the Premier League. I do not think if you take the injuries, plus all the competitions we played in and compared it to Liverpool you cannot say we are miles behind them.’","output":"This is a story about a soccer player named Jack Wilshere, who hurt his foot playing in a game. But his coach, Arsene Wenger, says that he is getting better and will be ready to play in the World Cup for England.

(CNN) -- Ten years after the end of its civil war, Angola, which is heading to the polls Friday, has been transformed into a regional African power with a strong economy, but poverty is still widespread. Angola experienced double digit growth in GDP annually in the period 2002-2008. In the last five of these years, average annual growth was at 17%, which more than doubled the size of the economy. The country is the second largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa, and the third biggest economy, after South Africa and Nigeria. Do these tremendous growth rates mean that Angola has escaped the so-called resource curse, where oil resources are detrimental to growth? Is Angola likely to continue growing at these fast rates, and perhaps catch up to the largest economies in the region in a few years' time? Is Angola a success in terms of development and poverty reduction? The fact the Angolan economy is the most concentrated in","output":"the world, with over 90% of its export revenues coming from oil, raises concerns about the sustainability of this growth and the country's ability to truly address issues of poverty and inequality. While economic diversification remains a key challenge for Angola, the government has made efforts to invest in infrastructure and social services. However, a large portion of the population still struggles with access to basic needs such as healthcare, education, and safe drinking water. In conclusion, despite impressive growth rates, Angola's overdependence on oil revenue highlights the importance of diversification and targeted poverty reduction measures to ensure long-term, equitable development for its people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"One of the band members playing his trombone.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A man is playing the clarinet.\\"?","output":"No, it does not logically follow that \\"A man is playing the clarinet\\" if \\"One of the band members is playing his trombone.\\" These two statements are not directly related, and one does not necessarily cause or imply the occurrence of the other. Let's break down the two statements in detail: 1. \\"One of the band members is playing his trombone.\\" This statement establishes that a specific band member is playing a trombone. It provides information about the musical instrument being played (trombone) and indicates that the person playing it is part of a band. However, it doesn't provide any information about other musicians within the same band or what instruments they are playing. 2. \\"A man is playing the clarinet.\\" This statement refers to a person (a man) playing a different musical instrument (clarinet). There is no direct link or connection between this statement and the first one. For example, the man in question could be part of another band, a solo artist, or from the same band mentioned in the first statement, but it doesn't necessarily follow that if the trombonist is playing, the clarinetist must also play. It is entirely possible that a man might be playing the clarinet in the same band as the specified trombonist, or in a different scenario altogether. However, the presence of a trombone player does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the presence of a clarinet player. To make such an assumption, additional information and context would be necessary. Logically speaking, the two statements are independent, and there's no reason to draw a direct connection or inference between the two. Thus, it does not logically follow that \\"A man is playing the clarinet\\" if we know that \\"One of the band members is playing his trombone.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Individuals with a history of being physically or emotionally abused, especially as children, are more prone to suffer from IED, as are those suffering from a personality disorder or other serious mental illnesses. IED may also be linked with repeated traumatic experiences of violence or stress, such as the traumas experienced by active-duty military personnel.  Other mental illnesses are sometimes linked to IED include personality disorders, such as antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and disorders associated with disruptive behavior, such as attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder. Just because an individual displays one or more of these risk factors does not mean they suffer from IED. However, the presence of risk factors in addition to the characteristic symptoms of IED, explosive episodes of rage, should be cause for concern. Everyone finds themselves feeling or expressing anger from time to time, and it's perfectly healthy to do so. Rage, on the other hand, is a destructive emotion that can cause us to act in ways we normally would never think to. While anger may influence the way we behave while experiencing it, rage seems to utterly command our behavior and thought, leaving no room for anything else. Explosive episodes seem to come out of nowhere. An IED sufferer may find themselves in a steady, or even pleasant mood, conducting their daily business when, without warning, they find themselves overwhelmingly angry, displaying uncontrollable, violent behavior. While explosive episodes are most likely to occur in private, often after dark, their unpredictable nature means that they may sometimes occur in places where loud or highly visible expressions of anger are inappropriate, such as at work or in public places. Sufferers of IED often become extremely violent, or even abusive, during their explosive episodes. Seemingly tiny arguments or frustrations can lead, in the blink of an eye, to extraordinary and uncharacteristic displays of physical and emotional cruelty. These displays are usually very sudden in their onset, making them unpredictable and dangerous for everyone involved. Common examples of violent behaviors linked to IED include:  Shouting or screaming, even though the person being spoken to is not raising their voice. Invading personal space, often by stepping close and getting \\"in the face\\" of those nearby. Throwing, hitting, or breaking objects. Shoving, grabbing, or hitting others. Intentionally hurting oneself, such as by slapping or punching, beating one's head against a wall, etc. Name-calling, or use of language intended to hurt or insult others. Threatening others with violence. While the specific behaviors displayed by an IED sufferer during an explosive episode may vary, they are always characterized by being disproportionate, or \\"way over the top\\", relative to the circumstances or events triggering the episode. A true explosive episode can last for several hours before it dissipates naturally.  After an extended episode of rage, the sufferer is likely to feel exhausted, and relieved that the episode has ended. Later, the sufferer may feel intense remorse, shame, and unease while thinking about the things they said and did while experiencing their explosive episode. These feelings can lead the sufferer to become depressed, irritable and removed  An IED sufferer will also often experience much shorter episodes, during which they might momentarily \\"snap\\" at someone in conversation, becoming suddenly verbally or physically hostile before returning to normal. Episodes occur irregularly, with gaps of days, weeks or even months in between. Only a medical expert can diagnose someone with IED, or any other mental illness. Your first step, if you suspect that you or someone you know is suffering from IED, should be to consult with a psychiatrist, councilor or medical doctor about the symptoms and risk factors which are bothering you. Once any anger issues have been diagnosed, you and your doctor can begin exploring options for treatment. Summary:","output":"The article examines Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED), a mental condition characterized by sudden episodes of extreme anger that are disproportionate to the situation, which can include violent or abusive behavior. The piece emphasizes that IED sufferers may have a history of physical/emotional abuse or serious mental illness such as personality disorders, and the condition can also be associated with recurrent violent stress or traumas, like those experienced by military personnel. It illustrates the unpredictable nature of IED episodes, often occurring without any obvious triggering event, in which sufferers exhibit aggressive behaviors such as shouting, invading personal space, causing physical harm to themselves or others, and threatening violence. The article also explains that sufferers often feel remorseful and emotionally drained after these episodes, which can further lead to depression and isolation. Additionally, they may experience shorter episodes where they momentarily display hostility before returning to their normal state. The recurrences of these episodes are irregular, with varying gap periods. The article asserts the importance of seeking a medical expert's opinion if IED is suspected to initiate the appropriate treatment following a proper diagnosis. It further emphasizes that not every individual displaying the described risk factors and symptoms necessarily suffers from IED, but their presence should raise concern. The article ends by reiterating our common experiences with anger and differentiating them from the destructive emotion of rage which dominates the behavior of individuals with IED, leaving no scope for any other emotion or thought."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation.  and the situation: The southern province was exposed to intensive grazing for many years , and now soil quality is poor and dust storms are present. The northern province has more fertile soil, more trees.  Answer the following question: Which province experiences more carbon loss? A:","output":"Based on the given background and situation, the southern province experiences more carbon loss. This can be inferred from the information provided about the degraded land and its impacts on biodiversity, soil quality, and the associated economic losses. In the southern province, the land has been exposed to intensive grazing for many years, which has resulted in poor soil quality and the presence of dust storms. These factors suggest that the soil in this region has experienced significant degradation, making it less capable of retaining essential nutrients such as carbon. The text explicitly mentions that carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau (a likely analog for the southern province) results in substantial economic losses. This implies that degradation, which is occurring in the southern province due to intensive grazing, leads to higher carbon loss. On the other hand, the northern province has more fertile soil and more trees. The presence of trees suggests better overall ecosystem health and a higher capacity for carbon sequestration. Trees, in general, act as carbon sinks, absorbing and storing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This means that the northern province's more abundant tree cover would result in less carbon loss compared to the southern province. In conclusion, the southern province, with its poor soil quality, intensive grazing history, and the presence of dust storms, experiences more carbon loss compared to the northern province, which has more fertile soil and a greater number of trees."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: Who runs Beerfest?

Upon arrival, they find themselves immersed in a high-stakes world of beer games, hilarious competitions, and a legendary rivalry. Behind it all stands the enigmatic and charismatic organizer, Baron Wolfgang von Wolfhausen.  As they delve deeper into the world of Beerfest, the friends learn that the event originated hundreds of years ago as a form of rebellion against the ruling families of Germany, led by Baron Wolfgang's ancestors - the Wolfhausen family. The Barons of the Wolfhausen clan created Beerfest in order to raise funds for their secret society, dedicated to overthrowing the oppressive nobility and establishing a new order of freedom and fairness. However, in recent decades, Beerfest has lost its value and has turned into a self-serving party filled with debauchery for the current Baron. As the competition unfolds, Jack, Lucy, Mike, and Sarah shine in the beer games and attract the attention of Baron Wolfgang himself. He reveals that his family had long ago made their fortunes in America through beer brewing, and in fact, the four friends are long-lost relatives of the von Wolfhausen family. The Baron sees their exceptional beer-game skills as an opportunity to bring purpose back to Beerfest. Over time, the friends learn that the recent Barons of Wolfhausen, including Wolfgang, have grown greedy and corrupt, abandoning the original noble principles of the festival. Dissatisfied with the current state of Beerfest, the friends decide to reform the event, reestablishing it as a platform for raising awareness and funds for social issues, and restoring the original vision of the founding von Wolfhausen ancestors. The climax of the movie unfolds as Jack, Lucy, Mike, and Sarah challenge Baron Wolfgang to a legendary beer tournament, wagering control over the festival. If they win, Beerfest reverts to its initial purpose of making the world a better place, while if they lose, they'll leave Beerfest and never return. After an intense showdown, the friends ultimately prevail, revealing that they have been working with an underground organization to expose the Baron's corrupt practices. In the end, the friends rally together with the Beerfest attendees, renewing the Wolfhausen legacy and transforming the festival into a force for good.

Some of these reviews were published in well-known newspapers, magazines, and online platforms, demonstrating that the general sentiment towards the film was widely negative. Here are some examples: 1. Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times: In his review, Ebert called the movie a \\"deranged\\" version of the original 1973 film, questioning most of the creative choices made by LaBute. He expressed frustration with the plot's lacking coherence and emphasized that much of the intended suspense and drama came across as unintentional humor. 2. Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian: Bradshaw described \\"The Wicker Man\\" remake as \\"lamentable,\\" comparing it unfavorably to Robin Hardy's 1973 original. He criticized the acting, particularly Nicolas Cage's performance, and pointed out that the film's attempts at psychological terror often resulted in laughter from audiences. 3. Manohla Dargis, The New York Times: Dargis expressed disappointment in the film, citing its diminished horror when compared to the original movie. She noted that the film's story lacked expansiveness and depth, and took issue with the casting of Nicolas Cage, whose performance was often absurd and cartoonish. 4. James Berardinelli, ReelViews: Berardinelli echoed the consensus that \\"The Wicker Man\\" remake was a failure, finding fault in the adaptation of the original's nuanced plot to a Hollywood-style production. He critiqued the film's confusing narrative and poor pacing, adding that the resulting unintentional humor detracted from its intended horror theme. 5. Scott Foundas, LA Weekly: Foundas labeled the film a \\"travesty,\\" detailing the struggle to identify a single element in the new adaptation that surpassed its predecessor. He took particular issue with the screenplay, remarking that the characters and dialogue lacked any sense of believability or logic. These reviews, along with several others, were instrumental in shaping the overall critical consensus of \\"The Wicker Man\\" as puzzlingly misguided. The film was widely panned for its lack of narrative coherence, unintentional comedy, and weak performances, failing to live up to the impact of the original 1973 movie."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The passage now reads: \\"And the he-goat became very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken, and in its place came up four other horns turned to the four winds of heaven.\\" This passage is taken from Daniel 8:8, which is a part of Daniel's vision of a ram and a goat. In this vision, Daniel sees a powerful he-goat with a prominent horn between its eyes. The goat becomes very powerful and dominant, but at the peak of its strength, the great horn is broken. In place of the broken horn, four other horns grow, pointing towards the four winds of heaven. These events are believed to represent historical occurrences and the rise and fall of specific kingdoms. To provide some context, the book of Daniel is traditionally placed within the context of the Babylonian exile (605-539 BCE), when the southern kingdom of Judah was conquered, and its elites were exiled to Babylon. Daniel is one of those exiles who serve in the court of the Babylonian king and later under the Persian rulers. Biblical scholars have interpreted the passage in different ways. Some of them believe that the he-goat symbolizes the empire of Alexander the Great, who conquered the then-known world and defeated the Persian Empire. The breaking of the great horn can be interpreted as the death of Alexander the Great at the height of his power and success. The emergence of the four other horns represents the division of Alexander's empire into four kingdoms after his death. These kingdoms were ruled by his generals, also known as the Diadochi. The four winds of heaven, in this interpretation, represent the geographical directions to which the four generals expanded their respective territories. In conclusion, the passage in its original form had all the words connected, making it challenging to read. By adding appropriate spaces, the passage from Daniel 8:8 becomes much more legible and provides insight into a prophetic vision of a he-goat and its broken horn, symbolizing historical events relating to powerful kingdoms and their rulers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Dead Snow Context: A woman, Sara, is being chased through the snows of Norway. She is ultimately cornered and eaten by zombies in World War II Nazi SS uniforms. Seven students on Easter vacation arrive at a small cabin near Ãksfjord. The cabin is owned by Sara, Vegard's girlfriend. The group begins to drink and party until a mysterious hiker arrives. He tells them the dark history of the region; during World War II, a force of Einsatzgruppe, led by StandartenfÃ¼hrer Herzog, occupied the area. For three years, the Nazis abused and tortured the local people. Near the end of the war, with Germany's defeat looming, the soldiers looted all the town's valuables. However, the citizens staged an uprising and ambushed them, killing many. The survivors, including Herzog and Michael Schwab, were chased into the mountains, and it was assumed that they all froze to death. The hiker then continues on his way. That night, Vegard wakes to a figure placing something beneath the floorboards of the cabin. He calls out, believing it to be Sara, but she ignores him and leaves. Vegard follows, and finds her outside covered in blood. Vegard suddenly jolts awake in his bed, revealing it was a dream. Meanwhile, the hiker has set up camp in the mountains and is eating dinner when he is disturbed by a noise outside. He investigates, and is attacked and killed by a zombie. The next morning, Vegard, out looking for Sara, discovers the hiker's body. He searches the area, falls through the snow into a cave, and is knocked unconscious. After sunset, Erlend finds an old wooden box filled with valuables and golden trinkets. They celebrate, and one of them pockets a gold coin. They eventually return the rest of the treasure to the box. Erlend goes to the outhouse where he and Chris have sex. Afterwards, Erlend return to the cabin, and drops a gold coin. Chris is attacked by a zombie, and killed. The others leave the cabin to look for her, and find Sara's rucksack buried in the snow. Upon returning to the cabin, they are attacked.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Mixture brew two cups of boiling water. Insist in a thermos 6 hours, filter and spray the apartment. Please remove spaces between words.","output":"To effectively follow your task, you need to create a herbal mixture that you will brew in boiling water, let it steep in a thermos for six hours, then filter it and spray the mixture around your apartment for the desired purpose (freshening the air, repelling insects, or a similar goal). Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this: 1. Select the herbs and ingredients: Determine the purpose of the mixture – whether as a room freshener, insect repellent, or for another specific usage. Research and choose the appropriate herbs and natural ingredients that will provide the desired effect. For example, if you want a refreshing room scent, you may choose herbs like lavender, eucalyptus, or mint. For an insect repellent, consider using ingredients like citronella, lemongrass, or rosemary. 2. Prepare the herbs: After deciding on the suitable herbs or ingredients, gather and measure the needed quantities. Chop or crush them to release their oils and fragrances. You may also consider drying the herbs first to preserve them for future use and concentrate their properties. 3. Boil water: Measure two cups of water and bring it to a rolling boil in a kettle or pot. It must be extremely hot to properly steep the ingredients and extract their beneficial properties. 4. Combine boiling water and herbs: Carefully and quickly pour the boiling water over the prepared herbs in a heat-proof container. Stir the mixture gently to ensure that all the ingredients are equally submerged. 5. Transfer the mixture to a thermos: Pour the hot herbal blend into a thermos and seal it tightly. This will help retain the heat during the infusion process. 6. Steep the mixture for six hours: Allow the herbs to steep for six hours to ensure that the water absorbs all the necessary oils, fragrances, and other beneficial properties from the herbs. 7. Filter the mixture: After six hours, open the thermos and carefully strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or a piece of cheesecloth to separate the liquid from the herb particles. You may discard the used herbs. 8. Prepare your spraying device: Fill a clean spray bottle with the filtered herbal mixture. Be sure to select a suitable bottle with an adjustable nozzle that allows you to control the force and direction of the spray. 9. Spray the apartment: Proceed to spray the herbal mixture around your apartment as desired. Make sure to cover all the necessary areas and surfaces, depending on your intended purpose. For example, if you aim to repel insects, be sure to spray the mixture near doors and windows to discourage insects from entering your home. Following these steps should result in a successfully brewed and sprayed herbal mixture that suits your specific purpose. Remember to store any leftover mixture in a sealed bottle or jar for future use, and clean your spraying device thoroughly after use."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Given this review: \\"Very handy and useful\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

Please answer the following question: Information:  - A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose electronic computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. PCs are intended to be operated directly by a person using a graphical user interface such as Windows. The versatility of a personal computer is greatly enhanced by the use of peripheral devices such as a keyboard, monitor, printer, mouse, speakers, and an external hard drive.  - Microsoft Office is an office suite of applications, servers, and services developed by Microsoft. It was first announced by Bill Gates on 1 August 1988, at COMDEX in Las Vegas. Initially a marketing term for a bundled set of applications, the first version of Office contained Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint. Over the years, Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, OLE data integration and Visual Basic for Applications scripting language. Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the Office Business Applications brand. On 10 July 2012, Softpedia reported that Office is used by over a billion people worldwide.  - Redmond is a city in King County, Washington, United States, located east of Seattle, within the Seattle metropolitan area. The population is 60,560 in 2016, an increase from the 2010 census, up from 45,256 in 2000 census. Redmond is commonly recognized as the home of Microsoft and Nintendo of America. With an annual bike race on city streets and the state's only velodrome, Redmond is also known as the \\"Bicycle Capital of the Northwest\\".  - An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. All computer programs, excluding firmware, require an operating system to function.  - Money laundering is the process of transforming the profits of crime and corruption into ostensibly 'legitimate' assets. In a number of legal and regulatory systems, however, the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial and business crime, and is sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system (involving things such as securities, digital currencies, credit cards, and traditional currency), including terrorism financing and evasion of international sanctions. Most anti-money laundering laws openly conflate money laundering (which is concerned with \\"source\\" of funds) with terrorism financing (which is concerned with \\"destination\\" of funds) when regulating the financial system.  - Internet Explorer (formerly Microsoft Internet Explorer and Windows Internet Explorer, commonly abbreviated IE or MSIE) is a discontinued series of graphical web browsers developed by Microsoft and included as part of the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, starting in 1995. It was first released as part of the add-on package Plus! for Windows 95 that year. Later versions were available as free downloads, or in service packs, and included in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) service releases of Windows 95 and later versions of Windows.  - Robert Alan Soloway is the founder of the so - called \`\` Strategic Partnership Against Microsoft Illegal Spam , '' or SPAMIS , but is said to be one of the Internet 's biggest spammers through his company , Newport Internet Marketing ( NIM ) . He was arrested on May 30 , 2007 , after a grand jury indicted him on charges of identity theft , money laundering , and mail , wire , and e-mail fraud . He was nicknamed the \`\` Spam King '' by prosecutors .  - In common usage, theft is the taking of another person's property or services without that person's permission or consent with the intent to deprive the rightful owner of it. The word is also used as an informal shorthand term for some crimes against property, such as burglary, embezzlement, larceny, looting, robbery, shoplifting, library theft, and fraud (\\"i.e.\\", obtaining money under false pretenses). In some jurisdictions, theft is considered to be synonymous with larceny; in others, theft has replaced larceny. Someone who carries out an act of or makes a career of theft is known as a thief. The act of theft is also known by other terms such as stealing, thieving, and filching.  - Consumer electronics or home electronics are electronic or digital equipment intended for everyday use, typically in private homes. Consumer electronics include devices used for entertainment (flatscreen TVs, DVD players, DVD movies, iPods, video games, remote control cars, etc.), communications (telephones, cell phones, e-mail-capable laptops, etc.), and home-office activities (e.g., desktop computers, printers, paper shredders, etc.). In British English, they are often called brown goods by producers and sellers, to distinguish them from \\"white goods\\" such as washing machines and refrigerators. In the 2010s, this distinction is not always present in large big box consumer electronics stores, such as Best Buy, which sell both entertainment, communications, and home office devices and kitchen appliances such as refrigerators. Consumer electronics stores differ from professional audio stores in that the former sells consumer-grade electronics for private use, whereas the latter sells professional-grade electronics designed for use by audio engineers and audio technicians.  - Identity theft is the deliberate use of someone else's identity, usually as a method to gain a financial advantage or obtain credit and other benefits in the other person's name, and perhaps to the other person's disadvantage or loss. The person whose identity has been assumed may suffer adverse consequences if they are held responsible for the perpetrator's actions. Identity theft occurs when someone uses another's personally identifying information, like their name, identifying number, or credit card number, without their permission, to commit fraud or other crimes. The term \\"identity theft\\" was coined in 1964.  - A video game console is an electronic, digital or computer device that outputs a video signal or visual image to display a video game that one or more people can play.  - A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for retrieving, presenting and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web. An \\"information resource\\" is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI/URL) that may be a web page, image, video or other piece of content. Hyperlinks present in resources enable users easily to navigate their browsers to related resources.  - Microsoft Windows (or simply Windows) is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. It consists of several families of operating systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry with the OS typically associated with IBM PC compatible architecture. Active Windows families include Windows NT, Windows Embedded and Windows Phone; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE) or Windows Server. Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x; Windows 10 Mobile is an active product, unrelated to the defunct family Windows Mobile.  - A court is a tribunal, often as a government institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law. In both common law and civil law legal systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all persons have an ability to bring their claims before a court. Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court.  - Microsoft Corporation (commonly referred to as Microsoft or MS) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington, that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics and personal computers and services. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, Microsoft Office office suite, and Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface tablet lineup. As of 2016, it was the world's largest software maker by revenue, and one of the world's most valuable companies.  - In law, fraud is deliberate deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain, or to deprive a victim of a legal right. Fraud itself can be a civil wrong (i.e., a fraud victim may sue the fraud perpetrator to avoid the fraud and/or recover monetary compensation), a criminal wrong (i.e., a fraud perpetrator may be prosecuted and imprisoned by governmental authorities) or it may cause no loss of money, property or legal right but still be an element of another civil or criminal wrong. The purpose of fraud may be monetary gain or other benefits, such as obtaining a driver's license or qualifying for a mortgage by way of false statements.  - Terrorism financing refers to activities that provides financing or financial support to individual terrorists or terrorist groups. A government that maintains a list of terrorist organizations normally will also pass laws to prevent money laundering being used to finance those organizations.  - Grand jury is a legal body empowered to conduct official proceedings and investigate potential criminal conduct, and determine whether criminal charges should be brought. A grand jury may compel the production of documents and compel sworn testimony of witnesses to appear before it. Grand jury is separate from the courts, which do not preside over its functioning.  - Law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'occupation' with 'criminal'.

To many property developers and local government officials, housing price in China is still low compared with many developed countries. However, the average housing price in the United States is only 8, 000 yuan per square metre, while in China, it is even higher than that in the United States. \\"This shows that there are some bubbles  in Chinese real estate  market,\\" the International Finance News reported. Although the average price of residential houses in the United States, after changed to RMB, is about 8, 000 yuan per square metre, the houses in the US are not sold in terms of building area, as most Chinese property developers do when they sell their houses. If the US property developers sell their houses according to the building area, then the housing price will be even lower than 8, 000 yuan per square metre. In most big Chinese cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, houses are sold at a price even higher than those in the US. The high housing price in large cities in China proves that Chinese real estate market does have some bubbles. Moreover, Chinese houses cannot be compared with houses in the US in terms of building quality, environment and supporting facilities. Furthermore, it should be noted that American people's average income is several dozen times higher than that of Chinese people. How can the Chinese afford to buy a house which is even more expensive than that sold in the US? At the beginning of 2007, Chinese government issued a set of policies that aimed to benefit the public. Now in order to reduce the high housing prices, the government can regulate the real estate market by raising tax on property industry and controlling the release of loans and lands to property developers.

Choose a location where the girl will likely feel comfortable, such as your home or a hotel room. Make sure you'll be alone and uninterrupted while you're hooking up. For instance, you might take her to your home or you might ask to go back to hers. If you can't take her home, you could rent a hotel room or arrange to go to a friend's home. Consent is essential when you’re hooking up. Don’t assume that she wants to have sex just because she agrees to be alone with you. Pay attention to her words and body language to see if she’s into it. When in doubt, ask her directly if she wants to have sex.  Signs she’s into it include smiling, initiating kissing and physical contact, asking you to do sexual things to her, and getting close to you. Signals she’s not into it include pulling away, looking away from you, and changing the subject. You could just ask, “Do you want to have sex?” or “Do you want to take this to the bedroom?” Hooking up can be super fun, but it’s important to avoid potential complications. Talk to the girl before you become intimate to decide what kind of protection you'll use. Ask her if she is currently on birth control pills, has received a birth control shot, or has an intrauterine device (IUD) to prevent pregnancy. Additionally, wear a condom or dental dam to protect you against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Even if the girl is on birth control, it’s typically best to use a barrier form of protection to protect against STDs anyway. Start by kissing her on the hand, arm, or cheek. Then, give her a passionate kiss on the lips. If you’re both into it, kiss her in other intimate places, like her neck, breasts, or thighs.  Go slow at first. Give her a light kiss and gauge her reaction. Don’t use tongue when you first start kissing her. Build up to it so she doesn’t feel like you’re rushing things. She’s going to be more interested in a hookup if she feels sexually excited. Don’t rush things by trying to start intercourse too soon. Instead, take your time to caress her, kiss her body, and rub against her. This will help her get into the mood for sex. For instance, start by gently caressing her body. Then, move from kissing her lips to making a trail of kisses down her neck, chest, stomach, and thighs. Simply shift her clothing or remove it as you go. Don't just get up an leave after a hook-up. Instead, talk to the girl to make sure she enjoyed it. Then, clean yourself up and get dressed. If you're at her place, thank her for having you over before you leave. If you're at your place, offer to help her get home safely. If you've gotten a hotel room, ask her if she'd prefer to stay overnight or go home. Both your and her experience will be better if you part on good terms. Show her that you care about her health and well-being by helping her get home. Offer to drive her home or to call her a ride if she can't drive herself home. If she's got her car and feels comfortable driving herself home, walk her to her car and ask her to text when she gets home. If you stay the night together, talk to her before you fall asleep so you both understand each other's expectations for the morning after. For instance, decide if you're both okay with the person who slept over leaving without waking the other. While you might not be interested in a relationship, it's still important to be kind to the girl you hooked-up with. Tell her that you enjoyed meeting her and had a good time. Additionally, ask her if she had a nice time so she feels like you care about her.  You might text, \\"It was great meeting you last night! I had a great time and hope you did, as well.\\" You don't have to have a long conversation with her. However, sending a check-up text shows her that you don't just see her as an object.","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of communication and consent when approaching a hookup. It suggests choosing a comfortable location for both parties, such as a home, hotel room, or a friend's place, ensuring privacy and uninterrupted time together. Consent should never be assumed, and it is vital to pay attention to verbal cues and body language. If unsure, directly asking for consent helps maintain a clear, respectful understanding. Among other things, discussing protection and birth control methods prior to getting intimate is essential to avoid potential complications. Furthermore, the article suggests taking the time to build up excitement by slowly progressing from light physical contact to more intimate actions rather than rushing into intercourse. After the hookup, it's important to check in with one another to ensure that both parties enjoyed the experience. Parting on good terms, addressing each other's health and well-being, and assisting with transportation are significant steps that show kindness and consideration, even if there is no intention of pursuing a relationship. Lastly, sending a follow-up text emphasizes that the other person is more than just an object and instills a sense of respect and conscientiousness for the encounter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Brink has recently taken Pud's (Bobs Watson) parents in an auto wreck.  Brink later comes for Gramps. Believing Brink to be an ordinary stranger, the crotchety old Gramps orders Mr. Brink off the property. Pud comes out of the house and asks who the stranger was. Gramps is surprised and relieved that someone else could see the stranger; he was not merely a dream or apparition. Pud tells Gramps that when he does a good deed, he will be able to make a wish. Because his apples are constantly being stolen, Gramps wishes that anyone who climbs up his apple tree will have to stay there until he permits them to climb down. Pud inadvertently tests the wish when he has trouble coming down from the tree himself, becoming free only when Gramps says he can. Pud's busybody Aunt Demetria has designs on Pud and the money left him by his parents. Gramps spends much time fending off her efforts to adopt the boy. Brink takes Granny Nellie in a peaceful death just after she finishes a bit of knitting. When Mr. Brink returns again for Gramps, the old man finally realizes who his visitor is. Determined not to leave Pud to Demetria, Gramps tricks Mr. Brink into climbing the apple tree. While stuck in the tree, he cannot take Gramps or anyone else. The only way anyone or anything can die is if Gramps touches Mr. Brink or the apple tree. Demetria plots to have Gramps committed to a psychiatric hospital when he claims that Death is trapped in his apple tree. Gramps proves his story first by proving that his doctor, Dr. Evans, can not even kill a fly they have captured. He offers further proof of his power by shooting Mr. Grimes, the orderly who has come to take him to the asylum; Grimes lives when he should have died. Answer:","output":"In the given context, after Mr. Brink (Death) cannot get the crotchety old Gramps, he takes Granny Nellie.

(CNN) -- Washington's relentless focus on crisis tends to cloud its ability to see great opportunities. With more than 40 African heads of state coming to Washington this week for three days of meetings with President Barack Obama, Cabinet officials, members of Congress and American business leaders, the United States has a real opportunity to jump-start what has been a slow evolution in the way we have engaged with Africa. It's an opportunity that should not be missed. Foreign assistance is no longer America's primary export to Africa, and our engagement needs to change, too. The U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit is an opportunity to showcase and strengthen a relationship that is evolving dramatically on economic, security and development fronts. Africa will emerge as the next great growth market and opportunity of the 21st century, and China will not miss \\"the next","output":"Asia.\\" The United States must recognize and seize the moment to build stronger economic partnerships, enhance regional and global security, and support sustainable development in Africa. The U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit is the perfect platform to demonstrate and solidify America's commitment to the continent, paving the way for a new era of collaboration and shared prosperity. In the past, the United States' focus on Africa has often been limited to providing foreign aid and humanitarian assistance. While these efforts are crucial in addressing critical challenges like poverty, disease, and hunger, they do not alone foster the long-term, sustainable development that Africa needs. To truly harness Africa's potential, the United States must broaden its approach, engaging with the continent as a strategic partner rather than simply a recipient of aid. One key area where this shift must occur is in trade and investment. The United States must work to increase its presence in Africa's rapidly expanding markets, which are projected to boast some of the fastest-growing populations and middle classes in the coming decades. Africa's consumer spending is expected to reach 2.1 trillion by 2025, offering immense opportunities for American businesses across sectors from infrastructure and energy to technology and agriculture. By investing in African businesses and forging commercial partnerships with African entrepreneurs, U.S. companies can tap into this burgeoning market and create mutually beneficial relationships that contribute to the continent's economic growth and job creation. Furthermore, improving digital connectivity and expanding access to technology is crucial for Africa's development in the 21st century. The United States can play a leading role in bridging the digital divide by working with African governments and private sector partners to increase internet access, promote digital literacy, and foster innovation. By helping African countries leverage technology to support sectors like education, healthcare, and financial services, the United States can contribute to Africa's ongoing digital transformation and enable the continent to leapfrog over some developmental barriers. On the security front, as Africa continues to grapple with issues like terrorism, organized crime, and ongoing conflicts, the United States must deepen its security cooperation with African governments and regional organizations, providing training, equipment, and intelligence support to help build resilient security institutions. By working with African partners to establish robust security networks, the United States can not only contribute to the continent's stability but also safeguard its own national security interests by curbing the spread of extremist ideologies and transnational criminal networks. Finally, the U.S.-Africa partnership should focus on empowering the next generation of African leaders and entrepreneurs through capacity-building programs, educational initiatives, and cultural exchanges. The United States has a wealth of knowledge and experience that can be shared with Africa, and promoting the right policy frameworks, institutional development, and good governance will be essential for unleashing the full potential of Africa's human capital. In conclusion, the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit is a pivotal opportunity for the United States to reevaluate and reshape its relationship with Africa, moving beyond the traditional focus on foreign aid. By embracing a more comprehensive and strategic approach that includes trade and investment, technology, security cooperation, and people-to-people ties, the United States can foster a new era of shared growth, development, and partnership with Africa – and ensure it does not miss out on the vast economic and geopolitical opportunities the continent offers in the 21st century."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information:  - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.  - Dead Space was the only album released by Omaha , Nebraska natives Slowdown Virginia . Released by Lumberjack Records ( which later became Saddle Creek ) in 1994 , the album was pressed in a small amount of copies ( aimed at the local scene without expecting a much larger fan base ) . Shortly after the release of the album , Slowdown Virginia broke up . Most the members went on to form Cursive , who have since become major contenders in the indie rock circuit , making Dead Space a major collector 's item . Dead Space LBJ - 003 Track List : 01 - Supernova ' 75 02 - Dave Mustang 03 - Vicki My Sick Gills 04 - Whipping Stick 05 - Martian Landing 06 - Dave Mustang Reprise 07 - Breaking Branches 08 - Blame 09 - Cross-Eyed 10 - Fork in My Socket 11 - Another Slip 12 - Untitled 13 - Juan Pablo Shoe  - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish. The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function.  - Slowdown Virginia was an indie rock band from Omaha, Nebraska. Formed in 1993, the band recorded and released one album, \\"Dead Space\\", on Lumberjack Records in 1994, the predecessor to today's Saddle Creek Records. After playing an influential role in inspiring the later formation of other Omaha bands like Bright Eyes, The Faint, and Desaparecidos with their energetic live shows and recordings, Slowdown Virginia broke up in the spring of 1995. A month after breaking up, Kasher, Maginn, and Pedersen regrouped with a new drummer to form Cursive. Omaha's mixed entertainment venue Slowdown is named in honor of the band.  - The Faint is an American indie rock band. Formed in Omaha, Nebraska, the band consists of Todd Fink, Jacob Thiele, Dapose, Joel Petersen and Clark Baechle. The Faint was originally known as Norman Bailer and included Conor Oberst (of Bright Eyes, with whom the Faint toured in 2005). He quit shortly after the band was formed, though the Faint continued to share a spot with Bright Eyes on Saddle Creek Records.  - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns.  - Saddle Creek Records is an American record label based in Omaha, Nebraska. Started as a college class project on entrepreneurship, the label was founded by Mike Mogis and Justin Oberst in 1993 (as Lumberjack Records). Mogis soon turned over his role in the company to Robb Nansel. The label is named after Saddle Creek Road, a street that cuts through the east side of midtown Omaha, and the beginnings of a scene whose members included Conor Oberst (then a solo artist, currently of Bright Eyes, Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band, Desaparecidos and Monsters of Folk), Tim Kasher (then of Slowdown Virginia, currently of Cursive and The Good Life), and others. Collectively, they were known unofficially as the \\"Creekers\\". Saddle Creek first appeared in print on a show flyer, offering to \\"Spend an evening with Saddle Creek\\" (later to be the title of the label's DVD.) Saddle Creek became an incorporated entity as a result of a class project on entrepreneurship. Distribution is handled by the Alternative Distribution Alliance, which is under the Warner Music Group umbrella.  - Omaha is the largest city in the state of Nebraska and the county seat of Douglas County. Omaha is located in the Midwestern United States on the Missouri River, about north of the mouth of the Platte River.

(CNN)With crews from around the world aiding in the search, 30 bodies have been recovered from the wreckage of AirAsia Flight QZ8501, Indonesian officials said Friday. What appears to be a piece of the fuselage was found, Singapore's Defense Ministry said. It resembles a window panel. Finding the fuselage and the plane's \\"black boxes\\" are a priority, Indonesia's search and rescue agency said Friday.  There are 59 teams of divers involved, the agency's chief Bambang Sulistyo said, according to the state-run Antara news agency. The USS Sampson, the U.S. Navy ship that is helping with the search, recovered some of the bodies, the U.S. Seventh Fleet said Friday. Indonesian authorities have identified four of the recovered bodies so far. The first victim they identified, an Indonesian woman named Hayati Lutfiah Hamid, was buried Thursday. Many family members are waiting in Surabaya for news about their loved ones. But with 162 people on the plane when it took off from Surabaya, Indonesia, crews have a long way to go. Who was on the plane. AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes said he was traveling Friday to Surabaya to bring the body of flight attendant Khairunisa Haidar Fauzi home. \\"I cannot describe how I feel.  There are no words,\\" he said on Twitter. The other two people identified are Grayson Herbert Linaksita and Kevin Alexander Soetjipto, Indonesian authorities said. Search efforts are concentrated in a zone covering 1,575 square nautical miles (5,400 square kilometers) that officials believe is the \\"most probable area\\" to find the remains of the aircraft. But on Friday, waves in the Java Sea as high as four meters (13 feet) were making it hard for divers search underwater. The weather is \\"the biggest obstacle,\\" said Bambang Hermanu, chief of police in Indonesia's Central Kalimantan province, where much of the search operation is based. Anguish revisited: Relatives of MH370 victims speak. Here's more key information about where things stand on Flight QZ8501:. The flight. What we know: The aircraft took off early Sunday from Surabaya, bound for Singapore. Roughly 35 minutes into the flight, the pilot asked air traffic control for permission to turn left and climb to avoid bad weather. Minutes later, the plane disappeared from air traffic control's radar. What we don't know: What happened on board after contact with the plane was lost. No distress call was received. Indonesian aviation authorities have suggested that the plane ascended despite permission being denied because of traffic. Some experts have speculated that the aircraft might have experienced an aerodynamic stall because of a lack of speed or from flying at too sharp an angle to get enough lift. Analysts have also suggested that the pilots might not have been getting information from onboard systems about the plane's position, or that rain or hail from thunderstorms in the area could have damaged the engines. Until the main wreckage of the plane is found, along with the flight recorders, experts have little evidence to support their theories. How can a modern airliner vanish? The search. What we know: Search teams found debris and some bodies 100 to 200 kilometers (about 60 to 120 miles) from the aircraft's last known location over the Java Sea, Indonesia's search and rescue agency said. What we don't know: The exact location of the body of the aircraft. An Indonesian search official told CNN on Wednesday that he thought sonar equipment had detected wreckage from Flight 8501 at the bottom of the Java Sea. But the country's search and rescue chief said the plane hadn't been found yet. Bad weather has hindered the search operation. The ones who missed the flight. The investigation. What we know: The key to understanding what happened may be in the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, commonly known as black boxes. The black boxes, which are actually orange, are in the tail of Airbus 320-200s. If recovered, they will be taken to a lab in Jakarta, Indonesia, to be analyzed, said Tatang Kurniadi, head of Indonesia's National Committee for Transportation Safety. The batteries powering the \\"pingers\\" that send acoustic signals have only about 24 days of power left, officials said. What we don't know: Where the plane's remains might have been taken by the elements. Investigators will need to use information gleaned from the flight recorders and clues from the wreckage. \\"The more bits I can put into my mosaic, the better my picture will be,\\" aviation safety expert Michael Barr said. \\"The better the picture, the better I can come up with an understanding of what happened.\\" But the conditions at sea make that work much more difficult than on land. \\"In the water, you are working with currents and winds, and so the pieces won't be where they had the initial impact,\\" he said. What happens next? The plane and the pilots. What we know: The 6-year-old Airbus A320-200, operated by AirAsia's Indonesian affiliate, had accumulated around 23,000 flight hours in about 13,600 flights, according to Airbus. The plane's last scheduled maintenance was on November 16. Flight 8501's veteran captain, Iriyanto, 53, had 20,537 flying hours, 6,100 of them with AirAsia on the Airbus A320, the airline said. The first officer, Remi Emmanuel Plesel, 46, had 2,275 flying hours, a reasonable amount for his position. What we don't know: Whether technical problems, human error or other issues were involved in the crash. According to information from the Aviation Safety Network accident database, there have been 54 incidents involving the A320. \\"In the A320 family, accidents and incidents range from fan-cowl detachment, landing gear collapse, bird strikes, right through to hull losses through pilot error,\\" said Kane Ray, an analyst with the International Bureau of Aviation, a global aviation consulting group. \\"Most aircraft have teething problems, and in most cases, these are eradicated. Very rarely, these issues cause disasters -- largely because of a culmination of factors that lead to the event,\\" Ray said.

It's not Miyazaki's best work, but it is leagues beyond any traditional 2-D animation out of 3-D-mad Hollywood lately, and more beguiling than anything Disney's done in ages. 2. A gorgeous, life-affirming piece whose anti-war message is particularly timely. 3. Emphatically passionate and fraught with greater meaning. 4. The visual power of Miyazaki's animation is as strong as ever, but it's all for naught when you can't make heads or tails of the story on screen. 5. Glitches in storytelling and stunt casting cannot overshadow the wondrous sights that Miyazaki doles out for our approval. 6. The story works on many levels, including as an anti-war fable, but its central theme is about the matchless power of love. 7. While there's no denying Miyazaki's visual flair and tip-top draughtsmanship, I found myself less than enchanted by the mile-high convolutions of the plot, and frankly bored by the final half-hour. 8. Miyazaki's expertise at drafting, along with his eye for detail and ability to infuse a story with heart, results in a wonderfully entertaining film. 9. Howl's Moving Castle moves -- in short, choppy, jumpy jerks that will never make anyone forget how fluid the truly great hand-drawn cartoons look by comparison. 10. With such an unfocused, impenetrable center, the film grows dull. What was the overall consensus about the movie?","output":"The overall consensus about the movie appears to be mixed but leans more towards the positive side. Several reviews praise the film's visual flair, animation, and anti-war message, with many considering it as a life-affirming and captivating experience. Some reviewers appreciate the movie's theming and entertaining nature, stating that it works on multiple levels, including its central theme about the power of love. However, there are also criticisms regarding the storytelling and plot. Some reviewers find the plot convoluted, the pacing choppy, and the story impenetrable, which affected their engagement and enjoyment of the film. A few even mentioned that these issues overshadowed the remarkable animation and visuals. Overall, from the listed reviews, it can be concluded that the movie has outstanding visuals and a compelling anti-war message, but its storytelling and plot may not be as effective or engaging for some viewers, leading to a mixed, yet mostly positive reception."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Build a movie plot around this: Who is sacrificed by Pang ? Zhao The answer to this question is:","output":"Step 1: Establish the main characters In order to create a movie plot around \\"Who is sacrificed by Pang? Zhao,\\" we first need to establish our main characters. In this case, we have two characters, Pang and Zhao. We can further develop these characters by giving them a backstory, personality traits, and motivations. Pang: A cunning and ambitious individual who will do anything to achieve power and success. Pang comes from a lower-class background and has always felt the need to prove himself. He is manipulative and sees people as pawns in his grand schemes. Zhao: A loyal and trustworthy friend, Zhao is the complete opposite of Pang. Kind-hearted and genuine, Zhao has always believed in the power of friendship and trust. He is intelligent and quick-witted but prefers to use his skills for the greater good rather than for personal gain. Step 2: Determine the setting The setting for our movie plot could be a sprawling, ancient kingdom filled with political intrigue, betrayals, and power struggles. This helps create an environment where our characters' motivations and actions can flourish as well as create tension in the narrative. Step 3: Outline the main events 1. Introduction: The movie starts by presenting the friendship and bond between Pang and Zhao as they grow up together in the kingdom. They both dream of rising through the ranks and making a difference in the kingdom. 2. Rising Tension: As they grow older, their paths diverge. Pang increasingly focuses on using any means necessary to gain power, while Zhao remains true to his beliefs in loyalty and trust. This tension grows as they both secure positions within the kingdom's political system. 3. The Sacrifice: In order to secure a powerful alliance and discredit potential threats to his position, Pang concocts a plot to frame Zhao for treason, setting him up as the sacrificial pawn. He manipulates events so that Zhao is accused, tried, and sentenced to death. 4. The Aftermath: Following Zhao's death, Pang achieves his goal of obtaining a position of great power in the kingdom. However, his guilt over sacrificing his once best friend begins to eat away at him. He starts to question whether obtaining power was truly worth the cost. And ultimately his ambition leads to his own downfall. Step 4: The climax and conclusion 1. Climax: Pang's position of power leads him to face grave challenges from within and outside the kingdom. His enemies use his past actions against him and expose the truth about his betrayal and sacrifice of Zhao. A revolt starts, and Pang loses everything he's built. 2. Conclusion: The kingdom is ultimately saved by a new leader, one who embodies Zhao's ideals of loyalty, trust, and selflessness. Pang, now a broken man, is left reflecting on the price of his ambition and how his greed led to his own destruction. By following these steps, we have built a movie plot around the question, \\"Who is sacrificed by Pang? Zhao.\\" The story focuses on themes of betrayal, ambition, loyalty, and the consequences of one's actions, with a tragic ending that highlights the importance of staying true to one's beliefs and values."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This technique helped reduce unwanted vibrations and improved the overall sound quality of the recordings."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The hijackers attacked at 9:28. While traveling 35,000 feet above eastern Ohio, United 93 suddenly dropped 700 feet. Eleven seconds into the descent, the FAA's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft. During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring \\"Mayday\\" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit. The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing. The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:\\" Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here.\\" On the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers. This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001. But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation. The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams. They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff. On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers. The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando International Airport in August. Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight. FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals, usually air carrier or FAA personnel. We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight. All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them. We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial pilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the passengers.  After reading the above, is \\"he preferred to remain standing\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Jarrah remained seated where during the takeover?\\"? Select from: [I] no; [II] yes;","output":"I'm going to explain this to you like you're five years old. There were some bad people called hijackers who took over a plane called United 93. This happened a long time ago on a day called 9/11. One of the bad guys was named Jarrah. When the bad guys took over the plane, Jarrah was sitting in his seat. He stayed there until they got control of the cockpit, where the pilots sit. Then Jarrah went inside the cockpit. So, the correct answer to the question \\"Jarrah remained seated where during the takeover?\\" is [I] no. He did not prefer to remain standing. He stayed seated until he went into the cockpit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

On the positive side, the user is expressing their interest and excitement in upgrading and playing with a Mac Pro, a device known for its high performance and design. The use of \\"lol\\" indicates that the user is in a light-hearted mood while discussing their desire for the computer. The choice of words like \\"play\\" and \\"pennies\\" also contributes to the casual tone of the tweet, making it seem like a friendly conversation about the user's interest in technology products. However, there is also a touch of negative sentiment in the tweet. The user mentions that they'll have to \\"keep saving [their] pennies,\\" which implies that the cost of the Mac Pro is a considerable factor in their decision making and might be a source of frustration or financial stress. This suggests that the user desires the product but is aware of the financial commitment required to obtain it. In summary, the sentiment in this tweet can be characterized as a mix of positive (enthusiasm about the product) and negative (financial stress).

To solve this problem for 'o', we first simplify both sides of the equation.  On the right side, you subtract 405 from 1149 to get -1554: -405 - 1149 = -1554 So the equation becomes: -48*o - 162 = -1554 Next, we isolate '-48*o' by getting rid of the '-162'. We do this by adding '162' to both sides. That will cancel out the '-162' on the left side: -48*o - 162 + 162 = -1554 + 162 which simplifies to: -48*o = -1392 Now, divide both sides by '-48' to solve for 'o'.  -48*o / -48= -1392 / -48 'O' becomes: o = 29 So, the solution for 'o' in the given equation is 29."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An annoyed aristocratic fop, the Vicomte de Valvert (Albert Cavens), provokes him into a duel by tritely insulting Cyrano's enormous nose. Cyrano first mocks his lack of wit, improvising numerous inventive ways in which Valvert could have phrased it (much to the amusement of the audience). He then composes a ballade for the occasion on the spot and recites it during the sword fight. With the last line, he stabs his opponent. Cyrano's friend Le Bret (Morris Carnovsky), Captain of the Gascony guards, warns him he has made powerful enemies of his victim's friends, but he is unconcerned. When Le Bret presses him to reveal the real reason he hates Montfleury, Cyrano admits that he became jealous when he saw his beautiful cousin Roxane (Mala Powers) being smiled at by the actor. He confesses that he is in love with her, but harbors no hope of it being returned because of his nose. When he receives a request from Roxane to see her in the morning, he is finally emboldened to act. Then pastry chef and fellow poet Ragueneau (Lloyd Corrigan) approaches him for help.

They kept the systems of government that they had developed as separate colonies but also would have a federal government that was responsible for matters concerning the whole nation. When the Constitution of Australia came into force, the colonies collectively became states of the Commonwealth of Australia.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The six colonies that were self-governed but formed by Britain are implied to have been created and occupied before the date of January 1, 1901. This is the date when the Federation of Australia took place, resulting in the unification of these six separate British colonies into one nation known as the Commonwealth of Australia. Prior to this date, each colony functioned as a distinct entity with its own system of government under British control. They were established over a period of time during the 19th century, with specific founding dates for each colony: 1. New South Wales: Established on January 26, 1788, by the arrival of the First Fleet, led by Captain Arthur Phillip. This marked the beginning of British colonization in Australia. 2. Tasmania: Initially founded as a separate settlement in 1803 under the name Van Diemen's Land, it later became a separate colony in 1825. 3. Western Australia: Established as the Swan River Colony in 1829, under the command of Captain James Stirling. 4. South Australia: Proclaimed as a new British colony on December 28, 1836, by Governor John Hindmarsh. 5. Victoria: Formed as a separate colony on July 1, 1851, when its southeastern region was separated from the larger Colony of New South Wales. 6. Queensland: Established on June 6, 1859, when its northeastern region separated from the Colony of New South Wales. As the 19th century drew to a close, there was a growing sentiment among the colonies that they would benefit from unifying under a single national government. The process of the Federation of Australia was primarily aimed at achieving this unity while still retaining the individual systems of government that each colony had developed. On January 1, 1901, the Commonwealth of Australia was established, marking the onset of a new era for the former British colonies that are today known as the states of Australia."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe.  His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire.  At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher.  Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford.  Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study.  At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836. During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France, studying Romanesque and early Gothic architecture. He had intended to travel further into northern France, but his tour was curtailed in Paris owing to \\"fatigue and illness\\".... Answer:","output":"Edmund"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This significant victory in English football history took place on July 30, 1966, at Wembley Stadium in London. The tournament featured 16 teams, including the host nation England. Under the management of Sir Alf Ramsey, England featured a highly talented team with players such as captain Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst, Martin Peters, and Bobby Charlton. Throughout the tournament, England displayed great skill and determination, remaining undefeated in all their matches. In the group stages, England played against Uruguay, Mexico, and France. They advanced to the knockout stages after finishing at the top of their group. In the quarter-finals, England faced Argentina and won 1-0, thanks to a goal by Geoff Hurst. This victory took them to the semi-finals, where they played against Portugal. The match ended with a 2-1 victory for England, with both goals scored by Bobby Charlton. The final match saw England facing West Germany on July 30, 1966, at Wembley Stadium. The match started intensely, with both teams showing their determination to win the coveted trophy. Helmut Haller scored the opening goal for West Germany in the 12th minute, but Geoff Hurst equalized for England six minutes later. Martin Peters then put England in front in the 78th minute, but West Germany's Wolfgang Weber equalized in the 89th minute to force extra time. During extra time, Geoff Hurst became the hero for England by scoring two more goals, thereby completing his hat-trick and ensuring a 4-2 victory for his team. This made Hurst the first and only player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final to this day. The 1966 FIFA World Cup win remains England's only World Cup title. Since then, the English team has had varying degrees of success in the tournament, but they have yet to repeat their historic victory."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Firstly, the sentence confirms that Puerto Rican farm laborers and Mexican ranchers, who belong to Hispanic groups, have settled in Hawaii since the late 19th century. This historical context demonstrates that Hispanics have been present in the Hawaiian Islands for over a century, contributing to the cultural diversity of the region. Moreover, the sentence provides quantitative data on the Hispanic population in Hawaii. It states that 7.0 per cent of the population in the Hawaiian Islands are either Hispanic or Hispanophone (Hispanic-speaking) or both. This percentage confirms the presence of Hispanics in Hawaii, with a measurable representation among the broader population. It is also worth mentioning that the data presented in the sentence not only highlights the existence of Hispanics in Hawaii, but it also showcases the linguistic aspect of the Hispanic community.

Answer: As the Communist Party was outlawed in Yugoslavia starting on 30 December 1920, Josip Broz took on many assumed names during his activity within the Party, including \\"Rudi\\", \\"Walter\\", and \\"Tito.\\"  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Answer: The party that was outlawed in Yugoslavia in 1920 was the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (CPY).  The Communist Party of Yugoslavia, initially called the Socialist Workers' Party of Yugoslavia (Communists), was founded on April 20, 1919, in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later known as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia). The party was established as a response to the need for a unified communist movement in the newly formed country, following the end of World War I. Its primary aim was to establish a socialist state that would ensure social, economic, and political equality for all citizens. However, the ruling monarch, King Alexander I, perceived the CPY as a threat to his political power and the stability of the kingdom. The global surge in communist influence following the Russian Revolution of 1917 contributed to the growing concern about the potential destabilization caused by the communist movement in Europe. In this context, on December 30, 1920, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia decided to outlaw the Communist Party by enacting a law called the \\"Law Concerning the Protection of Public Safety and Order.\\" This law imposed severe restrictions on organizations, activities, publications, and individuals promoting communism or related ideologies. Consequently, the Communist Party and its members were forced to go underground and carry out their activities in secret. One notable figure who emerged during this period was Josip Broz Tito, who later became the President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Operating under various aliases, such as \\"Rudi,\\" \\"Walter,\\" and \\"Tito,\\" he actively participated in the illegal activities of the CPY and played a crucial role in organizing and expanding the communist movement in Yugoslavia. After years of operating in secret, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia re-emerged during World War II as a primary force in the Yugoslav resistance against the Axis powers. Following the end of the war and the collapse of the royal government, the CPY came to power and established a socialist federal state, led by Tito until his death in 1980. In summary, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia was outlawed in 1920, following the enactment of a law that aimed to protect public safety and order. Despite being forced underground, the party continued to grow and ultimately became a major political force in post-World War II Yugoslavia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tocqueville asserted that the values that had triumphed in the North and were present in the South had begun to suffocate old-world ethics and social arrangements. Legislatures abolished primogeniture and entails, resulting in more widely distributed land holdings. This was a contrast to the general aristocratic pattern in which only the eldest child, usually a man, inherited the estate, which had the effect of keeping large estates intact from generation to generation. In America, in contrast, landed elites were less likely to pass on fortunes to a single child by the action of primogeniture, which meant that as time went by, large estates became broken up within a few generations which, in turn, made the children more equal overall. It was not always a negative development, according to Joshua Kaplan's interpretation of Tocqueville, since bonds of affection and shared experience between children often replaced the more formal relation between the eldest child and the siblings, characteristic of the previous aristocratic pattern. Overall, in the new democracies, hereditary fortunes became exceedingly difficult to secure and more people were forced to struggle for their own living. This rapidly democratizing society, as Tocqueville understood it, had a population devoted to \\"middling\\" values which wanted to amass, through hard work, vast fortunes. In Tocqueville's mind, this explained why America was so different from Europe. In Europe, he claimed, nobody cared about making money. The lower classes had no hope of gaining more than minimal wealth, while the upper classes found it crass, vulgar, and unbecoming of their sort to care about something as unseemly as money; many were virtually guaranteed wealth and took it for granted. At the same time in America, workers would see people fashioned in exquisite attire and merely proclaim that through hard work they too would soon possess the fortune necessary to enjoy such luxuries. Despite maintaining with Aristotle, Montesquieu, and others that the balance of property determined the balance of power, Tocqueville argued that, as America showed, equitable property holdings did not ensure the rule of the best men. In fact, it did quite the opposite. The widespread, relatively equitable property ownership which distinguished America and determined its mores and values also explained why the American masses held elites in such contempt.  Question: \\"How did Europeans' and Americans' attitudes toward amassing wealth differ?\\" Answer: \\"Europeans had no interest in it, while Americans desired it\\" Is this answer correct? Select from the following. I. no II. yes...I think the answer is","output":"II. yes The answer is correct because, according to Tocqueville, Europeans did not care about making money, with the lower classes having little hope of gaining wealth and the upper classes finding it crass and unbecoming to focus on money. On the other hand, Americans desired to amass wealth through hard work and saw it as an achievable goal.  The \\"no\\" answer (I) is incorrect because it contradicts the information provided in the passage about the differing attitudes towards wealth between Europeans and Americans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would crop A more likely or less likely be virus resistant than crop B?  Keith is a biotech scientist. He had developed a GMO crop that he labeled as crop A. To see how his GMO crop compare with another crop he selected crop B. Crop B was a non-GMO crop. Keith needed to find the pros and cons of both crops.  Hint: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination... A:","output":"Crop A would more likely be virus resistant than crop B. The paragraph mentions that Keith, a biotech scientist, has developed a GMO crop labeled as crop A and compares it with another non-GMO crop, crop B. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have their genetic material altered through recombinant DNA technology, which significantly broadens the range of genes available to breeders when designing new crops with specific desired traits. One of the primary benefits obtained from genetic engineering is increased virus resistance, among other attributes such as enhanced durability, nutritional content, insect resistance, and herbicide tolerance. Since crop A is a GMO, it is more likely to have been specifically designed and engineered to have a higher level of virus resistance than crop B, which is a non-GMO crop. Non-GMO crops rely on traditional breeding practices, and although they can achieve virus resistance through hybridization or cross-pollination, the \\"created\\" resistance is likely to be less targeted and effective than the resistance designed through genetic engineering. It is worth mentioning that the use of GMO crops can raise food safety, food labeling, and environmental concerns. Several countries have imposed restrictions on the production, import, or use of GMO foods and crops, which underscores the ongoing debate surrounding the risks and benefits associated with GMOs. In the European Union, for instance, all GMO foods must be labeled, while the United States does not require such labeling. Despite these concerns and regulatory approaches, the fact remains that crop A, as a GMO crop, is more likely to have been designed with increased virus resistance compared to the non-GMO crop B."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decided not to lower production on Thursday in spite of dropping oil prices and pleas from poorer member nations. Around 9 a.m. Friday, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate was trading at 69.29 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a 4.40 per barrel drop from Wednesday. Crude: Oil prices opened Friday morning down more than 4, signaling fallout from OPEC's decision not to cut production levels. Prices had slumped even lower in electronic trading during the Thanksgiving holiday, where oil dropped down to 67.75. The Friday low was a four-year record for US crude prices as uncertainties remain over consumer demand and global economic growth. As consumer gas prices drop, so too does hesitation among Americans to spend more during holiday shopping. 'Tis the season: energy down, consumer up,' said Strategas Research Partners, reports the USA Today. 'The continued decline in the price of crude oil and the resulting savings at the gas pump will likely continue to bolster consumer shares as the market anticipates the positive implications on consumer spending,' said Strategas partner Nicholas Bohnsack. At OPEC's headquarters in Vienna, there was some belief among analysts that the organization would push for compliance with current production levels, held at 30 million a day. Trading: Prices had slumped even lower in electronic trading during the Thanksgiving holiday, where oil dropped down to 67.75. In October, members had produced an average of 30.6 million barrels daily, according to the International Energy Agency.

Under the iron fist of the enigmatic leader known as The Sovereign, a group known as The Allegiance serves as the watchdog, ensuring all citizens adhere to the regime's rules and regulations. However, a secretive rebellion called The Veil has been growing under the radar, working to overthrow The Sovereign. Plot: The Veil, led by the mysterious strategist, Zara, develops a plan to free their imprisoned leader, Blake, who was captured by The Allegiance. The movie begins with the Veil executing a carefully coordinated attack on the facility holding Blake, which results in an explosion that incapacitates all members of The Allegiance, including The Sovereign and his followers. As the story unfolds, Zara and her team of rebels slowly expose the hidden truths behind The Sovereign's rise to power, revealing a twisted web of betrayal, intrigue, and manipulation. Through a series of guerilla attacks, they work to dismantle the regime's oppressive infrastructure. Meanwhile, The Allegiance desperately tries to regain control, deploying their most ruthless agents to eliminate The Veil. With the leader and his followers incapacitated due to the initial attack, The Sovereign's rule is threatened. His second-in-command, a ruthless enforcer named Vorak, captures several members of The Veil and tortures them for information, threatening to unravel their entire operation. While time is running out for The Veil, the team discovers a hidden underground facility where The Sovereign has been secretly replicating himself. The clones, each enhanced with unique skills and abilities, are being prepared to replace The Sovereign should he ever fall. Zara resolves to infiltrate the underground facility and destroy the clones, but only with the help of an insider, a conflicted allegiance agent named Finn, who has begun questioning his role in the regime. In an action-packed climax, Zara and her team confront The Sovereign and a number of his clones in the heart of the underground facility. A desperate battle ensues, with the fate of the world hanging in the balance. In the end, Zara sacrifices herself in a massive explosion that destroys the clones, ultimately allowing the former followers of The Sovereign to revolt against the regime and dismantle The Allegiance. As the story closes, Blake stands on the ashes of the fallen regime, delivering a powerful speech to a crowd of newly liberated citizens. The message of hope and unity spreads, as the people begin to rebuild their society in true freedom, honoring the memory of Zara and the rebels who lost their lives in the pursuit of a better world. \\"The Veiled Rebellion\\" is a thrilling sci-fi action dystopian drama that not only entertains but also emphasizes the importance of unity, courage, and the pursuit of freedom in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Again, whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else. Father's hard work paid off and he was promoted. Happily, he decided to hire a maid to relieve his wife from her domestic tasks. He also felt that their three-room flat was no longer big enough. It would be nice for his family to be able to enjoy the facilities and comfort of a condominium.

The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - Plant morphology or phytomorphology is the study of the physical form and external structure of plants. This is usually considered distinct from plant anatomy, which is the study of the internal structure of plants, especially at the microscopic level. Plant morphology is useful in the visual identification of plants. Scope. Plant morphology \\"represents a study of the development, form, and structure of plants, and, by implication, an attempt to interpret these on the basis of similarity of plan and origin.\\" There are four major areas of investigation in plant morphology, and each overlaps with another field of the biological sciences.  - This is a list of botanical illustrators born or active in Ireland . Botanical illustration involves the painting , drawing and illustration of plants and ecosystems .

Typical illustrations are in watercolour, but may also be in oils, ink or pencil, or a combination of these. The image may be life size or not, the scale is often shown, and may show the habit and habitat of the plant, the upper and reverse sides of leaves, and details of flowers, bud, seed and root system.  - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - Ulster (or \\"Cúige Uladh\\" , Ulster Scots: \\"Ulstèr\\" or \\"Ulster\\") is a province in the north of the island of Ireland.

They must be scientifically accurate but often also have an artistic component and may be printed with a botanical description in book, magazines, and other media or sold as a work of art. Often composed in consultation with a scientific author, their creation requires an understanding of plant morphology and access to specimens and references.   - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic.

The answer is:","output":"The Call of Cthulhu: The Official Video Game is an upcoming role-playing survival horror video game developed by Cyanide, based on the highly influential short story \\"The Call of Cthulhu.\\" This iconic work was written by the renowned American writer H.P. Lovecraft, who is widely considered one of the most significant and influential authors in the horror and weird fiction genres. Born on August 20, 1890, in Providence, Rhode Island, Howard Phillips Lovecraft was an American writer who achieved posthumous fame for his unique and terrifying stories that often dealt with cosmic horror. Lovecraft's work, including \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" and various other tales, greatly influenced both literature and pop culture, inspiring generations of writers, filmmakers, and game developers alike. \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" was first published in 1928 in the American pulp magazine Weird Tales. It is a classic example of Lovecraft's literary style, known as \\"cosmic horror\\" or \\"Lovecraftian horror.\\" This style of horror is characterized by the notion that the universe is unknowable, indifferent, and hostile to humankind, and that getting too close to the truth would lead to madness or destruction. The story revolves around a series of notes and accounts left by a man named Francis Wayland Thurston, who is trying to uncover the truth about a mysterious cult that worships an ancient, terrifying deity called Cthulhu. As Thurston delves deeper into the story, he discovers that the cult seeks to awaken Cthulhu, who lies in a deathlike slumber beneath the ocean, and bring about the end of the world. Cyanide, the developer of the upcoming video game adaptation of \\"The Call of Cthulhu,\\" is a French video game studio that has previously worked on several other notable titles, such as Styx: Master of Shadows and the adaptation of George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series into a role-playing game. The studio aims to capture the essence of Lovecraft's story and its haunting atmosphere by blending elements of traditional role-playing games with survival horror game mechanics, resulting in a unique and immersive gaming experience. Players will take on the role of a private investigator who explores the mysterious town of Darkwater Island, Massachusetts, in search of answers to a dark and unsettling mystery. The game will challenge players to confront the dark forces lurking beneath the surface of the island while managing their own sanity and making choices that will ultimately determine the fate of both themselves and the world around them. In conclusion, The Call of Cthulhu: The Official Video Game is an upcoming role-playing survival horror video game developed by Cyanide, based on the famous short story \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" by the influential American writer H.P. Lovecraft. By combining Lovecraft's chilling storytelling, atmospheric exploration, and engaging game mechanics, the developer seeks to provide an unforgettable gaming experience that is both faithful to the original story and innovative in its approach."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: The value of pollinators to the UK government is estimated to be Â£430m a year, but populations have been on the decline for 30 years. The Welsh government launched the action plan at the Royal Welsh Show in Powys in July. Since then a review has looked at the reasons for the insects' decline. The action plan will be developed in partnership with key agencies and might include changes to the planning system to help make development \\"pollinator friendly\\". Other plans include planting more bee-friendly plants in areas such as railway embankments and road verges. The Welsh government held a workshop at Aberystwyth University on Monday to share the results of its review with Friends of the Earth Cymru, the Welsh Bee Keepers' Association and wildlife trusts. Speaking before the meeting, Peter Barrar, a director of National Bee Keeping Centre Wales, said: \\"A number of policies and programmes will be put forward for discussion and hopefully we're going to have a situation where we have an action plan that (can be implemented) throughout Wales, and addresses some of the really key issues that are facing pollinators, not just in Wales, but throughout the UK as a whole and elsewhere.\\" Mr Barrar said there was probably four of five issues affecting pollinators. \\"Firstly, I think we've got problems with the loss of natural habitats which have resulted from ways in which we now manage the land,\\" he added. \\"For example, 97% of the UK's wild flower meadows have disappeared since the 1930s. That's an incredible impact due to farming practices and so on. \\"There are issues about the use of pesticides which many beekeepers believe are having a disastrous effect, on not just bees, but on other pollinators as well.\\" Environment Minister John Griffiths said 20% of the UK's cropped area was made up of pollinator-dependent crops. \\"In July I announced that Wales would produce an action plan for pollinators,\\" he added. \\"Since then a review has been undertaken in Wales to look at the reasons for the population decline and the impacts that such a decline will have upon our society. \\"We now want to share this report with our relevant partners and take their views on how we can protect this vitally important eco-system service. \\"Their views and expertise will be crucial is helping to shape this action plan which is the first of its kind in the UK.\\"","output":"Pollinators, like bees, are very important to help plants grow, and they are worth a lot of money to the UK. But there are fewer bees than before. So, the Welsh government made a plan to help bees and other pollinators. They want to change some things, like planting more flowers that bees like near roads and train tracks. They talked to different groups who care about bees and the environment. They think they need to fix a few problems, like having more places for bees to live, and using fewer bad chemicals that hurt the bees. This plan will help bees and other pollinators in Wales and maybe in other places too."},{"instruction":"Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: In ancient Egypt, the pharaoh treated the poor message runner like a prince when he arrived at the palace, if he brought good news.

A combination of talent, grit, and determination quickly transformed this young workhorse into a crucial element of the Cowboys' offense, revitalizing their playoff dreams and injecting life into a season that seemed all but lost. Early Struggles and Jones' Arrival Beginning their season with high expectations and a roster filled with both new and seasoned talent, the Dallas Cowboys immediately stumbled out of the gates, plagued by inconsistent performances and numerous injuries. As the losses mounted, the once-proud franchise appeared destined for yet another testing season and a missed opportunity for playoff contention. Enter Julius Jones - a talented rookie running back with the potential to shake things up. Drafted in the second round, Jones boasted impressive stats at Notre Dame, setting numerous records and garnering nationwide attention for his powerful running style. Initially sidelined due to a fractured scapula, Jones made his debut later in the season, immediately making an indelible impact on the team's offensive scheme. The Turning Point: Julius Jones in Action Though there was skepticism surrounding just how quickly Jones could acclimate to the NFL and the Cowboys' offense, the young running back proved to be a revelation. Displaying an uncanny aptitude for reading defenses and finding holes to exploit, Jones' combination of speed, agility, and power instantly changed the dynamic of the game for the Cowboys. As Jones began to rack up yards and touchdowns, the team rallied around their newfound asset, taking a little pressure off quarterback Tony Romo and giving the Dallas receiving corps more space to maneuver. Moreover, Jones' emergence helped to balance the team's overall offensive strategy, forcing defenses to respect the Cowboys' running game. Another significant factor contributing to Jones' success stemmed from the hard work and chemistry he cultivated with the Cowboys' offensive line. Trusting in the blockers and showing patience and vision on the field allowed Jones to seize every opportunity provided to him, further solidifying his importance when it came to the offensive game plan. Defying the Odds: The Playoff Push As the season progressed, Julius Jones continued to exceed expectations, becoming a vital component of the Cowboys' push for a playoff berth. As the team charted an increasingly impressive course through the NFL schedule, fans and analysts alike began to take notice of the unyielding spirit displayed by this once-counted-out franchise. Jones' relentless pursuit of achievement paralleled the very ethos of the Dallas Cowboys organization – persistence in the face of adversity. Conclusion In a season that appeared destined for disappointment, the Dallas Cowboys found a glimmer of hope in the outstanding performance of rookie running back Julius Jones. With his arrival on the field, the tides of fortune turned, demonstrating the immense impact a single player can have on a team's trajectory. As Julius Jones cemented his spot as one of the NFL's brightest young stars, he rekindled the Dallas Cowboys' playoff hopes and showcased a future overflowing with promise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Early one morning, more than a hundred years ago, an American inventor called Elias Howe finally fell asleep. He had been working all night on the design of a sewing machine but he had run into a very difficult problem. It seemed impossible to get the thread to run smoothly around the needle. Despite his exhaustion, Howe slept badly. He tossed  and turned. Then he had a nightmare He dreamt that he had been caught by terrible savages whose king wanted to kill him and eat him unless he could build a perfect sewing machine. When he tried to do so, Howe ran into the same problem as before. The thread kept getting caught around the needle. The king flew into the cage and ordered his soldiers to kill Howe. They came up towards him with their spears raised. But suddenly the inventor noticed something. There was a hole in the tip of each spear. The inventor awoke from the dream, realizing that he had just found the answer to the problem. Instead of trying to get the thread to run around the needle, he should make a small hole in the center of the needle and have the thread run through it. This was the simple idea that finally made Howe design and build the first really practical sewing machine. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the electric light, said his best ideas came into him in dreams. So did the great physicist Albert Einstein. To appreciate the value of dreams, you have to understand what happens when you are asleep. Even then, a part of your mind is still working. This unconscious , but still active part digests your experiences and goes to work on the problems you have had during the day.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. How might one describe the sentiment of this review? I went to Las Vegas last week, and I figured what better way to fill in the after dinner 9PM - 11PM time slot than with a show. I've already seen pretty much all the big named production shows in Vegas, some shows even multiple times even (Cirque Du Soleil's O, Ka, Mystere, Jubilee, Le Reve, Penn & Teller etc). I haven't seen Mystere since the late 90's, so I figured I'd see it again, reminiscing old times. If I remembered correctly, Mystere had a lot going on everywhere, so in order to get the best view, sitting a little farther back from the stage was better. I bought 2 tickets in section 202 center for about 80 a ticket. Not bad for the seats, and price as the view was excellent, especially since it was right in the center!   Mystere was made back in 1993 by producer Franco Dragone, with music composed by Benoit Jutras. The same two also teamed up to make \\"O\\" at the Bellagio, and also teamed up to make \\"Le Reve\\" (non-Cirque du Soleil) at the Wynn.   Having seen \\"O\\" recently, and \\"Mystere\\" almost 10 years ago, I could see Franco Dragone's creative touches and influences in Mystere that shows up in a larger scale in \\"O\\". Mystere is like Franco Dragone's baby, and \\"O\\" is like the upgraded version of Mystere with water. Franco Dragone must love large stage lifts, as they are seen in Mystere, and also in \\"O\\" and \\"Le Reve\\" but with the additional water component. (Side Note: Franco Dragone and Benoit Jutras recently made \\"House of Dancing Waters\\" in Macao, which from the previews seems like a combination of the best components of \\"O\\" and \\"Le Reve\\". These two are amazing!).   I have to mention, the composer Benoit Jutras is a genius. There is nothing like a Cirque du Soleil show with music that we have no clue what they are saying. The music really adds to the shows. As mentioned above, Benoit Jutras made the music for \\"Mystere\\", \\"O\\", and \\"Le Reve\\", in which I love the music for all 3 shows.   I'd say if you've already seen \\"O\\" or \\"Le Reve\\" or Ka, you might have to think twice about seeing Mystere. If you really like the circus/acrobatics aspect without the flashy stages, Mystere I'd say has the best acrobatics/circus aspect than O, Ka, or even Le Reve. All the performers in Mystere make it look so easy. If your more into the large stages, then Mystere might be a disappointment. Although considering Mystere was made in 1993, the stage still seems amazing even for todays standards for me. I definitely had a good time, and I was entertained for the full 90 minutes.   Maybe its because I saw the 9:30PM show, but I was disappointed to see that a lot of seats were empty, especially on the sides.","output":"The sentiment of this review is mostly positive. The person enjoyed watching Mystere again and appreciated the creative work of Franco Dragone and the music by Benoit Jutras. They also liked the view from their seats and thought the show was entertaining. However, they mentioned that if someone has already seen other similar shows, they might need to think twice before going to Mystere, and they were disappointed to see empty seats at the show."},{"instruction":"You need to create a question containing a blank (_), based on the given context word.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I can use this background: Submarine volcanoes are common features of the ocean floor. In shallow water, active volcanoes disclose their presence by blasting steam and rocky debris high above the ocean's surface. In the ocean's deep, the tremendous weight of the water above prevents the explosive release of steam and gases; however, they can be detected by hydrophones and discoloration of water because of volcanic gases. Pillow lava is a common eruptive product of submarine volcanoes and is characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses which form under water. Even large submarine eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface due to the rapid cooling effect and increased buoyancy of water (as compared to air) which often causes volcanic vents to form steep pillars on the ocean floor. Hydrothermal vents are common near these volcanoes, and some support peculiar ecosystems based on dissolved minerals. Over time, the formations created by submarine volcanoes may become so large that they break the ocean surface as new islands or floating pumice rafts.  Now, I have a new situation: Planet X had two large oceans. Ice ocean had few submarine volcanoes, while Tropical ocean had thousands of active volcanoes on the ocean floor.  Answer this question please: Which ocean showed less discoloration of water because of volcanic gases?

(a). in horny toads (b). in rats (c). in humans (d). in bears","output":"(c). in humans Reptiles, like the horny toad, are cold-blooded animals, which means that they rely on the environment to regulate their body temperature. On the other hand, mammals such as rats, humans, and bears are warm-blooded animals, which means they have the ability to maintain a constant internal body temperature regardless of the external conditions. Out of the given options, humans (option c) have warmer blood compared to horny toads (option a), rats (option b), and bears (option d). First, let's understand why reptiles are cold-blooded. Reptiles have an ectothermic metabolism, which means they do not generate their own internal heat. They rely on external heat sources such as sunlight or the warmth of the environment to regulate their body temperature. This helps them conserve energy but limits their mobility and metabolic activities in extreme temperatures. For example, reptiles may become sluggish in colder temperatures, whereas they may be more prone to overheating in very hot environments. On the other hand, mammals are endothermic, which allows them to generate and maintain their body heat internally. This internal homeostasis enables them to function efficiently in a broader range of temperatures and environments. Humans, specifically, have several ways of maintaining their internal temperature, including the following: 1. Sweating: As a human's body temperature rises above the average level of approximately 98.6°F (37°C), sweat glands secrete sweat, which is mostly composed of water, onto the skin. When the sweat evaporates, it cools down the body and helps regulate internal temperature. 2. Shivering: When the body temperature drops below the normal range, the body begins to shiver to generate heat through muscle contractions. 3. Vasodilation and vasoconstriction: These mechanisms involve the widening or narrowing of blood vessels to regulate blood flow and heat distribution throughout the body. Vasodilation (dilation of blood vessels) helps release heat when the body temperature increases, while vasoconstriction (constriction of blood vessels) conserves heat during cold conditions. 4. Metabolism: The human body continuously generates heat as a byproduct of various chemical reactions and metabolic processes, allowing for the maintenance of consistent internal temperature. In conclusion, while reptiles like horny toads rely on external heat sources to regulate their body temperature, mammals such as rats, humans, and bears generate and maintain their body heat through various specialized mechanisms. Among the given options, humans possess warmer blood, as they have several highly efficient ways to maintain a stable internal temperature, allowing them to thrive in diverse environmental conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Menominee (also spelled Menomini, derived from the Ojibwe language word for \\"Wild Rice People;\\" known as Mamaceqtaw, \\"the people,\\" in the Menominee language) are a federally recognized nation of Native Americans, with a 353.894 sq mi (916.581 km2) reservation in Wisconsin. Their historic territory originally included an estimated 10 million acres (40,000 km2) in present-day Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The tribe currently has about 8,700 members. The tribe was terminated in the 1950s under federal policy of the time which stressed assimilation. The Menominee Indian Reservation is located in northeastern Wisconsin. For the most part, it is conterminous with Menominee County and the town of Menominee, which were established after termination of the tribe in 1961 under contemporary federal policy whose goal was assimilation. The tribe regained its federally recognized status and reservation in 1975.  The reservation was created in a treaty with the United States signed on May 12, 1854 in which the Menominee relinquished all claims to the lands held by them under previous treaties, and were assigned 432 square miles (1,120 km2) on the Wolf River in present-day Wisconsin. An additional treaty, which they signed on February 11, 1856, carved out the southwestern corner of this area to create a separate reservation for the Stockbridge and Lenape (Munsee) tribes, who had reached the area as refugees from New York state. The latter two tribes have the federally recognized joint Stockbridge-Munsee Community.  After the tribe had regained federal recognition in 1973, it essentially restored the reservation to its historic boundaries in 1975. Many small pockets of territory within the county (and its geographically equivalent town) are not considered as part of the reservation. These amount to 1.14% of the county's area, so the reservation is essentially 98.86% of the county's area. The largest of these pockets is in the western part of the community of Keshena, Wisconsin. The reservation includes a plot of off-reservation trust land of 10.22 acres (41,400 m2) in Winnebago County, Wisconsin to the south, west of the city of Oshkosh. The reservation's total land area is 353.894 sq mi (916.581 km2), while Menominee County's land area is 357.960 sq mi (927.11 km2).  The small non-reservation parts of the county are more densely populated than the reservation, holding 1,337 (29.3%) of the county's 4,562 total population, as opposed to the reservation's 3,225 (70.7%) population, as of the 2000 census.  The most populous communities are Legend Lake and Keshena. Since the late 20th century, the members of the reservation have operated a number of gambling facilities in these communities as a source of revenue. They speak English as well as their traditional Menominee language, one of the Algonquian languages.

A 7-month-old unvaccinated domestic shorthair cat was presented with a history of inappetence and hypersalivation. Clinical examination revealed fever, gingivitis and oral ulceration. An initial blood sample revealed a severe leukopenia and neutropenia and a feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) titre of 1:640; a second titre 10 days later was 1:2,560. A feline calicivirus (FCV) titre was 1:320 and the initial clinical signs and laboratory findings were attributed to a coinfection with FPV and FCV. The cat was treated with interferon omega. A blood sample taken 10 days later revealed a severe thrombocytosis of 3,448×10 9 /L (reference range 200-500×10 9 /L) confirmed by blood smear examination. The platelet count on day 35 was 4,990×10 9 /L. No bone marrow examination was carried out. Two differential diagnoses for an extreme thrombocytosis are a reactive thrombocytosis or essential thrombocythemia (ET). ET is a hemic neoplasia that causes a severe and persistent thrombocytosis, and is a diagnosis of exclusion. Reactive thrombocytosis is generally mild to moderate and of shorter duration than described here, but an excessive response could have been caused by infection. The influence of additional factors such as an initial thrombocytopenia, age and interferon treatment are not clear but can be speculated on. Although the exact pathophysiology in this case remains unclear, such high, persistent thrombocyte numbers have not been reported in cats in the absence of a neoplastic process. A 7-month-old, male neutered domestic shorthair cat presented to his veterinarian with a complaint of inappetence and a swaying gait. The cat was allowed to go outside and was unvaccinated. The cat shared a household with a female littermate that had received only the first part of the primary vaccination 3 months previously. Upon examination, the cat was found to be pyrexic (temperature 41°C), and an examination of the oral cavity revealed an ulcerative gingivostomatitis. The gait abnormality was identified by the veterinarian as a hindlimb ataxia. A blood sample was collected and sent to the InVitro Diagnostic Laboratory.

Currently, the department is working to train all their officers to use nunchucks. ||||| Looking for another nonlethal way to take down suspects, the Anderson Police Department decided to go the way of the dragon.      The police force in the Northern California town of about 10,000 people plans to equip its 20 officers with nunchakus, also known as nunchucks.      Basically, they’re what martial arts legend Bruce Lee used – besides his fists of fury and feet -- to take down all those bad guys in his movies.      The police department was looking for a versatile tool that would limit injuries to officers and the people they detained – but that would still be an effective means of subduing an unruly suspect. Anderson’s top brass decided nunchakus were the way to go, said Sgt. Casey Day.      “It gives us the ability to control a suspect instead of striking them,” he said.      Of course, if you’ve watched enough Lee movies you’ll notice that he didn’t use nunchakus to pacify his enemies. He beat them up with them. But Anderson police insist they can detain someone with them in a relatively peaceful way.      Graphic: comparing batons and nunchucks      On the website of the nunchakus’ manufacturer, Orcutt Police Defensive Systems Inc., the restraint technique is demonstrated. It shows a male officer using the nunchakus to grip the ankle of a man who is kicking his foot toward the officer’s face. The photo also depicts a female officer using them to hold a man’s wrist.      The weapon, or tool, is often made of two wooden sticks or bars tethered together by a metal chain. (Developed by retired Colorado police Sgt. Kevin Orcutt in the 1980s, the Anderson Police Department's nunchakus are made of a hard plastic connected by a nylon cord designed to wrap around wrists and ankles). Wielded by martial arts experts, nunchakus can be used in complicated motions to fight off attackers. In the movies, including some of Lee’s, the occasional bad guy who gets the bright idea of trying to use it himself usually whacks himself in the face.      Day was recently certified to train the department’s officers on the proper use of the nunchakus. He wants officers to have another option besides the baton, a traditional impact weapon. Officers won’t be required to use nunchakus, he said. But if officers decide to use them, they must pass a 16-hour training program.      Day, a 15-year police veteran, said he has given up his baton for nunchakus.      “I see the value and the safety they bring to me,” he said, adding that nunchakus provide a distance between an officer and a suspect.      Sure, he was skeptical at first, Day said. But once he used the nunchakus, he was sold.      The pincher-style nunchakus became popular in the police community in the 1980s, said Greg Meyer, a use-of-force expert and former Los Angeles Police Department training captain. Anaheim, San Diego and the LAPD are just some of the agencies that have used them– at least for a while.      Some law enforcement agencies stopped using nunchakus when officers improperly used them -- in some cases resulting in broken wrists, he said.      In 1991, the LAPD agreed to stop using nunchakus at protests– a decision sparked by a federal lawsuit filed by anti-abortion activists.      The department opted to settle the lawsuit following the March 3 beating of Rodney G. King, which happened that same year. At the time, Deputy City Atty. Jack Brown, who was representing the LAPD, said the department was concerned about the public perception over using nunchakus to subdue people.      Day hasn’t used his nunchakus, but is confident he will use them properly.      “I don’t go around looking for trouble,” he said.      Neither did Bruce Lee.

Having originated in Japan and used in martial arts for years, nunchucks are considered a multipurpose weapon and have begun making a comeback in Shasta County. In California, nunchucks are illegal for citizens to own, however, police can obtain certification to use them. The Anderson Police Department utilizes plastic nunchucks connected by a nylon rope, as opposed to the traditional wooden sticks or bars connected by a metal chain. Sergeant Casey Day, who was recently certified to use nunchucks, explained that they can be used to hit, strike, jab, and take someone down, as well as being utilized as a restraint for locking someone's hand, elbow, or ankle. The department is now working to train all of its officers in the effective use of nunchucks, emphasizing their role as a control tool instead of an impact weapon."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The iPod line came from Apple's \\"digital hub\\" category, when the company began creating software for the growing market of personal digital devices. Digital cameras, camcorders and organizers had well-established mainstream markets, but the company found existing digital music players \\"big and clunky or small and useless\\" with user interfaces that were \\"unbelievably awful,\\" so Apple decided to develop its own. As ordered by CEO Steve Jobs, Apple's hardware engineering chief Jon Rubinstein assembled a team of engineers to design the iPod line, including hardware engineers Tony Fadell and Michael Dhuey, and design engineer Sir Jonathan Ive. Rubinstein had already discovered the Toshiba disk drive when meeting with an Apple supplier in Japan, and purchased the rights to it for Apple, and had also already worked out how the screen, battery, and other key elements would work. The aesthetic was inspired by the 1958 Braun T3 transistor radio designed by Dieter Rams, while the wheel based user interface was prompted by Bang & Olufsen's BeoCom 6000 telephone. The product (\\"the Walkman of the twenty-first century\\" ) was developed in less than one year and unveiled on October 23, 2001.

Read this article and answer this question The Bears opened the 2016 season on the road against the Houston Texans, who defeated the Bears in all three of their previous meetings, most recently a 13-6 win in 2012. The game was the second Bears-Texans game at NRG Stadium, the first being a Houston 31-24 win in 2008. On offense, the Bears faced a Texans defense that was ranked third in the NFL in 2015, which WBBM-TV writer Jeff Joniak wrote should be handled by controlling the ball and blocking defenders J. J. Watt, Whitney Mercilus and Jadeveon Clowney. Meanwhile, the Texans were led by quarterback Brock Osweiler, who guided the Broncos to victory against the Bears in his debut as an NFL starter last year. Osweiler was bolstered by a fast-paced receiving corps featuring DeAndre Hopkins and rookies Will Fuller and Braxton Miller. With an unproven roster, including six new starters on offense, Joniak believed the Bears should utilize this as an \\"element of surprise\\" against the Texans. On their opening drive, the Texans reached the Bears' 34-yard line, but had their drive end when Tracy Porter pulled the ball away from Hopkins for the interception; Chicago capitalized on the takeaway with Jeremy Langford's one-yard touchdown run. After the Texans punted, the Bears elected to attempt a fourth down conversion at Houston's 31-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs when Jay Cutler fumbled the snap. Nick Novak kicked a 28-yard field goal in the second quarter. The Texans took the lead when Osweiler threw a 23-yard touchdown pass to Hopkins, and had a chance to increase the margin when Osweiler threw a potential 83-yard touchdown pass to Fuller, but he dropped the pass; they punted three plays later. With 31 seconds left in the half, the Bears offense traveled 75 yards on three plays, including a 54-yard pass by Cutler to Alshon Jeffery, ending the drive with Cutler's 19-yard touchdown pass to Eddie Royal. On the second play of the third quarter, Cutler was intercepted by Andre Hal after Kevin White appeared to stop running his route midplay. Novak kicked a 28-yard field goal on the resulting drive. The next five drives of the game ended in punts, ending early in the fourth quarter when Fuller converted a screen pass into an 18-yard touchdown. The Texans increased the score to 23-14 via Novak's 38-yard kick. The Bears were unable to enter Houston territory on their final two drives. In comparison to the first half, the Bears offense struggled in the second; despite recording five first downs on their opening drive and a 75-yard series in the second quarter, the unit had just 71 yards and four first downs in the final two quarters.

Question: Which language spoken by 55 million people is not known to be related to any other Answer:","output":"The language spoken by approximately 55 million people that is not conclusively known to be related to any other is Korean. Korean is the official language of both South Korea and North Korea, and the linguistic classification of this language is debated among scholars and linguists. Korean is considered an isolated language, meaning that it does not have any definitive connections with other languages or language families. However, there are multiple hypotheses about its possible relations, which include Altaic, Dravidian, Austronesian, and Ural-Altaic families, but none of these proposals have gained wide acceptance within the linguistic community. Due to the lack of evidence and consensus, Korean is often classified as a language isolate. Adjacent to Korea are the countries of China, Japan, and Russia, which have influenced its history and culture. Throughout the centuries, Korean has adopted many loanwords and cultural elements from neighboring languages such as Chinese and Japanese. The Korean writing system, Hangul, consists of a combination of logographic (hanja) characters borrowed from the Chinese language, and indigenous alphabetic (hangul) elements. Hangul was developed during the 15th century under the reign of King Sejong the Great, marking a significant departure from the earlier Chinese-based writing system. Despite being classified as a language isolate, Korean has several dialects that have notable differences in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Some of the major dialects include the Seoul dialect, which serves as the basis for the standard Korean used in South Korea; the Pyongan dialect, which is the foundation for the standard Korean in North Korea; and other regional dialects such as Gyeongsang, Jeolla, and Gangwon, among others. Moreover, the grammar of the Korean language follows the subject-object-verb (SOV) word order and relies heavily on agglutination as a method to express grammatical relationships between words. This involves attaching affixes to the base form of words to create meaningful expressions. Historically, the Korean language has been significantly influenced by both Confucian and Buddhist traditions, which have shaped its development. However, since the division of the Korean Peninsula after World War II, the two Koreas evolved separate dialects, vocabularies, and orthographies due to political and social differences. In conclusion, the Korean language is spoken by approximately 55 million people and is regarded as an isolated language with no definitive connections to other languages or language families. While various hypotheses have been proposed about its possible relations, the lack of concrete evidence and consensus among linguists has led to its classification as a language isolate, making it a unique and noteworthy language with a rich history and distinct characteristics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer this question: who was the egyptian god of the nile??","output":"The Egyptian god of the Nile was Hapi, also known as Hapy. He was an extremely important figure in ancient Egyptian religion and mythology due to the crucial role the Nile River played in sustaining the lives of the Egyptian people. The Nile was the main source of water for crops and livestock, and its annual flooding deposited fertile silt along its banks, allowing the region to flourish. Hapi was considered the deity responsible for the annual flooding and fertility of the land. Although he was not the god of the Nile itself as a river (that honor would go to a goddess named \\"Nun\\"), he was responsible for bringing life, prosperity, and abundance through the waters he brought forth during the inundation period. This was a critical period for the ancient Egyptians, as it replenished the water supply and enabled agriculture to thrive. Therefore, Hapi held immense importance in the pantheon of Egyptian gods and goddesses. Hapi was often depicted as a well-built man with a round body, which reflected this notion of abundance. He usually had the appearance of fertility and prosperity, with a potbelly, wide hips, and pendulous breasts, typical of those who had ample amounts of food available. Hapi was shown with the beard of a pharaoh and a flower headpiece composed of lily stems, papyrus plants, and lotus flowers which symbolized both the Upper and Lower Egypt. As a representation of the Nile's unification of Egypt, Hapi was sometimes depicted with two faces - one looking towards Upper Egypt (the south) and the other towards Lower Egypt (the north). This symbolism represents the joining of these two regions through the Nile, which establishes the unity of the entire country. There were frequently offerings made to Hapi, consisting of food and drink, in an attempt to please the god and ensure that he would continue to provide the life-giving waters with which they so heavily relied upon. Hapi was not a prominent god from a specific city or region; rather, he was worshiped throughout Egypt due to the significance of the Nile for the whole country. Temples and sanctuaries dedicated to Hapi were located along the length of the river, with special emphasis paid to locations near key points of the Nile flood. His cult was spread throughout the land, and great celebrations were held in his honor during the time of the annual flooding and the related festivals that followed. In conclusion, Hapi, the Egyptian god of the Nile inundation, played a crucial role in ancient Egyptian religion and mythology. He was responsible for the annual flooding of the Nile that transformed an otherwise arid region into a fertile environment, supporting the survival and prosperity of the Egyptian civilization.

Article:","output":"Title: Mel Gibson's Alleged Altercation: A Disturbing Audio Clip Raises Questions and Triggers Investigation  Introduction: An unsettling recording, rumored to be capturing a heated dispute between renowned actor Mel Gibson and his then-girlfriend, has surfaced on the internet, garnering widespread attention and sparking debates. The allegations have prompted law enforcement agencies to initiate an investigation into the potential involvement of the actor in a case of domestic violence.  Body: The audio clip, released on Monday, is the second suggestive recording to be leaked in under a week, both purportedly capturing a verbal spat between the Hollywood star and his ex-partner. In the unsettling recordings, a male voice can be heard engaging in a vehement exchange with a female voice, inevitably raising questions concerning the authenticity of the participants. The site that released the audio claims that the male voice belongs to Mel Gibson, although there has been no official confirmation from the actor's representatives. As the incident gains momentum, law enforcement agencies have initiated an investigation into allegations of domestic violence against Gibson. This development adds another chapter to the already beleaguered career of the actor, who has previously been mired in controversies on and off the set. The leaked audio recordings have once again pushed the issue of domestic violence into the public fore and have opened up a fresh debate on how such occurrences can happen within the confines of a seemingly perfect relationship, even involving high-profile figures. Although the true identity of the voices in the audio clip remains unconfirmed, the impact of the scandal on Mel Gibson's reputation is already evident. The actor, who has starred in and directed various blockbuster films, may face severe consequences in his personal and professional life should the allegations be proven true. This investigation is also likely to induce a thorough review of his previous relationships and intimate interactions. Conclusion: The recordings allegedly featuring Mel Gibson and his ex-girlfriend have left many shocked and pondering about the prevalence of domestic violence. As the authorities continue their investigation, the focus must not solely be on this particular case but on the broader implications of physical and emotional violence within relationships. Domestic violence does not discriminate; it affects people across all walks of life, and in various forms. It is essential, especially when high-profile cases come to light, that they elevate the discourse surrounding the issue of domestic assault, its consequences, and the steps to be taken to combat it. In the case of Mel Gibson, regardless of the truth behind the audio clip, the incident highlights the need for public figures to be held accountable for their actions and reinforces the importance of creating a safe environment for victims and survivors to speak up and seek help.  As the entertainment industry continues to grapple with issues of abuse and misconduct, it is imperative to prioritize the welfare and mental well-being of the individuals involved, as well as to ensure a just outcome that serves as an example for future cases. Domestic violence is an alarming social issue that merits our collective effort in addressing and eradicating its existence in society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a hypothesis: Drew knew they would catch up to him momentarily. Here are the options: Options: (i) yes; (ii) it is not possible to tell; (iii) no; Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"It is not possible to conclusively say that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is true, as well. This is because the given premise does not provide sufficient information to support the hypothesis with certainty. While the premise sets a scene, the hypothesis makes a prediction about the outcome without accounting for all the variables involved. The main premise involves the following elements: 1. Drew is being followed by a boy and a girl on rangy, nervous horses. 2. The horses seem to have a significant amount of speed based on their appearance. 3. The scene occurs in the context of a location called Tubacca alley. The hypothesis suggests that: Drew knew the pursuers (the boy and the girl) would catch up to him momentarily. Now, let's consider the options provided. (i) Yes - If it were possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true, it would mean that there are no other factors that could affect the outcome, and the information available is sufficient to make that conclusion. However, we do not have enough details about Drew's awareness, the distance between them, or any potential obstacles in their path. Therefore, we cannot definitively say \\"yes\\" to this option. (ii) It is not possible to tell - This option is the most accurate answer. With the information provided in the premise, we cannot accurately predict whether the pursuers will catch up to Drew or how Drew knows this will happen. Many factors might influence the outcome (e.g., horses' stamina, the actual distance between Drew and the pursuers, potential obstacles, etc.), making it impossible to tell for sure if the hypothesis is true given the premise. (iii) No - While we cannot conclusively say that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true, we also cannot definitively say this option is the most accurate. The hypothesis may still be true, but we lack enough information to confirm or deny it. Thus, choosing \\"no\\" would mean we can disprove the hypothesis, which we cannot do with the information provided.

This famous doll, called Barbie, was created by Ruth Handler in 1959. Now Barbie is known everywhere. Before Barbie, all dolls were made to look like babies. People thought that this was a way to teach young girls how to become a good mother. Barbie was the first doll made to look like an adult instead of baby. From the beginning, Barbie was a modern career  girl. There was a different Barbie for each job: nurse, teacher, police officer, race car driver, professional basketball player, pilot, as well as the very first female to fly in space. Barbie made it possible for young girls to dream about a future other than being a mother and a housewife. It showed girls that they had choices and could become anything they wanted to be. At the time, these ideas were very new and positive. The movement for equal opportunity  for women had just begun and women wanted to have the same chance as men to do important work. However, Barbie's approval  as a role model has not lasted. Today, many people criticize  Barbie for making young girls too concerned about their appearance .

Andoheb has called him to undertake a mission for the priesthood, but first refreshes his memory on the story of Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.).3000 years ago, Kharis and the Princess Ananka were involved in a forbidden love affair. The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research.After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori (Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. Amina has been researching Egyptian history, which has brought on a strange, clouded feeling in her mind.Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef's mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Sofia (or or ;) (\\"Sofiya\\",) is the capital and largest city of Bulgaria. The city has a population of 1.26 million, while 1.68 million people live in its metropolitan area. The city is located at the foot of Vitosha Mountain in the western part of the country, within less than drive from the Serbian border. Its location in the centre of the Balkan peninsula means that it is the midway between the Black Sea and the Adriatic Sea, whereas the Aegean Sea is the closest to it.  - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate.  - Vitosha, the ancient \\"Scomius\\" or \\"Scombrus\\", is a mountain massif, on the outskirts of Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. Vitosha is one of the symbols of Sofia and the closest site for hiking, alpinism and skiing. Convenient bus lines and rope ways render the mountain easily accessible. Vitosha has the outlines of an enormous dome. The territory of the mountain includes Vitosha nature park that encompasses the best known and most frequently visited parts. The foothills of Vitosha shelter resort quarters of Sofia; Knyazhevo quarter has mineral springs. Vitosha is the oldest nature park in the Balkans. The mountain emerged as a result of volcanic activity and has been subsequently shaped by the slow folding of the granite rock layers and a series of gradual uplifts of the area. It appears dome shaped at first sight, but the mountain, 19 km long by 17 km wide, actually consists of concentric denudational plateaus rising in tiers one above the other. Vitosha is separated into four main parts whose main ridges gather at a crown known as \\"Cherni Vrah\\" (\\"\\"Black Peak\\"\\"). This is the highest point of the mountain at 2290 m and is one of 10 peaks of Vitosha over 2000 m in height.  - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe.

Answer the following question: Given the background: For most substances, when the temperature of the solid is raised high enough, the substance changes to a liquid, and when the temperature of the liquid is raised high enough, the substance changes to a gas. We typically visualize a solid as tiny particles in constant motion held together by attractive forces. As we add heat to the solid, the motion, or the kinetic energy, of the particles increases. At some temperature, the motion of the particles becomes great enough to overcome the attractive forces. The thermal energy that was added to the solid up to this point was absorbed by the solid as kinetic energy, increasing the speed of the molecules. The lowest temperature at which the particles are able to exist in the liquid form is called the melting point .  and the situation: As a science experiment for his school homework, Kendra is putting two ice cubes on separate pans and then putting those pans on burners set to different temperatures. Ice cube A is set on top of a burner set to a low temperature, and ice cube B is placed on a burner set quite a bite higher. One minute later, Kendra begins writing down what she sees happening to the ice cubes.  Answer the following question: Which ice cube will melt faster? Answer:","output":"Ice cube B will melt faster than ice cube A. The reason for this is rooted in the way substances change their state from solid to liquid, which is dependent on the amount of heat energy provided to the substance. In this case, both ice cubes (A and B) are subjected to heat from burners set at different temperatures. As the temperature of a solid substance, such as ice, increases, the kinetic energy of its particles increases as well. This kinetic energy enables the particles to move more rapidly, which gradually weakens the attractive forces that hold them together in a solid state. When enough heat is absorbed, the kinetic energy of the particles overcomes the attractive forces, causing the solid to change into a liquid form. This is known as the process of melting. The melting point of a substance is the lowest temperature at which its particles can exist in a liquid state. In the case of ice, the melting point is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). Since both ice cubes are initially in their solid state, they need to absorb a sufficient amount of thermal energy to achieve their melting point and transition into a liquid state, which is water in this case. The burners that Kendra uses have different temperature settings, with the one for ice cube A being set to a lower temperature and the one for ice cube B set to a higher temperature. With ice cube B being exposed to a higher temperature, it will absorb heat at a faster rate than ice cube A. This increased rate of heat absorption means that ice cube B's particles will gain more kinetic energy more quickly, allowing them to overcome the attractive forces and transition into a liquid state faster than the particles of ice cube A. Consequently, Kendra will observe that ice cube B melts at a faster pace than ice cube A, due to the different temperature settings on the burners and the impact of heat energy on the state transition of the ice cubes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: Alphanumeric LEDs are available in seven-segment, starburst and dot-matrix format.  A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? pick from the following. (A). yes. (B). no.","output":"(A) No. The provided answer was not detailed and long enough. Here is a detailed and long answer: Seven-segment LED displays are widely used in various electronic devices for displaying numeric or, in some cases, alphanumeric characters. These displays are composed of seven linear segments arranged in a specific pattern to represent numbers and some characters. There are several types of LEDs used in seven-segment displays, which are mainly distinguished by the materials used in their production, their color, and the technology used. Here is a list of various types of LEDs available in seven-segment format: 1. Inorganic LEDs: The most common type of LEDs used in seven-segment displays are inorganic LEDs, primarily made from materials like gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium phosphide (GaP), and gallium nitride (GaN). These LEDs are known for their high efficiency, brightness, and long life.    a. Red LEDs: Red LEDs are made from aluminum gallium indium phosphide (AlGaInP) or gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP). They are widely used due to their low cost and high efficiency.    b. Green LEDs: Green LEDs in seven-segment displays typically use gallium phosphide (GaP) or aluminum gallium indium phosphide (AlGaInP) materials.    c. Blue LEDs: Blue LEDs are made from indium gallium nitride (InGaN) and are known for their high brightness and efficiency. 2. Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs): OLEDs are a relatively newer technology compared to inorganic LEDs. They consist of organic molecules that emit light when an electric current is applied. OLEDs offer the advantage of being flexible, thin, and lightweight, resulting in potential applications for flexible seven-segment displays and wearable technologies. 3. SMD (Surface-Mounted Device) LEDs: SMD LEDs are a type of LED package that can be mounted directly onto the surface of a PCB (Printed Circuit Board), without the need for through-hole soldering. SMD LEDs can be used for seven-segment displays that require a compact design or for densely packaged electronic devices. 4. Common Anode and Common Cathode: In addition to the material and color types, seven-segment LED displays can be classified into common anode and common cathode configurations. In a common anode display, all the anode connections of the LEDs are tied together, and segments are turned on or off by grounding individual segment cathodes. In contrast, in a common cathode design, all the cathode connections of the LEDs are tied together, and segments are turned on or off by applying a voltage to individual segment anodes. 5. Multicolor and RGB LEDs: Some seven-segment displays utilize multi-color LEDs or RGB LEDs, which can display multiple colors by combining individual Red, Green, and Blue LEDs. This allows for more vibrant and dynamic color displays in various applications. In conclusion, various types of LEDs are available for use in seven-segment displays, with options regarding the materials, colors, and technologies used. These options provide flexibility for designers and engineers working on various applications, from simple numeric displays to more advanced, multi-color, and flexible displays."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Summarize the following: Different people react to miscarriage in different ways, but everyone — regardless of the circumstances of the miscarriage — needs time to heal. It is important to grieve the loss of your baby as much as you need, as this helps you to accept the loss and begin the healing process.  If you are feeling constantly down and can't seem to recover from your miscarriage, it might be a good idea to seek the help of a counselor. They can help you to work through your feelings and allow you to make sense of what you're going through. It is important to find a counselor that you feel comfortable around, so you feel comfortable opening up about your sadness, fear and anxiety. The hormonal changes that take place in the mother's body following a miscarriage can heighten feelings of sadness or anger, which your partner may not be able to fully understand. Therefore, finding a friend, a close relative or even a support group to whom you can express your feelings is very important. This helps to promote healing and prevent depression.  However, it's important to be be conscious of the fact that a miscarriage is a distressing experience for both the mother and the partner. Both experience the emotional strain of losing the baby, so don't shut your partner out — it is essential that you support each other throughout the grieving process. Also try to keep in mind that both partners may grieve differently. For example, you may cry out loud, while your partner keeps their grief to themselves. This does not mean that their pain is any less real, so try to be understanding. Once you get over the initial physical symptoms of a miscarriage, it's recommended that you work out as much as possible. Any form of exercise is good, as it reduces the levels of androgens (stress hormones) in our body and releases endorphins (happy, relaxing hormones) instead.  Start out by going for a daily 20 minute walk to get the blood flowing — the fresh air will do you good. After that, you can move on to more strenuous activities, like running, biking or rowing. Find a type of exercise that you enjoy doing — anything from dancing to rock climbing to horseback riding. The months following a miscarriage are a difficult time, so it's important to indulge in activities that bring you happiness Doing yoga everyday is highly recommended for women recovering from a miscarriage, as it provides a form of light exercise and helps to calm the mind and relieve tension.  Yoga involves a series of breathing exercises, which promote feelings of calmness and relaxation while also delivering more oxygen into the blood stream, relaxing the muscles and helping you to feel better physically. Yoga can be practiced in the comfort of your own home, with the help of a yoga mat and DVD, or you can find out about classes in your local area. For more detailed instruction on how to do specific yoga breathing exercises, see this article. Anti-anxiety and antidepressant drugs are available to help with depression and anxiety if these feelings become overwhelming. These medications work by inhibiting the serotonin receptors that cause more depression and grief.  These medicines can take up to 3 weeks before you feel a noticeable difference, but over time they tend to produce good results. Talk to your doctor about getting a prescription. The time it take to returning to work and resume normal, everyday activities following a miscarriage varies from one person to another.  Some people will return to work early as a way of dealing with the emotional trauma associated with the loss of their baby. Other people take more time because they don't feel ready to face the real world just yet. How much time you take off after a miscarriage is a completely personal choice, which should be informed by how you feel both mentally and physically. Take as much time as you need — there's no need to rush the decision. Following a miscarriage, it is recommended that you plan any future pregnancies with the help of an obstetrician.  The obstetrician will advise you on any precautions you can take to avoid future miscarriages — this may include instructions to rest enough during pregnancy and follow a balanced diet. He or she may also prescribe you drugs to minimize the chances of miscarrying. This can help you to feel more relaxed and secure during your next pregnancy. For more detailed information on how to prevent a miscarriage, see this article.","output":"Miscarriages affect people differently and require time to heal. Grieving is essential for recovery, and seeking help from a counselor or support group can be beneficial. It's important for partners to support each other during this time. Engaging in exercise and activities like yoga can help improve mental and physical well-being. If depression or anxiety becomes overwhelming, medication may be considered. Recovery time varies, and returning to work is a personal decision.

EXCLUSIVE-India likely to bring in rules to make mills export sugar stocks-sources * Indian PM Modi discussed the issue at the weekend * Policy could be introduced from Oct 1 -sources * Surge in sugar exports could come amid glut in world market * India also considering small local tax on sugar -sources NEW DELHI, Aug 5 (Reuters) - India is likely to bring in rules to make it compulsory for sugar mills to export millions of tonnes of surplus supplies to support local prices, sources said, in a move that could quell growing anger among farmers but add to a glut on global markets. A final decision rests with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who discussed the politically sensitive issue at a weekend meeting with ministers, officials and sugar mill bosses, said the two government sources. The proposal, which could mean mills selling at loss, comes at time when the world sugar market is grappling with a flood of supplies and prices at 6-1/2-year lows. The mandatory export rule, which could be introduced from the start of the next crop year on Oct. 1, would apply only when output was higher than local demand, said the officials, who are directly involved in formulating the policy. If approved, India could overtake Australia as the world's third-largest exporter behind Brazil and Thailand. Food ministry spokesman N.C. Joshi declined to comment. Apart from boosting farm exports, government-backed overseas sales of sugar could also help mills clear about 2.5 billion they owe to 50 million cane growers - a group equivalent in size to the population of Spain and concentrated in politically important states like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. Last year, Modi won 9 out of 10 seats in Uttar Pradesh, which sends the highest number of lawmakers to parliament, as rural voters were swayed by a pledge to keep crop prices high. But mills have been struggling to pay the fixed price to cane farmers, who have been losing patience as the amount of money they are owed piles up. India, the world's largest sugar consumer and biggest producer after Brazil, has been producing more sugar than it needs for the past five years and the trend is likely to continue. At last Saturday's meeting, there was also discussion on an additional tax, which the government calls a cess, on sugar to prop up domestic prices that are the lowest in six years, said the officials. \\"Mandatory exports may force mills to sell sugar at a loss now, but they would (eventually) gain because lower domestic stocks mean higher domestic prices, which will get a leg up because of the cess,\\" said one of the sources. India's mills are expected to produce 28 million tonnes in the next season, when inventories will climb to 10.3 million tonnes, up from 7.5 million tonnes at the start of the current season. Indians consume 24-25 million tonnes of sugar a year, thus could easily export 5-6 million tonnes yearly even after stocking up for emergencies, analysts said. That would be more than the 3 million tonnes that Australia sells and compares to Brazil's exports of 27 million tonnes and Thailand's 10 million tonnes. The sources said the government may also step in to help mills pay dues by using funds raised from the tax. The federal government fixes the price that mills pay to cane growers yearly and some states, invariably, raise it further. In the past six years, government-set prices have soared by 70 percent but sugar prices have slumped to 2,200 rupees (34) a tonne, against an average cost of production of 3,100 rupees. Experts say the higher cane price is the main reason for the surplus which has helped avoid sharp output swings, such as when India had to import 4.3 million tonnes in 2008/09 after exporting 5 million tonnes a year earlier, pushing benchmark New York prices to a 30-year high. Despite an export incentive of 4,000 rupees a tonne, India's overseas sales are expected to be only 800,000 tonnes in the 2014/15 season against 2.2 million tonnes in the previous year. Abinash Verma, director general of the Indian Sugar Mills Association, said the push for exports could lead to further losses at mills but eventually mean a balance between demand and supply at home.

Das and Ed Davies) What was this article about?","output":"This article is about India possibly making new rules for sugar mills to export millions of extra sugar supplies to help local prices.

Article: An advantage of the universal motor is that AC supplies may be used on motors which have some characteristics more common in DC motors, specifically high starting torque and very compact design if high running speeds are used. The negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems caused by the commutator. Such motors are used in devices such as food mixers and power tools which are used only intermittently, and often have high starting-torque demands. Multiple taps on the field coil provide (imprecise) stepped speed control. Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC). Universal motors also lend themselves to electronic speed control and, as such, are an ideal choice for devices like domestic washing machines. The motor can be used to agitate the drum (both forwards and in reverse) by switching the field winding with respect to the armature. Question: How is stepped speed control achieved?","output":"Stepped speed control in universal motors is achieved by having multiple taps on the field coil. These taps provide varying levels of electrical input to the motor, resulting in different speeds. When combined with other components, such as a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC, it allows for imprecise but adjustable speed control. This type of speed control is often found in household appliances like blenders, which advertise multiple speed options."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:You are given a new situation: Environmental scientists are trying to find a solution to reducing the harmful effects of chemicals on the environment. To that end, they developed a transgenic crop with the help of Bt toxin - they referred to it as case A. To test the effectiveness of this new crop they also studied Bt toxin spray - they referred to it as case B. They need to figure out which case is safer for the environment.  and a hint : There is growing concern regarding the use of pesticides in agriculture. Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying.  Please answer this question : In which case the Bt toxin is in an active state, case A or case B? A:","output":"To answer the question, let's go through the details of both cases: Case A: Transgenic crop with the help of Bt toxin In this case, crop plants have been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, producing the toxin in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, the Bt toxin binds to the insect's gut wall, causing the insect to stop feeding and eventually die. Case B: Bt toxin spray In this case, the Bt toxin is used as a spray, which is in an inactive state. It requires digestion by the insect to become active and have any effect. Based on this information, the Bt toxin is in an active state in Case A (transgenic crop with the help of Bt toxin)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: suppose there may be a drought happens, how will it affect more steam rises from water.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"A drought is an extended period of unusually dry weather that leads to a shortage of water. If a drought occurs, it may lead to less availability of water for various purposes, including boiling in this specific process. However, the process of boiling water and the steam produced from it is not directly affected by a drought, as long as you still have access to water. If there may be a drought happening, it will result in more careful use of available water resources and potentially less water usage for non-essential activities like boiling water. But if water is still accessible during the drought and you perform your described process of boiling water, the production of steam will not be affected by the drought, as long as you perform the process correctly: add water to a pot, put it over a heat source, and follow the described steps.

Question: Why were religious figures like Christ painted red? Context: Red was the color of the banner of the Byzantine emperors. In Western Europe, Emperor Charlemagne painted his palace red as a very visible symbol of his authority, and wore red shoes at his coronation. Kings, princes and, beginning in 1295, Roman Catholic cardinals began to wear red costumes. When Abbe Suger rebuilt Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris in the early 12th century, he added stained glass windows colored blue cobalt glass and red glass tinted with copper. Together they flooded the basilica with a mystical light. Soon stained glass windows were being added to cathedrals all across France, England and Germany. In Medieval painting red was used to attract attention to the most important figures; both Christ and the Virgin Mary were commonly painted wearing red mantles.

The exclamation points also emphasize enthusiasm and excitement. 2. Surprising and thoughtful gesture: The tweeter is taking their best friend Takia to New York City for her birthday as a surprise. The element of secrecy (\\"Shhhh\\") adds to the positive sentiment, as it highlights the extent to which the tweeter cares about making the trip special for their friend. 3. First-time experience for the friend: Takia has never been to New York City, which seems to be a surprise to the tweeter (\\"thought every1 has been 2 nyc guess not\\"). This adds an extra layer of excitement to the trip, making it more meaningful because it represents a new and unique experience. 4. Celebration of a special occasion: The trip is planned for Takia's birthday, which is another positive aspect. The tweeter acknowledges the day as a meaningful occasion and seeks to celebrate it in a memorable way. Overall, the sentiment of the tweet is positive due to the anticipation of a fun, thoughtful, and memorable trip for the tweeter's best friend in celebration of her birthday.

Gandhi A:","output":"Title: The Uprising Genre: Historical Drama Plot Summary: The Uprising is a riveting historical drama that chronicles the life of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, as he is urged to take up the fight for India's independence from British rule. Set in early 20th century India, the movie focuses on the personal and political struggles Gandhi faces as he becomes the face of India's quest for freedom, all the while fighting against tradition, prejudice, and his own insecurities. Act 1: The movie starts with Gandhi, a young lawyer from Gujarat, traveling to South Africa to work as a legal advisor for a wealthy Indian businessman. Witnessing blatant racism and the struggles of Indians there, Gandhi embarks on a personal mission to fight against injustice, eventually forming the Natal Indian Congress. His efforts in South Africa draw the attention of Indian freedom fighters back home, who urge him to return and join their cause. Act 2: Upon his return to India, Gandhi begins to familiarize himself with the dire situation of the Indians under British rule. As he travels through the country and witnesses scenes of extreme poverty, he becomes convinced that India must fight for its independence from Britain. Gandhi implements the nonviolent civil disobedience method and joins the Indian National Congress, eventually becoming their leader. Act 3: Under Gandhi's leadership, the Indian National Congress organizes nonviolent protests, boycotts, and marches that gradually gain momentum and popular support. The Dandi March is one such turning point, where Gandhi and thousands of followers walk nearly 240 miles to the Arabian Sea and make their own salt as a symbolic act of defiance against the British salt tax. Act 4: Despite revolts breaking out within the Indian National Congress and growing violent incidents, Gandhi remains committed to the nonviolent approach and fasts as a form of protest. His consistent emphasis on nonviolence and unity across religious lines begins to catalyze nationwide support. Act 5: Gandhi's efforts ultimately lead to the Quit India Movement, wherein a mass civil disobedience campaign is launched against British rule. The movement culminates in the nationwide cry for independence, and after years of tireless struggle, India finally achieves freedom from Britain in 1947. Epilogue: Despite the triumph of India's independence, tragedy strikes as the Indian subcontinent is partitioned into the dominions of India and Pakistan, leading to widespread riots and bloodshed between Hindus and Muslims. In the wake of the partition, Gandhi fasts and prays for peace, but his vision of a united India is left unfulfilled. Nevertheless, his selfless dedication to the cause of freedom and the principles of nonviolence leaves a lasting impact across the world, immortalizing him in history as the \\"Mahatma\\" (or \\"Great Soul\\")."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Problem:Pessimistic Richard Tyler (Macaulay Culkin) lives life based on statistics and fears everything. His exasperated parents (Ed Begley, Jr. and Mel Harris) have tried multiple ways to build up the courage of their son, but to little success. Richard is sent to buy a bag of nails for building a treehouse. However, Richard gets caught in a harsh thunderstorm and takes shelter in a library. He meets Mr. Dewey (Christopher Lloyd), an eccentric librarian who gives him a library card, despite Richard's protests he doesn't want a book, since he's only there to escape the storm. Searching for a phone, Richard finds a large rotunda painted with famous literary characters. He slips on some water dripping from his coat and falls down, knocking himself out. Richard awakens to find the rotunda art melting, which washes over him and the library, turning them into illustrations.He is met by the Pagemaster (Christopher Lloyd), who sends him through the fiction section to find the library's exit. Along the way, Richard befriends three anthropomorphic books: Adventure (Patrick Stewart), a swashbuckling gold pirate-like book; Fantasy (Whoopi Goldberg), a sassy but caring lavender fairy tale book; and Horror (Frank Welker), a fearful turquoise \\"Hunchbook\\" with a misshapen spine. The three agree to help Richard if he checks them out. Together, the quartet encounter classic-fictional characters. They meet Dr. Jekyll (Leonard Nimoy) who turns into Mr. Hyde, driving them to the open waters of the Land of Adventure. However, the group is separated after Moby-Dick attacks, following the whale's battle with Captain Ahab (George Hearn). Richard and Adventure are picked up by the Hispaniola, captained by Long John Silver (Jim Cummings). The pirates go to Treasure Island, but find no treasure, nearly causing a mutiny. Fantasy and Horror return and defeat the pirates. Silver attempts taking Richard with him, but surrenders when Richard threatens him with a sword. As Adventure insulted Horror, it caused the hunchbook to get captured by Lilliputians from Gulliver's Travels. Adventure saves him and they make up.In the fantasy section, Richard sees the exit sign on the top of a mountain. However, Adventure's bumbling awakens a dormant dragon. Richard tries to fight the dragon with a sword and shield, but the dragon wraps its tail around him and shakes his armor and weapons off, throws him into the air and swallows him. Richard finds books in the dragon's stomach and uses a beanstalk from the Jack and the Beanstalk to escape. He and the books use it to reach the exit. They enter a large dark room where the Pagemaster awaits them. Richard berates the Pagemaster for the horrors that he suffered, but the Pagemaster reveals the journey was intended to make Richard face his fears.

Roy, who had top-scored in the low-scoring opening match in Bloemfontein with 43, piled into the South Africa A bowlers on a Kimberley pitch which justified its reputation as a batsmen's paradise, hitting 13 fours and six sixes after the Lions had been put in. The Surrey opener made 141, his first Lions century and his highest score in 50-over cricket, from only 110 balls before he was dismissed in the 40th over, ending a second-wicket stand of 198 in 26 overs with his captain James Vince. Jason Roy top-scored for England Lions with 141 as they beat South Africa A by 141 runs on Wednesday. Roy's innings helped England on their way to posting 376 for nine as they claimed a 2-0 one-day series lead. Vince fell agonisingly short of his second century of the tour six overs later, adjudged lbw for 99 from 95 balls, and although wickets tumbled late in the innings, Jonny Bairstow and Ben Stokes maintained the momentum for an imposing total of 376 for nine. There seemed a real danger that would not be enough as Hendricks and Dean Elgar responded with an opening stand of 142 inside 18 overs under the Diamond Oval floodlights. It was Lancashire left-arm spinner Stephen Parry, making his first appearance of the tour, who dragged the Lions back into the match with a tidy spell which earned him the wickets of Elgar, for 66 from 59 balls, and Dane Vilas. Liam Plunkett then claimed one wicket and Mark Wood a couple, but it was Stokes who finally removed Hendricks, driving to cover in the 37th over after making 141, the same score as Roy, from four balls fewer with 14 fours and five sixes. Alex Less readies himself to hit the ball during the match in Kimberley on Wednesday. Harry Gurney also took two wickets before Plunkett returned to claim the last two and end with three for 73 as South Africa A were dismissed for 306 in the 45th over, but Parry remained comfortably the most economical bowler. The Lions now have the first of three chances to clinch the series in Potchefstroom on Saturday, when South Africa's World Cup wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock is expected to boost the home team as he looks for match practice after an ankle injury. Tim Bresnan could come into contention for the Lions, as the Yorkshire all-rounder flew into Johannesburg on Wednesday, and Sam Billings hopes to recover from the nasty illness which ruled him out in Kimberley.

OPT: (1). degradation of nutrients due to pesticides; (2). formation of deserts due to tree felling; (3). flooding due to dam construction; (4). removal of nutrients due to heavy rains; Your answer:","output":"The option that best represents a soil change due to only natural causes is (4). removal of nutrients due to heavy rains.  Since ancient times, soil erosion by water has been a natural geological process shaping landforms and contributing to soil formation. However, it is also one of the most significant global environmental problems.  When heavy rain falls, the kinetic energy of the falling water detaches soil particles. This process is called splash erosion. The fallen water also contributes to the saturation of the soil, enhancing the runoff effect; this is known as sheet erosion. At a more localized level, smaller water currents form and begin to transport detached soil particles downstream, resulting in a process called rill erosion. If these currents become more significant, they can create larger and deeper channels called gullies which, in some cases, can reach several meters deep and wide. All these erosion processes remove and transport soil nutrients and organic matter, degrading the soil fertility and structure. The removed soil particles rich in nutrients are typically deposited in reservoirs, deltas, and the seabed, causing a loss of agricultural productivity in eroded areas, while potentially stimulating productivity in the deposition zones. The lost nutrients have to be replaced, most often artificially via the application of fertilizers, to maintain agricultural productivity, which subsequently increases the economic cost of farming. Therefore, the removal of nutrients due to heavy rains could be considered a soil change due solely to natural causes. This is different from the other options mentioned: degradation of nutrients due to pesticides, formation of deserts due to tree felling, and flooding due to dam construction, which all result from human activities. Pesticides are synthetic substances applied to control pests, weeds, and diseases; tree felling refers to the cutting down of trees, often due to deforestation activities; and dam construction is another human action that significantly transforms landscape and affects natural water flow, all of which have significant impacts on soil conditions and characteristics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A high school valedictorian denied her diploma after delivering a speech deemed too racy by her principal says she will not apologize for her choice of words. Appearing on NBC's Today show, recent graduate Kaitlin Nootbaar from Oklahoma's Prague High School said she doesn't need her diploma nor does her school need her apology after using the word 'Hell' in her class speech. 'I know what I've achieved and the fact that I don't want to give an apology, maybe I'll never get my diploma and that's fine,' the 18-year-old told NBC's Matt Laurer on Wednesday. Scroll down for video. Won't back down: High school valedictorian Kaitlin Nootbaar has refused to apologize after delivering a speech at her high school graduation that included the word 'Hell' in it. Upset: Because of her refusal to apologize, her former high school has refused to give her her diploma which has upset both her and her father, left. Appearing by her father's side, David Nootbaar, a military veteran, expressed his pride in his daughter for not backing down and practicing her first amendment in her speech that drew laughter and applause by her fellow students. 'Why should she bow down to this man and give those rights away when so many young men are laying their lives on the line to protect those rights?' Mr Nootbaar said. Moving on without her diploma, Miss Nootbaar is preparing to start her freshmen year at Southwestern Oklahoma State University on a full scholarship this fall after receiving straight A's throughout her four years in high school. When she went to collect her certificate from the school's administration office last week she was told she wouldn't be getting it until she wrote a formal letter apologising for using the unacceptable word. Not needed: Despite denied her diploma, the straight-A student says she doesn't need it as she embarks on her freshmen year of college on full scholarship. Apology: The 18-year-old issued an apology to her school and teachers on Wednesday, however, after hearing of numerous calls of harassment over the issue. 'We went to the office and asked for the diploma and the principal said \\"Your diploma is right here but you’re not getting it. Close the door we have a problem\\",' Mr Nootbaar told kfor.com. The script for the teenager's speech - inspired by the film Eclipse: The Twilight Saga -. had been given to the school in advance of the ceremony. It included the. word 'heck' but in the moments leading up to the ceremony she said she decided to change it to 'hell' instead. 'Right before I got on stage is when I talked it over with my classmates and the ones I had talked to were like no go ahead and say it!' she told NBC. As her father explained: 'Her quote was, when she first started school she wanted to be a nurse, then a veterinarian. Parody: The valedictorian, pictured, said that her speech was a parody of one given in the Twilight movie Eclipse. 'And now that she was getting closer. to graduation people would ask her what do you want to do and she said. \\"How the hell do I know? I’ve changed my mind so many times.\\"' Furious, Miss Nootbaar said she won't be saying sorry because she doesn't think she did anything wrong. 'She earned that diploma she completed all the state curriculum,' said Mr Nootbaar. 'In four years she has never made a B. She got straight A’s and had a 4.0 the whole way through. 'She has worked so hard to stay at the top of her class and this is not right.' Despite her upset, Miss Nootbaar did offer one apology to her teachers, however. 'I'm sorry about the problems that this has caused the school especially the teachers. I've heard that they've been getting calls from numerous people and that would be nice if that would stop,' she said. Watch the video here:.

To answer the question \\"Along with New Yorkese, what is another name for the New York dialect?\\", we can look into the various names and variations of this dialect. The New York dialect, also known as New Yorkese or New York City English, has been influenced by the various waves of immigration and cultural shifts throughout the city's history, which in turn has spawned a range of sub-dialects and associated terms. These include terms such as Brooklynese, Bronxese, or Noo Yawk Tawk, which are often used to describe the speech patterns and accents specific to certain boroughs or neighborhoods of New York City. New York City English is best characterized by its unique pronunciations, vocabulary, and grammatical structures, which have set it apart from the standard American English. Some of the most distinctive features of this dialect include the pronunciation of the \\"r\\" sounds (also known as the \\"New York r\\"), the nasalized \\"a\\" sounds, and the use of specific slang words or expressions unique to the city. As mentioned earlier, several changes have occurred within the dialect over the years, due to the influx of both European and non-European immigrants, socio-economic shifts, and increased exposure to standard American English. This has led to a gradual decline in the prominence of the traditional New York dialect, especially among younger generations. However, it still remains an important part of the city's cultural history and a symbol of its diverse and dynamic linguistic heritage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Process:  - Carbon dioxide enters the leaves through the stomates by diffusion - Water is transported to the leaves in the xylem - Energy harvested through light reaction is stored by forming ATP - Carbon dioxide and energy from ATP are used to create sugar - Oxygen exits the leaves through the stomata by diffusion - The plant reuses the water or the water exits through the stomata as water vapor.  suppose area is cleared around the plant happens, how will it affect less oxygen exits through leaves.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","output":"If an area is cleared around the plant, it will likely have an indirect impact on a step in the process. The reason for this is that the physical conditions and environment surrounding the plant can influence various aspects of plant growth and development. For example, if an area is cleared around the plant, factors such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed may change, which could indirectly influence stomatal opening and closing. Stomata are responsible for regulating gas exchange (carbon dioxide and oxygen) and water vapor transpiration. As a result, these environmental changes might influence the rate of transpiration and the diffusion of oxygen out of the leaves. However, this perturbation will not directly affect the core process of photosynthesis, where carbon dioxide is converted into glucose and oxygen using the energy from light. The main steps of photosynthesis, such as light absorption, electron transfer, and carbon fixation, will still occur as long as the plant has access to light, water, and carbon dioxide. In summary, clearing an area around a plant may have indirect effects on the rate at which oxygen exits the leaves through the stomata, but it does not directly impact the fundamental photosynthetic processes occurring within the plant cells."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Make your wife feel good by giving her compliments or praise. Think of the compliments you gave her when you first started dating. Tell her those same compliments and how they still make you love her even more.  Start the day by giving your wife a compliment. Let her know at the start of the day how beautiful she is and how lucky you are to have her. Be persistent. If she refuses your compliment or she undercuts your compliment because she doesn’t think you are sincere, be persistent. Tell her again and look into to her eyes, then give her a hug to let her know that you are serious. An indirect way to compliment your wife is to stop ogling other women. A harmless glance never hurt anybody, but if you stare or make a comment it will hurt your wife’s feelings. Keep your focus on your wife; she will appreciate it. Brag about her to other people. If she hears you she will adore you. Or somebody will eventually tell her what you said and she will appreciate it. This does not mean you need to go out and buy expensive jewelry, clothes, or a hand bag; rather, something thoughtful like a surprise back rub, a hot bath with rose petals, or a bouquet of flowers sent to her work.  Buy her a cozy robe she can wrap herself up in after a hot bath or shower. Give her some time alone to relax and do what she wants to do around the house. Cook her favorite dinner. All she has to do is show up and sit at the table. You do the rest. Get her some plush slippers to wear around the house. Prepare a picnic all by yourself and pick a scenic location. Good smelling toiletries are always a hit. Give her some bath goodies and prepare a hot bath with rose petals. Then, have her cozy robe and plush slippers ready when she gets out. Chocolate, of course, almost always works. Women love to receive original love letters from the person they care most about and, in today’s world, a love letter is very rare indeed. Sending “I am thinking about you” texts, tweets, or emails are nice, but putting something down on paper and placing it in an envelope with her name on it is something special. She will certainly consider this a thoughtful gift.  Write down your most romantic thoughts and memories on nice letter paper. Make it smell good by spraying a small amount of her favorite scent or your aftershave or cologne on the paper. Be romantic and write a letter for every week of the year. Don’t copy something you found on the internet. Make sure your letter is original and sincere by expressing your appreciation and clearly describing your feelings as you write down your thoughts. This will personalize your letter. Try poetry. Even if you never wrote a poem before, she will certainly appreciate your effort. This does not mean the typical, and perhaps boring, dinner and a movie. Instead, try something novel, inspirational, or adventurous that provides a lasting and romantic memory for life.  Try something spontaneous and adventurous like arriving at the airport with no bags or destination and jump on a plane to somewhere you never been before. Do something inspirational, like participating in a new activity together. Try making pottery, go ice skating, or take a class on how to give a sensual massage. Seek out something novel, like a hot air balloon ride, horseback riding, or rock climbing. The nice thing about long marriages is that you create a lot of good memories. Don’t let those memories get stuck in a photo album or in reminiscing – relive them. Treat your wife like she is your girlfriend all over again.  Take a trip back to where you first met. Kiss her and compliment her like you did when you were trying to win her over. Visit the restaurant where you had your first date or go to the movie theater where you watched your first movie together. Sit down and watch your wedding video again. Tell her how beautiful she was on that special day and how she is still beautiful to this day. People often get caught up on how many times a week they have sex or become so busy with their job, kids, and other responsibilities that sex becomes more of an act that an intimate encounter. Try to take one day a week to slow things down and become deeply intimate with your wife by spending quality time in the bedroom together. Show her that making love to her is still something that is important.  There is no actual “right amount of sex” for a married couple to have. Focus on quality rather than quantity if you are trying to get your wife to love you again. Concentrate on all the special actions that demonstrate to your wife that you are “making love” rather than “having sex.” Although it’s nice to have candles lit after a hot bath with soft music playing in the background for a romantic encounter, quality does not necessarily mean romantic. Quality sex should be intimate and a show your desire to show your wife that you truly love her. Practice good health and hygiene. Your wife will be proud to be at your side if you take pride in your appearance. She will probably appreciate it if you stay in good shape. Take a shower every day, wear clean clothes, and brush your teeth and hair.  This also means to clean up after yourself. Throw dirty clothes in the hamper and clean up the sink when you are finished shaving. Mind your manners. Living with somebody for a long time gives comfort and security that should not be taken advantage of. Use manners when you have a bodily function, such as saying, \\"Excuse me\\" when you burp or pass gas.","output":"To make your wife feel good and loved, practice giving her compliments and praise consistently, reminding her of the qualities you loved about her from the beginning of your relationship. Start your day by complimenting her and be persistent even if she tries to shrug it off. Avoid ogling other women and instead, focus on your wife and brag about her to others. Show her your appreciation through thoughtful gestures such as surprising her with a prepared hot bath with rose petals, cooking her favorite dinner, or buying her a cozy robe and slippers. Small gifts like chocolates and heartfelt, handwritten love letters also go a long way in making her feel special. Keep the romance alive by engaging in creative and adventurous activities together. This can include spontaneous trips, learning new activities together, or rekindling old memories by revisiting places where you shared significant experiences together. Prioritize intimacy in your relationship, focusing on the quality of your time in the bedroom rather than the frequency of your encounters. Concentrate on creating a deeply connected and loving atmosphere when making love. Maintain good health, hygiene, and manners as a sign of respect and consideration for your wife. Keep yourself clean, pick up after yourself, and practice polite behavior, even in the comfort of your own home. By consistently doing these things, you can make your wife feel cherished and loved in your relationship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He and his girlfriend Tina (Rosie Perez) have a son. He's a pizza delivery man at the local pizzeria, but lacks ambition. Sal (Danny Aiello), the pizzeria's Italian-American owner, has been in the neighborhood for twenty-five years. His older son Pino (John Turturro) intensely dislikes blacks, and does not get along with Mookie. Pino is at odds with his younger brother Vito (Richard Edson), who is friendly with Mookie. The neighborhood is full of distinct personalities, including Da Mayor (Ossie Davis), a friendly local drunk; Mother Sister (Ruby Dee), who watches the neighborhood from her brownstone; Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn), who blasts Public Enemy on his boombox wherever he goes; and Smiley (Roger Guenveur Smith), a mentally disabled man, who meanders around the neighborhood trying to sell hand-colored pictures of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. While at Sal's, Mookie's trouble-making b-boyish friend, Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito), questions Sal about his \\"Wall of Fame\\", a wall decorated with photos of famous Italian-Americans. Buggin' Out demands that Sal put up pictures of black celebrities since Sal's pizzeria is in a black neighborhood. Sal replies that he doesn't need to feature anyone but Italians as it is his restaurant. Buggin' Out attempts to start a protest over the Wall of Fame. Only Radio Raheem and Smiley support him. During the day, the heat and tensions begin to rise. The local teenagers open a fire hydrant and douse the street, before police officers intervene. Mookie and Pino begin arguing over race, which leads to a series of scenes in which the characters spew racial insults into the camera. Pino and Sal talk about the neighborhood, with Pino expressing his hatred, and Sal insisting that he is not leaving. Sal almost fires Mookie, but Jade intervenes, before Mookie confronts her for being too close to Sal. That night, Buggin' Out, Radio Raheem, and Smiley march...

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the last name of the person who encouraged their pregnant lover to rob? ?  By the time of the third plate, Tom Nero has progressed from the mistreatment of animals to theft and murder. Having encouraged his pregnant lover, Ann Gill, to rob and leave her mistress, he murders the girl when she meets him. The murder is shown to be particularly brutal: her neck, wrist, and index finger are almost severed. Her trinket box and the goods she had stolen lie on the ground beside her, and the index finger of her partially severed hand points to the words \\"God's Revenge against Murder\\" written on a book that, along with the Book of Common Prayer, has fallen from the box. A woman searching Nero's pockets uncovers pistols, a number of pocket watches—evidence of his having turned to highway robbery (as Tom Idle did in Industry and Idleness),  and a letter from Ann Gill which reads: Dear TommyMy mistress has been the best of women to me, and my conscience flies in my face as often as I think of wronging her; yet I am resolved to venture body and soul to do as you would have me, so do not fail to meet me as you said you would, for I will bring along with me all the things I can lay my hands on. So no more at present; but I remain yours till death. Ann Gill. The spelling is perfect and while this is perhaps unrealistic, Hogarth deliberately avoids any chance of the scene becoming comical. A discarded envelope is addressed \\"To Thos Nero at Pinne...\\". Ronald Paulson sees a parallel between the lamb beaten to death in the Second Stage and the defenceless girl murdered here. Below the print, the text claims that Nero, if not repentant, is at least stunned by his actions: Various features in the print are meant to intensify the feelings of dread: the murder takes place in a graveyard, said to be St Pancras but suggested by John Ireland to resemble Marylebone; an owl and a bat fly around the scene; the moon shines down on the crime; the clock strikes one for the end of the witching hour. The composition of the image may allude to Anthony van Dyck's The Arrest of Christ. A lone Good Samaritan appears...

Information:  - The Holy Land (Hebrew: , ; Arabic: ) is an area roughly located between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea that also includes the Eastern Bank of the Jordan River. Traditionally, it is synonymous with both the biblical Land of Israel and historical Palestine. The term usually refers to a territory roughly corresponding to the modern State of Israel, the Palestinian territories, western Jordan, and parts of southern Lebanon and southwestern Syria. It is considered holy by Jews, Christians, and Muslims.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Yaghi-Siyan (died June 3, 1098) was the governor of Antioch during the First Crusade.  - The Siege of Antioch took place during the First Crusade in 1097 and 1098 . The first siege , by the crusaders against the Muslim - held city , lasted from 21 October 1097 to 2 June 1098 . Antioch lay in a strategic location on the crusaders ' route to Palestine . Supplies , reinforcements and retreat could all be controlled by the city . Anticipating that it would be attacked , the Muslim governor of the city , Yaghi - Siyan , began stockpilling food and sending requests for help . The Byzantine walls surrounding the city presented a formidable obstacle to its capture , but the leaders of the crusade felt compelled to besiege Antioch anyway . The crusaders arrived outside the city on 21 October and began the siege . The garrison sortied unsuccessfully on 29 December . After stripping the surrounding area of food , the crusaders were forced to look farther afield for supplies , opening themselves to ambush and while searching for food on 31 December , a force of 20,000 crusaders encountered a relief force led by Duqaq of Damascus heading to Antioch and defeated the army . However , supplies dwindled and in early 1098 one in seven of the crusaders was dying from starvation and people began deserting in January . A second relief force , this time under the command of Ridwan of Aleppo , advanced towards Antioch , arriving on 9 February . Like the army of Duqaq before , it was defeated . Antioch was captured on 3 June , although the citadel remained in the hands of the Muslim defenders . Kerbogha began the second siege , against the crusaders who had occupied Antioch , which lasted from 7 June to 28 June 1098 . The second siege ended when the crusaders exited the city to engage Kerbogha 's army in battle and succeeded in defeating them . On seeing the Muslim army routed , the defenders remaining in the citadel surrendered .  - Pope Urban II (  29 July 1099), born Odo of Châtillon or Otho de Lagery, was Pope from 12 March 1088 to his death in 1099. He is best known for initiating the First Crusade (109699) and setting up the modern-day Roman Curia in the manner of a royal ecclesiastical court to help run the Church.  - Syria, officially known as the Syrian Arab Republic (\\"\\"), is a country in Western Asia, bordering Lebanon and the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, Jordan to the south, and Israel to the southwest. Syria's capital and largest city is Damascus.  - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history.  - Antioch on the Orontes (also Syrian Antioch) was an ancient Greco-Roman city on the eastern side of the Orontes River. Its ruins lie near the modern city of Antakya, Turkey, and lends the modern city its name.  - The First Crusade (10951099) was the first of a number of crusades that attempted to capture the Holy Land, called by Pope Urban II in 1095. It started as a widespread pilgrimage in western Christendom and ended as a military expedition by Roman Catholic Europe to regain the Holy Land taken in the Muslim conquests of the Levant (632661), ultimately resulting in the capture of Jerusalem in 1099.   - The Orontes () or Asi (\\"\\") is a northward flowing river starting in Lebanon and flowing through Syria and Turkey before entering the Mediterranean Sea.  - Antakya (\\"Anky\\" from , \\"Aniokia\\" \\"Antiócheia\\"), is the seat of the Hatay Province in southern Turkey.  - The Levant (Arabic:  \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term \\"Mashriq\\", meaning \\"the land where the sun rises\\".  - Jerusalem , is a city located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. One of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem was named as \\"\\"Urusalima\\"\\" on ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets, probably meaning \\"City of Shalem\\" after a Canaanite deity, during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BCE). During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.    What is the relationship between 'siege of antioch' and 'antakya'?","output":"The relationship between the 'Siege of Antioch' and 'Antakya' lies in their geographical connection. The Siege of Antioch took place during the First Crusade in 1097 and 1098, targeting the ancient Greco-Roman city of Antioch on the Orontes, which was a strategically important city on the Crusaders' route to Palestine. Antioch on the Orontes is now in ruins and is located near the modern city of Antakya, Turkey. The modern city of Antakya derives its name from the ancient city of Antioch. Thus, the connection between the Siege of Antioch and Antakya is that the ancient city of Antioch, which was the site of the siege, is situated near the present-day city of Antakya in Turkey."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Samantha likes to clean the house.. [B]. Betty likes to clean the house..","output":"Samantha is having to replace their vacuum bags frequently, but not Betty, as Samantha likes to clean the house more often. It appears that Samantha has a higher preference for maintaining a spotless environment, which is a reflection of her personality and attitude towards household chores. On the other hand, Betty may have different priorities or might simply enjoy cleaning the house less frequently. It's important not to judge them based on their habits, but rather to appreciate the diversity in their approaches to maintaining their respective living spaces. With different personalities come distinct lifestyle preferences and habits. For instance, some people find comfort in meticulously organizing and cleaning the spaces they inhabit. They derive great satisfaction from putting things in order, ensuring that everything has a place, and completing the tasks necessary to keep their home clean. In this case, Samantha seems to be one of those individuals who genuinely enjoys the process of keeping her house neat and tidy. This could be because she finds it soothing to have a well-organized space or that she simply takes pride in keeping her environment in excellent condition. On the other hand, it is entirely possible that Betty has different priorities when it comes to cleaning and taking care of her home. Perhaps she focuses more on cultivating a warm and welcoming atmosphere rather than an immaculate space. She might spend more time engaging in activities such as cooking, gardening, or spending time with loved ones in her well-used and lived-in home. It's important to remember that just because someone doesn't share the same affinity for cleaning as another doesn't mean they don't care about their home or that their space is any less valuable or enjoyable. Alternatively, maybe Betty simply has a more effective method of cleaning or better tools at her disposal, such as a vacuum cleaner with reusable filters that don't need frequent replacement. In the age of advanced technology, there is a plethora of options available for cleaning appliances that cater to various needs and preferences. It could be that she has chosen a cleaning method, which while still efficient, requires less frequent maintenance. Overall, it is vital to recognize that there are various ways to approach keeping a clean and comfortable home, and each individual is likely to differ in their preferences. Samantha and Betty's contrasting experiences with vacuum bag replacements serve as a useful illustration of this. While Samantha might be content with her routine of changing vacuum bags frequently due to her love for cleaning, Betty might be finding other ways to ensure her house is kept neat and orderly, without the need for constant vacuum bag replacements.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who served as Thomaskantor? is inside the article: Johann Sebastian Bach composed the church cantata Erschallet, ihr Lieder, erklinget, ihr Saiten! (Ring out, you songs; sound, you strings!), BWV 172, in Weimar for Pentecost Sunday in 1714. Bach led the first performance on 20 May 1714 in the Schlosskirche, the court chapel in the ducal Schloss. Erschallet, ihr Lieder is an early work in a genre to which he later contributed complete cantata cycles for all occasions of the liturgical year. Bach was appointed Konzertmeister in Weimar in the spring of 1714, a position that called for the performance of a church cantata each month. He composed Erschallet, ihr Lieder as the third cantata in the series, to a text probably written by court poet Salomon Franck. The text reflects different aspects of the Holy Spirit. The librettist included a quotation from the day's prescribed Gospel reading in the only recitative, and for the closing chorale he used a stanza from Philipp Nicolai's hymn \\"Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern\\" (1599). The work is in six movements, and scored for four vocal soloists, four-part choir, three trumpets, timpani, oboe, bassoon and a string orchestra of two violins, two violas, and basso continuo. The orchestra for the holiday occasion is festive compared to the two works previously composed in Weimar. The cantata opens with a chorus, followed by the recitative, in which words spoken by Jesus are sung by the bass as the vox Christi (voice of Christ). A bass aria with trumpets addresses the Trinity, and a tenor aria then describes the Spirit that was present at the Creation. This is followed by an intimate duet of the Soul (soprano) and the Spirit (alto), to which an oboe plays the ornamented melody of Martin Luther's hymn \\"Komm, Heiliger Geist, Herre Gott\\" and a solo cello provides the bass line. The theme of intimacy between God and Man is developed further in the following chorale, after which Bach specified an unusual repeat of the opening chorus.

Here is a question about this article: In the 1820s, Boston's population grew rapidly, and the city's ethnic composition changed dramatically with the first wave of European immigrants. Irish immigrants dominated the first wave of newcomers during this period, especially following the Irish Potato Famine; by 1850, about 35,000 Irish lived in Boston. In the latter half of the 19th century, the city saw increasing numbers of Irish, Germans, Lebanese, Syrians, French Canadians, and Russian and Polish Jews settled in the city. By the end of the 19th century, Boston's core neighborhoods had become enclaves of ethnically distinct immigrants—Italians inhabited the North End, Irish dominated South Boston and Charlestown, and Russian Jews lived in the West End. Irish and Italian immigrants brought with them Roman Catholicism. Currently, Catholics make up Boston's largest religious community, and since the early 20th century, the Irish have played a major role in Boston politics—prominent figures include the Kennedys, Tip O'Neill, and John F. Fitzgerald. What is the answer to this question: What was the estimated population of Irish people living in Boston in 1850?","output":"The estimated population of Irish people living in Boston in 1850 was about 35,000. This initial wave of Irish immigrants was largely a result of the Irish Potato Famine, and their arrival significantly changed the ethnic composition of the city. The Irish presence continued to grow throughout the latter half of the 19th century, and they, along with other immigrant groups such as Germans, Lebanese, Syrians, French Canadians, and Russian and Polish Jews, came to occupy distinct ethnic enclaves in various parts of the city. In particular, Boston's South Boston and Charlestown neighborhoods were heavily dominated by Irish immigrants.  In addition to making a significant demographic impact, the Irish community has also profoundly shaped the religious and political character of Boston. For example, the influx of Irish (and Italian) immigrants brought Roman Catholicism to the city, making Catholicism Boston's largest religious community today. Furthermore, the Irish community has long played a major role in Boston politics, with notable figures such as the Kennedys, Tip O'Neill, and John F. Fitzgerald hailing from this background. Hence, the arrival of around 35,000 Irish immigrants in Boston by 1850 marked the beginning of a transformative period in the city's history that continues to influence its cultural, religious, and political life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who disposes of a body? , can you please find it?   In 1955 in Portland, Oregon, a businessman finds his wife in bed with another man, and commits a double murder-suicide. His young son, Paul, witnesses the three deaths, and is traumatized. Twenty-five years later, in 1980, Paul is incarcerated at a psychiatric institution near Stanford Bay, a small town on the Oregon Coast. One day, Paul manages to murder an orderly, and subsequently retrieves a beloved wooden flute given to him by his father before escaping the institution. Local teenager Marion is struggling to adjust to her disability—she survived a car accident several years prior, caused by her drunken father Frank, which left her unable to walk without the help of a leg brace. She is plagued by bizarre dreams, which she comes to discover are in fact premonitions; while in the hospital after her accident, she received a blood transfusion from Paul, which has given her extrasensory perception into Paul's actions. Marion's home life is troubled, with her father being verbally abusive to her and her mother, Bea, and she dreams of leaving Stanford Bay once her fisherman boyfriend, Joey, obtains a job in Portland. Meanwhile, Paul hitchhikes with a truck driver whom he bludgeons to death with a hatchet, and then steals his vehicle. He subsequently picks up a female hitchhiker, who he brings to a local motel in Stanford Bay, and murders her after failing to charm her with his flute-playing. Marion's psychic visions of Paul's murders increase in frequency and intensity, and sh soon witnesses him in person disposing of a body on a rural beach, making her his next target. Marion manages to elude to Paul, but he later discovers where she lives, and infiltrates her home, killing Frank. Struggling to walk, Marion manages to flee her home to an adjacent sawmill, and is pursued by Paul. While chasing Marion, Paul impales a worker with a forklift, and then inadvertently crashes through a barrier, driving the forklift off the pier and into the bay.

Cracking Down on Toxic Makeup Let's put this out there first: I do not know much about cosmetics. I have deodorant and shaving cream and—because I burn in the sun faster than Robert Pattinson in Twilight—lots and lots of sunblock. The average American uses 10 personal care products a day, and I am sub-average. But I do know that government regulation of cosmetics and other personal care products is badly lacking. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may regulate foods and drugs relatively well—with some exceptions—but the agency can't require cosmetics companies to conduct safety assessments, control the labeling of products or force product recalls. Just a fifth of the chemicals in cosmetics have actually been assessed by the FDA's safety panel. As it is for industrial chemicals—as I wrote in TIME this past April—regulation tends to be in name alone, with the cosmetics industry effectively self-policing. And if you think industry can police itself—well, there's a spillcam I'd like to show you. And the chemicals inside many cosmetics—shampoos, moiturizers, lipstick and more—are worth worrying about. Carcinogens like formaldehyde, neurotoxins like lead, endocrine disrupters like phthalates—they're often found, even in just trace amounts, in cosmetics and personal care items. An investigation by the Chicago Tribune in May found that some skin-whitening creams had dangerous levels of mercury, enough to cause kidney damage. I could go on—but Annie Leonard—the author of the book The Story of Stuff and its accompanying film—has made a short web video that tells the tale with much more punch than I could manage. (Especially at 5 PM.) It's the Story of Cosmetics: Alarming stuff—enough to make you want to ditch the eyeshadow and just go natural. But as Leonard points out, real change needs to come not just from the consumer, or even industry, but in the laws that govern cosmetic and chemical regulation. And there's some positive news from Washington: today Representatives Jan Schakowsky, Ed Markey and Tammy Baldwin introduced the Safe Cosmetics Act of 2010. The legislation aims to phase out cosmetic ingredients linked to cancer and developmental harm, improve protection for children and other vulnerable populations and close labeling loopholes that allow companies to classify any number of chemicals under innocuous terms like \\"fragrances.\\" Here's what Schakowsky said in a statement: Harmful chemicals have no place in the products we put on our bodies or on our children's bodies. Our cosmetics laws are woefully out of date—manufacturers aren't even required to disclose all their ingredients on labels, leaving Americans unknowingly exposed to harmful mystery ingredients. This bill will finally protect those consumers. Passing the bill won't easy—the Personal Care Products Council, a trade group for the industry, argues that the legislation would place impossible burdens on the FDA, and that it's \\"not based on credible and established scientific principles.\\" (Meaning theirs.) But at the very least the industry does seem to recognize that it has a problem, and is open to strengthening regulation at the FDA level, which is a start. The truth is that the industry needs stronger regulations as much as the consumer. The science connecting chemicals found in many personal care products to health problems is early and often far from conclusive—but the vague labels and lack of transparency from the FDA is already eroding consumer confidence and trust. You can, if you try very hard, shop your way out of the problem and only buy organic or chemical-free cosmetics. (And if you want to do that, check out the new book No More Dirty Looks, which can help you look good and green.) But most consumers just want to be able to buy products at the drug store and have faith that someone—someone not making a profit on it—is ensuring they're safe. That doesn't seem to much to ask. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about the concerns regarding toxic chemicals in makeup and other personal care products. It talks about how the government regulation of cosmetics is not very strong, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn't control these products as much as it should. Many cosmetics contain harmful chemicals, like formaldehyde and lead, which can be dangerous. The article also mentions a new law called the Safe Cosmetics Act of 2010, which aims to make cosmetics safer by removing harmful ingredients and improving labels on the products. The writer believes that stronger regulations are needed to protect consumers and make them feel more confident about the safety of the products they use.  So, this article is about the need for better rules and laws to keep makeup and other products safe for people to use."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Do you blank out or feel so nervous in exams that you have trouble writing answers to questions that you knew just last night? If so, you likely have a case of test anxiety. But, don't be afraid. By recognizing the problem, you are taking the first step towards overcoming it. Believe it or not, a touch of nervousness can sharpen your mind, allowing you to perform more quickly. This is because under stress, the body releases   the hormone adrenaline  , which prepares it for something important that will happen. However, too much anxiety can result in sleeplessness, loss of appetite before tests, and poor performance. Some people might feel hot and tired. With great anger they often shout or complain for no reason. If you worry a lot or are a perfectionist, you are more likely to have trouble with test anxiety. Those who have prepared poorly for a test or have had negative experiences taking tests may also experience test anxiety. When you feel a storm of anxiety coming on, stop what you're doing and make your mind a blank. If possible, actually tell yourself to 'STOP!' This will get your mind off the stress. Then think of being at a place of comfort and let your body relax. As you continue the test, find questions you know the answers to and answer them first. This will help restore your confidence. Important of all, talk to yourself using positive language. Make it a habit to replace each negative thought with a logical reason. For example: \\"I've studied hard and I know the material, so I'm ready to do the best I can.\\" Another thing you can do is to learn to accept mistakes. In fact, they can be valuable learning opportunities. Last but not least, start test preparation early - three to five days ahead of the quiz or test. After all, good study habits and skills - for example, time management and note-taking - will give you the feeling that you are in control. What can we infer from the passage? A) Mistakes sometime can be valuable and helpful. B) Those who have prepared poorly for a test cause test anxiety easily. C) Full test preparations will give you the feeling that you are in control. D) A touch of anxiety can have a positive effect. Answer:","output":"We can infer from the passage that all of the options (A, B, C, and D) are correct.  A) Mistakes sometimes can be valuable and helpful, as they can be learning opportunities. B) Those who have prepared poorly for a test can cause test anxiety easily, as poor preparation and negative experiences with tests can lead to anxiety. C) Full test preparations will give you the feeling that you are in control, by allowing good study habits and skills to mitigate anxiety. D) A touch of anxiety can have a positive effect, as it can sharpen your mind and help you perform more quickly due to adrenaline release."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: Main components: computers, reportedly located, U.S., Canada, South Korea Sentence 2: Main components: PCs, scattered, United States, Canada, South Korea Step 2: Compare the components for similarities and differences. Similarities: - Both sentences refer to computers or PCs - Both sentences mention the same three locations: U.S. / United States, Canada, and South Korea Differences: - Sentence 1 uses the term \\"computers\\" while Sentence 2 uses \\"PCs\\". However, these terms can be considered synonymous in most contexts. - Sentence 1 uses \\"reportedly located\\" while Sentence 2 uses \\"scattered\\". These two phrases somewhat differ in meaning. \\"Reportedly located\\" implies that the information comes from a source or sources, while \\"scattered\\" simply states that the computers are dispersed across the mentioned locations. Step 3: Determine if the sentences convey the same meaning. Based on the comparison of the main components of both sentences, I can conclude that they convey the same general idea, but with a slight difference in the source of information mentioned and the dispersal of the computers.

Today we're going to learn about some easy ways to keep our fish friends happy and healthy in their fish tank home. We want to make sure they have the best home possible, so let's learn some tips together. 1. Schedule Weekly Partial Water Changes Remember to change your fish tank's water every week, like you would clean your room. But, instead of changing all the water, we only need to change some of it, like when we take half of the toys out of our toy box. This helps to keep the water clean and fresh so our fish friends can swim and breathe easily.  2. \\"Reset\\" Your Tank with Water Changes Sometimes, we need to reset and refresh things, just like when we're playing a game and want to start over. Doing this for our fish tank means changing a lot of the water. This helps to remove any dirt, extra food, or bad things in the water that can make our fish friends not feel well. By resetting the tank, we make sure our fish have a clean and comfy home to live in. 3. Limit Your Light Usage Fish, like us, need to sleep too! They need some time for rest and relaxation, so we should turn off the fish tank light when it's nighttime. Imagine if you had to sleep with the lights on all the time – you wouldn't like it, right? The same thing goes for our fish friends. Turning off the light also helps to stop any algae from growing too much, which can make the water dirty. 4. Avoid Overfeeding We love giving treats to our pets, but we should remember not to give our fish friends too much food. It's like when we eat too much candy – we can get a tummy ache. Overfeeding can also make the fish tank water dirty because the extra food turns into waste. Make sure to give your fish friends just the right amount of food to help them stay happy and healthy. Now that we've learned these simple tips, we can make sure our fish friends have the best home possible. And every time you take care of your fish tank, remember that you're being a great and responsible pet owner!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the last name of the person who was impressed with Deal's ability to move from bass to guitar? , can you please find it?   The album was generally well received. Several music critics favorably compared the album to Deal's work with the Pixies, among which were William Van Meter, Rob Sheffield, and Steve Kandell of Spin. Kandell and Sheffield mentioned tracks including \\"Fortunately Gone\\" as superior to songs by that group. Kandell noted Pod appealed to fans of the Pixies' \\"Gigantic\\", which was written and sung by Deal. In AllMusic, Heather Phares described Pod as a \\"vibrantly creative debut\\" that was better than the Pixies' 1990 album Bossanova, and argued that the Pixies should have recorded more of Deal's compositions.The Rough Guide to Rock's Piers Clifton and Melody Maker's Simon Reynolds viewed Pod as lacking energy in comparison to the Pixies' work. To Clifton, it was \\"plodding\\", while Reynolds felt it sounded \\"inhibited, moribund, stilted\\" and \\"never [let] it rip like the Pixies\\". Reynolds added that \\"Whenever a song gathers momentum or thrust, [the Breeders] throw in a weird bit, a gear change or an abrupt stop. They seem unhappy with the idea of simple rock exuberance.\\" Steve Taylor of The A to X of Alternative Music also found Pod inferior to music of the Pixies, but was impressed with Deal's ability to move from bass to guitar.Some reviews found Pod under-developed or insubstantial. Jon Dolan in Blender likened it to a poorly-constructed building. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice described it unfavorably as more \\"art project\\" than the work of a band, and Greg Sandow in Entertainment Weekly felt the lyrics were sometimes forced.Wif Stenger of Trouser Press called the first side \\"a bit shaky\\" but considered side 2 to be \\"damn near perfect\\". NME's Steve Lamacq described the album as \\"a tight-ish piece of tantalising rock\\", and said that listeners who found it too minimalist would soon warm to it. Karen Schoemer of The New York Times praised Pod's intelligence and originality. Answer:","output":"Taylor"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

At the beginning of the Three Kingdoms era (220–280 CE), Zhejiang was home to the warlords Yan Baihu and Wang Lang prior to their defeat by Sun Ce and Sun Quan, who eventually established the Kingdom of Wu. Despite the removal of their court from Kuaiji to Jianye (present-day Nanjing), they continued development of the region and benefitted from influxes of refugees fleeing the turmoil in northern China. Industrial kilns were established and trade reached as far as Manchuria and Funan (south Vietnam). Along with Manchuria, where did trade reach as far as?","output":"Trade during the Three Kingdoms era in Zhejiang, specifically under the rule of Sun Ce and Sun Quan who established the Kingdom of Wu, reached as far as two distinct regions. The first region is Manchuria, which is located in the northeastern part of China. Manchuria was historically significant for its abundant resources, which made it a pivotal area for trade. The other region is Funan, an ancient pre-Angkor kingdom located around the Mekong Delta, largely corresponding to modern-day mainland Southeast Asia including South Vietnam. Funan played a crucial role in the trade routes connecting China with Southeast Asia and the broader Indian Ocean commerce. It was significant for its productive agriculture, especially the production of rice, and also for its strategic trade location. Therefore, despite upheavals in the northern regions of China causing a massive influx of refugees, the early Kingdom of Wu under Sun Ce and Sun Quan was able to strengthen its economic framework. This prosperity is demonstrated by the reach of Zhejiang's trade routes to both Manchuria and Funan, underlining the kingdom's vast trade network and its involvement in commercial activities during the Three Kingdoms period. The establishment of industrial kilns further reflected the kingdom's efforts in strengthening its industrial foundation, leading to a prosperous era of trade and development."},{"instruction":"Background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. By. Martha De Lacey. Jill Greenberg is bored with the 'controversy' rumbling around her photographs. The portrait artist's beautifully stylised and highly emotive images of very young, damp-cheeked children sobbing up close to her camera lens drew accusations of 'child abuse' when they were first seen in 2006. But the New York-based mother-of-two, who has now released a collection of the photos as a stunning hardback art book with D.A.P. and Madrid-based TF Editores, says she had no intention of creating such a stir with her images, and was shocked to have actually received hate mail as a result of them. The Truth: Jill Greenberg's photos depict crying children but were intended to reflect her dissatisfaction with Bush-era politics in 2006. The Rapture Index: Jill Greenberg used her daughter, her daughter's friends and some child models in the photos. Speaking to MailOnline, Greenberg said: 'Children at that age cry as a form of communication since they can't use their words, its not evidence of pain.' 'Making children cry for a photographer can be considered mean,' she continued in Slate Magazine. speaking to Jordan G Teicher. 'But I. would say that making children laugh and show off their jeans for an. apparel ad is just as exploitative and less natural. Toddlers' natural. state, like 30 per cent of the time, is crying.' To get the children welling up, Greenberg and the infants' mothers would offer the tots sweets and chocolate or something just as tantalising, such as a mobile phone, then stop short of handing them over, prompting a tantrum. In a statement about the collection on her website, Greenberg says: 'Nothing is more pure than the anguish of a child. Pictures of children crying capture raw emotion: sputtering rage and profound loss. 'In many ways we’ve become desensitized to disturbing image. But the honesty of a child's feelings is undeniable and it draws you in to the photograph. Perhaps because kids experience the kind of powerful emotions that we, as adults, have suppressed in ourselves.' Greenberg said: 'Children at that age cry as a form of communication since they can't use their words, its not evidence of pain' In a statement about the collection, Greenberg said: 'Nothing is more pure than the anguish of a child. Pictures of children crying capture raw emotion: sputtering rage and profound loss' Continuing, she wrote: 'The children I photographed were not harmed in any way. And, as a mother, I am quite aware of how easily toddlers can cry. Storms of grief sweep across their features without warning; a joyful smile can dissolve into a grimace of despair. 'The first little boy I shot, Liam, suddenly became hysterically upset. It reminded me of helplessness and anger I feel about our current political and social situation. 'It made me think of my outrage at our false reasons for going to war in Iraq and the scandalous way in which the conflict was sold to the American people. I thought of George W. Bush, then just sworn into his second term in office, and I decided to call the image \\"Four More Years\\". Shock: 'The first little boy I shot, Liam, suddenly became hysterically upset. It reminded me of helplessness and anger I feel about our current political and social situation' She said: 'As a parent I have to reckon with the knowledge that our children will suffer for the mistakes our government is making. Their pain is a precursor of that is to come' 'As any new parent will tell you, the future suddenly becomes a very serious concern. As ecstatic as I was at the birth of my daughter, I felt selfish bringing her, and later my son into our screwed-up world. I seemed to become a mother at exactly the moment things went awry. 'Of course, human beings have always been greedy, violent and dishonest. But the rise of the Christian right as a political force in this country has made the situation dire. The most dangerous fundamentalists aren’t just waging war in Iraq; they're attacking evolution, blocking medical research and ignoring the environment. 'It's as if they believe the apocalyptic End Time is near, therefore protecting the earth and the future of all our children is futile. As a parent I have to reckon with the knowledge that our children will suffer for the mistakes our government is making. Their pain is a precursor of that is to come.' Trillions: 'As any new parent will tell you, the future suddenly becomes a very serious concern.

'The children I photographed were not harmed in any way. And, as a mother, I am quite aware of how easily toddlers can cry' Jill Greenberg isn't the only parent to have snapped children at their most teary moments. The father behind hit Tumblr photo blog Reasons My Son Is Crying has been exploring the 'universal culture of toddler' using photos of his two sons - and the children of people from around the world - sobbing. Greg Pembroke, from Rochester, New York, began taking mid-tantrum photos. of his infant sons Charlie, 22 months, and William, three-and-a-half,. and captioning the images with the (mostly unreasonable) reasons for the. boys' tears. The. hilarious tags range from 'I broke his cheese in half' and 'I wiped the. dirt off his pear', to 'we asked him to stop hitting his brother with a. plastic wand' and 'his milk was in the wrong cup'. We let him play on the grass - submitted by Trish, Sydney, Australia. I sneezed - submitted by Sofia, Stockholm,. Sweden, left; and he wasn't allowed to scald himself with hot tea -. submitted by Tomoe, Tokyo, Japan, right. Pembroke - who writes commercials for. radio stations and is married to Charity, a physical therapist -. initially began his light-hearted hobby by posting images and captions. on his personal Facebook page. But when friends began telling him they wanted to share his jokes with their own friends, they encouraged him to launch a blog. Within five days his Tumblr page had. gone viral, and was being featured in news outlets, websites and. magazines all over the world. The family were invited to talk on Good. Morning America. We would not let him drive this Porsche - submitted by Chris. We took away his baby powder - submitted by. Jessica T, Texas, USA, left; and her mother didn't pick her up quickly. enough - submitted by Cherry, Shunde, China, right. Speaking to MailOnline, Pembroke. said: 'It's so interesting. I started it for a bit of fun, and it got. big completely by accident. The first photo we did was the cheese one. I. broke it in half after he asked me to, and when he got upset I thought. his reaction was so hilariously unreasonable. It went from there. 'The. best bit is that I've been getting emails from all over the world from. people saying they find it so relatable. It doesn't matter where in the. world you are, the universal culture of toddler is the same.' He continued: 'Some. of the funniest contributions I've had are one from Australia with a. picture. of a little boy crying his face off because his mother unwrapped a. chocolate biscuit. Then there's a little girl in China whose mum didn't. pick her up quickly enouigh, and a girl in South Korea who is literally. crying over. spilled milk.' I broke his cheese in half. I asked him to thank his brother for sharing Buzz Lightyear, left, and I closed the refrigerator door, right. Pembroke is now publishing global. contributions to his site, and has launched a contest to find the. funniest reason for a child crying, with the best one winning a digital. camera, donated to him by Sony. He said: 'I have gotten so many great pictures that I wanted to find a way to recognize some of them.' Greg and his wife will pick the 10 best submissions and put them to a vote on Tumblr. Submissions can be entered until 15 May. We gave him delicious pudding. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

Larger capacitors like electrolytics usually display the actual capacitance together with the unit (for example, 220 μF). Smaller capacitors like ceramics, however, use a shorthand consisting of three numeric digits and a letter, where the digits indicate the capacitance in pF (calculated as XY × 10Z for digits XYZ) and the letter indicates the tolerance (J, K or M for ±5%, ±10% and ±20% respectively). Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): What part of the electrical characteristics of smaller capacitors do the digits of the abbreviated notation represent ?","output":"The digits of the abbreviated notation on smaller capacitors, specifically ceramics, represent the capacitance of the capacitor in picofarads (pF). This abbreviated notation consists of three numeric digits, which are used to calculate the capacitance value. This is done in a particular way for these capacitors. The first two numbers (XY) in the code are taken at face value, and they represent the significant figures of the capacitance. The third number (Z) is a multiplier, and that's used as a power of 10. The resulting value, XY × 10 Z, gives the capacitance in pF.  For example, if the numeric code is 104, it would translate to a capacitance of 10 x 10⁴ pF, or 100,000 pF, which is also equivalent to 0.1 microfarads (μF) since 1μF = 1,000,000 pF.  This shorthand is a method used to convey detailed information in a small amount of space, which is necessary given the small size of these types of capacitors. With just three numbers and a letter, manufacturers are able to specify not only the capacitance but also the tolerance of the unit, with the tolerance signified by a letter code where 'J', 'K' and 'M' represent ±5%, ±10% and ±20% respectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paladins","output":"Title: David's Redemption Genre: Action-Drama / Thriller Plot: In the bustling city of Edenton, a religious extremist group called the Paladins are creating chaos and fear amongst the townspeople. The Paladins believe that a normal mechanic named David (played by Chris Evans), who lives and works in the city, not only holds the secret to an ancient artifact with immense power but that he is also destined to bring about worldwide destruction. Led by the charismatic cult leader Bishop (played by Jared Harris), the Paladins systematically hunt and attempt to capture David, convinced that his death will save the world from the proclaimed prophecy. When the group strikes close to home, taking David's sister Emily (played by Emma Stone) hostage as leverage, David goes on the run. Desperate to save her, he crosses paths with Seth, a former Paladin member (played by Idris Elba), who now seeks redemption for a dark past. Seth informs David of the prophetic artifact, called the Elysium Orb, and how it is linked to a hidden chamber underneath Edenton's oldest church, all while deciphering ancient scrolls. As David and Seth unravel the truth behind the town's history and the origins of the Paladins' religious zeal, they discover that another mysterious and powerful organization, known as The Guardians, created the prophecy to keep the Elysium Orb hidden and out of the hands of the wrong people. Betrayed by his own beliefs, Bishop becomes obsessed with finding the Orb first and using it to assume control over those who created the false prophecy. Despite being pursued by the Paladins, David and Seth devise a plan to infiltrate and topple the power-hungry sect. A string of intricate schemes and intense action sequences take place as the duo attempt to outsmart and outplay their enemies while trying to rescue Emily before any harm comes to her. In a riveting climax, David, Seth, and Emily confront Bishop in the hidden chamber beneath the church as he retrieves the Elysium Orb. David, armed with newfound strength and understanding, battles Bishop and successfully defeats him. The Orb's energy transforms David, revealing him as the rightful protector of the artifact. With Bishop now vanquished, the Paladins dissolve, and peace is restored to the city of Edenton. In the end, the truth of the prophecy, and David's unique destiny, is revealed not as destruction but rather as a protector and guardian of humanity's balance. The Guardians, their mission now complete, fade into the shadows. David, Emily, and Seth embark on a new life together, starting anew while safeguarding the Elysium Orb's power and mystery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  Two groups of adults were a part of a diet experiment. Group Brown ate 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months, while group Yellow, had a normal diet. Group Brown gained a lot of weight.  Which group has a smaller chance of getting more health problems? A:","output":"Group Yellow, the group that maintained a normal diet, has a smaller chance of getting more health problems. According to the information given, the overconsumption of calories leads to an increase in stored body fat, which if persistent can result in obesity. Obesity, defined as having a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 kg/m^2 or greater, is associated with increased risks for a number of health issues, such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Group Brown, which consumed 3500 extra calories per day for three months, would have experienced significant weight gain due to the overconsumption of energy. This would make them more susceptible to obesity and therefore associated health problems. In contrast, Group Yellow maintained a normal diet. If they were consuming a calorie-appropriate diet for their energy needs, then they would be less likely to gain excess weight or become obese. Thus, they are at a lower risk for obesity-associated health concerns compared to Group Brown.  However, it's important to note that a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and an overall healthy lifestyle are key in reducing the risk of health problems, not just maintaining a normal diet. Other factors could come into play such as genetics, age, and underlying health conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

When you do acts of good like help at a shelter or soup kitchen, it's part of being a Christian. Search online for shelters in your area and give them a call during business hours to inquire about opportunities to volunteer. In Proverbs 21:13 it says \\"Whoever shuts their ears to the cry of the poor will also cry out and not be answered.\\" The church that you go to will probably be involved in some programs in your town to help others. Some churches will take missions to go to poorer countries and help the people there and disaster response, while others concentrate on improving the neighborhood. Call your local church and inquire about any volunteer opportunities available.  The Bowery Mission in New York City is one example of a church with volunteer opportunities to help the homeless. Things that they might have you do is feed the poor, clean up a community space, or help fix up or repair things at the church itself. In Galatians 3:28 it says, \\"There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\\" This can be interpreted to mean that regardless of their beliefs or nationalities, you should treat all people with dignity and respect.

You are given a new situation: Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms.  and a hint : Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  Please answer this question : Who will cause less fertilizer to end up in the ponds near their farm? Answer:","output":"Kenny will cause less fertilizer to end up in the ponds near his farm. This is because he is currently growing tomatoes, which are not in season, and therefore his use of fertilizer is low. On the other hand, Bobby has dramatically increased his use of fertilizer due to the large order of potatoes he received, which means more fertilizer could get dissolved and carried away by rain into the pond near his farm.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Understanding How Women Network Whether through online social networking or face-to-face contact, women are meeting, sharing and connecting in ways that men often shy away from. The result is lasting relationships that are the building blocks of future job placements, sales leads and partnerships. We're dissecting the ins and outs of the way women network differently than men--with the experts weighing in on the how, why and a lesson on building connections with the guys. Do women network differently than men? In a word, yes. \\"Men don't actually network the way women define networking,\\" says Gail Blanke, a life coach and author of Throw Out Fifty Things: Clear the Clutter, Find Your Life. They do what she calls \\"a straight shot.\\" The narrative looks like this: A man thinks, \\"Who do I know who has what I need right now?\\"--could be a job, investment tip or tickets to the game--and then he asks for it. Simple. Women are generally more complex. \\"We see things from a lot of different angles, not just one straight-lined route, and so we take a roundabout route,\\" says Blanke. In an effort to personalize professional networking, women normally try to create connections or friendships. \\"Before we think, 'What can this person do for me,' we ask, 'What can I do for her in order to get what I need.'\\" In many cases this give-and-then-take style of networking builds long-lasting relationships. \\"Connecting is what it's all about for women,\\" says Blanke. Think LinkedIn: \\"Even if she can't help me, maybe she knows somebody who can or will think of me at some point in the future when she needs somebody. In other words, the connection is not wasted, even if there's no immediate transaction.\\" What are the benefits of building these relationships? \\"Women are really good listeners, and, even at a networking event, we listen to what the other person needs so that we can help to make that happen,\\" continues Blanke. \\"Out of that comes trust. And out of that--perhaps--comes a new business contact, new boyfriend or play dates for your kids. That works for women.\\" Underscoring the point, Sonya Shelton, a leadership consultant and founder of Being Present to Win, describes women's style of networking as mutually beneficial \\"added value.\\" \\"Women help each other build our businesses and our networks,\\" says Shelton. \\"We can also share what we're learning, reach out to each other as thought-partners and have more access to best practices within our industry.\\" What's the downside to making personal connections when networking for business? \\"I love your handbag,\\" says a woman next to you at an industry event as you're waiting in line for a glass of Chardonnay. By the time you've tipped the bartender, you've discovered she shares your favorite designers and also has two elementary school-age kids. You exchange business cards and part with a new friend. Now that you have a personal connection, you recommend her for a job--or perhaps hire her yourself. Well, it's really uncomfortable if it doesn't work out, right? After all, she's your \\"friend.\\" \\"Sometimes creating these intimate connections in networking can backfire,\\" says Dawn Todd, founder of Wildly Successful Woman Network, a membership-based network of female entrepreneurs. \\"Still, if you've developed a real and honest relationship, you can go to her and say, 'My experience with your service didn't accomplish what I thought it would. And as someone who cares about you, I want to help you.' Now your relationship--both personally and professionally--can move forward.\\" Where's the line between networking and friendship? It's called pragmatism. \\"Many women would benefit from drawing a harder line between networking relationships and personal relationships,\\" says Karen Burns, author of The Amazing Adventures of Working Girl: Real Life Career Advice You Can Actually Use. In networking, your goal is to \\"sell yourself\\" so you appear responsible, reliable and smart. Sharing TMI that makes you look otherwise can backfire. Off the table: sex, politics, drinking escapades and, well, you get the picture. \\"Yes, it's good to be open and real but keep the impression you're making in mind.\\" How do I develop networking skills with men? Men and women have very different brains and they do network differently, says Helen Fisher, Ph.D., biological anthropologist at Rutgers University and author of Why Him, Why Her. \\"The male brain is more compartmentalized; they get straight to the point, they know the goal. They tend to decide right away, with little to no small-talk, whether they will work with you or not.\\" If you know what you want, ask for it. Drop the small talk. And if you are going to make small talk, make boy small talk, not girl talk. And get to the point. Are You Networking Or Self-Promoting? Get Ahead By Reaching Out Enjoy this story? Keep reading at ForbesWoman. Summary:","output":"This news article is about how women network differently than men. When women connect with others, they usually try to make friends and help each other. This can lead to long-lasting relationships that help them find jobs and other opportunities. Men usually just ask for what they need right away. Both ways of networking have their own benefits, but it's important to remember to keep some boundaries when making connections for business."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who played the tambourine? ?  Martin's first recording session with the Beatles took place at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London on 6 June 1962. Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of \\"Love Me Do\\" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You\\".Martin initially selected the Starr version of \\"Love Me Do\\" for the band's first single, though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version, with Starr on tambourine. Released in early October, \\"Love Me Do\\" peaked at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart. Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme People and Places. After Martin suggested rerecording \\"Please Please Me\\" at a faster tempo, a studio session in late November yielded that recording, of which Martin accurately predicted, \\"You've just made your first No.1.\\"In December 1962, the Beatles concluded their fifth and final Hamburg residency. By 1963, they had agreed that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, in an effort to maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing. Lennon recalled him saying, \\"Look, if you really want to get in these bigger places, you're going to have to change – stop eating on stage, stop swearing, stop smoking ...\\" Lennon said: \\"We used to dress how we...

As a result, clients who have booked a grooming session after the current one may have to wait longer than planned for their turn. This can lead to a delay in their grooming services, making them potentially late or causing inconveniences to their schedule. When a grooming session runs longer than anticipated, it might be due to a variety of reasons. These can include an unexpected pet behavior, the need for additional services, grooming complications, or having an inexperienced groomer. A \\"late\\" appointment can affect not only the individuals in the next sessions but also the groomers and the overall efficiency of the grooming salon. It can lead to stress and dissatisfaction for all parties involved - clients might feel rushed or unhappy about the waiting time, and the groomers might have to rush through the following appointments to catch up with their schedule. To prevent these situations, it's essential to be proactive in managing grooming appointments. This can include giving extra buffer time between appointments, ensuring that the groomer is experienced and well-trained, managing the workload efficiently, and communicating any potential delays to the affected clients as early as possible.

A spork I'd seen before, but the addition of a simple serration on the side of the fork end makes this a genuine \\"three-in-one\\" implement for eating one's full three-course takeaway meal on the plane. The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \\"sporf\\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design. The sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork. In strategy formation, we can develop a multitude of potential purposes within one document, killer vision statement or mission. But it's important to recognise that the teams around us will only ever be able to do one thing really well at any one time. This is a lesson oft ignored by schools, in particular, as they attempt to ask educators to create an ever-more creative curriculum without having first tackled attitudes towards summative assessments throughout the year. It is also a challenge in some of the world's most successful, but now stagnating, big businesses: they've spent decades or centuries building a reputation across a large array of devices, technologies, components or clothing, but the real strategy is working out which of the current array needs killed off to enable teams in their quest to develop something totally new, properly innovative.

Mangoes are usually cut into slices from its meaty portion and then carving out the rest of the mango from the inner seed.  B). Mangoes are cut into two halves in the middle horizontally....I think the answer is","output":"B). Let's examine both options to determine which is the more reasonable method for cutting a mango. Option A: Cutting mangoes into slices from its meaty portion and then carving out the rest of the mango from the inner seed. - Step 1: Identify the Mango's cheeks by locating the widest part of the mango, which are the two sides extending from both ends of the flat seed. - Step 2: Slice each cheek off from the mango by cutting about a 1/4-inch away from the center of the mango that contains the seed. - Step 3: Using a spoon or knife, separate the mango fruit from the skin by sliding it under the flesh. - Step 4: Cut the mango flesh into slices or cubes, depending on your preference. - Step 5: Using the same technique, remove the remaining fruit from around the seed on both ends, be cautious of the slippery mango seed. Option B: Cutting mangoes into two halves in the middle horizontally. - Step 1: Place the mango with the stem facing upwards, locate the wider sides of the mango. - Step 2: Cut horizontally through the center of the mango, trying to avoid the flat seed in the middle. Since the seed runs along the center of the fruit, there is a high chance that cutting it horizontally will result in waste. - Step 3: After successfully cutting the mango into two halves, separate the mango flesh from the skin and cut it into the desired pieces. In conclusion, Option A is more reasonable for accomplishing the goal of how to best cut a mango. This method ensures minimal waste and more control while cutting the mango around the seed. It also allows for easier extraction of the mango flesh with the use of a spoon or knife, and provides a better presentation if slicing or creating cubes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The interesting fact about them wast that, while Twin I had a very cold water all year, Twin II lake had very warm waters year round.  But I can use this background: The temperature of a body of water directly affects the amount of dissolved oxygen it can hold. Following Henry's law, as water becomes warmer, oxygen becomes less soluble in it. This property leads to daily anoxic cycles on small geographic scales and seasonal cycles of anoxia on the larger scale. Thus, bodies of water are more vulnerable to anoxic conditions during warmest period of the day and during the summer months. This problem can be further exacerbated in the vicinity of industrial discharge where warm water used to cool machinery is less able to hold oxygen than the basin to which it is released.  What is an answer for this question: Which body of water had fewer problems in the vicinity of industrial discharge ? Answer:","output":"Considering the background provided, it is more probable that Twin I, the lake with cooler water temperatures, would have fewer problems in the vicinity of industrial discharge compared to Twin II, the lake with warmer water. There are a few key reasons behind this conclusion. Henry’s Law states that the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas, and temperature affects this solubility. When the temperature of water increases, dissolved oxygen - a gas - becomes less soluble in it. This means that when warm water is used to cool industrial machinery and then released back into a body of water, it is less able to dissolve and hold oxygen than cooler water.  This is of particular importance because oxygen is crucial for the organisms living in bodies of water. It is used by aquatic life such as fish and plankton to breathe, and they cannot live in water that doesn't have enough oxygen. Dissolved oxygen is also morally crucial for the process of decomposition. Therefore, if industrial discharge were to occur near the two lakes, Twin I, with its consistently cooler water, would be more capable of maintaining greater levels of dissolved oxygen after coming into contact with the discharged warm water used to cool machinery. Cooler water has a greater ability to hold dissolved oxygen, so the impact of the industrial discharge would likely be less severe in Twin I than Twin II. On the other hand, Twin II, being warmer year-round, is already predisposed to holding less dissolved oxygen to begin with, as per Henry's law. If warm water from industrial discharge were to be released into Twin II, the ability of the water to hold oxygen would decline even further. This could potentially lead to the creation of anoxia, or oxygen-depleted conditions, which could harm aquatic life and overall ecosystem health. In addition, anoxia can lead to the growth of certain bacteria that produce toxins harmful not only to aquatic life but also to humans who might come into contact with the water. Thus, Twin II would likely face a more significant impact from industrial discharge due to its year-round warm temperatures. In conclusion, Twin I, the colder of the two Twin lakes, would hypothetically face fewer issues from the release of warm industrial discharge because its cooler water is naturally more capable of maintaining higher levels of dissolved oxygen, thus promoting a more stable and healthy aquatic ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: The Whales of August Movie plot: The Whales of August tells the story of two elderly widowed sisters near the end of their lives, spending a summer in a seaside house in Maine. The surroundings cause them to recall their relationship as young women, and the summers they had enjoyed there in the past. They reflect on the passage of time, and the bitterness, jealousies and misunderstandings that slowly festered over the years and kept them from establishing a true closeness in their relationship. Libby, played by Davis, is the elder and the more infirm of the two sisters, and her nature has become bitter and cold as a result. Sarah, played by Gish, is the younger sister, a softer and more tolerant character, intent on nursing her sister through her discomfort and trying to breach the gulf that has grown between them. The resentment that Libby so clearly displays to her stifles Sarah's every attempt at making a friendly overture towards her, and Sarah cautiously retreats from her. Ironically, Gish was actually 15 years older than Davis. Maranov (Price) is an expatriate from Russia who has recently lost the friend that he has been living with. Tisha (Sothern) is a vivacious lifelong friend who provides common sense, fun and laughter, and is the catalyst for some of the sisters' conversations and revelations. In flashbacks, actresses Margaret Ladd, Mary Steenburgen and Tisha Sterling (Sothern's real-life daughter) play respectively Libby, Sarah, and Tisha as young women.

Q: As U.S. political candidates make their final appeals, voters in 35 states will decide policy issues Tuesday that include legalizing recreational use of marijuana and restricting access to guns and ammunition, voting yes or no on nearly 160 state ballot initiatives. California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have abolished or overturned capital punishment on the grounds that it is unequally applied to minority populations and that innocent people are sometimes convicted.

Cover the pot and cook until the rice is tender. Allow the rice to sit in the pot for several minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork and serve.","output":"Title: The Perfect Way to Cook Rice: A Simple and Foolproof Method Introduction: Rice is a staple food for billions of people around the world. It comes in various types and forms, but one thing that brings them all together is the art of cooking it perfectly. While there are plenty of methods to cook rice, this simple and foolproof method will guarantee perfectly fluffy and tender rice every time. Follow these easy steps to become a master of cooking rice. Step 1: Rinse the Rice Rinsing the rice is an essential first step in preparing it for cooking. This process helps to remove any debris, excess starch, or impurities that may be present. To rinse the rice, place it in a strainer or fine-mesh sieve and run cold water over it, gently agitating it with your hands or a spoon. Continue rinsing until the water runs clear. Rinsing not only cleans the rice, but it also prevents it from sticking together during cooking, ensuring fluffy and separate grains. Step 2: Bring the Water to a Boil Start by measuring the correct amount of water according to the type of rice you're cooking and the desired texture. Different types of rice require different water to rice ratios. For instance, long-grain white rice typically requires a 2:1 ratio (water to rice). Check the rice packaging for specific instructions or consult a trusted recipe. Pour the water into a pot and bring it to a rolling boil over medium to high heat. It's important to wait until the water reaches a full, rolling boil before adding the rice, as this will ensure the rice cooks evenly. Step 3: Add Rice and Salt to the Pot Once the water is boiling, add the rinsed rice and a pinch of salt. The salt helps to enhance the flavor of the rice and can be adjusted according to your personal taste.  Step 4: Cover and Cook After adding the rice and salt, give the mixture a quick stir to ensure that it is evenly distributed in the pot. Then cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and reduce the heat to low. This will help to maintain a gentle simmer, which is ideal for cooking rice.  The cooking time will vary depending on the type of rice being used. For example, white rice typically takes about 18-20 minutes to cook, while brown rice can take 30-40 minutes. Be sure to keep an eye on the time and avoid lifting the lid too often, as this may cause the rice to cook unevenly. Step 5: Allow Rice to Sit and Fluff Once the rice is fully cooked and all of the water has been absorbed, remove the pot from the heat and allow the rice to sit, covered, for an additional 5-10 minutes. This resting period enables the rice to continue cooking gently in its own steam, resulting in perfectly tender and fluffy rice. After the rice has rested, gently fluff it with a fork to separate the grains. Be sure to use a light touch, as vigorous stirring or mashing can result in sticky or clumpy rice. Conclusion: With these easy and foolproof steps, anyone can master the art of cooking perfect rice. Whether it's for a simple side dish or as the base for a more elaborate meal, following this method will guarantee tender, fluffy, and delicious rice every time. So, the next time you cook rice, give this simple yet effective method a try, and enjoy the tasty results!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

From marquee matchups and gritty performances to inspiring displays of team spirit and surprising upsets, Saturday's sports scoreboard was a true testament to the undeniable love for the game. Let's take a closer look at some of the highlights of the day and celebrate the athletes who gave their all in the pursuit of victory. As the clocks struck noon, soccer enthusiasts settled into their stadium seats and home couches to witness an exhilarating showdown between their favorite teams. The New York Titans battled it out against the Los Angeles Warriors, with the Titans emerging victorious in a nail-biting 2-1 finish. Fans will fondly remember the incredible goal scored by Titans' striker Michael Anderson in the 86th minute, sealing their win and sending the home crowd into rapturous applause. Simultaneously, another gripping match dictated Saturday's sports scoreboard, as the Chicago Flames took on the Dallas Comets in a basketball game for the ages. This game was marked by precision, fervor, and extraordinary athleticism, as both teams put their skills to the test in front of a packed arena. Ultimately, it was Chicago's star guard, James Phillips, who led his team to a narrow victory, securing the win in the final seconds with a spectacular three-point shot, bringing the final score to 107-104. As the sun began to lower over stadiums and fields across the nation, an intense rugby clash unfolded between two historic rivals, the Boston Rebels and the San Francisco Raiders. This back-and-forth match showcased the sheer determination and grit of both teams, as they fought tooth and nail for every inch of ground. In the end, it was a timely tackle by Rebels' second-row forward, Daniel Mitchell, and the reliable boot of their fly-half Joseph Evans, which secured a hard-fought victory for Boston at 36-31. Saturday's sports scoreboard also featured an exciting softball tournament held at the Central Park fields. Youth and adult teams alike gathered to participate, creating a vibrant atmosphere filled with laughter, cheers, and the reassuring crack of the bats. Softball lovers from all walks of life enjoyed neck-and-neck championship games and celebrated this beloved American pastime. As the night fell and stadiums began to empty, Saturday's sports scoreboard came to a close, leaving behind countless memorable moments to be treasured by fans and athletes alike.

Yom Kippur, also known as the Day of Atonement, is the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. It is a day of fasting, prayer, and reflection, during which Jews around the world seek forgiveness for their sins and strive to make amends for their wrongdoings. They also take the time to commit themselves to leading better lives in the year ahead.  Given the solemn and introspective nature of the day, it is essential to choose a fitting and respectful greeting when wishing someone well on Yom Kippur. One traditional Yom Kippur greeting is “G’mar Chatimah Tovah,” which translates to \\"May you be sealed in the Book of Life for a good year.\\" In Hebrew, it is written as גמר חתימה טובה. This greeting refers to the belief that on Yom Kippur, God seals the fates of individuals for the coming year in the Book of Life, based on their actions. By wishing someone a good sealing in the Book of Life, you are expressing hope that they will be granted a favorable judgment for the upcoming year. Another common greeting for Yom Kippur is “Tzom Kal,” which means \\"Have an easy or meaningful fast.\\" In Hebrew, it is written as צום קל. This greeting acknowledges the physical challenge and spiritual significance of fasting on this day and conveys the wish for the individual to find meaning in their observance. It is important to note that sending a simple \\"Happy Yom Kippur\\" is not appropriate, as this day is meant for solemn reflection and repentance, rather than celebration.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Playing with toy blocks   may lead to improved language development in young children, a new study reported.      Early childhood is an important period in the development of young minds. The newborn brain grows three times in size between birth and age 2. Scientists have said that certain activities during this important period may promote   healthy development while others may hold it back, and development of memory and language may especially be helped by imaginative play.      After six months, language scores among half of the 175 children aged 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 who were sent plastic blocks were 15 percent higher than a matched group that did not receive the free blocks, according to the study by researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle.     Parents were given ideas about how to help their children play with the blocks, then were told to keep diaries of their children's activities over four days. Finally, all the parents filled out questionnaires that judged their children's vocabulary, grammar, and other language abilities. Study author Dimitri Christakis said unstructured play with blocks motivated children's thinking, memory and physical skills at a time when a child's brain is growing rapidly. \\"They are the foundation of thought and language,\\" he wrote of the skills learned from building blocks. \\"Older children begin to make up stories for these objects .\\" Such play may also take the place of less helpful activities such as watching TV, he said, adding parents ought to have doubts about some toy-makers' words. \\"An increasing number of media-based products are making ungrounded   claims that they can make children smarter, more literate, and more musical,\\" Christakis said.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and 40,000 are diagnosed every year in the UK - 10,000 die of the disease every year. Black men have a greater genetic risk of prostate cancer and are less likely to see their GP about symptoms. Article:","output":"Title: Understanding Prostate Cancer in the UK: The Growing Threat and the Importance of Early Detection Introduction Prostate cancer has become an alarming health crisis for men in the United Kingdom, with 40,000 new diagnoses every year. It is the most common cancer among men, and it claims the lives of approximately 10,000 individuals annually. Of particular concern is the heightened risk faced by black men, who have a greater genetic probability of developing prostate cancer and are less likely to consult their General Practitioner (GP) about symptoms. This article aims to shed light on the prevalence of prostate cancer, its genetic implications, and the crucial need for early detection and intervention. The Growing Prevalence of Prostate Cancer in the UK Cancer is a formidable health challenge on a global scale, and prostate cancer has become the most common form of cancer affecting men. Every year, 40,000 individuals in the UK receive a prostate cancer diagnosis, and the number of men succumbing to the disease is on the rise. It now accounts for 13% of all cancer deaths in the country. This makes it an urgent public health matter that requires increased awareness and understanding of the risk factors, symptoms, and preventive measures necessary to combat the disease effectively. Genetic Risk and Disparities among Black Men There is a growing body of evidence highlighting the role of genetics in the risk of developing prostate cancer. In particular, black men are more likely to be diagnosed, and studies have shown that they have a 50% higher chance of being affected by the disease compared to white men. This disparity can be attributed to both genetic and environmental factors, and it highlights the importance of targeted efforts to raise awareness among high-risk populations such as the black community. Another concerning issue is the reluctance of black men to consult a GP about their symptoms. This may stem from factors such as cultural differences, perceived stigma, or a lack of trust in the healthcare system. Whatever the underlying causes, the fact remains that early detection and treatment can make a significant difference in the prognosis of prostate cancer. As such, it is crucial to work towards overcoming the barriers that prevent black men from seeking the help they need. The Importance of Early Detection Early detection plays a crucial role in significantly improving the survival rate of prostate cancer patients. In many cases, the disease presents itself as asymptomatic in the initial stages, meaning there are no overt signs that signal the presence of cancer. This makes screening and regular check-ups all the more essential, particularly among high-risk populations. By diagnosing and treating prostate cancer in the early stages, there is a higher likelihood of successful treatment, reduced complications, and better quality of life for the patients. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing is a valuable diagnostic tool to aid early detection, and men should discuss the benefits of this test with their GP, especially those with known risk factors or a family history. Conclusion Prostate cancer is a pervasive public health issue that affects a growing population of men in the UK each year. With a heightened genetic risk among black men and the concerning tendency for this group to under-utilize healthcare services, it has become increasingly urgent to prioritize education, awareness campaigns, and improved access to early detection services. By focusing our efforts on these preventive measures, we can help reduce the devastating impact of prostate cancer and safeguard the lives of countless men across the UK."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you need to answer 'Yes' if the given word is the longest word (in terms of number of letters) in the given sentence, else answer 'No'.

Title: Too much talk, not enough \\"how to\\" Review: I felt that this book spent too much time talking about \\"why\\" someone is a Messie. If you're looking for in-depth analysis of why you might have issues with housework, this is the book for you. If you're looking for some fast ideas on how to keep the house tidy, there's better books out there (such as \\"Sink Reflections\\" or \\"Confessions of an Organized Homemaker\\"). Some of the ideas in this book sound great, but honestly - if a person is finding it hard to tackle the housework, are they going to tackle making a complicated file system for reminding them to do the housework? Probably not. This book could be an addition to housekeeping books but I wouldn't recommend it as the main one. Is this product review negative? pick from the following.  a). Yes.  b).

For example, why do some people paint the walls of their rooms yellow and others pink? The same is true in stores. They want us to feel something when we look at their products. Green, for example, tries to show the quality of a product: how good it is for us or for our environment. It also suggests that the product is healthier, has less fat and maybe fewer calories. Red, on the other hand is an aggressive color that is often used for packaging food. Red wants us to become hungry or thirsty. Purple is a kind of color that is often seen as royal. It indicates that it is something special. Producers use purple to show that something is of good quality. Blue is not very often found in food packaging because there are not very many foods that have a blue color. Colors can also have different meaning in different cultures and countries. For example, while the color white is used in many Western countries to represent purity and innocence, it is seen as a symbol of mourning in many Eastern countries. The Egyptian pharaohs  wore white crowns. A white sale is a sale of sheets, towels, and other bed and bath items. A white flag is the universal symbol for truce . A white elephant is a rare, pale elephant sacred  to the people of India, Thailand, Burma, and Sri Lanka. In these countries, something that is a white elephant is either a possession that costs more than it is worth to keep or an item that the owner doesn't want but can't get rid of. Consumers are aware that certain foods must have certain colors. When Pepsi brought out a crystal clear cola in 1992, it thought that consumers would buy it because clear meant pure and healthy. After a few months Pepsi found out that a cola had to be dark-colored. Crystal Pepsi failed and the company pulled it off the market.

I had the pleasure of dining at The Wholesome Plate last night, and I must say, it was an experience worth raving about! As a (sometimes) food connoisseur who enjoys trying out new establishments, I'm always on the lookout for hidden gems, and The Wholesome Plate is definitely one of those. Upon entering the restaurant, my family and I were immediately greeted by its cozy and stylish ambiance. The dim lighting and contemporary decor struck the perfect balance between chic and casual, making it a great spot for both special occasions and laid-back dinners. We had made reservations in advance and were promptly seated in a cozy yet spacious booth that was just perfect for our party of four. Now, let's talk about the star of the show - the food! The menu was quite extensive, offering a wide variety of options to suit all preferences and dietary needs. The Wholesome Plate is known for its farm-to-table concept, and the use of locally sourced, fresh ingredients was evident in each delectable dish we ordered. We decided to start our dining experience with a few appetizers - the Ahi Tuna Poke Nachos and the Butternut Squash Crostini. The former was a beautiful fusion of flavors and textures, with the crispiness of the wonton chips perfectly complementing the tender, melt-in-your-mouth Ahi tuna. The latter boasted a delicious mix of caramelized butternut squash, creamy goat cheese, toasted pine nuts, and just the right touch of balsamic drizzle atop crunchy crostini. Both appetizers left us eager to try our main courses. For our entrees, I opted for the Seared Scallops with Mushroom Risotto, while my family members chose the Herb-Roasted Chicken, Grilled Ribeye Steak, and Vegetable Stir-Fry. The seared scallops were cooked to perfection, with a light sear on the outside and a divine buttery texture on the inside. Coupled with the rich, creamy mushroom risotto, it was a match made in heaven.  The Herb-Roasted Chicken was succulent and moist, infused with just the right amount of herbs and spices. The Grilled Ribeye Steak, cooked medium-rare, was juicy, tender, and full of flavor. As for the Vegetable Stir-Fry, it was hearty and colorful, with an assortment of crunchy veggies and a delightful, tangy sauce that served as the perfect accompaniment. Dessert was the ideal finale to our amazing dining experience. We indulged in the warm Chocolate Lava Cake with a gooey, molten center, and the tangy yet sweet Lemon Tart, both of which were the epitome of decadence. Of course, I cannot wrap up this review without mentioning the exceptional service we received at The Wholesome Plate. From the warm welcome as we entered to the attentive waitstaff that ensured our dining experience was nothing short of perfect, every aspect of the service was commend-worthy. In conclusion, The Wholesome Plate left a lasting impression on us with its mouthwatering culinary delights, inviting ambiance, and impeccable service. I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough, and I am already looking forward to our next visit!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

News article: Boy Meets World: Baby Cambridge Emerges From Hospital Still Nameless The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with their new baby boy outside the Lindo Wing of St. Mary’s Hospital in London on July 23, 2013 The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge emerged on the steps of the Lindo Wing of St. Mary’s hospital in London today, giving the world its first glimpse of the couple’s 1-day-old firstborn son, who is third in line to the British throne. The happy parents stood before a crowd of photographers and reporters, many of whom had booked their place in the pen weeks before. “He’s got a good pair of lungs on him, that’s for sure,” said a thrilled-looking Prince William as a healthy-looking and smiling Kate stood by his side. Kate had emerged holding the baby but passed the boy to his father before the young family approached the journalists waiting across the road from the hospital entrance. “We’re still working on a name,” William said. He also commented on the baby’s hair: “He’s got way more than me, thank God.” (PHOTOS: Britain’s New Prince: World Watches Royal Baby’s Birth) Members of the public had joined the journalists at the hospital since the early hours of Monday morning, when royal officials confirmed that the Duchess of Cambridge, formerly Kate Middleton, had gone into labor. After over a 14-hour wait on the hottest day in Britain this year, the news broke that the Duchess was delivered of a son, weighing in at a healthy 8 lb. 6 oz. (3.8 kg), at 4:24 p.m. A cheer broke out from the crowd as the couple emerged. Ashley Miller, a homemaker from Virginia on vacation in London with her husband, was at the hospital to see the royal couple and their baby. “It was just amazing,” Miller said. “Kate’s a world icon. She’s an inspiration to all women. It was my dream to see Kate when we came here. It’s like a fairy tale that’s come true for Kate. We saw them in the car. They were both smiling, the baby was in the backseat. William was beaming ear to ear. To think their little boy will be the King of England one day.” “I thought I’d be happy, but I got the shakes and got all emotional,” said Carlene Mareno, 30, an administrator from London. Mareno said she finds William and Kate hugely likeable. “They’re so normal, aren’t they? You can relate to them. It’s a new generation of royals.” Annabel Cornfoot, a 37-year-old baby-record-book publisher living in London, had come to the hospital with her two young daughters to catch the first glimpse of the new family. “I think they will be good parents,” said Cornfoot, shortly before Kate, William and their baby appeared, but added that she felt bad for Kate. “I know from experience that sometimes the day after labor you can’t walk properly — it must be nerve-racking.” After their appearance, Kate, William and the baby went back into the hospital. Soon after they emerged with the baby in a car seat. Kate got into the backseat while William opened the other door and put the car seat in place. Kate immediately leaned over to touch her son. They then drove off in a black Range Rover to their home in Kensington Palace in central London. (PHOTOS: Oh Baby: 119 Years of Infant Royals on Camera) Earlier in the day the first visitors to the hospital were Kate’s parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, who arrived in a black London taxi and entered the hospital in the early afternoon smiling broadly but saying nothing to the waiting press. When they left Carole Middleton described the baby as “absolutely beautiful.” William’s father Prince Charles arrived later with his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. After visiting his son and grandson — the first gathering of the three royal males who may all one day be King — Charles said the boy was “marvelous.” Earlier, on a visit to Yorkshire, Charles was greeted by well-wishers with the words: ’Morning, granddad. The Prince did not give any indication of what his grandson might be called, but said he was “thrilled and very excited” and conceded that he had enjoyed “a little bit” of Champagne to mark the occasion. The Duchess of Cornwall added that she thought Charles would make a “brilliant” grandfather because “he’s brilliant with children.” (PHOTOS: Great Expectations: Kate Middleton’s Maternity Style) Messages of congratulations have been steadily pouring in from around the world — Prince Charles’ office has even set up a congratulatory e-card on Google+ that anyone can sign for the new royal parents. The couple is believed to have drawn up a short list of possible names. According to British bookmakers, James has emerged as a clear favorite, followed by George and Henry. Some Twitter users joked in the morning that the child should be called Thor, because of the thunderstorms and lightning that swept across the evening before Kate went into labor. It could be quite some time before the name is known to the public; it took a week after his birth for the royal family to announce Prince William’s name, and a month for Prince Charles’ name to be made public. — With reporting by Megan Gibson and Katie Harris MORE: Why the Royal Baby Will Be Such a Figure of Global Influence MORE: TIME’s 1982 Story About the Birth of Prince William What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1.

Tchaikovsky was born in 1840 in Votkinsk, a small town in present-day Udmurtia, formerly the Imperial Russian province of Vyatka. A precocious pupil, he began piano lessons at the age of five, and could read music as adeptly as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky was sent by his family to board at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school in Saint Petersburg, 800 miles (1,300 km) from his family home in Alapayevsk. Once Tchaikovsky came of age for acceptance, he was transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.Music was not a priority at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant. Tchaikovsky remained there for the rest of his three-year civil service career.In 1861, Tchaikovsky... The answer is:","output":"Ilya"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mr Cameron said it had been a \\"tough few years\\" but added that the country was \\"coming out the other side\\". Labour said the Conservatives' promises would sound like \\"empty words\\" to the unemployed or those on low pay. Mr Cameron's goal of \\"full employment\\" would involve the UK, currently 72%, overtaking Germany's 74% in terms of the percentage of people in work, said BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith. There is no timescale, but it is an \\"aspiration which he wants to achieve\\", he added. In a speech in Ipswich, the prime minister said full employment would mean that \\"anyone who wants a job is able to get a job in our country\\". He outlined Conservative manifesto pledges on employment and enterprise, including an increase to 75,000 in the number of start-up loans provided by the government in the next parliament. The loans provide about Â£5,000 to young entrepreneurs founding a business. He also pledged investment in infrastructure to attract businesses and creating three million new apprenticeships.

Paragraph: The Washington Supreme Court is asking the Legislature to approve a 90 surcharge on a court filing fee to help provide legal help for the poor in civil cases, Chief Justice Gerry Alexander said Wednesday. \\"Some might say, why should we support this when we face tough financial times?\\" Alexander asked in his State of the Judiciary address to a joint session of the Legislature. \\"It seems to me in America, where we rejoice in the fact that we are a nation devoted to the rule of law, we should not ration access to justice.\\" The recommendation comes from the court's Task Force on Civil Equal Justice Funding, created in 2001 to look for ways to cope with the sparse amount of money available for such cases. As the task force was studying the issue, 900,000 was cut from state support for civil equal justice services. That prompted the state's two main legal services providers - Columbia Legal Services and Northwest Justice Project - to cut their staffs, Alexander said. The change would increase the cost of filing a lawsuit in Superior Court to 200. The total fee would be split, with 54 percent going to counties and 46 percent going to the state for a newly created equal justice account. Alexander also requested money for five additional Superior Court judgeships and one additional District Court judgeships, arguing that increased caseloads require more judges. Two of the Superior Court judges and the District Court judge would be in Clark County, with one Superior Court judge added in the joint district that serves Benton and Franklin counties and one each in Kittitas and Kitsap counties.

Zhou Jianliang, chief engineer with the BACC, explained: \\" During the lunar night, the lander and the rover were in a power-off condition and the communication with Earth was cut off. \\" When the night ends, they will be started up with the power provided by sunlight and resume operation and communication according to preset programmes. He added that the Jade Rabbit surviving the lunar night showed Chinese technology had proved successful. The Jade Rabbit and the lander compose Chang'e-3 landed on the moon on 14 December. With the landing, China became one of only three nations to soft-land on the moon, and the first to do so in more than three decades. Scientists said the mission was designed to test new technologies and build the country's expertise of space exploration. The Jade Rabbit will gather scientific data and capture images from the Moon. China was planning further missions planned to collect lunar soil samples and it is thought officials are looking to conduct manned lunar landings if they prove successful.

Context: Official figures (as of July 21, 2008 12:00 CST) stated that 69,197 were confirmed dead, including 68,636 in Sichuan province, and 374,176 injured, with 18,222 listed as missing. The earthquake left about 4.8 million people homeless, though the number could be as high as 11 million. Approximately 15 million people lived in the affected area. It was the deadliest earthquake to hit China since the 1976 Tangshan earthquake, which killed at least 240,000 people, and the strongest in the country since the 1950 Chayu earthquake, which registered at 8.5 on the Richter magnitude scale. It is the 21st deadliest earthquake of all time.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"Based on the information provided, we cannot conclusively determine whether the second sentence is true or false in relation to the first sentence. These two sentences, while sequential, do not necessarily present a logical contradiction or a directly related condition. Let's examine the information further. Sentence 1: \\"Finally, he said, 'Acrobats?'\\" This sentence tells us that an individual (presumably male) eventually spoke and mentioned \\"acrobats,\\" perhaps asking a question, making a statement, or offering a suggestion. We do not have enough contextual information to deduce the intention behind this sentence, but we are certain that the individual has spoken. Sentence 2: \\"He remained silent.\\" This sentence suggests that the same individual stays silent after speaking in the first sentence. However, we do not know if this silence is immediate, a pause for a few moments, or extended across a longer period. It is possible that the individual is silent before speaking the first sentence, momentarily silent after the first sentence, or eventually silent following additional discussion. Because these two sentences do not present cause-and-effect or contradictory statements, we are unable to determine if the second sentence is true or false based on the truth of the first sentence. It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the individual spoke the first sentence and then remained silent for some time, or that the silence is unrelated or only temporary. The relationship between the two sentences would be clearer if they were connected by additional context or a timeline that specifies when or why the silence occurred."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Homer ( , \\"Hómēros\\") is the name ascribed by the ancient Greeks to the legendary author of the \\"Iliad\\" and the \\"Odyssey\\", two epic poems which are the central works of ancient Greek literature. The \\"Iliad\\" is set during the Trojan War, the ten-year siege of the city of Troy by a coalition of Greek states. It focuses on a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles lasting a few weeks during the last year of the war. The \\"Odyssey\\" focuses on the journey home of Odysseus, king of Ithaca, after the fall of Troy.  Many accounts of Homer's life circulated in classical antiquity, the most widespread being that he was a blind bard from Ionia, a region of central coastal Anatolia in present-day Turkey. Modern scholars consider them legends.  The Homeric Question—by whom, when, where and under what circumstances were the \\"Iliad\\" and \\"Odyssey\\" composed—continues to be debated. Broadly speaking, modern scholarly opinion falls into two groups. One holds that most of the \\"Iliad\\" and (according to some) the \\"Odyssey\\" are the works of a single poet of genius. The other considers the Homeric poems to be the result of a process of working and re-working by many contributors, and that \\"Homer\\" is best seen as a label for an entire tradition. It is generally accepted that the poems were composed at some point around the late 8th or early 7th century BC. The poems are in Homeric Greek, also known as Epic Greek, a literary language which shows a mixture of features of the Ionic and Aeolic dialects from different centuries; the predominant influence is Eastern Ionic. Most researchers believe that the poems were originally transmitted orally. 1. Can you name one of Homer's poems? 2. Can you name another? 3. Who is the main character in the Odyssey? 4.

The scientific method is a method of research with defined steps that include experiments and careful observation. The steps of the scientific method will be examined in detail later, but one of the most important aspects of this method is the testing of hypotheses. A hypothesis is a suggested explanation for an event, which can be tested. Hypotheses, or tentative explanations, are generally produced within the context of a scientific theory. A scientific theory is a generally accepted, thoroughly tested and confirmed explanation for a set of observations or phenomena. Scientific theory is the foundation of scientific knowledge. In addition, in many scientific disciplines (less so in biology) there are scientific laws, often expressed in mathematical formulas, which describe how elements of nature will behave under certain specific conditions. There is not an evolution of hypotheses through theories to laws as if they represented some increase in certainty about the world.

If I tell you that Wind affects farm viability, and ask you the question \\"what affects farm viaility?\\", is the correct answer \\"mines\\"? Pick your answer from:  (1). Yes.  (2). No.","output":"(2). No. The correct answer is not \\"mines.\\" If you mentioned that wind affects farm viability and asked the question \\"what affects farm viability?\\", it would be illogical to answer with \\"mines\\" since it does not directly correlate with the given information. Numerous factors impact farm viability, and I will present you with a detailed explanation of some of these factors. 1. Climate: The climate, including temperature, precipitation levels, and the frequency of extreme weather events, significantly affect farm viability. Climate determines which crops and livestock can thrive in a particular region, as different plants and animals have specific requirements needed for growth, reproduction, and survivability. 2. Soil quality: Proper soil composition, nutrient content, and fertility are essential for farm viability. Different crops have specific soil requirements, and a farmer must ensure that their land has suitable soil for growing their intended crops. Soil management practices, such as crop rotation and adding organic matter, are essential to maintaining soil fertility over time. 3. Pest and disease control: Pests and diseases can significantly reduce crop yields and cause devastating losses for farmers. Effective pest and disease control methods, including proper crop rotation, chemical control, and integrated pest management, are crucial to ensuring farm viability. 4. Access to resources: Availability of water, labor, and finances impact farm viability. Sufficient water supply, either through rainfall or irrigation, is essential for crop growth. Additionally, farm viability depends on access to a skilled workforce and financial resources to cover operating costs, machinery, and land acquisitions. 5. Market conditions: Successful farms depend on strong local, regional, and international markets. Market conditions, including demand for specific products, price fluctuations, and competition, directly influence farm viability. 6. Technological advancements: Technological advancements in agriculture, such as precision farming, genetically engineered seeds, and improved machinery, can significantly increase farm productivity, leading to higher farm viability. Integrating new technologies into a farm can lead to increased yields, cost savings, and more sustainable farming practices. 7. Government policies and regulations: Farm viability can also be affected by government policies and regulations. Subsidies, trade agreements, and environmental regulations can either support or hinder the viability of a farm, depending on the specific policies in place. 8. Management practices: Effective farm management practices, such as proper planning, risk management, and decision-making, are crucial to positive outcomes in agricultural production. Good management can help ensure that farms remain viable despite various challenges, such as climate change, pests, and market conditions. In conclusion, farm viability is affected by numerous factors, including climate, soil quality, pest and disease control, access to resources, market conditions, technological advancements, government policies and regulations, and management practices. To maintain farm viability, it is essential for farmers to consider and adapt to these various factors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: -  A red giant burns mass - This mass creates high core temperatures - The mass decreases - The red giant can no longer fuse the carbon and oxygen in its center - The gravity of the star can no longer hold the outside layers - The layers break away - Only the inner core remains  What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step of the process for a red giant star, after the outer layers have been shed and only the inner core remains, depends on the mass of the star. The evolution of the red giant can lead to one of two possible outcomes – forming a white dwarf or undergoing a core-collapse supernova, leading to the creation of a neutron star or a black hole. 1. Formation of a White Dwarf: For red giants with a mass between approximately 0.5 and 8 solar masses, their cores will not attain sufficient temperature or pressure for further fusion of the carbon and oxygen present in the core. As a result, they become degenerate, meaning that their particles are so tightly packed that they only maintain structure through electron degeneracy pressure. Consequently, the remaining core of the star, known as a white dwarf, is an incredibly dense and hot object composed primarily of carbon and oxygen.  White dwarfs, due to their high density and compact size, emit a large amount of energy as visible, ultraviolet, or even X-ray radiation. Eventually, as they continue to radiate energy, white dwarfs will cool down and become progressively fainter, transitioning to a black dwarf. However, the universe is not yet old enough for any white dwarfs to have cooled enough to form black dwarfs, and thus, black dwarfs remain a purely theoretical concept for now. 2. Core-Collapse Supernova: For more massive red giants, typically with a mass greater than 8 solar masses, their cores will attain sufficiently high temperatures and pressures to ignite the fusion of heavier elements such as carbon, oxygen, and eventually even iron. However, iron is the final element that can release energy during nuclear fusion. Once iron accumulates in the core, the star can no longer generate sufficient energy to counteract the force of gravity, causing the core to collapse rapidly under its own gravitational pull. This rapid core-collapse leads to a violent explosion known as a core-collapse supernova that can outshine entire galaxies for a brief period. During the supernova explosion, the outer layers of the star are violently ejected into space, contributing to the creation of new elements and the distribution of these elements across the galaxy. Depending on the mass of the progenitor star's core, the remnant of the core-collapse supernova may form either a neutron star or a black hole. Neutron stars are formed when the mass of the core is between approximately 1.4 and 3 solar masses. These remnants are held up by neutron degeneracy pressure, making them extremely compact and dense objects. If the core's mass is above approximately 3 solar masses, the gravitational pull becomes so strong that even neutron degeneracy pressure cannot counteract it, causing the core to collapse into a black hole, a region of spacetime where gravity is so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape its grasp."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He contemplated a story, an outline he had laboriously constructed some time ago. He had filled his pen and raised it, the nib descending towards the paper, before the sound came: the gentle, persistent tapping of the gnarled, primeval willow touching the window with long, insistent fingers. His eyes awoke with a passionate, determined flame, though the only light came from the glutted moon. Allan filled page after page, the words escaping from his mind onto the paper. Where before they had marched in regiments, practiced in ranks and followed their leaders' commands, the words now escaped in their true forms, unhindered by any stricture.

Here is a news article: A Saudi Arabian scholar has issued a fatwa against using another person’s WiFi without permission, in line with the Islamic ruling that theft is forbidden.      The fatwa was made by Ali Al Hakami, a member of the Council of Senior Scholars which advises the Saudi King on religious matters.      “Taking advantage of the Wi-Fi service illegally or without the knowledge of other beneficiaries or providers is not allowed,” said Ali Al Hakami, a member of the high scholars’ commission, Gulf News reports.      Read more      “The clear permission of the beneficiary or the provider is a must. Any provider or user who pays money for the Wi-Fi service should be consulted before using it,” he added.      “When the Wi-Fi service is open such as in parks, malls, cafeterias, hotels and government departments, then there is no problem since it is meant to be used by the people or clients.”      A fatwa is a legal pronouncement issued by Islamic religious figures. In 2010, Saudi Arabia’s late King Abdullah decreed that only members of the Council and a few other clerics could issue a fatwa.      The WiFi fatwa follows a similar one issued last April by the Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department (IACAD) of Dubai in the UAE.      “It is not allowed for people to use what belongs to others without payment or without their permission. Therefore, the internet should be used only after subscribing for the service,” the government department wrote on its website.      Some Saudis reacted online to the WiFi fatwa by suggesting that it would be more appropriate for people to ensure their WiFi is secure by using a password. Others said people shouldn’t need a fatwa to respect private property.      Read more      “We do not need a religious edict to pinpoint such basic things,” one user commented, according to Gulf News. “Private property should remain private, especially [since] the owner paid money for the services. Nobody should just take advantage.”      The WiFi fatwa joins the ranks of some unexpected edicts issued in recent years, including against traveling to Mars, against women eating phallic shaped fruits, women watching football, women sitting on chairs, and emoticons.      Perhaps the most famous fatwa issued was against controversial award-winning British Indian writer Salman Rushdie.      In 1989, the first Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, called for the author’s assassination, accusing his novel, The Satanic Verses, of being blasphemous.The fatwa was renewed earlier this year by Iranian state media. ||||| A Saudi scholar issued a fatwa against using another person's WiFi without permission, since theft cannot be tolerated in Islam.      \\"Taking advantage of the WiFi service illegally or without the knowledge of other beneficiaries or providers is not allowed,\\" said Ali Al Hakami, a member of the high scholars' commission, a senior religious body which advises the Saudi king.      \\"Any provider or user who pays money for the WiFi service should be consulted before using it.

In other instances, they reflect patriarchal, conservative norms or even outright misogyny: In Indonesia, clerics issued a fatwa against certain emoticons that could be seen as LGBT-friendly; the Islamic State, during the early stages of its insurgency in Syria, declared that women should not be allowed to sit in chairs.

The total is down 22% on the previous quarter, but that's largely because consumers know Apple is about to release a new model - probably in the autumn - so many will wait until then. Continued decline, attributed to bigger iPhones being available. A sixth consecutive quarter of falls - but iPad still dominates the high-end tablet market (that's anything about 200). Apple shifted just shy of 11m units in the last quarter. That said, chief executive Tim Cook said: \\"I am still bullish on iPad.\\" Now that's a lot trickier. \\"We made a decision back to September not to disclose the shipments of the watch,\\" Mr Cook told investors on Tuesday. \\"That was not a matter of not being transparent. It was a matter of not giving our competition insight on a product we've worked hard on.\\" Many aren't buying that explanation. But let's look at what Apple did tell us. Apple has lumped the watch in its \\"other\\" category that includes the iPod, Beats accessories, Apple TV and so on. Compared to the previous quarter - before the gadget went on sale - the \\"other\\" category is up 56%, with quarterly revenue of 2.6bn. But Mr Cook urged against back-of-a-cigarette-packet maths to determine watch sales. \\"It would not be be an accurate thing to look at the sequential change and assume that was the watch revenue,\\" he said. Parts of the category, such as the iPod, are in decline, making a precise number hard to isolate until Apple feels compelled to tell us. Having canvassed several analysts, the general wisdom is that Apple has sold between 2.5 million and 3 million watches. Sensing the assumption that journalists and investors might suggest the watch hasn't been a hit thus far, Mr Cook kept things positive. \\"Sales of the watch did exceed our expectations and they did so despite supply trailing demand at the end of the quarter,\\" he said. To back this up, Mr Cook said sales in June were higher than in April or May, seemingly putting to bed some reports that sales had fallen off a cliff. Analysts agreed that was a good sign for future sales. Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst for IDC, put the performance into context, tweeting: \\"Whatever estimates you have for the Apple Watch, one thing is for sure: Apple sold more watches in 2Q15 than all other smartwatch vendors combined.\\" Carolina Milanesi, from Kantar WorldPanel, said sales were not key at the moment: \\"Opportunity, in my view, is more important at this point than early sales - as for every product to be honest. \\"We surveyed consumers in Britain in April - soon after the Apple Watch became available - and asked their brand preference if they intended to buy a wearable device in the next year - 69% said Apple.\\" Following the results, Apple shares fell by almost 7%, partly due to a lower-than-expected forecast for the next quarter. So, for the time being, the debate over whether the Apple Watch is the firm's next big hit or an embarrassing flop continues. Mr Cook's quoting of surveys claiming very high satisfaction rates doesn't match up entirely with anecdotal evidence of some early adopters, but that's a conclusion as unscientific as it sounds. We just have to wait and see. And here's another nugget to ponder: sales of the iPhone in South Korea specifically were up 200% - which means, Mr Jeronimo estimates, it could be outselling Samsung in its home country.

Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease.  Rob is testing the properties of gas. To that end, he experimented with a cylinder of gas in three stages, stage A, stage B, and stage C. In stage A he kept the gas in room temperature. In stage B he heated the gas up. And in stage C he cooled the gas down.  In which stage the kinetic energy of the gas molecules would not increase, stage A or stage B? A:","output":"In stage A, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules would not increase. This is because, during stage A, Rob kept the gas at room temperature (300 K), which means there would be no change in the temperature or thermal energy of the gas. As a result, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules would remain unchanged in stage A. In contrast, during stage B, Rob heated the gas, which led to a doubling of the Kelvin temperature (from 300 K to 600 K). This increase in temperature causes the kinetic energy of the gas molecules to increase, resulting in more forceful collisions with the walls of the container and a subsequent increase in pressure. Therefore, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules would increase in stage B. It is important to note that in stage C, when Rob cooled the gas down, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules would decrease due to the decrease in temperature, leading to a reduction in pressure. However, this stage was not asked about in the query."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was offered to the city of Reykjavík as a gift?  The museum's founder Sigurður Hjartarson worked as a teacher and principal for 37 years, teaching history and Spanish at Reykjavík's Hamrahlid College for the last 26 years before his retirement. As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.Sigurður was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment. His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: \\"Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'\\" According to Sigurður, \\"Collecting penises is like collecting anything. You can never stop, you can never catch up, you can always get a new one, a better one.\\" The collection was at first housed in Sigurður's office at the college until he retired from his teaching job. He decided, more as a hobby than a job, to put it on public display in Reykjavík and was awarded a grant from the city council of ISK 200,000 to... A:","output":"The article discusses the journey and passion of Sigurður Hjartarson, the founder of the Icelandic Phallological Museum, in collecting penises from various animal species. Although the article does not explicitly mention a gift being offered to the city of Reykjavík, it does mention that Sigurður was awarded a grant of ISK 200,000 from the city council to put his unique collection on public display. The collection, which started with a bull's penis that Sigurður owned as a child and used as a cattle whip, grew over the years as he received more specimens from friends and acquaintances, as well as from various sources around Iceland such as slaughterhouses and fishermen. His impressive assortment of penises from different animals, particularly whales, came to be showcased in the Icelandic Phallological Museum, which is located in Reykjavík. In essence, while the city of Reykjavík did not receive a gift, the residents and visitors were given the opportunity to visit and enjoy the unique and intriguing Icelandic Phallological Museum, which houses Sigurður Hjartarson's extensive collection of animal penises, thanks to the grant provided by the city council."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The relationship to the future is the state of anticipating a potential possibility, task, or engagement. It is related to the human propensity for caring and being concerned, which causes \\"being ahead of oneself\\" when thinking of a pending occurrence. Therefore, this concern for a potential occurrence also allows the future to exist in the present. The present becomes an experience, which is qualitative instead of quantitative. Heidegger seems to think this is the way that a linear relationship with time, or temporal existence, is broken or transcended. We are not stuck in sequential time.

Alec Baldwin apologizes for ‘toxic little queen’ comment (Photo by Ray Tamarra/Getty Images) Actor Alec Baldwin has issued a public apology for using gay slurs in an online rant aimed at a reporter. The star posted a foul-mouthed tirade on his Twitter.com page on Thursday over a report published by the Daily Mail that suggested his wife, Hilaria, was tweeting during James Gandolfini’s funeral. Baldwin denied his partner had been tweeting from the church, and took to Twitter to blast the author of the article, George Stark, as a “toxic little queen” and a “lying little b—”, adding, “I am gonna f— you up… I want all of my followers and beyond to straighten out this f— little b—.” The star has now issued an apology for any offence his language might have caused, releasing a letter to gay rights group GLAAD. The message reads, “My ill-advised attack on George Stark of the Daily Mail had absolutely nothing to do with issues of anyone’s sexual orientation… As someone who fights against homophobia, I apologize… I would not advocate violence against someone for being gay and I hope that my friends at GLAAD and the gay community understand that my attack on Mr. Stark in no way was the result of homophobia.” In an interview with Gothamist.com, he adds, “The idea of me calling this guy a ‘queen’ and that being something that people thought is homophobic…a queen to me has a different meaning. It’s somebody who’s just above. It doesn’t have any necessarily sexual connotations. To me a queen… I know women that act queeny, I know men that are straight that act queeny, and I know gay men that act queeny.

Caroline quickly defeated Sue because she regained her confidence.","output":"In the sentence \\"Caroline quickly defeated Sue because she regained her confidence,\\" the pronoun 'she' refers to the entity Caroline. To dissect this sentence further, we can start by breaking down its structure. We can see that there are two main subjects involved: Caroline and Sue. The sentence describes an action, defeating, which was performed by Caroline against Sue. It also provides a reason, or an explanation, for why this action took place. This reason or explanation is centered around the pronoun 'she,' which subsequently points to the entity that regained her confidence. Now, we need to ascertain which of the two main subjects - Caroline or Sue - is the likely referent of 'she.' When we consider the sentence as a whole and the context it provides, it becomes clear that Caroline is the one who regained her confidence. This is primarily because, based on the information given, Caroline is the one who experienced a change that affected the outcome of the situation. This change was regaining her confidence, which led to her defeating Sue. If it were Sue who regained confidence, it would not make sense for Caroline to defeat her as a result, since the sentence indicates a positive change in 'she' that contributed to the victory. In conclusion, the entity 'she' in the sentence refers to Caroline, as it is aligned with the context of the sentence in which Caroline experienced a shift in confidence that led to her defeating Sue."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"Couple jailed for abusing little girl\\" Article:","output":"Title: Couple Jailed for Abusing Little Girl In a deeply disturbing case that has sent shockwaves throughout the community, a couple has been handed significant jail sentences after being found guilty of the horrifying abuse of a young girl. The harrowing case has led to an outpouring of anger, sympathy, and calls for stronger measures to protect vulnerable children in our society. Prosecutors presented a chilling account of the abuse, which took place over several years, involving both physical and emotional maltreatment. The young girl, whose identity remains protected under a court order, suffered unimaginable pain and trauma at the hands of the couple, who, in a twisted irony, were supposed to be her caretakers. The case first came to light when teachers at the girl's school noticed severe bruising and other physical injuries, raising the alarm and prompting authorities to investigate further. Despite the young girl's initial reluctance to reveal the truth, fearing retaliation from her abusers, she eventually disclosed the horrifying details of her suffering, leading to a thorough and distressing investigation. During the trial, graphic evidence of the abuse was presented to the court, exposing the unimaginable cruelty the girl was subjected to. This included instances of being locked in a small, dark room for extended periods without food or water, as well as physical violence of the worst kind. The judge, visibly shaken by the case, was unforgiving in their sentencing, stating that the couple displayed \\"a total lack of humanity and empathy\\" and were guilty of subjecting the girl to \\"the most horrendous and repulsive acts of torture imaginable, with a deep and prolonged impact on her mental and physical well-being\\". The couple has been handed lengthy sentences, with the man receiving a 25-year prison term and the woman receiving 20 years. Despite the punishment, there has been a resounding public consensus that no sentence could ever truly be enough for the unfathomable acts perpetrated by these individuals. Following the sentencing, a spokesperson for the local child protection agency expressed hope that the convictions would encourage other victims, or those who suspect abuse, to come forward and report their concerns. They emphasized that the authorities and support organizations exist to protect the vulnerable and to ensure that justice prevails for those who are cruelly and unjustly treated. The haunting case has struck a chord with the wider public, prompting urgent calls for increased vigilance, education, and support systems to identify and prevent child abuse. Campaigners argue that there is a pressing need for more comprehensive background checks and regular monitoring of those given the responsibility of caring for children, to prevent further unspeakable tragedies. As society grapples with the incomprehensible brutality of this case, it serves as a sobering reminder of the duty we all have to protect the most vulnerable in our midst. Eyes must be opened, questions must be asked, and a collective resolve must be found to prevent, detect, and punish those who see fit to torment innocent children who rely solely on the adults in their lives for love, support, and protection. In the end, the incarceration of this monstrous couple will not undo the trauma endured by the brave young girl in this case, but it does give her a sense of justice and the opportunity to begin healing. It also sends a powerful message that such heinous acts will not be tolerated within our society, and that anyone who betrays the trust and innocence of the children they care for will be met with the full force of the law."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Keep your plans secret from your spouse. Hide or lock up anything that might let them know you want to get away. If your spouse goes through your things, store your personal items at a friend or family member’s house. Your spouse may sabotage your plans or become more dangerous if they know you are about to leave. Confide in a family member, neighbor, or friend about your spouse’s abuse and your plans to leave. Tell them when you are planning to escape and where you will go. Ask them to check in on you afterwards to ensure you got out safely.  If you decide to talk to a family member, choose carefully. Family members sometimes tip off spouses before a planned escape. Only confide in those you trust deeply. If your neighbors are trustworthy, you can also ask them to call the police if they hear your spouse abusing you or your kids before you leave. Change your phone number or get a new phone when you leave your spouse. Create new passwords and PIN numbers for your online accounts, including your bank account, email account, and social media accounts.  If your spouse harasses you over the phone or online, block them. If you think there is any chance your spouse might have installed a keylogger or other tracking software on your computer, don’t use it. Use a computer at a public library or internet café until you can get a clean computer of your own. Be cautious when you go anywhere by yourself, especially at night. Park close to buildings and avoid using headphones. Stay away from places where your spouse might look for you, and change your route to work, school, and anywhere else you go often. If you feel unsafe, ask somebody to accompany you or call 911 or emergency services. If you’re concerned that your spouse may stalk or harass you, consider asking your boss if you can change your hours at work or work from home. If you have kids, discuss potential safety risks with them. Explaining the situation as best you can may help avoid trauma. Teach them how to leave the house safely and call 911, and have them come up with a list of people they can trust if something happens.  For example, you might pinpoint a nearby area they can go to if you are in danger, such as a park or neighbor's house. If you have an older adolescent or teen, you might also give them a list of phone numbers of shelters or organizations for abuse victims in case they need to make calls. If you feel threatened by your spouse, you can speak to someone anonymously by calling a hotline. They can help you stay safe and advise you on developing an escape plan. For those in the U.S., you can get support by calling the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE. For those in the UK, call 0808 2000 247 to reach a 24-hour helpline. If your spouse threatens to harm you or your children, you may need to file for an order of protection against them. You may file a restraining order against a current or former spouse, even if you left some time ago. Reach out to your city's courthouse to find out the protocol in your area.  This order can help you keep your children in your care and away from an abusive spouse. It also may help you stay in your family home temporarily (and have your spouse removed) until the hearing date. Usually, no fees are associated with filing a restraining order. Summary:","output":"It is crucial to maintain secrecy when planning to leave an abusive spouse, as they may become more dangerous if they know about the plans. Store personal items away from home if necessary and confide only in deeply trusted friends, family members, or neighbors. Change phone numbers, passwords, and PINs and be cautious about using potentially compromised devices. Be careful when going out alone, especially at night, and avoid places where your spouse might look for you. Modify your daily routes, and consider adjusting work hours or working from home if possible. Discuss safety risks with your children and educate them on how to respond in dangerous situations. Seek assistance through hotlines and consider filing for an order of protection to keep your children in your care and safeguard yourself from further harm. Remember to reach out to local support systems or helplines if you feel threatened or need advice on executing an escape plan."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Background: An anaerobic organism is any organism that does not need oxygen for growth and even dies in its presence. Obligate anaerobes will die when exposed to atmospheric levels of oxygen. Clostridium perfringens bacteria, which are commonly found in soil around the world, are obligate anaerobes. Infection of a wound by C. perfringens bacteria causes the disease gas gangrene. Obligate anaerobes use molecules other than oxygen as terminal electron acceptors.  Paragraph: Microbiologist John is studying the anaerobic organism. He collected two samples of this organism, sample A and sample B. Sample A is an anaerobic organism, and sample B is specifically identified as the Clostridium perfringens obligate anaerobe. To compare these samples to other organisms he collected another microbe that is not an anaerobic organism. He labeled it as sample C.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which sample would not need oxygen for growth, sample A or sample C?","output":"According to the paragraph, sample A would not need oxygen for growth because it is described as an anaerobic organism. Anaerobic organisms do not require oxygen to grow, and in some cases, like the obligate anaerobes, their survival can be threatened by the presence of oxygen.

She was born Marem-Ides Leventon (Russian name Adelaida Yakovlevna Leventon) in Yalta, Crimea, Russian Empire. Her stage name Alla Nazimova was a combination of Alla (a diminutive of Adelaida) and the surname of Nadezhda Nazimova, the heroine of the Russian novel Children of the Streets. She was widely known as just Nazimova, and also went under the name Alia Nasimoff. She was the youngest of three children of Jewish parents Yakov Abramovich Leventon, a pharmacist, and Sofia (Sara) Lvovna Horowitz, who moved to Yalta in 1870 from Kishinev. From 1917 to 1922, Nazimova wielded considerable influence and power in Hollywood.  Nazimova helped start the careers of both of Rudolph Valentino's wives, Jean Acker and Natacha Rambova. Although she was involved in an affair with Acker, it is debated as to whether her connection with Rambova ever developed into a sexual affair. Nevertheless, there were rumors that Nazimova and Rambova were involved in a lesbian affair (they are discussed at length in Dark Lover, Emily Leider's biography of Rudolph Valentino) but those rumors have never been definitely confirmed. She was very impressed by Rambova's skills as an art director, and Rambova designed the innovative sets for Nazimova's film productions of Camille and Salome.  Of those Nazimova is confirmed to have been involved with romantically, the list includes actress Eva Le Gallienne, director Dorothy Arzner, writer Mercedes de Acosta, and Oscar Wilde's niece, Dolly Wilde. Bridget Bate Tichenor, a Magic Realist artist and Surrealist painter, was also rumored to be one of Nazimova's favored lovers in Hollywood during the World War II years of 1940 to 1942. The two had been introduced by the poet and art collector Edward James, and according to Tichenor, their intimate relationship angered Nazimova's longtime companion, Glesca Marshall. However, the fact that Tichenor was pregnant most of 1940, giving birth to her son on Dec. 21, 1940, along with the 40-year age gap between the two women, casts some doubt on this rumor.  It is believed that Nazimova coined the phrase \\"sewing circle\\" as code to refer to lesbian or bisexual actresses of her day who concealed their true sexuality.  Nazimova lived with Glesca Marshall from 1929 until her death in 1945.","output":"This text is about Marem-Ides Leventon, better known by her stage name Alla Nazimova or just Nazimova.

I'll help you ask Emily to go on a date with you!\\" First, Kenneth taught Ryan to be brave by helping him practice saying, \\"Hi!\\" and \\"Hello!\\" to people at the park. It was really hard for Ryan to talk to new people. But with Kenneth's help, Ryan was soon waving and saying \\"Hi!\\" to everyone they saw! Next, Kenneth taught Ryan how to give Emily a nice and friendly compliment. \\"Tell her that you really like the pretty flowers she has in her hair,\\" said Kenneth. Ryan practiced a lot, and he became better at giving people nice compliments. Then, they practiced how Ryan would ask Emily out on the ice cream date. With a big smile, Ryan practiced saying, \\"Emily, would you like to go on an ice cream date with me?\\" Finally, after all their practicing, it was time for Ryan to go and ask Emily to go on a date with him. Ryan was still nervous, but Kenneth encouraged him, saying, \\"You can do it, Ryan! You're ready!\\" With butterflies in his stomach, Ryan walked up to Emily in the park.

Usage: The Tail is \\"body is shaking because of the pain.\\" This description suggests a physical reaction or consequence rather than a persona or attribute. Therefore, it does not describe how PersonX would be perceived by others. Part #4: Classify the answer into \\"Yes\\" or \\"No.\\" Usage: Based on the given information, PersonX's action (hurting) does not lead to them being seen as described in the Tail (body is shaking because of the pain).

Options: - hall - kitchen - neighbor's house - card room - livingroom  Explain why a human would choose \\"livingroom\\" to answer the question above:","output":"A human would choose \\"living room\\" to answer the question above because it is a plausible and practical option for accommodating the extra table and guests in a typical residential setting.  The living room is often the largest common area in a house or an apartment, providing more open space and furniture that can be temporarily rearranged to make room for an extra table. Additionally, the living room is traditionally designed for socializing and hosting events, making it an ideal location for large gatherings such as Thanksgiving dinner. Here is an explanation for each of the other options: - Hall: Depending on the size and layout of the house, a hall usually functions as a passageway between rooms rather than a designated gathering space. Thus, there may not be enough room for a large table and chairs. - Kitchen: While the kitchen is a common area for eating and meal preparation, it may not have enough space to accommodate an extra table and a large number of guests, especially if the main purpose of the room is cooking. - Neighbor's house: Although this might work in some situations where close relationships with neighbors exist, it is less likely that a host would extend their Thanksgiving celebration into someone else's property and living space. - Card room: A card room is typically a smaller, separate room designated for card games or leisure activities. It might not have enough open space to accommodate an extra table, and not every house has a designated card room. Considering these factors, a human would be inclined to choose \\"living room\\" as it is the most appropriate and convenient option to accommodate the extra table and guests during a Thanksgiving gathering."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On October 5, four University of Port Harcourt students, Chiadika Biringa, Ugonna Obuzor, Lloyd Toku, and Tekena Elkanah left campus for the village of Aluu. According to Biringa's mother Chinwe, Obuzor was owed some money and he asked his three classmates to accompany him to the village to collect on the debt. Within minutes of their arrival, a rumor spread that the students were not there to collect but to steal. An enraged mob stripped them naked while beating them with sticks and rocks then wrapped car tires around their necks -- a form of torture known as \\"necklacing.\\" As the four men sat on the muddy ground dazed and pleading for their lives, someone doused them with gasoline, lit a match and set them on fire.  OPTIONS: - Africa's mother felt the same way when CNN approached her to talk about her son's killing. - Aluu's mother felt the same way when CNN approached her to talk about her son's killing. - Biringa's mother felt the same way when CNN approached her to talk about her son's killing. - CNN's mother felt the same way when CNN approached her to talk about her son's killing. - Chiadika Biringa's mother felt the same way when CNN approached her to talk about her son's killing. - Chinwe's mother felt the same way when CNN approached her to talk about her son's killing. - Lloyd Toku's mother felt the same way when CNN approached her to talk about her son's killing. - Misunderstanding's mother felt the same way when CNN approached her to talk about her son's killing. - Nigerian's mother felt the same way when CNN approached her to talk about her son's killing. - Obuzor's mother felt the same way when CNN approached her to talk about her son's killing. - Tekena Elkanah's mother felt the same way when CNN approached her to talk about her son's killing. - Ugonna Obuzor's mother felt the same way when CNN approached her to talk about her son's killing. - University of Port Harcourt's mother felt the same way when CNN approached her to talk about her son's killing.","output":"Chiadika Biringa's mother felt the same way when CNN approached her to talk about her son's killing. The brutal murder of the four young students sent shockwaves through the community and sparked widespread outrage, prompting a conversation about the problem of mob justice in Nigeria. Families of the victims were left devastated, struggling to come to terms with the senseless killings of their loved ones. For Chiadika Biringa's mother, the pain of losing her child in such a horrific manner is unbearable. When asked about her son's murder, she broke down in tears, recounting the joyful memories of her son and the bright future he had ahead of him. As a mother, the thought of her son begging for his life, being beaten, and ultimately, set on fire is too much to bear. The Nigerian government was quick to condemn the lynching, vowing to bring the perpetrators to justice. However, despite the public outcry and the government's promises, it remains to be seen whether the incident will lead to lasting change in Nigeria, a country that has struggled with the issue of mob justice for decades. The University of Port Harcourt mourned the loss of their students, with fellow classmates organizing candlelight vigils and protests to demand justice for their fallen peers. Students and members of the public expressed their anger and disbelief at the barbaric act, calling for an end to this form of extrajudicial killing in Nigeria. This tragic event highlights the lethal consequences of rumors and misunderstandings, as well as the urgent need to dismantle the culture of mob justice. Education, awareness campaigns, and the implementation of strong laws to protect victims against such violence are essential in preventing other innocent lives from being taken in the future. As the families of Biringa, Obuzor, Toku, and Elkanah continue to grieve and seek justice, it is the responsibility of the Nigerian society to reflect on the events of that fateful day in Aluu and work towards a future where no one else will suffer the same fate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does \\"Article 12 of the 1886 Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works uses the term \\"piracy\\" in relation to copyright infringement, stating \\"Pirated works may be seized on importation into those countries of the Union where the original work enjoys legal protection.\\"\\" contain the correct answer to \\"How does Article 12 of the 1886 Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works use the term piracy?\\"","output":"Yes, the given statement correctly answers the question, \\"How does Article 12 of the 1886 Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works use the term piracy?” To provide a detailed explanation, the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, commonly known as the Berne Convention, is an international agreement governing copyright. It was first adopted on September 9, 1886, in Berne, Switzerland, with 178 countries currently being signatories of the agreement. Article 12 of the 1886 Berne Convention specifically addresses the use of the term \\"piracy\\" in relation to copyright infringement. Piracy, in this context, refers to the unauthorized copying, reproduction, or distribution of copyrighted works, which infringes upon the rights granted to authors and creators under copyright law. According to Article 12, pirated works may be seized when they are imported into countries that are members of the Berne Convention, referred to as \\"countries of the Union,\\" and only if the original work enjoys legal protection in the importing country. Legal protection is generally granted in the country where the work was originally created, published, or registered under copyright law. The aim of this provision is to deter and combat the trade of pirated works across international borders, providing authors and creators with the means to protect their intellectual property rights upon the importation of infringing copies. It is important to note that the Berne Convention has since undergone several revisions, with the latest and most significant changes being adopted in the 1971 Paris Act. However, the essence of Article 12 in its 1886 form is still relevant — it established a framework for international cooperation in dealing with copyright piracy, demonstrating the participating countries' commitment to the protection and enforcement of copyright law. In summary, Article 12 of the 1886 Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works uses the term \\"piracy\\" in relation to copyright infringement, stating that pirated works may be seized upon importation into the countries of the Union where the original work enjoys legal protection. The given statement answers the question accurately and provides a clear understanding of the Berne Convention's approach toward piracy in the context of copyright infringement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  Now, I have a new situation: Greg is studying the environmental impact of agriculture. He noticed that in his own state a lake near agricultural lands has been declared as a dead zone. For his study Greg labeled this zone as zone A. Then he found near a national park in his state a lake is not declared as a dead zone. To further his study he labeled this zone as zone B.  Answer this question please: Would zone B see less or more organisms than zone A? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information and understanding on the concepts of dead zones and eutrophication, Zone B would likely see more organisms than Zone A.  The primary reason for this is the presence (or lack thereof) of oxygen in the water. In the process called eutrophication, excess nutrients—particularly nitrogen and phosphorous, found in fertilizers used in agricultural lands—enter a body of water. This leads to high concentrations of these nutrients, which in turn lead to overgrowth of algae, a process termed algal bloom.  Algae use carbon dioxide and, during sunlight hours, produce oxygen through photosynthesis. However, when they die, decomposers break down the algae. This process of decomposition uses up much of the available oxygen in the water, as decay organisms grow rapidly in the presence of such a rich food source. When the oxygen in the water is depleted, it leaves an aquatic environment in which few organisms can live, therefore creating a \\"dead zone.\\" In the case of Zone A, the lake has been declared a dead zone. This means that this area of water has such low oxygen levels that most marine life cannot survive. Any organisms which do not possess adaptations to live in oxygen-poor environments would either move away (if mobile, like fish or crustaceans) or die out. Contrastingly, for Zone B, which is near a national park and not classified as a dead zone, its water body is presumably less exposed to agricultural runoff and thus to lower risk of algal blooms and oxygen depletion. As such, it can support a wider range of aquatic life, from various species of fish and amphibians to crustaceans and other invertebrates, as well as different types of plant life elements such as water lilies or reeds.  Therefore, studying the biodiversity and population density of both Zone A and Zone B, it is expected that Zone B, a healthier aquatic ecosystem, would accommodate significantly more organisms compared to Zone A, a recognized dead zone with limited to no oxygen supply."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy.  I am facing a new situation today: An alien passing by Earth in a UFO to write a report on two random cities so that his government can better understand what the people of Earth are like. He first flies over Nillmar, a city in France, which uses burns coal as its main production of electricity. After observing Nillmar, the alien flies over to Springfield, a city in the United States, that decided to use nuclear power to fuel itself. After taking his notes, the alien leaves and is eager to report back to his superiors about what he discovered.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which city will need to change its method of electricity production later? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article, Nillmar, the city in France that relies on burning coal as its main production of electricity, will need to change its method of electricity production later.

Question: Why did Axel want Pia to return to Germany? Movie plot title: Walk on Water Movie plot: Eyal is an agent in Mossad, the Israeli security service. He is a hitman who targets enemies of Israel. His wife has recently committed suicide, and the agency decides that he needs to take on a less challenging assignment: to find an aging Nazi war criminal and get him \\"before God does\\". In order to track down the old man, Eyal poses as a tour guide and befriends the Nazi's adult grandchildren, Axel and Pia. Pia lives on a kibbutz, an Israeli commune. Her brother Axel visits her in order to convince Pia to return to Germany for their father's seventieth birthday. It is later revealed that Pia's estrangement with her parents began when she discovered that they were hiding her grandfather. She shares this information with Axel. Although he has a job to perform, Eyal truly befriends Axel and Pia. Axel and Pia are decent people who demonstrate that most Germans have gotten beyond the hatred that led to the Holocaust. They spend time together and Eyal enjoys himself, even if he would not openly admit so. His friendship with Axel allows him to display some humanity, letting down his tough-guy machismo. Eyal and Axel even take a mud bath by the Dead Sea, showering off together in the nude afterward. When the three are at dinner one night in a Tel Aviv restaurant, Axel speaks privately to the Palestinian waiter, Rafik, and finds out where the best club in town is. Later that evening, Axel, Pia, and Eyal arrive at the club. Eyal is shocked to discover that it is a gay club. He sees Axel dancing with Rafik and is taken aback. Eyal is initially disgusted and disappointed to discover that Axel is gay. He asks to be removed from the assignment, not attempting to hide his homophobia as the reason. His boss, Menachem, insists that Eyal finish the mission. Eyal visits Germany and comes to realize that Axel's orientation is unimportant. During the visit, Eyal defends a group of Axel's transsexual friends from attackers and, in doing so, reveals that he is fluent in German. He tells Axel that his parents were German, leaving... Answer:","output":"Axel wanted Pia to return to Germany for their father's seventieth birthday."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

An additional field work standard for attestation engagements performed in accordance with GAGAS  Does it follow that \\"GAGAS is unrelated to field work standards for attestation engagements.\\"? Select from: (A). yes. (B). it is not possible to tell. (C). no.","output":"(C). No. GAGAS, which stands for Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards, is not unrelated to field work standards for attestation engagements. On the contrary, GAGAS is a set of guidelines established by the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO), which provides a framework for auditors to conduct high-quality and effective audits and attestation engagements for government programs and entities. Attestation engagements performed in accordance with GAGAS encompass examination, review, and agreed-upon procedures engagements related to subject matter or an assertion. The field work standards for attestation engagements are part of GAGAS and cover the essential aspects to ensure the high quality, reliability, and consistency of the work performed by auditors and practitioners. GAGAS field work standards for attestation engagements include, but not are limited to, the following key principles: 1. Independence: Auditors must maintain independence, both in fact and in appearance, to ensure the objectivity, integrity, and impartiality of the attestation engagement. 2. Professional Judgment: Auditors must exercise professional judgment in planning, conducting, and reporting the results of the attestation engagement. 3. Competence: The audit team collectively must have the necessary knowledge, skills, and experience to perform the attestation engagement in accordance with GAGAS. 4. Quality Control and Assurance: Auditors must establish and maintain a system of quality control for their organizations to provide reasonable assurance that the attestation engagement is conducted in accordance with GAGAS. 5. Planning and Supervision: Auditors must plan the attestation engagement and adequately supervise the work of audit team members to ensure that the engagement is conducted in accordance with GAGAS standards. 6. Evidence: Auditors must obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for the conclusion expressed in the attestation report. 7. Reporting: The attestation report must be clear, concise, and complete, presenting the results of the attestation engagement and the methodology used so readers can comprehend the work performed and the basis for the conclusions reached. In conclusion, GAGAS is not unrelated to field work standards for attestation engagements. Instead, the field work standards are an integral part of GAGAS, providing guidelines and requirements that auditors must adhere to in order to successfully conduct attestation engagements for government programs and entities within the established principles and standards."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question.

Summarize this article: Marble is very soft and prone to damage so it is important to apply a coat of high quality marble sealing agent before proceeding with the grout. This seal is also important because marble is very porous and grout can cause stains in the tiles.  Apply the sealing agent over the tops of the marble. Even if you prefer the color and look of unsealed marble you can use a “grout release”-type sealer to prevent grout from sticking to the marble tiles. Grout, or mortar, will be used ot fill in the spaces between the tiles. Be sure to wear a dust mask, safety goggles, and heavy-duty work gloves. Wear a long-sleeve shirt to avoid any possible damage to your skin from contact with the grout. Mix only enough as will be used in 15-20 minutes of work or else the extra can dry out and harden. This prepares the spaces for the grout or mortar. Spread the concrete evenly over the spaces between the tiles using a squeegee. Be careful to avoid getting cement on the tops of the tiles. Some will inevitably get on top of the tiles but you want to minimize the amount.  Try to push it into the spaces as much as possible to create a tight fight. Wipe up any grout on top of the tiles as you go. Use a squeegee to spread out the grout and leave a smooth surface in the cracks. You can also use a gloved finger to run down the grooves and smooth the top of the grout. Use a damp sponge to wipe down the tops of the tiles to remove any excess grout. Try not to get extra moisture into the grout or else it can make it too wet. Allow the grout to dry for the length of time required by the manufacturer. Some will require long curing times to ensure maximum strength. Use a disposable sponge applicator to paint the grout with a grout sealer. This will help prevent stains and dirt from permanently discoloring the grout. It will also make cleaning easier later on. Clean your tools with water or acetone to remove the excess grout or mortar and prepare them for use once again.","output":"This article is about how to take care of marble tiles when you put them on a floor or wall. Marble can be easily damaged, so you need to use a special sealing agent to protect it. You also need to use grout, which is like a paste, to fill the gaps between the tiles. When working with grout, wear safety gear like goggles, gloves and long sleeves. Mix the grout and put it between the tiles carefully. Use a squeegee or your finger to smooth it out, and clean the tiles with a damp sponge. When it's dry, use a grout sealer to keep it clean and strong.

Natalie easily passed Angela in the annual two mile race for charity because  Available options:  - Natalie  was so athletic.  - Angela  was so athletic.","output":"Natalie easily passed Angela in the annual two-mile race for charity because Natalie was so athletic. Her dedication to maintaining a consistent training regimen and relentless commitment to pushing her physical limitations had not only honed her skills as a runner but also given her an edge over the other participants in the event. Angela, while certainly enthusiastic about the race and the cause it supported, had not been able to devote as much time and effort to her training, and as a result, she found her stamina and endurance lagging behind Natalie's during the race. Natalie's success in the charity race was a testament to her hard work and determination. In the months leading up to the event, she had set aside time each day to train, meticulously tracking her progress and adjusting her training schedule to maximize her potential. Recognizing the importance of balance in any athletic pursuit, she had also worked on strengthening her core muscles and improving her flexibility through a combination of weight training and yoga exercises. Angela, on the other hand, had a busy schedule and struggled to find the time to fit in regular workouts. Although she was proud of her athletic abilities, she knew that without proper training, she was unlikely to match Natalie's performance on the day of the race. Angela focused on supporting the cause and was grateful to be a part of the charity event, irrespective of her position in the race. As they crossed the finish line, Natalie took a moment to look back and congratulate Angela. Despite the difference in their athletic prowess, the two women had come together to participate in the race, united by their shared dedication to supporting their community and the charitable organizations that worked tirelessly to make a difference. They would both carry the memories of this race with them for years to come, as a reminder of what can be achieved by those who channel their passion and determination into a cause greater than themselves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Background: Cooper was born on May 7, 1901, in Helena, Montana to Alice (nee Brazier, 1873-1967) and Charles Henry Cooper (1865-1946). His father had emigrated from Houghton Regis, Bedfordshire and was a prominent lawyer, rancher, and (later) a Montana Supreme Court justice. His mother had emigrated from Gillingham, Kent and married Charles in Montana. In 1906, Charles purchased the 600-acre (240 ha) Seven-Bar-Nine cattle ranch about fifty miles (eighty kilometers) north of Helena near the town of Craig on the Missouri River. Context: In early 1925, Cooper began his film career in silent pictures such as The Thundering Herd and Wild Horse Mesa with Jack Holt, Riders of the Purple Sage and The Lucky Horseshoe with Tom Mix, and The Trail Rider with Buck Jones. He worked for several Poverty Row studios, including Famous Players-Lasky and Fox Film Corporation. While his skilled horsemanship led to steady work in Westerns, Cooper found the stunt work--which sometimes injured horses and riders--\\"tough and cruel\\". Hoping to move beyond the risky stunt work and obtain acting roles, Cooper paid for a screen test and hired casting director Nan Collins to work as his agent. Knowing that other actors were using the name \\"Frank Cooper\\", Collins suggested he change his first name to \\"Gary\\" after her hometown of Gary, Indiana. Cooper immediately liked the name.  Cooper also found work in a variety of non-Western films, appearing, for example, as a masked Cossack in The Eagle (1925), as a Roman guard in Ben-Hur (1925), and as a flood survivor in The Johnstown Flood (1926). Gradually, he began to land credited roles that offered him more screen time, in films such as Tricks (1925), in which he played the film's antagonist, and the short film Lightnin' Wins (1926). As a featured player, he began to attract the attention of major film studios. On June 1, 1926, Cooper signed a contract with Samuel Goldwyn Productions for fifty dollars a week.  Cooper's first important film role was in The Winning of Barbara Worth (1926) with Ronald Colman and Vilma Banky, in which he plays a young engineer who helps a rival suitor save the woman he loves and her town from an impending dam disaster. Cooper's experience living among the Montana cowboys gave his performance an \\"instinctive authenticity\\", according to biographer Jeffrey Meyers. The film was a major success. Critics singled out Cooper as a \\"dynamic new personality\\" and future star. Goldwyn rushed to offer Cooper a long-term contract, but he held out for a better deal--finally signing a five-year contract with Jesse L. Lasky at Paramount Pictures for 175 a week. In 1927, with help from Clara Bow, Cooper landed high-profile roles in Children of Divorce and Wings, the latter being the first film to win an Academy Award for Best Picture. That year, Cooper also appeared in his first starring roles in Arizona Bound and Nevada--both films directed by John Waters.  In 1928, Paramount paired Cooper with a youthful Fay Wray in The Legion of the Condemned and The First Kiss--advertising them as the studio's \\"glorious young lovers\\". Their on-screen chemistry failed to generate much excitement with audiences. With each new film, Cooper's acting skills improved and his popularity continued to grow, especially among female movie-goers. During this time, he was earning as much as 2,750 per film and receiving a thousand fan letters a week. Looking to exploit Cooper's growing audience appeal, the studio placed him opposite popular leading ladies such as Evelyn Brent in Beau Sabreur, Florence Vidor in Doomsday, and Esther Ralston in Half a Bride. That year, Cooper also made Lilac Time with Colleen Moore for First National Pictures, his first movie with synchronized music and sound effects. It became one of the most commercially successful films of 1928. Question: Was he in any other films?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Gary Cooper appeared in many other films throughout his career. This excerpt highlights only the early portion of his filmography, including some silent pictures and his transition to talkies by 1928. Cooper's career spanned several decades, and he starred in numerous classic films such as \\"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\\" (1936), \\"Meet John Doe\\" (1941), \\"Sergeant York\\" (1941), \\"The Pride of the Yankees\\" (1942), \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" (1943), and \\"High Noon\\" (1952). These films, along with many others, contributed to his legacy as a prominent actor in Hollywood history."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

A pair of the same kind of shoes can be purchased new for 28.00 and will last for 2 years. The average cost per year of the new shoes is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the used shoes?","output":"First, let's calculate the average cost per year for both the repaired shoes and the new shoes. For the repaired shoes: The cost to repair is 11.50, and they will last for 1 year. So the average cost per year is 11.50 / 1 year = 11.50 per year. For the new shoes: The cost to purchase new is 28.00, and they will last for 2 years. So the average cost per year is 28.00 / 2 years = 14.00 per year. Now, let's calculate the percentage increase from the cost of repairing the used shoes to the cost of the new shoes per year. The difference in cost per year is 14.00 (new shoes) - 11.50 (repaired shoes) = 2.50. To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original amount (the cost of repairing the used shoes) and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage: Percentage increase = (2.50 / 11.50) * 100 = 0.2174 * 100 = 21.74% Therefore, the average cost per year of the new shoes is boxed{21.74%}  greater than the cost of repairing the used shoes."},{"instruction":"Given the sets P={0, a} and Q={1, 2}, if P cap Q neq emptyset, then a equals ( ) A: 1   B: 2   C: 1 or 2   D: 3","output":"Since P={0, a} and Q={1, 2}, and P cap Q neq emptyset,   it follows that P cap Q = {1} or P cap Q = {2},   which means the set P contains the element 1 or 2.

Determine which coin is defective using two weighings on a balance scale without weights. 1. **First Weighing:**    - Place the coins of 2 kopecks and 3 kopecks on one pan of the scale.    - Place the coin of 5 kopecks on the other pan. 2. **Possible Outcomes and Analysis:**    - **Outcome 1:** The scale is balanced.      - This implies that the coins of 2, 3, and 5 kopecks are of correct weight:        - Normal weights: ( 2 + 3 = 5 text{ grams} )        - The single 5 kopecks coin should weigh 5 grams.      - Therefore, the defective coin must be the 1 kopeck coin which wasn't weighed.    - **Outcome 2:** The scale is not balanced.      - This indicates that one of the coins on the scale is defective. 3. **Second Weighing:**    - Place the coins of 1 kopeck and 2 kopecks on one pan.    - Place the coin of 3 kopecks on the other pan. 4. **Possible Outcomes and Analysis:**    - **Balanced Scale:**       - If the scale balances, it means the 1, 2, and 3 kopeck coins are correct, and the 5 kopecks coin is defective.    - **Unbalanced Scale:**      - This indicates that either the 1 kopeck coin or the 2 kopeck coin is defective.      - The 3 kopeck coin is already confirmed to be correct from the first weighing. # Conclusion: - By evaluating the outcomes from both weighings, we can identify the defective coin.  ---  Problem 2: Identifying Dresses of Girls # Problem Statement: Four girls, named Asya, Katya, Galya, and Nina are standing in a circle. Given the following statements, determine the color of the dress for each girl: 1. The girl in the green dress is not Asya or Katya and is standing between the girl in the blue dress and Nina. 2. The girl in the white dress is standing between the girl in the pink dress and Katya. 1. **Identify the Girl in the Green Dress:**    - The girl in the green dress is not Asya or Katya, so it must be Galya or Nina.     - She stands between the girl in the blue dress and Nina, so she must be Galya since Galya is not Nina. 2. **Identify the Girl in the Blue Dress:**    - Katya cannot be in the green, white, or pink dress, so Katya must be in blue. 3. **Organize the Standing Position:**    - From point 1, Galya (green dress) stands between Katya (blue dress) and Nina.    - Therefore, the order is: Katya (blue), Galya (green), and Nina. 4. **Identify the Girl in the White Dress:**    - Given: The girl in the white dress stands between the girl in the pink dress and Katya.    - Since Katya is in the blue dress, and the position arranged above leaves only Asya, Asya must be in the white dress. 5. **Finally, Identify the Remaining Girl:**    - Nina is the only one left and must be in the pink dress. # Conclusion: - The final arrangement of the dresses among the girls is:   [   text{Asya in white, Katya in blue, Galya in green, Nina in pink}.   ] [ boxed{text{Asya in white, Katya in blue, Galya in green, Nina in pink}} ]"},{"instruction":"The positional relationship between the two circles x^2+y^24x+2y+1=0 and x^2+y^2+4x4y1=0 is (　　)   A: Separate   B: Externally tangent   C: Intersecting   D: Internally tange","output":"By transforming the equation of the circle x^2+y^2-4x+2y+1=0, we get (x-2)^2+(y+1)^2=4, which gives us the center A(2, -1) and radius R=2.

Since we are considering x > 0, we only take x > 2. Similarly, setting f'(x) < 0 gives 0 < x < 2. This means f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, 2) and monotonically increasing on (2, +infty). To ensure f(x) has no zeros for x > 0, we need to ensure the minimum value of f(x) on (0, +infty) is positive. The minimum occurs at x = 2, so we calculate f(2): f(2) = frac{1}{3}(2)^3 - 4(2) + a = frac{8}{3} - 8 + a = a - frac{16}{3}. For f(2) > 0, we need a - frac{16}{3} > 0, which simplifies to a > frac{16}{3}. The smallest integer greater than frac{16}{3} is 6. Therefore, the minimum value of the integer a for which f(x) has only one zero in its domain is boxed{6}, which corresponds to choice boxed{C}."},{"instruction":"A crow leaves its nest, and flies back and forth from its nest to a nearby ditch to gather worms.

Use the stars and bars method where the 10 points are stars and the separations between dice are bars.    - We need 4 bars to separate the 5 dice.    - Compute binom{10+5-1}{5-1} = binom{14}{4}. 4. **Combination Calculation**:    [    binom{14}{4} = frac{14 times 13 times 12 times 11}{4 times 3 times 2 times 1} = 1001    ] Thus, the number of ways to achieve a sum of 15 when rolling 5 dice, each showing at least 1, is 1001.

If ( A ) does not mark the single cell, ( B ) places the first and only coin, guaranteeing ( B ) wins. Hence, the base case holds as ( A ) must necessarily mark one cell.          - **Inductive Step: Suppose the hypothesis holds for ( n=k ):**         - In a (2k+1) times (2k+1) grid, if ( A ) marks fewer than 2k+1 cells, ( B ) has a winning strategy.         - Now, consider ( n=k+1 ). ( A ) marks at most 2k+2 cells:             - If two marked cells share the same row or column, ( B ) can place a coin in that specific row or column.             - If no two marked cells lie in the same row or column, consider cells ((i,j)) and ((s,t)) marked by ( A ). ( B ) can place a coin in cell ((i,t)). 4. **Concluding Scenario if Fewer than ( 2n+1 ) Cells Marked:**     - ( B ) will have a relentless strategy to always block ( A )'s moves by leveraging the positioning of unmarked cells.     - By inductive reasoning, it infers that if ( A ) marks fewer than ( 2n+1 ) cells, ( B ) has a winning strategy by exploiting rows and columns. 5. **Applying Conclusion to the Original ( 25 times 25 ) Board:**     - Given ( 25 = 2n+1 ), we obtain ( n = 12 ).

So we have: (P/100) * 200 - 40 = 200 Now, let's solve for P: (P/100) * 200 = 200 + 40 P * 2 = 240 P = 240 / 2 P = 120 So, the alien returned 120% of the abducted people. However, this is not possible because you cannot return more than 100% of something that was taken. There must be a mistake in the interpretation of the question or the information provided.  Let's re-evaluate the scenario: If the alien returned a certain percentage of the abducted people and then took 40 people away (10 to another planet and 30 to his home planet), the number of people he returned would be the original number minus the 40 he took away. So, if he returned R people, we have: R = 200 - 40 R = 160 Now, to find the percentage of the abducted people he returned, we use the following formula: Percentage returned = (Number of people returned / Original number of people abducted) * 100 Percentage returned = (160 / 200) * 100 Percentage returned = 0.8 * 100 Percentage returned = 80% The alien returned boxed{80%}  of the abducted people."},{"instruction":"Below is the graph of (y = a sin (bx + c) + d) for some positive constants (a), (b), (c), and (d).

This derivative is negative for 0 < x < 1 and positive for 1 < x < ln 2a, indicating that h(x) decreases on (0,1) and increases on (1, ln 2a). This implies ln 2a leq 2 and a < h(1) = e, leading to a < e. Thus, for this case, frac{e}{2} < a < e.

The theorem states: [ A = I + frac{B}{2} - 1 ] where  - ( A ) is the area of the polygon, - ( I ) is the number of lattice points in the interior of the polygon, and - ( B ) is the number of lattice points on the boundary of the polygon. We are given a triangle with vertices at ( A = (0,0) ), ( B = (200,100) ), and ( C = (30,330) ). 1. **Calculate the area of the triangle ( Delta ABC ):**    The area of a triangle given its vertices can be calculated using the determinant formula:    [    A = frac{1}{2} left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) right|    ]        Substituting the given coordinates:    [    = frac{1}{2} left| 0(100 - 330) + 200(330 - 0) + 30(0 - 100) right|    ]    [    = frac{1}{2} left| 0 + 66000 - 3000 right|    ]    [    = frac{1}{2} times 63000 = 31500    ] 2. **Identify lattice points and center points:**    Center points are defined as points of the form ( left(x + frac{1}{2}, y + frac{1}{2}right) ) for integers ( x ) and ( y ). Once transformed and scaled appropriately, they can still be analyzed using Pick’s theorem in a modified lattice. 3. **Apply Pick's Theorem to the given triangle:**    [    31500 = I_1 + frac{B_1}{2} - 1    ]    Let ( I_c ) and ( B_c ) be the number of center points (interior and boundary) in the original triangle. Also, after transformation, if we use the new lattice:    [    2 times 31500 = I_2 + frac{B_2}{2} - 1    ] 4. **Derive the formula for the number of center points:**    Through manipulation and transformation, the relationship between ( I_c ) and both the original lattice points:        [    I_c = K - frac{B_c}{2}    ]        where ( K ) is the area, and ( B_c ) is boundary center points. 5. **Count the boundary center points:**    On segment ( AB ), the boundary center points calculated are 0.        On segment ( BC ), the boundary center points calculated are 10.        On segment ( CA ), the boundary center points calculated are 30.

For any alpha=left(a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{n}right) in A and beta=left(b_{1}, b_{2}, cdots, b_{n}right) in A,  we define: gamma(alpha, beta)=left(left|a_{1}-b_{1}right|,left|a_{2}-b_{2}right|, cdots,left|a_{n}-b_{n}right|right), and D(A)={gamma(alpha, beta) mid alpha in A, beta in A}.  We need to prove that ( |D(A)| geqslant |A| ). 1. **Base Case**: Suppose A contains exactly one element, say alpha = (a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{n}). In this case, any beta in A is also alpha, so         gamma(alpha, beta) = gamma(alpha, alpha) = (0, 0, cdots, 0).        Therefore, D(A) contains only the zero vector and |D(A)| = 1. Since |A| = 1, it follows that |D(A)| geqslant |A|. 2. **Step for n = 1**: Assume A = left{a_{1} < a_{2} < cdots < a_{m}right} for n = 1. Then we have:        D(A) = left{0, |a_{2}-a_{1}|, |a_{3}-a_{1}|, cdots, |a_{m}-a_{1}|right}.        Since |a_{i} - a_{1}| are distinct for i = 2, cdots, m, it follows that:        |D(A)| geqslant m = |A|.         3. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for any |A|>1 and n geqslant 1. Now consider any A and let B = left{left(x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{n-1}right) mid (x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{n-1}, x_{n}) in A text{ for some } x_{n}right}. By the inductive hypothesis, |D(B)| geqslant |B|. 4. **Set Partitions**:    Define A_{b} = {x_{n} mid (b, x_{n}) in A} for each b in B. Let a_{b} = max {x mid x in A_{b}} and C = A backslash left{(b, a_{b}) mid b in Bright}.

Therefore, this largest difference is not in left{left|c - c'right| mid d(b, b') = D, c in C_{b}, c' in C_{b'}right}.    Hence, for any D in D(B), the set         left{left|c - c'right| mid d(b, b') = D, c in C_{b}, c' in C_{b'}right}        is a proper subset of        left{left|a - a'right| mid d(b, b') = D, a in A_{b}, a' in A_{b'}right}.

It is known that ( omega ) also satisfies the equation ( omega^{2} + omega + 1 = 0 ). 3. To investigate the factors of ( x^{5} + x + 1 ), we substitute ( omega ) into the polynomial:    [    omega^{5} + omega + 1    ]    Given that (omega^{3} = 1), we can simplify this expression:    [    omega^{5} = omega^{(3+2)} = omega^{3} cdot omega^{2} = 1 cdot omega^{2} = omega^{2}    ]    Hence:    [    omega^{5} + omega + 1 = omega^{2} + omega + 1    ] 4. From the equation (omega^{2} + omega + 1 = 0), we have:    [    omega^{5} + omega + 1 = 0    ] 5.

Substituting this result back into the original equation, we have: f(2016)+f(-2016)+f'(2017)-f'(-2017)= asin 2016 + b(2016)^{3} + 4 + asin (-2016) + b(-2016)^{3} + 4 + 0 Since sin(x) is an odd function, sin(-2016)=-sin(2016), and because sin(2016) is a multiple of 2pi, sin(2016)=0. Thus, asin(2016)+asin(-2016)=0. Furthermore, since (2016)^3 = (-2016)^3, b(2016)^3 + b(-2016)^3 = 2b(2016)^3. However, without knowing the value of b, we cannot simplify this expression further. Nonetheless, since asin 2016=0, b(2016)^3 and b(-2016)^3 are equal, and f'(2017)-f'(-2017)=0, the equation simplifies to 8 + 2b(2016)^3. boxed{f(2016)+f(-2016)+f'(2017)-f'(-2017)=8+2b(2016)^3}"},{"instruction":"a mathematics competition, the sum of the scores of Bill and Dick equalled the sum of the scores of Ann and Carol.

For P(AB) = P(A)P(B) to hold, P(B) must also be frac{1}{10}, implying there are 10 ways for event B to occur. - If m is even or odd, the first draw can be any number from 0 to m, giving m+1 possibilities. - For there to be 10 ways, m+1=10, which simplifies to m=9. Therefore, if events A and B are independent, then m=9.  If m=9: - The first ball drawn must be labeled 7 to achieve a sum of 9 when the second ball is 2. - This gives P(AB) = frac{1}{10} times frac{1}{10} = frac{1}{100}. - With P(A) = frac{1}{10} and P(B) = frac{1}{10}, we confirm that P(AB) = P(A)P(B).

Hence, f(x)=frac{2x}{x+1} (x neq -1). Method 1: Assume there exists a constant c that meets the requirement, i.e., f(x)+f(c-x)=4 holds for x neq -1. Specifically, when x=0, we have f(0)+f(c)=4, which implies frac{2c}{c+1}=4. Solving this equation gives c=-2. Now we prove that f(x)+f(-2-x)=4 holds for x neq -1. In fact, when x neq -1, f(x)+f(-2-x)= frac{2x}{x+1} + frac{2(-2-x)}{(-2-x)+1} = frac{2x}{x+1} + frac{-4-2x}{-x-1} = frac{4x+4}{x+1} = 4. Thus, there exists a constant c=-2 that satisfies the given condition. Method 2: Assume there exists a constant c that meets the requirement, i.e., f(x)+f(c-x)=4 holds for x neq -1. Then, frac{2x}{x+1}+ frac{2(c-x)}{c-x+1} = 4, which implies frac{c-x}{c-x+1} = 2 - frac{x}{x+1}. Rearranging, we get -x^2 + (c-1)x + c = -x^2 + (c-1)x + 2(c+1), and simplifying, we obtain c=-2.

This simplifies to x leqslant frac{m}{|x-m|}, which holds for x in [1,2]. Consequently, we must have 0 < m < 1 or m > 2. Under the conditions 0 < m < 1 or m > 2, the problem becomes |x-m| leqslant frac{m}{x} for x in [1,2]. This is equivalent to mx-m leqslant x^2 leqslant mx+m for x in [1,2].

The distance from the center C to line l is d= dfrac {|D×(- dfrac {D}{2})+E×(- dfrac {E}{2})+F|}{ sqrt {D^{2}+E^{2}}}=| dfrac {F-2}{2}|.

Since ( B_1 ) to ( P ) has components mixed in both ( x ) and ( y ) directions, an equation for ( QB ) can be set:    [    QB = frac{sqrt{2} x}{x+1}    ] 3. **Compute Distance from Point ( B ) to Plane ( B_1CP ):**    Using the earlier result, the distance can be computed using sine:    [    h = QB sin 60^circ = frac{sqrt{6} x}{2(x+1)}    ] 4. **Triangle ( triangle B_1PC ):**    Calculate the sides:    [    B_1C = sqrt{2}, quad B_1P = PC = sqrt{x^2 + 1}    ]        Using Heron's formula or directly from the determinant method for the area of a triangle in coordinate geometry:    [    S_{triangle B_1PC} = frac{sqrt{2 x^2 + 1}}{2}    ] 5. **Volume Relationship Using Tetrahedron:**    Equate the volumes of tetrahedrons to solve for ( x ):    [    V_{text{Tetrahedron } B_1 - PB - C} = V_{text{Tetrahedron } B - PB_1 - C}    ]    This implies:    [    frac{x}{6} = frac{x sqrt{6(2 x^2 + 1)}}{12 (x+1)}    ]    Solving for ( x ):    [    x = frac{1}{2}    ] 6. **Distance Calculation:**    Point ( B ) to ( PB_1 ):    [    d = frac{1}{sqrt{5}}    ] 7. **Dihedral Angle:**    The angle ( A_1-B_1P-C ) being dihedral is evaluated by:    [    cos = frac{h}{d} = frac{sqrt{5}}{sqrt{6}}    ]        Therefore, the secant of the angle:    [    sec = -sqrt{5}    ] Conclusively the value of the secant function for the dihedral angle ( A_1 - B_1P - C ) is: [ boxed{-sqrt{5}} ]"},{"instruction":"A polynomial with integer coefficients is given by [ x^3 + b_2 x^2 + b_1 x + 18 = 0. ] List all the possible integer roots of this polynomial.","output":"- According to the Integer Root Theorem, the possible integer roots of the polynomial are divisors of the constant term, which is 18. - The divisors of 18 are pm 1, pm 2, pm 3, pm 6, pm 9, pm 18.

If every box already contains exactly one ball, we are done. Otherwise, some boxes contain more than one ball while others may be empty.     4. **Operations Impact on Configuration:**    - Consider the sum of the squared positions of the balls. Let the position of the i-th ball be p_i:      [      S = sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i^2      ]    - The allowed operations affect S as follows:      - Moving a ball from B_1 to B_2 increases the sum by 1^2 - 2^2 = -3.      - Moving a ball from B_n to B_{n-1} increases the sum by n^2 - (n-1)^2 = 2n - 1.      - Moving two balls from B_i to B_{i-1} and B_{i+1} changes the sum by (i^2 + i^2) - ((i-1)^2 + (i+1)^2) = 2i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1 + i^2 + 2i + 1) = 0.        Notice that though this operation doesn't change the sum S, it redistributes the balls.       5. **Reduction to Simplified Problem:**    - Suppose after a finite number of steps, one ball reaches either position 1 or position n, the sum of squares is bounded by n^3.    - Let without loss of generality, one ball reach position n. We can then redistribute the remaining balls in boxes B_1, B_2, ldots, B_{n-1}.    - By our inductive hypothesis, an arrangement can be reached where boxes B_1, ldots, B_{n-1} each hold exactly one ball. 6. **Final Adjustment:**    - If a ball was initially at position n and then shifted to n-1, it can be moved between n-1 and n to adjust the final configuration until each box contains one ball.    Thus, it is shown that using the operations permitted, one can always reach a state where each of the n boxes contains exactly one ball. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{text{It is always possible to reach a configuration where all boxes contain exactly one ball.}} ]"},{"instruction":"From points A and B, a motorist and a cyclist set off towards each other, but not at the same time.

To find the sum of all points that lie on the surface of the composed figure of 2012 dice, note that the sum of the points on a standard six-sided die is:    [    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21    ] 2. Since there are 2012 dice, the total sum of the points on all the dice is:    [    2012 times 21 = 42252    ] 3. On a standard die, the sum of the points on opposite faces is always 7. Let's denote the number of points on one of the end faces of the first die by (X). This is a random value and can be any integer from 1 to 6. 4. Similarly, the sum of the number of points on the opposite faces of each die in the sequence, due to their alignment by identical faces, is 7. Therefore, for the 2012 dice aligned in this manner, the sum of the points on the faces that are in direct contact will be:    [    (2012 - 1) times 7 = 2011 times 7 = 14077    ] 5.

We can change one of the primes dividing (a_m) into a (2), creating a new even number (b_m) with (ell) divisors. Thus, we have a new sequence of evens (b_1 < b_2 < cdots) all with (ell) divisors and obeying (b_i < a_i) for all (i). This implies that the (m)-th smallest even number with (ell) divisors is strictly less than the (m)-th smallest odd number with (ell) divisors. Hence, (f_ell(x) geq g_ell(x)). 6. **Summation Analysis:**    Notice that:    [    sum_{k=1}^n d(2k) > sum_{k=1}^n d(2k-1) Longleftrightarrow sum_{k=2}^n kf_k(n) > sum_{k=1}^n kg_k(n)    ]    We see (g_2(n) > f_2(n)) since this just counts primes. The left-hand side (LHS) is putting more weight on bigger numbers, so it is bigger.
