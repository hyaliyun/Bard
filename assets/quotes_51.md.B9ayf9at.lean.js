In order to find Asia they had to find a way past South America. The man who finally found the way from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific was Ferdinand Magellan. Magellan sailed from Seville in August, 1519 with five ships and about 280 men. Fourteen months later, after spending the cold winter on the coast of Patagonia, he discovered the channel which is now called Magellan Strait . In November, 1520, after many months of dangers from rocks and storms, the three remaining ships entered the ocean on the other side of South America. They then continued, hoping to reach Asia. But they did not see any land until they reached the islands off the coast of Asia. Before they arrived at these islands, later known as the Philippines, men were dying of starvation. While they were staying in the Philippines, Magellan was killed in a battle. The remaining officers then had to get back to Spain. They decided to sail round Africa. After many difficulties, one ship with eighteen men sailed into Seville three years after leaving. They were all that remained of Magellan's expedition. However, their achievement was great. They were the first men to sail round the world. The answer is:","output":"Which of the following statements is true about Ferdinand Magellan and his expedition in the 16th century?

Authorities charged former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez with first-degree murder on Wednesday, hours after police arrested him and the NFL team that once gave him a 40 million contract dropped him from its roster. Hernandez is accused in last week's shooting death of Odin Lloyd, whose body was found in an industrial park area less than a mile from Hernandez's home. Hernandez \\"drove the victim to the remote spot, and then he orchestrated his execution,\\" First Assistant District Attorney Bill McCauley said in court Wednesday. \\"He orchestrated the crime from the beginning, he took steps to conceal and destroy evidence, and he took steps to prevent the police from speaking to ... an important witness,\\" the prosecutor said. Both the NFL and OPTIONS: - Aaron Hernandez expressed sympathy for the victim's family. - Bill McCauley expressed sympathy for the victim's family. - Hernandez expressed sympathy for the victim's family. - NFL expressed sympathy for the victim's family. - New England Patriots expressed sympathy for the victim's family. - Odin Lloyd expressed sympathy for the victim's family.","output":"Both the NFL and the New England Patriots expressed sympathy for the victim's family. This tragic news came as a shock to the sporting community, and the loss of Odin Lloyd was deeply felt not only by his loved ones but also by his friends and associates. The NFL released a statement saying, \\"We extend our deepest condolences to the family and friends of Odin Lloyd. Our thoughts and prayers are with them during this difficult time.\\" This sentiment was further underscored by their decision to suspend Hernandez indefinitely, emphasizing the fact that the league upholds a strict moral and ethical code for all its players. In addition to the NFL, the New England Patriots also shared their heartfelt sympathies with the victim's family. As a key member of the team, the Patriots had previously supported Hernandez with a lucrative contract. However, the organization was left with no choice but to release him from the roster in response to the murder charges. Nevertheless, the team made it clear that they stand in solidarity with the grieving family and will offer any necessary assistance in their pursuit for justice. Both the NFL and the New England Patriots play a significant role in shaping the public image and reputation of their players. Their unequivocal support to Odin Lloyd's family underlines the importance of prioritizing human life and upholding the values of decency and morality. In spite of the challenges and controversies that may surround the Aaron Hernandez case, it is crucial for the sports industry and the wider society to remain committed to fairness, compassion, and a continued pursuit of justice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Australia Movie plot: The movie opens with information about World War II and its effect on Australia. It then transitions to the issue of Stolen Generations - the attempt of whites to take away aboriginal children and place them in missions to phase out the culture.Then the movie begins, with King George, an aboriginal medicine man/witch doctor showing Nullah how to do various things in the outback. KG shows him how to fish, and Nullah successfully catches one with a spear. However, behind them is a commotion and they see cattle being driven across the river. KG tells Nullah to become invisible (he hides underwater) and a man falls dead into the water, with blood swirling around him, and an arrowhead coming out of his chest. It seems KG might have done this because, Nullah tells the audience that KG does not like white men, and he was killed by an arrow.Nullah surfaces and a horse rears in the water. He sings to the horse and it comes over, calmly. He rides it back to where he lives, Faraway Downs. He jumps down off the horse after he sees a car coming down the road. He runs and hides in the water tower, afraid someone is going to come take him away (Stolen Generation).But its not people to take him away, but rather Drover (Hugh Jackman), Sarah (Nicole Kidman), Magarri, and another aborigine.Nullah, who has narrated some of the story, informs us that this story starts a while ago in another faraway place called England...

The War on Drugs has failed and there needs to be a new dialogue to decide on the course forward Come up with some evidence to support this claim.","output":"The assertion that the War on Drugs has failed and that there needs to be a new dialogue to decide on the course forward is backed by a significant amount of evidence. Several aspects of this evidence will be covered in this response, such as increased drug usage and addiction, the escalating cost of drug interdiction and incarceration, violations of human rights, perpetuation of drug-related violence and organized crime, and the negative public health effects. 1. Increased drug usage and addiction: The War on Drugs was launched to curtail drug use and addiction. However, statistics show that drug use has not decreased but increased globally. For instance, the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime estimated that in 2017, over 271 million people worldwide had used drugs, representing an increase of 30% since 2009. Similarly, drug addiction cases have not decreased but rather escalated, affecting millions of families and communities. 2. Escalating cost of drug interdiction and incarceration: The War on Drugs has led to significant financial investments in law enforcement, border control, and the criminal justice system. In the United States alone, it is estimated that over 1 trillion has been spent on the War on Drugs since its inception. This expenditure has not resulted in meaningful reductions in drug distribution or consumption, highlighting the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the current approach. 3. Violations of human rights: A crucial side effect of the War on Drugs has been the systematic violation of human rights. There have been numerous instances of extrajudicial killings, torture, and other abuses by law enforcement and military personnel in the pursuit of drug criminals. In countries like the Philippines, thousands of people have been killed in drug-related operations, often without due process or accountability. 4. Perpetuation of drug-related violence and organized crime: The War on Drugs has inadvertently led to the strengthening of drug cartels and other criminal organizations. As authorities crack down on drug production and distribution, cartels resort to more violent means to protect their business and territory. This results in increased violence, often with innocent civilians caught in the crossfire. For example, in Mexico, the drug war has led to tens of thousands of deaths and forced disappearances over the past decade. 5. Negative public health effects: The criminalization of drug use has driven people to consume drugs in unsafe environments and to use potentially contaminated substances. Furthermore, the stigma attached to drug use has deterred individuals from seeking help for drug addiction or from accessing harm reduction services, such as needle exchange programs. This has led to a rise in drug overdose deaths, the spread of infectious diseases like HIV and hepatitis C, and other negative health outcomes. These pieces of evidence call into question the effectiveness of the War on Drugs and show that a new dialogue is necessary to decide on a more efficient and humane course forward that focuses on harm reduction, prevention, and evidence-based drug policies. Potential alternatives include drug decriminalization, legalization and regulation of certain substances, increased funding for treatment programs, and adopting public health-centered policies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The Oklahoma player who participated in the 1951 Sugar Bowl and later won the Heisman Trophy is Billy Vessels. Billy Vessels, full name is William Abb Vessels, was an exceptional American football player, particularly known for his remarkable skills as a halfback. Born on March 22, 1931, in Cleveland, Oklahoma, Vessels became a key component in the University of Oklahoma's football team, the Oklahoma Sooners, during his college years. The 1951 Sugar Bowl was held on January 1, 1951, in Tulane Stadium, New Orleans, Louisiana. The game was played between the Oklahoma Sooners, representing the University of Oklahoma, and the Kentucky Wildcats, representing the University of Kentucky. Oklahoma's victory in the game, with a score of 13-7, was in part due to Billy Vessels' exceptional performance. In the 1952 college football season, Billy Vessels truly shined, leading the Sooners to an impressive 8-1-1 record under the guidance of legendary coach Bud Wilkinson. Vessels displayed his versatility on the field as he excelled in running, receiving, and even passing; his standout performance ultimately earned him the prestigious Heisman Trophy that year, becoming the first Oklahoma Sooner to ever win the award. During his college career, from 1950 to 1952, Vessels accumulated remarkable statistics, including 1,072 rushing yards, 17 rushing touchdowns, 1,318 yards passing, and 12 passing touchdowns, as well as a number of awards and accolades. After graduating from the University of Oklahoma in 1953, Vessels was drafted by the NFL's Baltimore Colts but chose to play for the Edmonton Eskimos in the Canadian Football League (CFL) for one season. In 1956, Vessels briefly played for the NFL's Baltimore Colts before then serving in the U.S. Army for two years. Following his discharge, Vessels chose to retire from professional football and embarked on a successful career in the oil and gas industry. On November 17, 2001, Vessels passed away at the age of 70 in Coral Gables, Florida. Billy Vessels' legacy lives on through various halls of fame, including being inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1974 and the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame in 1987. His outstanding performance during the 1951 Sugar Bowl, subsequent Heisman Trophy win, and numerous accomplishments both on and off the field have solidified his place as one of the greatest players in Oklahoma and college football history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Prince of Wales has revealed that his sons the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry have inherited an essential quality from their father - a love of dancing. Charles joked about his prowess on the dance floor and how William and Harry have picked up the skill during a wide-ranging interview with the magazine Australian Women's Weekly. The heir to the throne also spoke of his joy at the warm reception the Duchess of Cornwall received from Australians last year. The Prince of Wales, pictured here in a disco dancing session in Derby in 1992, claims that sons William and Harry inherited their dancing skills from him. Charles hit the Dance-O-Mat with Lisa Shannon during a visit to Christchurch, New Zealand last year, but says at his age he dances less. Prince Harry showed off his moves when he was invited to dance by Chantol Dormer, when he visited Rise Life, a youth charity project in Kingston, Jamaica last year. Charles and Camilla made their first official visit to the country as a couple last November, and the royal described his delight after wellwishers realised she was 'an incredibly good sort'. The royal was first interviewed by the magazine in 1974 when, aged 26, he declared, 'If I hear rhythmic music, I just want to get up and dance.' The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited Tuvalu and danced with the ladies at the Vaiku Falekaupule. Asked by the publication's deputy editor Juliet Rieden if he still felt the beat, Charles, who became a grandfather for the first time in July, repled: 'Perhaps, it's slightly less becoming once you get to my age.' He added: 'I think given half a chance though, the old one-two and the two-step can come in handy. I'm glad to say that both my sons have inherited it, I think. 'They're very good. They do make me laugh when they get going.' The Duke clearly amused his wife as he demonstrated his 'swagger' dance moves with Vanessa Boateng during a reception at Centrepoint's Camberwell Foyer in London in 2011. It is easy to see why Prince Harry makes his father laugh when he 'gets going' on the dance floor when you see him dancing with local women during a walkabout at a 'block party' in Belmopan, Belize, central America during the Diamond Jubilee world tour. Harry was spotted dancing numerous times during his Diamond Jubilee tour of the Caribbean last year - especially in Kingston when he visited a charity. And when Charles and Camilla travelled to New Zealand at the end of their Diamond Jubilee tour, they both strutted their stuff with different partners on a pop-up dancefloor in Christchurch. Asked if he was passing his wisdom on to William and Harry, Charles suggested his sons had learnt from him - but wanted to keep it a secret. Charles, seen here trying his hand at Latin dancing at a state banquet in 1999 in Buenos Aires, says even nowadays 'the old one-two and the two-step can come in handy' He said: 'Well, I don't know. I hope so. How do you know? You can try, but no, I've always believed I just do what I do and I hope that they might notice something. 'I mean, funnily enough, I don't see what they're up to when I'm not there, but sometimes I hear back from others that they're surprisingly similar in some ways (to me). So maybe some things rub off ... which they wouldn't want me to know.' Speaking about last year's Australian visit, which marked the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, the prince told the women's magazine: 'Before you go, you wonder what is the reaction going to be - it's always the same. But it was wonderful that they took to her and saw her for what she is - an incredibly good sort. The Prince and Princess of Wales dance together in 1985 at the Lady Mayoress's Committee Dance in Melbourne. Diana made a lasting impression on Australians during numerous visits. 'She loved it and has such incredibly happy memories of her experience and, obviously, I was thrilled, as you can imagine, for Australians to discover just how special she is ... because she's got the most wonderful sense of humour and has some very good jokes.' Charles' first wife Diana, Princess of Wales made a lasting impression on Australians during numerous visits and the Duchess appears to have also won the affections of many people in the country. The first stop for the royals during their tour was the remote outback settlement of Longreach and Camilla endeared herself to the locals by cuddling a 12-month-old kangaroo. The prince still has fond memories of his first visit to Australia, made in 1966 when he was aged 17. When the royal couple visited the outback settlement of Longreach and Camilla endeared herself to the locals by cuddling a 12-month-old kangaroo, called Ruby Blue. The royal spent two terms in the Australian outback at Timbertop, an off-shoot of Geelong Grammar School in Melbourne, on a private exchange from Gordonstoun. During the visit the prince said he plucked up the courage to really talk to the public and learnt to communicate with wellwishers. Speaking about the crowds that had come out to see him Charles said: 'Then, of course, finally, I took the plunge and went over and talked to people, and that suddenly unlocked a completely different feeling and I was then able to communicate and talk to people so much more.' While at Timbertop, 100 miles from Melbourne, the prince joined the other pupils who had to fend for themselves and complete expeditions into the surrounding hills. He said: 'There were leeches and snakes, and those enormous bull ants and funnel web spiders I've never forgotten. And then waking up in your tent and you're frozen stiff in the frost. 'I never imagined that would happen in that part of the world - or all these strange creepy crawlies wanting to do you mischief. But it was jolly good for the character and, in many ways, I loved it and I learnt a lot from it. And I certainly discovered what good value the Australians are.' Speaking about the issues that motivate him the royal said that we had created a 'throwaway society'. He stressed that nations had to look after the natural world: 'What I'm trying to say is there is another way of looking at this if we're going to hand over to our children and grandchildren a planet that isn't totally degraded and compromised. You can't push nature beyond a certain limit. We have to look after it.' Charles and Camilla made their first official visit to Australia as a couple last November, and the royal described his delight after wellwishers realised she was 'an incredibly good sort' Speaking about his views on balancing conventional medicine with complimentary treatments he said: 'I know lots of people who find they aren't benefited in every case by just the conventional, orthodox drug and finally discover that actually an approach - whether it's herbal medicine or acupuncture or various other forms of complementary medicine - actually does benefit them. 'There's a lot that can be done on the preventative side. There's an enormous amount we can do by looking at the whole person.' Charles also stressed that he wanted to see if some of his UK charities could link up with Australian counterparts to tackle issues. One project already off the ground will see the Prince's Foundation for Building Community develop the 'Prince's Australian Terrace' in Melbourne. The development will be an update to the popular Australian terraced house, combining 21st century Australian lifestyle demands with the technology of today which aims to create a sustainable and eco-friendly living solution.

I truly believe he made this character his own. Yes, sometimes the \\"monsters\\" are a bit cheesy and the plots, characters, and costumes are very much stuck in the 70's, but that's okay. It is a character tied to an era that tried to make the occult seem more real world like. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?

Armando Anthony \\"Chick\\" Corea (born June 12, 1941) is an American jazz pianist/electric keyboardist and composer. His compositions \\"Spain\\", \\"500 Miles High\\", \\"La Fiesta\\" and \\"Windows\\", are considered jazz standards. As a member of Miles Davis's band in the late 1960s, he participated in the birth of jazz fusion. In the 1970s he formed the fusion band Return to Forever. In the 1970s Corea started working with vibraphonist Gary Burton, with whom he recorded several duet albums for ECM, including 1972's Crystal Silence. They reunited in 2006 for a concert tour. A new record called The New Crystal Silence was issued in 2008 and won a Grammy Award in 2009. The package includes a disc of duets and another disc with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.  Toward the end of the 1970s, Corea embarked on a series of concerts and two albums with Hancock. These concerts were presented in elegant settings with both pianists dressed formally and performing on Yamaha concert grand pianos. The two traded playing each other's compositions, as well as pieces by other composers such as Bela Bartok. In 1982, Corea performed The Meeting, a live duet with the classical pianist Friedrich Gulda.  In December 2007 Corea recorded a duet album, The Enchantment, with banjoist Bela Fleck. Fleck and Corea toured extensively for the album in 2007. Fleck was nominated in the Best Instrumental Composition category at the 49th Grammy Awards for the track \\"Spectacle\\".  In 2008 Corea collaborated with Japanese pianist Hiromi Uehara on the live album Duet (Chick Corea and Hiromi). The duo played a concert at Tokyo's Budokan arena on April 30.  In 2015 Corea reprised the duet concert series with Hancock, again sticking to a dueling-piano format, though both also had synthesizers at their station. The first concert in this series was played at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle, and featured improvised music along with iconic songs from each of the duo and standards from other composers.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the names of the performers who were prevented from preforming songs they had submitted?, using the article: SVT selects performers for the entries. Artists who perform the demo of a song automatically enter the competition; they must perform their songs if suitable alternate performers cannot be found. The artists' songs risk disqualification if they refuse. In the past, this rule led to the disqualification of, among others, Carola's \\"När löven faller\\" in 2003 and Stephen Simmonds's \\"So Good\\" in 2006. SVT may also give songs to other performers without considering the interests of the demo artist. This prevented the Brandsta City Släckers (in 2004) and Pernilla Wahlgren (in 2005) from performing the songs they had submitted. Replacements for disqualified songs fare unpredictably at the competition. In 2006, \\"Naughty Boy\\" by Hannah Graaf (the replacement for Simmonds' song) finished second to last in its semi-final. In 2002 and 2007, by contrast, the replacements performed by Jan Johansen and Måns Zelmerlöw reached the final ten. The contestants that will perform the twenty-eight qualifiers from the preselection are announced in late November. Singer-songwriters are common. As such, artists often confirm that they will participate before the official announcement. The wildcard (joker) system was introduced in 2004 to diversify the music featured. Four artists, one in each semi-final, were invited by SVT to enter a song of their choice into the competition, provided it does not breach the rules. The wildcard songs and artists were announced in January. Since the wildcards' introduction, three have won the competition. In 2011 there were 15 wildcards.

Sex was used as an important element in the content and marketing the paper from the start, which Lamb believed was the most important part of his readers' lives. The first topless Page 3 model appeared on 17 November 1970, German-born Stephanie Rahn; she was tagged as a \\"Birthday Suit Girl\\" to mark the first anniversary of the relaunched Sun. A topless Page 3 model gradually became a regular fixture, and with increasingly risqué poses. Both feminists and many cultural conservatives saw the pictures as pornographic and misogynistic. Lamb expressed some regret at introducing the feature, although denied it was sexist. A Conservative council in Sowerby Bridge, Yorkshire, was the first to ban the paper from its public library, shortly after Page 3 began, because of its excessive sexual content.

Adam is a MBA student at Harvard University. He studies long hours, gets very little sleep and as a result, he drinks a lot of coffee---anywhere from five to six cups a day. Recently, Adam felt that drinking thus much coffee was making it hard for him to sleep at all. He also began having problems with his concentration , and complained of stomachaches. Adam's doctor made this suggestions: stop drinking coffee altogether. When Adam got up on October 3, he began his day without his morning coffee. By 11:00 a.m., Adam was in a terrible mood  . He was tired and had a headache. At 11:30, he had a meeting with his student advisor. In the meeting, he found it almost impossible to continue. What was going on? Caffeine, a chemical found in coffee, was most likely the reason for how Adam felt. Caffeine is a stimulant that boosts  energy levels and improves concentration- but only for a short time. Lowering caffeine consumption  often causes a drop in blood pressure and the result is a \\"coffee headache\\", People who stop drinking coffee often say they feel tired and moody, and find it hard to focus. The good news is that these feeling usually pass after four and five days. During this time, doctors suggested taking some aspirin for the headache. So, if Adam can wait, in less than a week, he may be feeling much better. The good news shows that  _  . A) Adam will be better if he stops drinking coffee.

Adam Harper, an MBA student at Harvard University, decided to stop drinking coffee as it was making it difficult for him to sleep, affecting his concentration, and causing stomachaches. His choice to quit coffee was based on his doctor's recommendation. On the first day without coffee, Adam experienced a terrible mood, fatigue, and a headache. He found it extremely challenging to focus during a meeting with his student advisor. These symptoms were likely a result of caffeine withdrawal. Caffeine is a stimulant found in coffee that temporarily boosts energy levels and improves concentration. However, when someone reduces or eliminates their caffeine intake, they may experience withdrawal symptoms such as a drop in blood pressure, headaches, fatigue, mood swings, and difficulty focusing.  The good news is that these withdrawal symptoms typically pass after four to five days. Doctors recommend taking aspirin to help alleviate headaches during this period. If Adam can endure the withdrawal symptoms, he will likely start feeling better in less than a week.

What is the answer: Dogberry is a constable in which play by William Shakespeare?","output":"Dogberry is a constable in the play \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" by William Shakespeare. This comedy, written in the late 16th century, is set in the town of Messina and follows the romantic entanglements, deceptions, and misunderstandings of its characters. The main plot focuses on the courtship and eventual marriage of Hero and Claudio, while a subplot revolves around the witty banter and growing affection between Benedick and Beatrice.  Dogberry, an amusing and bumbling character, leads a group of incompetent watchmen who play a pivotal role in resolving the central conflict of the story. As a constable, Dogberry is the head of the local police force and is responsible for preserving law and order in the community. Despite his high rank, he often confuses words and is mocked for his malapropisms throughout the play. He embodies the theme of appearance versus reality, which is also explored through the characters of Don John, the deceptive villain, and Borachio, his cunning accomplice. In \\"Much Ado About Nothing,\\" the villainous Don John creates a plot to cause discord and ruin the marriage of Hero and Claudio. He enlists the help of Borachio, who stages an act to convince Claudio and Don Pedro that Hero has been unfaithful the night before her wedding. The plan succeeds and leads to a dramatic public shaming of Hero during the wedding ceremony, who is believed to be dead due to extreme distress. In a serendipitous twist, Dogberry and his watchmen overhear Borachio boasting about his involvement in the scheme and arrest him. Although Dogberry's exaggerated sense of self-importance and inability to articulate the details of the crime delay the resolution, the truth eventually comes to light. In a dramatic turn of events, Claudio and Don Pedro learn of Hero's innocence, and Don John's deception is exposed. Dogberry's character adds comic relief to the play and serves as an amusing counterpoint to the more serious aspects of the story. His incompetence and persistence in seeking praise for his supposed skill in detecting crimes demonstrate the folly of vanity and the importance of humility. Through the actions of Dogberry and his watchmen, Shakespeare cleverly demonstrates the theme that even the most unlikely and seemingly insignificant characters can have a significant impact on the outcome of events. In conclusion, Dogberry is a constable in William Shakespeare's play \\"Much Ado About Nothing.\\" Serving as both comic foil and integral character in the unraveling of the main conflict, Dogberry highlights the themes of appearance versus reality, vanity, and humility while providing a humorous presence throughout the play."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Who is discovered by a priest?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The movie is set in 1985, in the fictional town of Quatssack, New Hampshire. Quatssack seems like a nice, ordinary town, but it harbors a dark and deadly secret: it is the home of the Children of the Yeti, an evil cult that worships a yeti that lives in the woods. The yeti was captured in the Himalayas and brought to the town as an old man′s sideshow, but had escaped, and is reportedly the last of its kind. Each night, Debra, one of its members, lures young men to the cult with the intention of offering it up to the yeti as a means of keeping it sexually sated. The movie opens up with such an example, with Debra and Raymond, the cult′s leader, looking on while laughing sadistically. Five college students—fraternity brothers Adam and Dick, their girlfriends Sally and Emily, and a fifth member named Joe—are coming to Quatssack on a camping trip, unaware of the town′s secrets. On their first night, Joe is killed while going to the bathroom in the woods, and since he was the one who had the car keys, the remaining four cannot leave town. The old man, who now owns a hideous-looking creature called \\"Tentacle Boy\\" and displays it as a sideshow, informs them of the yeti that he used to own now living somewhere in the woods. Emily goes into a nearby church to pray for Joe′s safety, and while she is in there, she is discovered by a priest as a \\"Chosen One\\" that was prophesied to take down the Children of the Yeti. She accepts her destiny, and the priest gives her supplies for her mission. Meanwhile, Adam, Dick, and Sally, who are waiting for Emily outside, are ambushed by a redneck demanding the whereabouts of the Chosen One. Emily emerges from the church and shoots the redneck with a crossbow, and despite his seemingly near-fatal wound, demands that the redneck take them to the cult′s location. Only Adam and Emily follow the redneck; Sally is sent back to their campsite, while Dick had left earlier, having met Debra.

Q:The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost. Why was there still a possibility of a shutdown? - the bill was approved for too much money - the senate still had to vote by the deadline - the senate still had to vote when they could make arrangements - not enough information A:","output":"The possibility of a government shutdown still existed at that time primarily due to the tight deadline the Senate had to vote on and approve the 1.3 trillion spending plan. They had until midnight Friday to make a decision and avoid the year's third government closure. Additionally, the Senate was trying to determine when they could arrange for the vote to take place.  Another factor that added to the uncertainty was the objection by Senator Rand Paul, who opposed the short amount of time given to members to read the lengthy legislation – which was nearly 2,200 pages long and released just hours before. Although a single senator cannot stop the vote entirely, their objection can cause delays; thus, heightening the risk of a brief government shutdown. Furthermore, the bill was a result of extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, and it is crucial for the Senate to carefully review the bill before approving it as it includes massive budget increases for the military, as well as funding for limited parts of President Trump's immigration agenda. The outcome of this vote had the potential to significantly impact the midterm elections in November, which could be another reason for the lingering possibility of a shutdown. Overall, the limited time available for the Senate to review, make arrangements to vote on the bill, and address objections contributed to the uncertainty surrounding the bill's approval and the risk of a government shutdown."},{"instruction":"Information:  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.

Write a title for this article: When AAP Rocky sat with director Dexter Navy to flesh out the visual conceit for the rapper’s song “LD,” he wanted it to be “trippy.” “Whenever a fellow emcee, or a rapper, or somebody puts out a music video that’s dope, I’m either hating or inspired,” Rocky told TIME. “I really enjoy good visuals.” And what better opportunity to experiment with imagery, than with a psychedelic, drug-induced love song about LSD? The music video borrows heavily from Gaspar Noé’s 2009 psychedelic fantasy film Enter the Void (which, if you ask Noé, also inspired Kanye West’s 2010 music video “All of the Lights”). “I watched that film,” said Rocky, “and at the end of the day, we wanted to do something that was inspired, that paid homage to it without taking from that storyline or that plot.” The Jim Jonsin-produced record is the third single from Rocky’s sophomore album, At. Long. Last. ASAP., which debuted at #1 on both the Billboard 200 and the R&B/Hip-Hop charts. This is his second consecutive #1 on the Billboard 200. The Harlem native is currently on a joint tour with Tyler the Creator with special guests Danny Brown and Vince Staples.

You are presented with the quiz \\"if an animal sweats it can cause\\"   But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"if an animal sweats then that animal 's bodily water decreases\\" and \\"dehydration is the loss of total body water\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? Answer:","output":"Based on the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the question \\"if an animal sweats it can cause\\" is dehydration. When an animal sweats, it is their body's natural response to dissipate heat and maintain a steady internal temperature. Sweat is primarily composed of water, and as the animal loses water content through sweating, it could potentially lead to a decrease in the overall bodily water. This reduction in water levels is referred to as dehydration. Dehydration occurs when the loss of total body water is greater than the water intake. For animals, this can lead to several consequences, including increased heart rate, decreased blood pressure, reduced concentration, and ultimately, detrimental effects on their overall health and well-being. In severe cases, dehydration can lead to organ failure and death, if not addressed promptly and appropriately. To avoid the risk of dehydration in animals, it is essential to ensure they have adequate access to clean water, particularly during periods of high ambient temperature or high activity levels. Additionally, monitoring the animal's behavior, such as seeking shade, panting excessively, or displaying other signs of discomfort, can be helpful in identifying the onset of dehydration and addressing it before it becomes a severe issue."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: (CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"In this case, the supposed perturbation would be directly impacting a step of the process. When a woman is older, it is possible that her uterus may not be as healthy as when she was younger. This can have various consequences on the process of conception, pregnancy, and childbirth. The primary way in which an older or unhealthy uterus might affect the number of babies being born is by impacting the step where the zygote implants into the uterus. For a healthy pregnancy to occur, the fertilized egg (zygote) must successfully implant itself into the uterine lining. If a woman's uterus is not in optimal health or has undergone changes with age, it may be more difficult for the zygote to properly implant. This can increase the risk of pregnancy complications, including miscarriage, or may result in infertility, making it difficult or impossible for the woman to get pregnant. As a result, fewer babies might be born as compared to a woman with a healthier uterus. Additionally, an older or unhealthy uterus can indirectly impact other steps in the process by leading to complications during pregnancy, such as gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, or placenta previa, among others. These complications can further affect the development and growth of the fetus and may lead to preterm birth or other adverse outcomes. In summary, the age and health of a woman's uterus can directly impact the step where a zygote implants into the uterus, leading to fewer babies born in such cases. Other complications arising from an older or unhealthy uterus can also indirectly affect various steps in the process, further contributing to the reduced number of babies being born."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I hope so, because this is a good one: I was 21 years old. I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under. Ever the professional, the waiter regained his composure and proceeded to take our orders without missing a beat - but I’m sure I was the talk of the kitchen for the rest of the evening.

As Milt and Linda start to settle down as a couple, she quickly realizes that he has an addiction to selling household items and junk for a quick buck, something that she is strongly against. She immediately dumps him, which leads to Milt to want Ellen back when he realizes how much he loves her for real. She admits that she doesn't really love Harry as much as she thought, as his bizarre day-to-day activities get to her. Milt and Ellen plot to get back together and convince Harry to divorce her but he loves her and sets out to prove it by getting a job as an elevator operator in a shopping mall.

The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs, or plays, or else they turn over the football to the opposing team; if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs.

QUEBEC CITY, CANADA — On the eve of the G-7 summit in Canada, the U.S. president lashed out at host Justin Trudeau and the White House announced Donald Trump would skip some of the sessions. In two tweets Thursday evening, Trump accused the Canadian prime minister, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron, of “charging the U.S. massive tariffs” and creating “non-monetary barriers.” Trump also said Trudeau was being “indignant” about the cross-border trade relationship. Later Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter again to urge the European Union and Canada to “Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!” Trump’s tweets came after Macron threatened to exclude the United States from the G-7 final statement to be issued in the mountainous tourism destination of Charlevoix. In his own tweets in French and English, Macron stated that while Trump “may not mind being isolated” the other six leaders meeting in Canada would also not mind signing an agreement among themselves. “American jobs are on the line because of his actions and because of his administration,” Trudeau said at a joint news conference with Macron earlier in the day in Ottawa. “When we can underscore this, and we see that there’s a lot of pressure within the U.S., perhaps he will revise his position.” “A trade war doesn’t spare anyone,” Macron said. “It will start to hurt American workers. The cost of raw materials will rise and industry will become less competitive.” After the contentious salvos on social media and the Trudeau-Macron news conference, the White House announced Trump would depart the summit at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, following the session on women’s empowerment. \\"The president will travel directly to Singapore from Canada in anticipation of his upcoming meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un Tuesday.

With the players union and owners one day into a lockout, the league can't profit from images of its stars, explains Gizmodo. NBA.com now features images only of retired players, and the league can't even contact active players without incurring a 1 million fine. Suddenly everyone involved in the NFL lockout looks like big softies. Expand this summary.","output":"The NBA has entered a digital ghost town as all photos of current players have been removed from its official website. This move comes in the wake of a lockout between the players union and the team owners, as disputes over contracts and player salaries escalate. With the lockout now in full effect, the league is no longer allowed to make money from its star athletes and their images. This has led to a drastic measure where NBA.com had to replace all current player images with those of retired legends. According to Gizmodo, any contact made with active players could result in an eye-watering 1 million fine. This massive penalty highlights the severity of the ongoing dispute between the players and the league. In comparison, the NFL lockout appears much less intense, as they have not resorted to such extreme measures. The two sides in the NFL situation seem more like gentle negotiators, whereas the animosity between the NBA players and owners is reminiscent of a scorned ex-lover erasing all memories of a failed relationship. The current state of NBA.com and its lack of active player photos serves as a stark reminder of the difficult times that the basketball world is experiencing. The website now displays only images of iconic retired players, lacking the presence and excitement of today's biggest stars. Fans hope that the ongoing negotiations between the players union and team owners reach a speedy and amicable resolution, allowing the league to reclaim its vibrant online presence, and for the love of the game to return both on and off the court."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

En tant qu'employé, une personne travaille généralement pour une entreprise ou un employeur spécifique et reçoit un salaire, important pour savoir si un travailleur est un salarié ou un travailleur indépendant. En France, les employés sont soumis à un certain nombre de protections légales et de conditions de travail, telles que le droit au salaire minimum, à des heures supplémentaires, aux congés payés, aux congés de maternité et de paternité, et aux indemnités de licenciement. Les employés sont également couverts par la sécurité sociale, ce qui inclut l'assurance maladie, la retraite, l'assurance-chômage et autres.

En outre, les employés bénéficient de la protection des lois relatives au travail, telles que la régulation des conditions de travail, des horaires et de la santé et sécurité sur le lieu de travail. D'autre part, un travailleur indépendant est une personne qui exerce une activité économique à son compte, en fournissant des services ou en vendant des produits de manière autonome, sans être lié à un employeur ou une entreprise spécifique. Les travailleurs indépendants sont généralement responsables de leurs propres taxes et charges sociales, ce qui signifie qu'ils doivent assumer la responsabilité de déclarer leurs revenus et de payer les cotisations nécessaires. Les travailleurs indépendants n'ont pas droit aux mêmes protections et avantages que les employés, tels que le salaire minimum, les congés payés, la sécurité de l'emploi et autres avantages sociaux. Cependant, ils bénéficient d'une certaine flexibilité dans leur travail, la possibilité de choisir leurs clients et projets, et la liberté d'organiser leur horaire comme bon leur semble. En somme, il est important de déterminer si un travailleur est un employé ou un travailleur indépendant pour une variété de raisons, notamment les responsabilités et obligations légales et fiscales, les droits et protections, ainsi que les avantages sociaux.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The 50 or so crossings of the Willamette River include many historic structures, such as the Van Buren Street Bridge, a swing bridge. Built in 1913, it carries Oregon Route 34 (Corvallis–Lebanon Highway) over the river upstream of RM 131 (RK 211) in Corvallis. The machinery to operate the swing span was removed in the 1950s. The Oregon City Bridge, built in 1922, replaced a suspension span constructed at the site in 1888. It carries Oregon Route 43 over the river at about RM 26 (RK 42) between Oregon City and West Linn.The Ross Island Bridge carries U.S. Route 26 (Mount Hood Highway) over the river at RM 14 (RK 23). It is one of 10 highway bridges crossing the river in Portland. The 3,700-foot (1,100 m) bridge is the only cantilevered deck truss in Oregon. Tilikum Crossing is a 1,720-foot (520 m) cable-stayed bridge that carries public transit, bicycles, and pedestrians, but no cars or trucks, over the river. It opened for general use on September 12, 2015, becoming the first new bridge built across the river in the Portland metropolitan area since 1973.Further downstream is the oldest remaining highway structure over the Willamette, the Hawthorne Bridge, built in 1910. It is the oldest vertical-lift bridge in operation in the United States and the oldest highway bridge in Portland.  It is also the busiest bicycle and transit bridge in Oregon, with over 8,000 cyclists and 800 TriMet buses (carrying about 17,400 riders) daily. Another historic structure, the Steel Bridge, further downstream, was \\"the largest telescoping bridge in the world at the time of its opening\\" in 1912. It carries trains on its lower deck, MAX (Metropolitan Area Express) light-rail trains and motorized vehicles on its upper deck, and foot and bicycle traffic on a cantilevered walkway attached to the lower deck. When small ships must pass under the bridge, its double vertical-lift span can raise a lower railway deck without disturbing traffic on the upper deck.

That is the question from the White House in Washington to the Blue House in Seoul — and perhaps also inside the Ryongsong Residence in Pyongyang. Following the historic handshake here between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader, who inked their names to a document with vague but compelling promises, the question emanating from Sentosa's Capella Hotel was what will actually change on the Korean peninsula? Moments after the summit between Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un concluded, VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren and I spent a few minutes with the U.S. president and his secretary of state, at the Capella. Trump was elated and within the hour would make a surprising announcement suspending \\"provocative\\" joint U.S.-South Korean drills on the Korean peninsula. \\"We had a great chemistry,\\" the president, speaking to Van Susteren, said of himself and Kim. \\"We will do business.\\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told us, \\"it's a great day.\\" The president has essentially handed off to Pompeo the hard work of turning a sparse declaration on denuclearization into something truly transformative. Many will question whether Pompeo, who a decade ago was running an oilfield equipment company, is truly the man for the task. In Pompeo's background, however, are indications of his capabilities: First in his class at the U.S. Military Academy, time served on the House of Representative's intelligence committee, a brief stint as director of the Central Intelligence Agency and two meetings with Kim in Pyongyang. Perhaps he is now as astute as any American official on piecing together the Pyongyang puzzle. This correspondent — an observer of the Korean peninsula over five decades, resident in Seoul for several years and once given the opportunity to frankly converse for a week (in 2013) in the North with KPA officers — has gleaned some insight into the world's most reclusive state. Rarely can any collection of a few hundred words adequately encapsulate the geo-political conundrum. It is... What are Kim Jong Un's motivations in meeting with Trump? - He admires Trump and is genuinely willing to cut back or eliminate his nuclear program in return for a lifting of sanctions - He wants to appear as a competent statesman before the world and his subjects - not enough information - He plans to take advantage of Trump's political naivete to deceive him A:","output":"Kim Jong Un's motivations in meeting with Donald Trump may be driven by a combination of factors. Let's delve into these motivations one by one: 1. He admires Trump and is genuinely willing to cut back or eliminate his nuclear program in return for a lifting of sanctions: It is possible that Kim Jong Un may have seen this historic meeting as an opportunity to negotiate the relaxation or removal of economic sanctions that have heavily impacted North Korea's economy. By expressing his willingness to denuclearize, Kim aims to ease the pressure on his country's resources and improve its financial stability. 2. He wants to appear as a competent statesman before the world and his subjects: Engaging in a high-profile meeting with the President of the United States is a strategic move for Kim Jong Un to showcase his leadership skills and diplomatic acumen. By doing so, he can bolster his image both domestically and on the international stage, projecting strength and legitimacy in the eyes of his people and the world. 3. Not enough information: While we can speculate on Kim Jong Un's motivations, it is challenging to definitively determine his thought process and intentions, given the secretive nature of the North Korean regime. North Korea has a history of building its nuclear program covertly and not adhering to agreements, so it's essential to approach any diplomatic negotiations with caution. 4. He plans to take advantage of Trump's political naiveté to deceive him: This theory suggests that Kim Jong Un's motivation was to take advantage of perceived inexperience or naïveté on the part of President Trump in order to gain concessions or benefits without truly committing to denuclearization. This could involve extracting financial aid or political recognition while continuing to develop nuclear capabilities secretly. If this were the case, it would be a strategic move by Kim in furthering his own political and national interests. In summary, Kim Jong Un's motivations in meeting with President Trump could stem from his desire for economic relief in the form of sanctions being lifted, his effort to appear as a competent statesman to enhance his domestic and international image, the inherent difficulty in deducing intentions due to the secretive nature of the North Korean regime, and the possibility of exploiting any perceived weaknesses in Trump's negotiation style to extract benefits without genuinely committing to denuclearization. Understanding these motivations can help contextualize future diplomatic engagements and aid in the pursuit of denuclearization and lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mapleson thought her \\"one of the most charming vocalists it has been my pleasure to know\\"?, using the article: The search for a singer-actress to play Carmen began in the summer of 1873. Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.The leading tenor part of Don José was given to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro. Marguerite Chapuy, who sang Micaëla, was at the beginning of a short career in which she was briefly a star at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; the impresario James H.

If the soil holding the plant is healthy and biologically diverse, the plant will have a higher chance of surviving stressful conditions.The plant responses to stress are dependent on the tissue or organ affected by the stress. For example, transcriptional responses to stress are tissue or cell specific in roots and are quite different depending on the stress involved.One of the primary responses to abiotic stress such as high salinity is the disruption of the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cell. High concentrations of Na+, for example, can decrease the capacity for the plant to take up water and also alter enzyme and transporter functions. Evolved adaptations to efficiently restore cellular ion homeostasis has led to a wide variety of stress tolerant plants.Facilitation, or the positive interactions between different species of plants, is an intricate web of association in a natural environment. It is how plants work together. In areas of high stress, the level of facilitation is especially high as well. This could possibly be because the plants need a stronger network to survive in a harsher environment, so their interactions between species, such as cross-pollination or mutualistic actions, become more common to cope with the severity of their habitat.Plants also adapt very differently from one another, even from a plant living in the same area. When a group of different plant species was prompted by a variety of different stress signals, such as drought or cold, each plant responded uniquely. Hardly any of the responses were similar, even though the plants had become accustomed to exactly the same home environment.Rice (Oryza sativa) is a classic example. Rice is a staple food throughout the world, especially in China and India. Rice plants experience different types of abiotic stresses, like drought and high salinity. These stress conditions have a negative impact on rice production. Genetic diversity has been studied...

Q: In this task you need to give reasons to justify the pronoun coreference relations. Each of the provided inputs contains a sentence with a target pronoun and a question about how to justify the coreference between a noun phrase and the target pronoun. Good practices involve the discussion about how the descriptions attached to the targeted pronoun relate to the noun phrase candidate in the question. The reasoning could come from one or multiple following knowledge types about commonsense: First: 'Property', the knowledge about property of objects (e.g., ice is cold). Second: 'Object', the knowledge about objects (e.g., cats have ears). Third: 'Eventuality', the knowledge about eventuality (e.g., 'wake up' happens before 'open eyes'). Forth: 'Spatial', the knowledge about spatial position (e.g., object at the back can be blocked). Fifth: 'Quantity', the knowledge about numbers (e.g., 2 is smaller than 10). Sixth: all other knowledge if above ones are not suitable. Write the sentence in natural language. Sentence: Bob collapsed on the sidewalk. Soon he saw Carl coming to help. He was very concerned.  Question: Why does the 'He' refer to carl? A:","output":"The 'He' in the sentence refers to Carl because of the eventuality knowledge. In the given sentence, the eventuality of 'Bob collapsing on the sidewalk' and then 'seeing Carl coming to help' implies that Bob is in a weakened state, and it would be more logical for Carl to exhibit concern in this situation.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In 1931 Berlin, young American Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) performs at the Kit Kat Klub. A new British arrival in the city, Brian Roberts (Michael York), moves into the boarding house where Sally lives. A reserved academic and writer, Brian gives English lessons to earn a living while completing his doctorate. Sally tries seducing Brian and suspects he may be gay. Brian tells Sally that on three previous occasions he has tried to have physical relationships with women, all of which failed. They become friends, and Brian witnesses Sally's anarchic, bohemian life in the last days of the German Weimar Republic. Sally and Brian become lovers despite their earlier reservations; they conclude that his previous failures with women were because they were \\"the wrong three girls\\". Sally befriends Maximilian von Heune, a rich playboy baron who takes her and Brian to his country estate; it becomes ambiguous which of the duo Max is seducing. After a sexual experience with Brian, Max loses interest in the two and departs for Argentina. During an argument, when Sally tells Brian that she has been having sex with Max, Brian reveals that he has as well. Brian and Sally later reconcile, and Sally reveals that Max left them money and mockingly compares the sum with what a professional prostitute gets. Sally learns that she is pregnant, but is unsure of the father. Brian offers to marry her and take her back to his university life in Cambridge. At first they celebrate their resolution to start this new life together, but after a picnic between Sally and Brian in which Brian acts distant and uninterested, Sally starts to doubt continuing with the pregnancy, and is disheartened by the vision of herself as a bored faculty wife washing dirty diapers. Ultimately she has an abortion, without informing Brian in advance. When he confronts her, she shares her fears and the two reach an understanding. Brian departs for England and Sally continues her life in Berlin, embedding herself in the Kit Kat Club, but the final shot shows men in...

Who played 'Edward Beddoes', the victim's valet in the 1974 film 'Murder On The Orient Express'????","output":"In the 1974 film adaptation of Agatha Christie's renowned detective novel, 'Murder On The Orient Express', the character of Edward Beddoes, the valet of the victim, Samuel Ratchett, played by actor Richard Widmark, is played by English-born actor and comedian John Gielgud. Sir Arthur John Gielgud (1904-2000) was widely acknowledged as one of the most talented and versatile actors of his time. Over a career spanning more than eight decades, Gielgud appeared in a diverse array of stage, film, and television productions, earning him numerous accolades including Academy, BAFTA, Tony, and Golden Globe Awards. In 'Murder On The Orient Express', Gielgud's portrayal of the fastidious, discreet, but loyal Beddoes added depth to the character, providing a human connection to the otherwise-cold and calculated Ratchett - a man whose eventual murder drives the film's intricate and twisting narrative. Directed by Sidney Lumet, the star-studded ensemble cast included Albert Finney as Hercule Poirot, the Belgian detective investigating the crime, alongside a host of distinguished actors like Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connery, and Vanessa Redgrave. The film itself, with its rich storytelling, sumptuous period settings, and intricate revelations, quickly became a classic and remains one of the most beloved adaptations of Christie's work to date. Gielgud's performance as Edward Beddoes contributed significantly to the ensemble's dynamism, helping to cement 'Murder On The Orient Express' as a must-see for fans of mystery and suspense."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

At the age of 30, aware of the desperate medical needs of Africans, he decided to become a doctor and devote the rest of his life to direct service in Africa. In 1913, at the age of 38, Dr.Schweitzer and his wife, Helene, opened a hospital in Lambarene, Gabon- then a province of French Equatorial Africa.Not even serious setbacks of World War I, part of which he and Helene spent as prisoners of war in France,  _ him from continuing commitment to his job. In 1915,troubled daily by the vast numbers of suffering patients coming to his hospital for help, he experienced as a revelation the idea of \\"Reverence  for Life\\" as the elementary and universal principle of ethics that he had been seeking for so long. By stressing the interdependence and unity of all life, he was a forerunner of the environmental and animal welfare movements - Rachel Carson dedicated Silent Spring to him. In 1952, at the age of 77, Schweitzer was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. During the last twelve years of his life, his speeches and writings emphasized the dangers of atmospheric nuclear test explosions and the suicidal nuclear arms race between the superpowers.  After retiring as a practicing doctor, Albert Schweitzer continued to oversee the hospital until his death at the age of 90. To the end, his one frustration was that he had not succeeded in convincing the world to abolish nuclear weapons. He and his wife are buried on the Hospital grounds in Lambarene.

We have the equation: -252 * y = -618 - 390 First, we need to add 618 and 390: -618 + 390 = -228 Now the equation looks like this: -252 * y = -228 To solve for y, we need to get y alone on one side of the equation. To do that, we will divide both sides of the equation by -252: (-252 * y) / -252 = -228 / -252 Now, when we divide, the -252 on the left side of the equation cancels out, leaving us with just: y = -228 / -252 Now, let's do the division: y = 228 / 252 At this point, we can simplify the fraction (228/252) by dividing the numerator (top number) and the denominator (bottom number) by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 228 and 252 is 12. So we'll divide both numbers by 12: 228 ÷ 12 = 19 252 ÷ 12 = 21 So the simplified fraction is: y = 19 / 21 And that's our answer! y is equal to 19/21 or approximately 0.9048."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:It could have triggered a rapid phase of global warming linked to the expansion of mammal groups during the Eocene time period. Writing in the journal Science, a team of American researchers outlines new evidence for the theory. They found spherical fragments of glass thought to form when molten debris flung out by an impact solidifies in mid-air. But the team's interpretation remains controversial with other experts. Space impacts have had profound effects on Earth's ecosystems. For example, an asteroid which slammed into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula 66 million years ago was responsible for wiping out the dinosaurs. Dennis Kent, from Rutgers University, a co-author of the new study, thinks the glass found in sediment cores drilled along the New Jersey coast could have come from a 10km-wide comet slamming into the Atlantic Ocean. This could be behind the mysterious release of CO2, and other greenhouse gases, which warmed the planet very rapidly 55.6 million years ago. During this event, global temperatures rose by about 6C in less than 1,000 years. \\"It got warm in a hurry. This suggests where it came from,\\" said Prof Kent. The warm period, known as the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), is often compared to today's rapid human-induced climate change. It is recorded as an injection of an \\"isotopically light\\" form of the element carbon into the Earth's system. This spike in temperature closely coincides with the dispersal of mammal groups to new parts of the world, and their diversification into three groups that are still with us today. These are the Artiodactyla, the Perissodactyla and the Primates - the mammalian order that includes humans. Modern Artiodactyls include sheep, pigs, camels and giraffes, while today's Perissodactyls include horses, tapirs, rhinos and zebras. The drivers behind this rapid phase of mammal evolution are not completely understood. But the planet became essentially ice-free during the PETM, with sea levels that were dramatically higher than now. Many small, single-celled ocean-bottom creatures became extinct. But on land, the mammals adapted by moving their ranges towards the poles, which would have opened up new opportunities for them. Mainstream theories suggest the global warming phase, which lasted about 200,000 years, was caused by sources closer to home - such as volcanism. But the authors of the Science study identified an interesting mineral within the glassy spherules known as microtektites. This mineral, called lechatelierite, \\"forms at really high temperatures - about 1,700C\\", said Prof Kent. The presence of this mineral is hard to explain without a highly energetic event such as an impact. Volcanic magma, for example, has much lower temperatures. A second line of evidence comes from the discovery of grains of shocked quartz in one of the spherules. These \\"shocked grains\\" occur when the mineral quartz is knocked out of shape under the kind of intense pressure produced by a cosmic collision. But pressures in a volcano are not sufficient to produce these grains. But Prof Christian Koeberl, an impact specialist at the University of Vienna who was not involved with the study, noted that the identification of shocked quartz had been made using a technique known as Raman spectrometry. He told the BBC News website: \\"This is not a standard method to identify shocked quartz, so maybe it is, maybe not.\\" Dennis Kent first floated the comet idea in a 2003 study published in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters. He based his argument on magnetised clay particles found in New Jersey that he said could have been altered by space impact. However, many colleagues were unconvinced by his hypothesis. The discovery of the glassy spherules, reported in Science, provides additional evidence favouring the comet theory, according to Prof Kent. \\"The glassy spherules don't demand a comet, rather than an asteroid, but the idea is attractive because of the increase in isotopically light carbon which acts as a greenhouse gas,\\" he told the BBC News website. \\"About a fifth of comets by mass is carbon... there are also indications from spectral analyses of comets in the Solar System that this carbon tends to be on the isotopically light side.\\" The dinosaur-killing impact 66 million years ago - almost certainly caused by an asteroid - left a pronounced layer of the element iridium in rocks far from the crater site. Iridium is rare on Earth but common in asteroids. However, the impact of a comet - with less rock and more ice than an asteroid - could explain why scientists have not found a significant iridium layer at the Palaeocene-Eocene boundary. In addition, \\"comets come from the outer reaches of the Solar System, so their impact velocity is something like three times faster than an asteroid's\\", said Prof Kent. This high speed impact may act to dilute the iridium present in the space object. And an impact into the ocean may explain why no crater has yet been discovered. Prof Koeberl told the BBC News website that the spherule evidence \\"indicates that an impact event may have occurred at that time - but only if the spherules are really unambiguously of [Palaeocene-Eocene] age. \\"The information given so far is not conclusive on this point - it is not impossible that the spherules are derived from another stratigraphic layer (I hope contamination can be excluded, which is not uncommon either - spherules have been found in many strange locations). So age dating would be helpful.\\" He added: \\"What I am also noting is that the spherules are very small and very rare... this indicates either a far-away source (but the limited size range is still unusual) or a rather small impact event. \\"Both options do not indicate a major influence on the Earth's climate. Even much larger events... have had no severe or discernible influence on the climate. In this respect I think any suggestion that an impact event caused the PETM is not supported by the data.\\" Follow Paul on Twitter.

Walcott stabbed home with the outside of his boot after a delightful pass by 17-year-old Jeff Reine-Adelaide. Wolfsburg's Josuha Guilavogui had a 25-yard drive pushed away by Cech, a £10m signing from Chelsea. Cech has now helped Arsenal win two pre-season trophies in two games, and Arsene Wenger's side can make it a hat-trick of success ahead of the Premier League campaign if they defeat Chelsea next weekend. Wenger made 10 changes to the side that started the 6-0 victory over Lyon, Mesut Ozil the only survivor from Saturday's match. Cech, 33, was making his home debut and looked comfortable throughout against the German Cup winners. Yet it was 17-year-old winger Reine-Adelaide who caught the eye, just as he did against Lyon. Wenger had said the teenager is \\"something special\\" after he had made his senior debut the previous day. Reine-Adelaide produced a quality slide-rule pass for Walcott to finish coolly to put Arsenal ahead in the 50th minute. Wolfsburg, who finished second in the Bundesliga last season, had several former Premier League players on show, including ex-Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner. Former Chelsea midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, after his side had fallen behind, fired high and wide when he should have done better, with Ricardo Rodriguez stinging the palms of Cech on the hour mark. De Bruyne has been heavily linked with a move to Manchester City this summer but failed to impress. Wenger introduced a number of substitutes including Aaron Ramsey and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, but it was 19-year-old forward Chuba Akpom who forced a save as Arsenal looked to kill the game off. FA Cup winners Arsenal now face Premier League champions Chelsea in the traditional season-opener at Wembley next Sunday. Arsenal: Cech, Chambers, Bellerin, Monreal, Gabriel, Ozil (Akpom, 46), Cazorla, Wilshere (Hayden, 76), Reine-Adelaide (Oxlade-Chamberlain, 64), Arteta (Ramsey, 63), Walcott (Giroud, 75). Substitutes not used: Martinez, Koscielny, Debuchy, Mertesacker, Coquelin, Iwobi. Wolfsburg: Benaglio, Naldo, Trasch (Arnold, 71 mins), Jung, Klose, Rodriguez, Vieirinha (Caligiuri, 46), Guilavogui (Seguin, 80 mins), De Bruyne (Kruse, 61), Schurrle, Bendtner (Rodriguez, 79).

SMITH DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER Tuesday, May 15th 2001, 2:21AM ATLANTA - Strip joint owner Steven Kaplan charged yesterday that the government targeted him in a mob-racketeering investigation because he is a \\"New York Jew\\" who made millions with his high-profile Gold Club. Kaplan's side of the story took center stage as prosecutors and defense lawyers presented opening arguments in what is expected to be a three-month trial and may include testimony from at least several professional athletes. He is charged with running a prostitution ring to attract pro sports stars to his club, which prosecutors say was controlled by the Gambino crime family. His lawyer, Steven Sadow, charged for the first time that Kaplan was \\"targeted by the government because there are motives and stakes here\\" that he likened to anti-Semitism. \\"In 1996, the government's motives became clear. I'm Jewish, so I can say this: Steve Kaplan is a New York Jew. He in some ways epitomizes the stereotype of the New York Jew. He is outspoken, he says what he thinks and he is enormously successful,\\" Sadow said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Arthur Leach took a different view, repeatedly mentioning the name of John A. (Junior) Gotti, who allegedly runs the Gambino family for his jailed father, John (Dapper Don) Gotti. Leach has brought the younger Gotti to Atlanta to testify, but Junior is refusing to cooperate. In his opening remarks for the prosecution, Leach alleged that the Gold Club aggressively fleeced customers of their earnings, deliberately running up bills until their credit cards were maxed out. He described one \\"extremely intoxicated\\" customer who was hit with a 24,000 bill for one night. The prosecutor said that when Knicks star Larry Johnson came to the club several years ago \\"and wanted a woman,\\" he was denied. But the request \\"inspired\\" Kaplan to change his policy, Leach said, and use strippers as prostitutes to attract big-name sports stars. Leach for the first time named names, saying ex-Knick Patrick Ewing, now of the Seattle Supersonics; Terrell Davis of the Denver Broncos, and Jamal Anderson of the Atlanta Falcons will be called as witnesses. Leach said the defendant liked hanging out center court. \\"Mr. Kaplan reveled in the glow of their celebrity,\\" Leach said. Defense lawyers hinted that they may call ex-Knick John Starks, now with the Utah Jazz, to testify that a Gold Club manager, now a government informant, regularly arranged for prostitute strippers for pro athletes without the club's knowledge. And they noted that during the 1996 Olympics, held in Atlanta, King Carl Gustaf of Sweden partied inside one of the elite \\"gold rooms\\" with several dancers while Secret Service agents guarded the door. Leach said that other activities took place in those rooms, vowing to present dozens of strippers who will say that Kaplan was aware of rampant prostitution inside the club and even sat in and observed some of the activity. Defense lawyers questioned the strippers' credibility and attacked a handful of Mafia associates who will testify for the prosecution. Sadow spent much time cataloguing the misdeeds of several government informants, some of whom have admitted to participating in brutal torture murders and near-death beatings. \\"They have recruited every scoundrel . . . every criminal they could possibly find and offered them money and their freedom,\\" Sadow said.","output":"\\"New York Strip Club Owner Says He Was Targeted for Being a 'New York Jew' in Mob-Linked Trial\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: 1896 | ‘Without Fear or Favor’ Political madness has surely gripped the nation when a Fox News journalist publicly embraces a 119-year-old guiding principle of The New York Times, as Megyn Kelly did this week by vowing — Donald Trump’s taunts notwithstanding — to “continue doing my job without fear or favor.” Consciously or not, Ms. Kelly borrowed from one of the most venerable playbooks in the field: the modestly titled “Business Announcement” written by Adolph S. Ochs on April 18, 1896, after he had assumed control of The Times, and published on Page 4, the editorial page, the next morning: “It will be my earnest aim that THE NEW-YORK TIMES give the news, all the news, in concise and attractive form, in language that is parliamentary in good society, and give it as early, if not earlier, than it can be learned through any other reliable medium; to give the news impartially, without fear or favor, regardless of party, sect, or interests involved; to make the columns of THE NEW-YORK TIMES a forum for the consideration of all questions of public importance, and to that end to invite intelligent discussion from all shades of opinion.” Though the phrase “without fear or favor” is far older, the words in this context were the publisher’s, wrote Susan E. Tifft and Alex S. Jones in “The Trust: The Private and Powerful Family Behind The New York Times.” The announcement borrowed heavily from a speech Mr. Ochs had delivered five years earlier in St. Paul, Minn., on how to manage a country newspaper. Mr. Ochs went on in his announcement to note that the editorial page, far from being impartial, would vigorously champion causes like the “lowest tax consistent with good government.” When The Times set out in 1933 to enshrine the credo in the lobby of its headquarters at 229 West 43rd Street — as a kind of cloud of Roman type above a bust of the publisher by Vincenzo Miserendino — it misquoted Mr. Ochs’s announcement. Twice. “To give the news impartially, without fear or favor, regardless of any party, sect, or interest involved.” Mr. Ochs had not used the word “any.” And he had rendered “interest” in the plural. Though the typos could have been easily fixed when the bust was moved to another part of the lobby during a modernization in 1971, the error was perpetuated. The bust came with us to 620 Eighth Avenue and stands in the 40th Street side of the lobby. There is no inscription above it any longer. But we still try to abide by Mr. Ochs’s principles. As, apparently, does Ms. Kelly. David W. Dunlap is a Metro reporter and writes the Building Blocks column. He has worked at The Times for 40 years. Summary:","output":"The article highlights the moment when Fox News journalist Megyn Kelly publicly embraces the 119-year-old guiding principle of The New York Times, which was written by Adolph S. Ochs in 1896. The principle emphasizes providing news impartially, \\"without fear or favor,\\" regardless of party, sect, or interests involved, and invites intelligent discussion from all shades of opinion on public importance matters. Megyn Kelly's commitment to this principle showcases its relevance and significance for journalism even after a century."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

When using a smaller vessel, the surface area in contact with the heat source is smaller, but the water's volume in the vessel decreases as well. As a result, less water needs to be heated, requiring less time and energy to reach boiling point. This modification directly impacts the steps of the process where you wait for the water to heat up and start to observe bubbles, as well as when the water begins to bubble a lot.

However, to provide a detailed analysis of the sentiment and the various factors contributing to it, we will break down the sentence and examine the key components. First, let us identify the subject of the sentence - a film. Though the specific film is not clearly mentioned, this sentence can be applicable to any film that is being discussed or reviewed. As a result, it allows the reader to focus on the sentiment rather than getting distracted by a specific film title. The main component of the sentiment in this sentence is centered around the word \\"undeniable.\\" \\"Undeniable\\" means something that is undoubtedly true or too strong to be denied. It conveys a strong sense of certainty, and when applied to a positive attribute such as talent, it amplifies the positive tone of the sentence.  When the phrase \\"the talent is undeniable\\" is applied to a film, it suggests that the abilities of the individuals involved - from the actors and the director to the production team and the screenplay writers - can be easily recognized and appreciated. This implies that the film showcases notable skills, outstanding performances, or exceptional creativity in different aspects related to filmmaking, such as acting, storytelling, cinematography, or visual effects. This assessment, therefore, reflects a sense of admiration and acknowledgement of the efforts put into creating the film. Moreover, the use of the word \\"talent\\" in the sentence establishes a connection with the reader, who likely appreciates talent in films and values the qualities that make a film stand out from the rest. This shared appreciation and recognition of talent create a positive atmosphere, where the reader tends to agree with the sentiment and can even increase their interest in the film being discussed. In summary, the sentiment of the sentence \\"is a film in which the talent is undeniable\\" is primarily perceived as positive, praising, and complimentary, owing to the use of the word \\"undeniable\\" to emphasize the high level of talent showcased in the film. The sentence conveys a strong sense of admiration and appreciation for the work of the individuals involved in the film and creates a connection with the reader by highlighting the shared value of talent in the context of cinema."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.  Question: \\"This famous explorer , after reaching China's capital city reported that the Chinese used what color rocks to make fire?\\" Answer: \\"Peking man said the chinese used coal to make fire\\" Is this answer correct? OPTIONS: (i). no. (ii). yes....I think the answer is","output":"(i). no. The correct answer is that Marco Polo reported the Chinese used black stones to make fire, which is what we know as coal today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article:Media playback is not supported on this device Many have tried and all have failed. Few have failed by such a miniscule distance as Mickelson. Everybody thought that putt on Troon's 18th green was in. Everybody thought they were in on an 'I was there' moment. Mickelson thought he had done what the golfing immortals could never do. Sixty-two. The magic - and still elusive - number. He was smiling but he was hurting. Four birdies on the front nine, four on the back nine and a cigarette paper away from a fifth - and a record that would surely have lasted the ages. \\"It's obvious why nobody has ever shot 62 in a major,\\" he said. \\"There's a curse, because that ball should have been in. If there wasn't a curse that ball would have been in and I would have had a 62. I didn't believe (in the golf Gods) but I do now. \\"That putt on 18 was a chance to do something historical. I knew it and with a foot to go I thought I had done it. I saw that ball rolling right in the centre. I went to go get it. I had that surge of adrenaline that I had just shot 62 and then I had the heartbreak that I didn't. It was 'Wow, that stings'. This ball was hunting right in the centre of the hole and didn't go. Unfortunately the curse hit me hard.\\" Media playback is not supported on this device The curse? Is there something in that? Mickelson would not be alone in thinking it because he is not alone in walking off the 18th green of a major championship having missed his chance to rewrite the history books. Mickelson joined the group of golfers who signed for a 63 at a major championship, but trooped off the 18th hole feeling that some kind of other worldly force was working against them. We go back to 1977 when Mark Hayes missed a six-footer for 62 at the Open at Turnberry. Onwards to 1980 and Jack Nicklaus missing a three-footer for 62 in the first round of the US Open at Baltusrol, later saying that he \\"totally choked\\". When did Nicklaus ever choke? In 1984, Gary Player had 12ft for a 62 at the USPGA at Shoal Creek. He missed. In 1986, Nick Price had 30ft for birdie, and 62, at Augusta, his ball circling the hole and staying above ground. Later, Price was to say that he felt like Augusta's co-founder Bobby Jones' hand \\"came up and popped it out\\". The same year of 1986, at Turnberry, Greg Norman's three putts from shy of 30ft denied him history. Norman had three bogeys on his card and a whole pile of regret about an opportunity lost. Tiger Woods has known this angst, too. In the 2007 USPGA he lipped-out for 62, his sense of injustice so cruel that he said that his score had to go down as a 62 and a half. Most recently, in 2013, Jason Dufner had a chance. He had 10ft for a birdie on 18 at the USPGA at Oak Hill and left it short. Dufner walked off the green with a demeanour of a man in shock. Isao Aoki, Vijay Singh, Rory McIlroy - one generation to the next, all united by the look they had at the holy grail only for it to be snatched away from them. Twenty-eight rounds of 63 have been recorded in major golf, beginning with Johnny Miller at the US Open at Oakmont in 1973. That number doesn't acknowledge the players who have had a little glimpse of the 62 nirvana and ended up not even making 63. The forgotten ones. Jordan Spieth is among this group. At Augusta last year, he was eight-under after 14 holes when standing on the tee of the par-five 15th - a birdie hole, the easiest on the golf course. He took six and finished on 64. People forget what an opportunity he had. Spieth has not forgotten, though. You can be sure of that. Mickelson will not forget this in a hurry either. The fact that he is leading the Open by three shots brought him minimal consolation. \\"The putt was outside the hole by a few inches, breaking left in the middle of the putt and then straight the last bit. Well, it was supposed to be straight the last bit. \\"This one is going to stay with me for a while. Lots of guys have shot 63 but nobody has shot 62. That would have been something special.\\" The history man - almost. We've launched a new BBC Sport newsletter, bringing all the best stories, features and video right to your inbox.

I've also done quite a bit of work writing copy and working in public relations for various local businesses and non-profits.\\" Impressed by the breadth of her background, I edged curiously, \\"That's excellent! It's great to see someone with diverse experience. What got you interested in working on this project?\\" \\"It was your mention of storytelling that caught my eye,\\" Jordan replied. \\"I was always very keen on writing and sharing stories as a child. My mom would buy me journals, and I would fill them with tales of adventures, mystery, and even some romance. When I saw your ad, it made me realize that there might be a way for me to combine all of my interests and skills into one incredible project.\\" My excitement for this project grew even more after hearing her experience and enthusiasm. \\"Absolutely! That's the kind of passion and creativity I'm looking for in a partner. I'd love for us to start brainstorming some ideas and see where it takes us.\\" And so began a fantastic journey where Jordan and I collaborated on an incredible project. We combined the power of visuals and storytelling to transport people into the magical worlds we created. Through our imagination, hard work, and collaboration, we were able to touch the lives of many and be proud of the beautiful art we made together. And along the way, we even joked about the confusion surrounding her name, just as she had with her dear teacher, Mr. James Jordan."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As the blondest brat in the Harry Potter universe, actor Tom Felton has no qualms about portraying the theoretically unlikable Draco Malfoy. So why do so many fans devote themselves to \\"Team Slytherin?\\" Felton muses on the possibilities with CNN. CNN: You have a fairly active dialogue with your fans. Can you explain to the muggles why fans are so into \\"Team Slytherin?\\" Felton: I definitely can't answer; I have no idea. I'm always curious when 7-year-olds and 8-year-olds come up to me and say, \\"Yeah, Draco's my favorite character.\\" I always think, \\"Hmmm, I'm not sure if he should be.\\" I'm not sure. I've been told that people like a bad guy, or I guess people love to hate someone. I guess Draco has filled that role for quite a few years. But yeah, I'm \\"Team Slytherin\\" all the way. CNN: Was it ever difficult to play such a mean-spirited and dirisive character as Draco Malfoy? Felton: Nothing but joy. I took great joy in every minute of it. It was like playing the polar opposite of me, really. It was kind of easy to step into his shoes and be delightfully horrible to everyone around me. I really enjoyed it and it never struck me as being difficult. Which is a little strange, in itself. I guess there's an evil kid inside me waiting to get out. CNN: Is it ever possible for you to have a good hair day after a decade of bleaching your locks for the role? Felton: Not really. I'm just grateful that I still have hair on my head after that many years of dying it. So yeah, it's actually turned back to its normal condition and is in not bad shape. Thanks for asking. CNN: What kinds of perks do you get for being a part of the Harry Potter franchise? Do you get a lifetime supply of butter beer? Felton: I've yet to cash in that coupon. What perks? We get the DVD a week before it comes out. We've been a couple of times to the Orlando theme park, the Wizarding World, and when we're there we're usually told to drink as much butter beer as we like. So yeah, you could call that a lifetime supply, I guess. CNN: Harry Potter has established itself as a consequential fantasy franchise. Has it influenced your tastes or is there a different genre that inspires you? Felton: I'm sure Harry will go down as this kind of fantasy thriller, but I see it as everything. It's a romantic comedy, it's dark humor, it's kind of everything in every one of the films. It encompasses a lot. I'm not really a genre kind of guy. I don't like to label films with a genre. I like all films whether it's dark or light, love, hate, whatever it is, I enjoy it. CNN: Was it ever heroes vs. villains on the set? Did you have a \\"Team Baddies?\\" Felton: You mean as the actors? No, not really. Bear in mind, we usually spend about 2% of the day in character, the rest of it is just us. So most of it is just normal chat. I hate to sound boring! CNN: Do you have a favorite memory of your time spent on the Harry Potter films? Felton: I don't really have one, that's sort of like saying pick your favorite memory of the last 15 years. Everyone asks that. It's the whole experience. The people that we work with, the relationships that we've made, the costumes we got to wear and all the stupid stuff we got to do. It's just the whole experience really. it's very hard for me to pick one memory. CNN: What's the most unexpected thing about being a part of Harry Potter? Felton: I guess that we're still here. Every year we kind of said, \\"When are the fans gonna get bored of these and move on?\\" But they never did. Every year the fans got more and more excited by everything. And it's kind of crazy that we're still here today talking about it. That's definitely one of the things that surprised me the most about the whole thing. CNN: What is J.K. Rowling like? Felton: She's exceptionally down to earth. She's one of the most down to earth people I've met. She's very, very sweet -- I'm always blown away by how down to earth she is. She's a really, really nice person and it's always a pleasure getting a chance to hang out with her. CNN: So many people around the world are fans of Draco. What is Draco a fan of? Felton: Other than villainous ways? He's a fan of snakes. Slitherin. Evil deeds. You know what, it's weird because that's kind of a changing question. Because in the recent films I think it's slightly different. Probably freedom and, you know, not his parents. It's a tough one. He's a character with two sides.

A cross-dressing bank robber, dubbed the \\"Mrs. Doubtfire Bandit\\" by police, is on the loose in Southern California. Surveillance video taken inside a Santa Cruz bank Friday shows the sashaying suspect wearing an ill-fitting dirty-blonde wig, black-framed glasses, a gold locket around his neck and carrying a tan purse on his bended arm.

Police say the man first prowled around inside the Rabo Bank around 2 p.m., \\"possibly casing the bank,\\" they said. \\"When the bank employees contacted the suspect they were surprised to see that although the suspect was dressed like a female, the suspect was actually a male,\\" police said. The suspect left without any crime being committed but at 3 p.m. the U.S. bank was robbed by a similarly dressed man who used a note but no visible weapon to demand money.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What did Moore do instead of using a machine when asked to reproduce The Virgin and Child? from the following article ?  After the Great War, Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing... Answer:","output":"When asked to reproduce Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child, instead of modeling the relief in plaster and then reproducing it in marble with a \\"pointing machine\\" which was the conventional technique, Henry Moore opted to carve the relief directly, even going as far as marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing machine.

Article: \\"There's going to be one less boy in the room!\\" The words rang in my ears as the criminal  pointed his gun against my head. The floodgates opened and tears ran down my face. No one in the courtroom  moved. Everyone was held silent with fear. A few seconds passed and the criminal put down his gun, turning his back on me. \\"Cut!\\" the director shouted with joy. One take! We had done the scene in just one take. Then all the people who acted in the film went off for lunch. I got my food and joined them, and the criminal, who had moments before been so scary, took his seat beside me and told us many funny jokes. A table of adults surrounded me, but I was never uncomfortable talking with strangers. I worked with these people and they worked with me. We talked, we laughed, we got to know each other and sometimes we became friends. At the end of the day we all went our separate ways, but we had been drawn close by working together to make this play. After the show was broadcast, my friends asked if I had been scared of the criminal. At first this sounded funny. He was, after all, a kind and intelligent man. Then I realized that they didn't see that side of him. Television and films are about creating an alternate  life that appears real even if for a while. We had been successful in doing that.

A terminally-ill schoolboy who was awarded a 'dream ride' in a Porsche suffered two broken legs and bit off his tongue when the car collided with oncoming traffic. Raphael Wittmann, 14, was placed in intensive care  after the high-powered sports car crashed in the outskirts of his home city of, Vienna, Austria, in May. He died two months later. His family claim the charity who organised the experience, Kinder Krebshlife, did not offer to help the youngster after the horrific crash, and as a result they are now demanding compensation. Tragic: Terminal cancer sufferer Raphael Wittmann, 14, ended up in intensive care and died two months after the crash in the outskirts of his hometown, Vienna, Austria. Scene: The emergency services tend to the youngster next to the crushed Porsche at the crash site in Vienna. The teenager was given intensive therapy at his home following his diagnoses 12 months ago, but it was not successful, and his parents were told he wasn't going to live. His father, Franz, 47, became determined to make his final months memorable, so managed to arrange a holiday to the Spanish island of Tenerife. But shortly before that, he was contacted by the children's cancer charity who invited Raphael for a drive in the high-performance car outside of Vienna. But the event ended tragically within minutes of starting when the Porsche 986 crashed into oncoming traffic, leaving the teen in intensive care with horrific injuries for two months before he passed away. The only acknowledgement  his family say he received from those involved in organising the event  was an iPhone from the driver who was at the wheel when Raphael died. Tragic: Raphael, pictured left with his mother and right draped in a football scarf, spent the last two months of his life recovering in intensive care. Treatment: Raphael was diagnosed with cancer last year. He underwent intensive radiotherapy at home but doctors said he was unlikely to live, meaning his parents wanted to make his last months memorable. His father Franz believes the accident on May 17 this year robbed his son of the will to live. 'After the hand that fate had dealt him, he just didn't have the strength to go on any longer' he said. And although the matter might have ended with the youngster's death on July 5, his father is still angry at the way they were treated by the children's charity. The family have now contacted lawyer Dr Astrid Wagner to take the charity to task. He said: 'I want justice for my dead boy. Not me.' Dr Wagner said: 'It was a charity event but these things should be properly organised and that means that the should be insurance as well as anything else. But the children's charity claim they didn't organise it, but won't tell us who did.' She said that as a result they had no option other than to take legal action against the charity. The head of the charity Karin Benedik, has denied any wrongdoing. She said: 'We tried to help this family, and our name is dragged through the mud as a result. We were not the organisers of this event, it was the Porsche forum.' Angry: Raphael's father Franz (left)contacted lawyer Astrid Wagner (right) to take legal action. They are now suing the charity.

Sentence 1: Stinking fish was a derogatory Elizabethan reference to vaginal odor Sentence 2: The term stinking fish has been around for decades. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"If the first sentence is true, indicating that the term \\"stinking fish\\" was used as a derogatory Elizabethan reference to vaginal odor, then it would mean that its origin dates back to the Elizabethan era (1558-1603). The second sentence claims that the term has been around for decades. In the context of evaluating the two sentences based on their correlation, it is important to note that a decade consists of ten years. If the term \\"stinking fish\\" was indeed used during the Elizabethan era, then this term would be approximately 400-500 years old, which means it has been around for more than just a few decades; it has actually been around for several centuries. Considering this information, it can be concluded that the second sentence is not entirely accurate when it states that the term \\"stinking fish\\" has been around for decades. It would be more precise to say that the term has existed for centuries. However, the sentence remains technically true as it does not specify an exact number of decades, and centuries encompass multiple decades.

Councils are heavily dependent on the Scottish government for their money - to say no at this stage, with no prospect of a significantly better offer, would plunge them into crisis. But this year's budget offer has strained relations badly between non-SNP councils and the Scottish government. The immediate concern is straightforward. Many councils argue they will receive less than they had anticipated so are now contemplating bigger cuts and savings than they had forecast. The government offer, as ever, includes money to compensate councils for not putting up the council tax. The government points to research which demonstrates that, if anything, councils have been over-compensated for freezing the council tax which last went up in 2007. However, this is only one portion of a complex equation. What really matters to councils is the overall amount they get from the government and how much control they have over their finances. Councils say they will get less in absolute terms in the coming year - Cosla talks of Â£350m of cuts - and many say the reduction is worse than anticipated. One council, Moray, proposed an 18% rise in council tax. It said the rise needed to be that big to balance out the loss of the government money to compensate them for the council tax freeze and balance out the impact of other cuts. A few other councils, including Highland and Fife, seriously explored the possibility of raising council tax. In 2011 the SNP promised to freeze the council tax until this year - they argue the freeze has been a popular policy and believe it has been a real help to family budgets. Sceptics have always noted that the biggest savings - in absolute terms - were made by people who live in large houses who may not make much use personally of council services. The government's own poverty adviser recently acknowledged this debate. Faced with the realistic possibility of a few increases, the government toughened up its carrot and stick approach - a rise would have left councils losing some other government money too. Moray took its proposed rise off the table. A number of councils will decide how they actually spend their money a little later than usual this year, to give themselves more time to find possible options for cuts and savings. As ever, one question is over how many of these options will mean cuts which are immediately obvious to the public. Or, will there be more so-called stealth cuts which may only be felt by staff and anyone immediately affected? There are, of course, also genuine arguments over potential efficiency savings and some may even wonder whether there are services currently provided by some councils which could actually be better left to the private sector. However, these are long term, underlying issues - the need to balance budgets is an immediate one. In the coming Scottish election, local services and how councils are funded is likely to become a major issue. Labour has proposed raising income tax to balance out the cuts councils are now facing. The underlying question though is about how much control of their finances councils should have and whether the council tax should be reformed or replaced. Proposals from all the main parties are expected in the coming weeks. Some in local government would be very disappointed if the proposals only looked at whether the small portion of their finances which comes from the council tax could be raised in a different way and if the parties did not address the question of whether councils should also have more financial freedom. A report produced for Cosla in 2014 argued that to strengthen local democracy, communities had to be in a position to determine what kind of services they wanted and how much they were prepared to pay for them. While the council tax freeze will almost certainly continue this year, the Scottish government's critics will argue it has been at a high cost - both to council services and the relationship between some councils and the Scottish government. The Scottish government will argue it has tried to do its best for councils in difficult circumstances and protected them from the worst of what it calls Westminster cuts. Summary:","output":"Scottish councils are being pressured into accepting a budget offer that many view as significantly worse than anticipated, straining relations and potentially leading to bigger cuts and savings than they had forecast."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One key aspect of successful communication is the appropriate use of proximity references. Proximity references are words or phrases that are employed in language to refer to objects or people that are close in space, time, or context. These references hold a remarkable potential in simplifying and streamlining conversations, ensuring both clarity and precision in language. This article delves into the various forms of proximity references and their usage in describing physical, temporal, figurative, and social contexts. Physical Proximity: Words That Describe Spatial Closeness Physical proximity refers to the nearness of nouns in space. To express physical proximity in language, we use demonstrative pronouns like 'this' and 'these'. 'This' is used in the singular form, while 'these' is used for plural nouns. For instance: - \\"This book on the table is mine.\\" - \\"These shoes in the corner are old.\\" These demonstrative pronouns allow speakers to identify specific items or people that are in close proximity, eliminating confusion and providing a clear reference point. Similarly, adverbs like 'here' can be used for specifying location. For example: - \\"The meeting is taking place here.\\" Temporal Proximity: Words That Signify Closeness in Time When it comes to referring to events or instances that are near in time, temporal proximity plays a significant role. Words like 'now,' 'soon,' 'recently,' and 'shortly' are employed to draw attention to the temporal context. These words can help listeners gauge the immediacy or a relative sense of when events are occurring. For example: - \\"Now is the time to act.\\" - \\"The package will arrive soon.\\" - \\"I recently moved to a new city.\\" - \\"We will shortly begin the presentation.\\" Figurative Proximity: Referring to Conceptual Relations Figurative proximity transcends physical or temporal closeness and refers to connection in terms of ideas, concepts, or emotions. To articulate figurative proximity, certain phrases or words are employed, like 'related to,' 'connected to,' or 'in the same vein'. These expressions highlight the correspondence between abstract ideas or emotions. For instance: - \\"Her experiences were closely related to mine.\\" - \\"His paintings are connected to the theme of nature.\\" - \\"The author brings forth yet another point in the same vein.\\" Social Proximity: Introducing People in Context Social proximity is about establishing connections and relationships between individuals. To introduce people to others, you can use phrases that indicate your association with the person or explain the nature of your relationship. These phrases might include 'my friend,' 'my colleague,' 'my neighbor,' or any relevant term that signifies social connection between two or more persons. For example: - \\"I would like you to meet my cousin Jane.\\" - \\"This is my colleague Mark, who works in the finance department.\\" Conclusion Mastering the art of proximity references is essential for effective communication in daily life, as well as in professional and social contexts. By understanding and utilizing physical, temporal, figurative, and social proximity terms accurately, one can create clear and concise sentences, avoid misunderstandings, and enhance the overall quality of interactions. Embrace these powerful language tools, and unlock the potential to express yourself with greater clarity and precision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer based on context: The period of the grandiose expansion of Sweden met its limits in two wars: the Great Northern War which ended in the Treaty of Nystad in 1721 and the Hat's War  with the Treaty of Turku in 1743. Sweden lost all its provinces in the Baltic region, and a portion of eastern Finland to Russia. The Valaam Monastery was re-established in Lake Ladoga, and a new main church was consecrated in 1719.  Monks returned to Konevsky Monastery before 1716. The Russian government favoured the activities of the religion they had professed for many centuries. The Emperors and Empresses paid for the reconstruction of burnt or otherwise demolished churches. The Orthodox population of Eastern Finland again had access to making pilgrimages to the monasteries of Solovetsk and Alexander-Svirsky. The Old Believers, a schismatic group of Russians who did not accept the religious reforms of patriarch Nikon in 1666-67, were excommunicated from the Orthodox Church and fled to the outskirts of Russia. They also moved into the remote areas of Finland building three small monasteries there. However, the activity of these monasteries stopped during the following century.

Information:  - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - Homogenic is the third international solo album by Icelandic musician Björk, released in September 1997. Produced by Björk, Mark Bell, Guy Sigsworth, Howie B and Markus Dravs, it was released on One Little Indian Records. The music of \\"Homogenic\\" was a new style for Björk, focusing on similar-sounding music combining electronic beats and string instruments with songs in tribute to her native country Iceland. \\"Homogenic\\" was originally to be produced in her home in London, but was later recorded in Spain. \\"Homogenic\\" marked the first of several production collaborations between Björk and Mark Bell, whom Björk would cite as a major influence on her musical career. The album peaked at number twenty-eight on the \\"Billboard\\" 200, and at number four on the UK Albums Chart.  - \`\` Alarm Call '' is a song by Björk released as the fourth single from her fourth studio album Homogenic , peaking at # 33 in the UK . The sped - up \`\` radio version '' of the song ( which was also featured in the video ) was used in the 1999 film The Mod Squad .  - One Little Indian Records is a London-based independent record label that rose from the ashes of punk rock record company Spiderleg Records. It was set up in 1985 by members of various anarcho-punk bands, and managed by former Flux of Pink Indians bassist Derek Birkett.  - Trip hop is a subgenre of electronic music that originated in the early 1990s in the United Kingdom, especially Bristol. Deriving from later idioms of acid house, the term was first used by the British music media and press as a way to describe the more experimental variant of breakbeat emerging from the Bristol Sound scene, which contained influences of soul, funk and jazz. It has been described as \\"Europe's alternative choice in the second half of the '90s\\", and \\"a fusion of hip hop and electronica until neither genre is recognisable\\". Trip hop music fuses several styles and has much in common with other genres; it has several qualities similar to ambient music, and its drum-based breakdowns share characteristics with hip hop. It also contains elements of R&B, dub and house, as well as other electronic music. Trip hop can be highly experimental.  - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate.  - Björk Guðmundsdóttir (born 21 November 1965), known as Björk, is an Icelandic singer, songwriter, producer, DJ, and actress. Over her four-decade career, she has developed an eclectic musical style that draws on a wide range of influences and genres spanning electronic, pop, experimental, classical, trip hop, IDM, and avant-garde styles. She initially became known as the lead singer of the alternative rock band The Sugarcubes, whose 1987 single \\"Birthday\\" was a hit on US and UK indie stations and a favorite among music critics. Björk embarked on a solo career in 1993, coming to prominence as a solo artist with albums such as \\"Debut\\" (1993), \\"Post\\" (1995), and \\"Homogenic\\" (1997), while collaborating with a range of artists and exploring a variety of multimedia projects.   - The UK Albums Chart (currently called the Official Albums Chart) is a list of albums ranked by physical and digital sales and (from March 2015) audio streaming in the United Kingdom.

Input: Context: Erectile dysfunction (ED) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) share many common risk factors, and vascular ED is a marker for increased ASCVD risk. Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations have been associated with increased ASCVD risk, but less is known regarding the relationship of low 25(OH)D with ED. We determined whether 25(OH)D deficiency is associated with ED independent of ASCVD risk factors.', 'We performed cross-sectional analyses of 3390 men aged ≥20 years free of ASCVD who participated in NHANES 2001-2004. Serum 25(OH)D was measured by the DiaSorin radioimmunoassay; deficiency was defined as levels <20xa0ng/ml (<50xa0nmol/L). Self-reported ED, assessed by a single validated question, was defined as men who reported being \\"never\\" or \\"sometimes able\\" to maintain an erection. We assessed the relationship between 25(OH)D deficiency and ED prevalence using adjusted Poisson regression methods.', 'After accounting for NHANES sampling, the weighted prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency and of ED were 30% and 15.2%, respectively. 25(OH)D levels were lower in men with vs. those without ED (mean 22.8 vs 24.3xa0ng/mL, respectively; pxa0=xa00.0005). After adjusting for lifestyle variables, comorbidities, and medication use, men with 25(OH)D deficiency had a higher prevalence of ED compared to those with levels ≥30xa0ng/ml (Prevalence Ratio 1.30, 95% CI 1.08-1.57).

Just before Christmas, a mysterious old man, Mr. Frederick Percival Blunden (Laurence Naismith) visits the family, introducing himself as a representative of a firm of solicitors.[2] The family are told there is an opportunity to become the caretakers of a derelict country mansion in the Home Counties named Langley Park, which was gutted by fire years before, and is now in the charge of the solicitors. Mrs. Allen takes the post despite rumours that the house is haunted, her instructions to care for the property until such time as the heirs to the estate can be traced. The air of mystery deepens when the children see a portrait at the solicitors office of a man they believe to be Mr Blunden. The solicitor confirms this, but reveals that the portrait is of a man called Mr Blunden, but who has been dead for a hundred years.[6] After they have settled into the new post, Lucy and Jamie see two ghostly figures in the grounds of the house: a teenage girl, Sara Latimer (Rosalyn Landor), and her younger brother, Georgie (Marc Granger). They are two children who lived in the house a century earlier.[7] Sara tells them that she and her brother are orphans, under the care of their dissolute and hapless Uncle Bertie (James Villiers) and the solicitor Mr. Blunden, until Georgie comes of age. Bertie marries a music hall performer, Bella Wickens[8] and her parents then move into Langley Park, ostensibly as the housekeeper and game keeper.[8] The children come to suspect that Mrs. Wickens (Diana Dors) and her disturbed (and often violent) husband are plotting to kill them to get hold of Georgie's inheritance. Sara and Georgie find a book with instructions for travelling through time, so that they can get help. Lucy and Jamie agree to travel back with them; they arrange to meet Sara the next day.

Take a two 9x11 inch baking pans, and place a cooling rack over one of them. Arrange the bowl and the two baking pans so the chicken is at one end, the pan with the cooling rack is at the other, and in between is empty pan.

In this method, the chicken tenders are first soaked in buttermilk overnight to tenderize and add flavor to the meat. This helps the breading to adhere better to the chicken and provides a moist and tender result when cooked.  Conversely, in solution 2, covering the chicken tenders with breading overnight might cause them to become too saturated with the dry breading mixture, which could lead to uneven coating and ultimately, a less than desirable texture. Additionally, dipping the chicken in buttermilk after the breading step would cause the breading to become soggy and it would not stick to the chicken properly, resulting in a poor crust when cooked. This method contradicts the objective of achieving a well-breaded chicken. Therefore, following the steps in solution 1 would be the better approach. Soaking the chicken in buttermilk overnight and then coating it in breading before placing it on a cooling rack ensures an even distribution of the breading and results in a crispy, flavorful crust when cooked."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: In this task, you are given text for US Congressional and California state bills, your task is to generate a summary for this bill. SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.     This Act may be cited as the \`\`Columbia River Habitat Protection  and Recreational Access Act of 1997''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS.     The Congress makes the following findings:             (1) The 51-mile stretch of the Columbia River, known as the          \`\`Hanford Reach'', provides 80 percent of the fall Chinook          salmon in the river system, critical habitat for wildlife, a          high-quality waterfowl sanctuary, as well as numerous scenic,          historic, and recreational opportunities for the public.             (2) In 1996 Congress, through Public Law 104-333,          prohibited damming, dredging, channeling, or other such          activities along the Hanford Reach in order to help preserve          and protect the unique environmental benefits of the region.             (3) The lands surrounding the Hanford Reach area of the          Columbia River, Washington, should be properly managed in order          to protect plant, fish, wildlife, cultural, recreational, and          scenic resources, while preserving access to these lands.             (4) Recognizing the unique and pristine values of the area,          local citizens in cooperation with Federal and State          authorities have developed a comprehensive protection plan          which has enhanced salmon habitat along the Hanford Reach. This          plan, known as the Vernita Bar Agreement, has preserved the          free flowing, riparian character of the Hanford Reach, and          serves as a blueprint for further successful management along          the Columbia River.             (5) Although dozens of local, State, and Federal          environmental protection and management laws and regulations          exist for the Hanford Reach, management efforts can be better          integrated and can lead to more efficient use of public          resources and improved habitat and recreation management.             (6) Several of the areas adjacent to the Hanford Reach of          the Columbia River, including lands known as the Wahluke Slope,          currently owned by the United States, have been extensively          studied and reviewed through environmental impact statements          and have been declared environmentally sound and certified          suitable for conveyance.             (7) Inasmuch as Federal financial resources are          constrained, joint partnerships among Federal, State, and local          entities can provide long-term habitat and wildlife management,          maintain recreational opportunities, and develop a responsible          and environmentally sound local land use plan for the region.             (8) The people and the governments of Benton, Franklin,          Grant, and Adams Counties desire to enter into such a          partnership with the State of Washington and the United States          to ensure the continued protection of plant, fish, wildlife,          cultural, recreational, and scenic resources on the lands          surrounding the Hanford Reach.             (9) Such a cooperative partnership will provide a forum for          public input from the entire region and ensure the long-term          protection of the river as wild, scenic, and accessible.             (10) Congress recommends the formation of a commission, of          which a majority of the members of such a commission represent          the local entities, to ensure that the above goals are achieved          and to maintain maximum involvement by the citizens of Benton,          Franklin, Grant, and Adams Counties.

Article: Much of the current knowledge of memory has come from studying memory disorders, particularly amnesia. Loss of memory is known as amnesia. Amnesia can result from extensive damage to: (a) the regions of the medial temporal lobe, such as the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, subiculum, amygdala, the parahippocampal, entorhinal, and perirhinal cortices or the (b) midline diencephalic region, specifically the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus and the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus. There are many sorts of amnesia, and by studying their different forms, it has become possible to observe apparent defects in individual sub-systems of the brain's memory systems, and thus hypothesize their function in the normally working brain. Other neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease can also affect memory and cognition. Hyperthymesia, or hyperthymesic syndrome, is a disorder that affects an individual's autobiographical memory, essentially meaning that they cannot forget small details that otherwise would not be stored. Korsakoff's syndrome, also known as Korsakoff's psychosis, amnesic-confabulatory syndrome, is an organic brain disease that adversely affects memory by widespread loss or shrinkage of neurons within the prefrontal cortex.

Aim to take around 280 mg per day. You can also increase your omega-3 intake by adding foods like fish to your diet. Always talk to your doctor before you add a new supplement. Omega-3’s can interact with some medications, and your doctor can tell you if these are safe for you. Curcumin is thought to have anti-inflammatory and pain-reducing properties. Try adding food like turmeric, which is a great source of curcumin, to your daily diet. You can also take turmeric as a supplement in tablet or capsule form.

The area where an electron is most likely to be found is called its orbital. Recall that the Bohr model depicts an atom’s electron shell configuration. Within each electron shell are subshells, and each subshell has a specified number of orbitals containing electrons. While it is impossible to calculate exactly where an electron is located, scientists know that it is most probably located within its orbital path. Subshells are designated by the letter s, p, d, and f. The s subshell is spherical in shape and has one orbital. Principal shell 1n has only a single s orbital, which can hold two electrons. Principal shell 2n has one s and one p subshell, and can hold a total of eight electrons. The p subshell has three dumbbell-shaped orbitals, as illustrated in Figure 2.8. Subshells d and f have more complex shapes and contain five and seven orbitals, respectively. These are not shown in the illustration. Principal shell 3n has s, p, and d subshells and can hold 18 electrons. Principal shell 4n has s, p, d and f orbitals and can hold 32 electrons. Moving away from the nucleus, the number of electrons and orbitals found in the energy levels increases. Progressing from one atom to the next in the periodic table, the electron structure can be worked out by fitting an extra electron into the next available orbital.

Ragan and Busek later cited arguments over writing credits, and Deuce not wanting to tour, as reasons for the departure.

American Tragedy turned out to be more successful than their first album Swan Songs, selling 66,915 in its debut week and peaking at No. 4 on the Billboard 200. It has also peaked at No. 2 on many other charts, while also reaching No. 1 on the Billboard's Top Hard Rock Albums chart.

Fresh off their dominating win over the Jaguars, the Seahawks stayed at home for a Week 6 NFC West duel with the Arizona Cardinals. Seattle would trail in the first quarter as Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner completed a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald, followed by running back Tim Hightower's 2-yard touchdown run. Arizona would increase its lead in the second quarter with a 29-yard field goal from kicker Neil Rackers. The Seahawks would then get on the board as kicker Olindo Mare nailed a 28-yard field goal. However, the Cardinals took control in the second half as Warner found wide receiver Steve Breaston on a 16-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter, followed by Rackers' 31-yard field goal in the fourth.

To do this, subtract 120*u from both sides of the equation: 169*u - 120*u = 120*u - 120*u + 3087 49*u = 3087 Finally, to solve for u, divide both sides of the equation by 49: (49*u) / 49 = 3087 / 49 u = 63 So, the solution for the equation is u = 63."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I have a new situation: Mike lives in a cold mid-western city, where there is not much predator prey interaction. Mike noticed that in his city some squirrels have darker coat, while others have lighter coat. He also knew that darker coats are more suitable in cold environment with less predator prey interaction. He started thinking why the squirrels developed different coat colors.  But I can use this background: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks.  What is an answer for this question: Which coat would most likely become more common, darker or lighter? A:","output":"Considering the background information on natural selection and the specific situation with Mike's observations in a cold mid-western city, it is likely that the darker coat would become more common among squirrels in this environment.  The reasons for this prediction are as follows: 1. Darker coats provide better insulation in cold environments, allowing squirrels to maintain their body heat more efficiently. This results in better chances of survival and reproduction for squirrels with darker coats compared to those with lighter coats. 2. In the given environment, there is not much predator-prey interaction. As a consequence, the need for the squirrels to have lighter coats for camouflage purposes is reduced. This means that squirrels with darker coats wouldn't have an increased risk of being preyed upon due to their coat color. Given these factors, natural selection would favor squirrels with darker coats in the cold mid-western city. As squirrels with darker coats reproduce in greater numbers, the frequency of this trait in the population would increase over time, making the darker coat more common among the local squirrel population."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: It’s October, which means it’s that time of the year again: flu vaccination time! Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza. This month, you’ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I’ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here’s what I’ll cover: * The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu * What to know about flu shots for older adults * What’s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu... Where did the author get the facts about how many people are affected by influenza each year?

Though he lay there helpless, still she found him an awesome figure, like a fallen cathedral tower. Only two other men are as tall, she thought. Amalric and Orlando. She felt a pang of guilt. How could she be thinking about the troubadour here where her royal master lay slowly dying? She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat. But she knew that this northern chateau, Pontoise-les-Noyons, a day's ride from Paris, had had to be built to withstand cold, its walls thick and its windows tiny ? so totally unlike the bright, airy Languedoc manor she had grown up in. Sweat trickled down her brow and stung her eyes. Her breath was coming in little gasps. She felt as if she would faint if she couldn't go outside soon. Dozens of people, the King's family and courtiers, had packed themselves uselessly into the room, making it even more suffocating. Their whispers, like the buzzing of mosquitoes, irritated Nicolette. Almost all of them, she was sure, worried more about their own welfare than about the King's. And even Louis's wife and mother, though they grieved for him, were too distracted to do much to alleviate his suffering. She saw the King's lips quiver, and quickly she bent close to him. Any last words could be terribly important. \\"Jerusalem,\\" he mumbled. \\"Towers - golden. Gates of pearl. Crystal waters.\\" Then he panted heavily. \\"Hush, sire,\\" she whispered. \\"Rest easy.\\" Question: The Kings wife: Options:  A. was not in the room  B. was beautiful  C. not enough information  D. was also tall  === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"C. not enough information"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In another Comic Strip Presents film, GLC, she produced and sang on the theme song \\"Ken\\". The song was written about Ken Livingstone, the leader of the Greater London Council and future mayor of London, who at the time was working with musicians to help the Labour Party garner the youth vote.Bush wrote and performed the song \\"The Magician\\", using a fairground-like arrangement, for Menahem Golan's 1979 film The Magician of Lublin. The track was scored and arranged by Michael Kamen. In 1986, she wrote and recorded \\"Be Kind to My Mistakes\\" for the Nicolas Roeg film Castaway.

What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who is helped by the museum exhibits to re-open the planetarium? from the following article ?  In 1938 Egypt, a team of archaeologists discover the tomb of pharaoh Ahkmenrah, including a young Cecil Fredericks, finding the magical Tablet of Ahkmenrah. The locals warn the group that removing the tablet will end its magic. In present-day New York City, Larry Daley remains the night guard of the American Museum of Natural History. He, Theodore Roosevelt, Sacagawea, Attila the Hun, Jedediah, Octavius, Rexy the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton and Dexter the capuchin monkey help re-open the Hayden Planetarium. A new wax Neanderthal resembling Larry named Laaa is introduced, identifying Larry as his father. Ahkmenrah shows Larry that the tablet is corroding, which later causes the exhibits to act erratically, causing mayhem at the planetarium's reopening. Afterwards, Larry catches his son Nick, who plans on taking a gap year to sort out his life, throwing a house party. Larry reunites with Cecil, now in retirement, who realizes the end of the tablet's magic will cause the exhibits to become lifeless. Cecil explains that Ahkmenrah's parents, Merenkahre and Shepseheret, may be able to restore the tablet's power but that they are located in the British Museum. Larry convinces the museum's curator, Dr. McPhee, to let him ship Ahkmenrah to London to restore the tablet, convinced that McPhee knows its secrets. Larry and Nick travel to the British Museum, bypassing the night guard Tilly. To Larry's surprise, Roosevelt, Sacagawea, Attila, Jed, Octavius, Dexter and Laaa have come as well, and Laaa is left to stand guard while the others search the museum, the tablet bringing its own exhibits to life. The answer to this question is:","output":"Larry.

Here's my step-by-step reasoning: 1. Analyze the options provided: The options given are Canada, Illinois, basket, ball stopped, and person's house. 2. Eliminate irrelevant options: Basket and ball stopped are unrelated to the context of the question, so they can be eliminated. 3.

Premise: 2) The gap between the earnings of women and their productivity. Hypothesis: There is a sizeable difference when you talk about women's pay and their effectiveness. Options: (A). yes. (B). it is not possible to tell. (C). no. To determine whether the hypothesis follows from the premise, let's break down both statements and consider the possible relationships between them. The premise describes a gap between the earnings of women and their productivity. This suggests that women's pay might not be equal or proportional to the level of their performance in the workplace. The premise does not imply any specific cause for this discrepancy, only that a gap exists. The hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that there is a sizeable difference when discussing women's pay and their effectiveness. The term \\"effectiveness\\" is closely related to \\"productivity,\\" as both refer to the level of performance at work. Therefore, the hypothesis also discusses a discrepancy between women's earnings and their work performance, similar to the premise. It is essential to recognize that there may be multiple factors influencing the wage gap between genders, such as discrimination, job choices, work hours, experience, and education levels – among others. The given premise and hypothesis do not specify any reasons or causes for the observed gap, focusing only on the difference in earnings and productivity. Considering the similarities between the premise and the hypothesis, it is reasonable to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also likely to be true. Both statements address the same topic – the discrepancy between women's earnings and their work performance. Therefore, option (A) yes, seems to be the most relevant answer in this context. However, it is crucial to underline that correlation does not equal causation. The premise and hypothesis point out a relationship between two variables (earnings and productivity), but they do not provide any information about causality, nor do they identify any specific factors that might be causing the wage gap. In conclusion, based on the provided premise and hypothesis and their alignment in discussing the discrepancy between women's pay and productivity, the answer appears to be (A) yes. If the premise is true, then it is plausible to accept the hypothesis as well. But it is necessary to remember that the relationship between earnings and productivity may involve numerous factors that are not addressed in either statement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements.   - A concept album is an album unified by a larger purpose or meaning to the album collectively than to its tracks individually. This may be achieved through a single central narrative or theme, or through a sense of artistic cohesiveness. The scope and definition of a \\"concept album\\" varies, and there is no consensus over what exactly the term constitutes.  - Michigan is a state in the Great Lakes and Midwestern regions of the United States. The name Michigan is the French form of the Ojibwa word \\"mishigamaa\\", meaning \\"large water\\" or \\"large lake\\". Michigan is the tenth most populous of the 50 United States, with the 11th most extensive total area (the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi River). Its capital is Lansing, and its largest city is Detroit.  - Detroit is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Michigan, the fourth-largest city in the Midwest and the largest city on the United StatesCanada border. It is the seat of Wayne County, the most populous county in the state.  - A song, most broadly, is a single (and often standalone) work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections. Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers and lyricists. Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or in some, cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas.  - Vol. 1 : Unreleased ( aka The Official Jay Dee Instrumental Series Vol.1 : Unreleased ) is an instrumental album by the late Detroit record producer , Jay Dee , released in 2002 . The album was compiled by Jay Dee and Waajeed , and is a collection of previously unreleased beats . Two of the tracks on the album , \`\` Busta '' and \`\` L.L.

Although Jay and Busta worked together on numerous occasions , he never worked with LL . It is also possible LL could stand for \`\` Lonnie Lynn '' , the legal name of frequent Jay Dee collaborator Common . Also , it could be entitled 'LL ' because it contains small LL Cool J vocal samples throughout . Vol. 1 is distributed by Bling 47 and is mainly available through their website . This release was followed by Vol.2 : Vintage , three months later .  - Waajeed (born Robert O'Bryant) is a Detroit-born music producer, and one half of the hip hop and R&B group Platinum Pied Pipers, and a founding member of Tiny Hearts. He formed the Bling47 record label in 2002, which has released projects by J Dilla, Waajeed himself, and others.

Over the centuries, the living here has always been easy enough to attract a steady stream of immigrants. Bountiful food sources might have made Malaysia an inviting place for the contemporaries of Java Man — in 230,000 b.c. But thus far, the country's earliest traces of homo sapiens, found in the Niah Caves of northern Sarawak, are fragments of a skull dating to 40,000 b.c. On the peninsula, the oldest human-related relics (10,000 b.c. ) are Stone Age tools of the Negritos. These small, dark Melanesians are related in type to Australian aborigines and are confined today to the forests of the northern highlands. By 2,000 b.c. , these timid, gentle nomads hunting with bow and arrow were driven back from the coasts by waves of sturdy immigrants arriving in outrigger canoes equipped with sails. Mongolians from South China and Polynesian and Malay peoples from the Philippines and the Indonesian islands settled along the rivers of the peninsula and northern Borneo. They practiced a slash-and-burn agriculture of yams and millet, a technique that exhausted the soil and imposed a semi-nomadic existence from one jungle clearing to another. Families lived in wooden longhouses like those still to be seen today among the Iban peoples of Sarawak. Another unit was added on to the communal dwelling each time a marriage created a new family. Other tough migrants from the South Seas settled along the coasts — sailors, fishermen, traders (for the most part pirates) — known euphemistically as orang laut (sea people).

Context: Previous studies have suggested that DNA methylation contributes to coronary artery disease (CAD) risk variability. DNA hypermethylation at the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) gene, an important modulator of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and reverse cholesterol transport, has been previously associated with plasma lipid levels, aging and CAD, but the association with CAD has yet to be replicated.', 'ABCA1 DNA methylation levels were measured in leucocytes of 88 men using bis-pyrosequencing. We first showed that DNA methylation at the ABCA1 gene promoter locus is associated with aging and CAD occurrence in men (Pu2009<u20090.05). The latter association is stronger among older men with CAD (≥61xa0years old; nu2009=u200919), who showed at least 4.7% higher ABCA1 DNA methylation levels as compared to younger men with CAD (<61xa0years old; nu2009=u200919) or men without CAD (nu2009=u200950; Pu2009<u20090.001). Higher ABCA1 DNA methylation levels in older men were also associated with higher total cholesterol (ru2009=u20090.34, Pu2009=u20090.03), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ru2009=u20090.32, Pu2009=u20090.04) and triglyceride levels (ru2009=u20090.26, Pu2009=u20090.09). Furthermore, we showed that acetylsalicylic acid therapy is associated with 3.6% lower ABCA1 DNA methylation levels (Pu2009=u20090.006), independent of aging and CAD status of patients. Answer: This study provides new evidence that the ABCA1 epigenetic profile is associated with CAD and aging, and highlights that epigenetic modifications might be a significant molecular mechanism involved in the pathophysiological processes associated with CAD.

Statement 1: \\"VT 67A Connector was assigned in 1974 and removed in 2004 concurrent to the assignment of VT 279.\\" In this statement, the VT 67A Connector was assigned in 1974. It later got removed in 2004. At the same time (concurrently) in 2004, VT 279 was assigned. The intended meaning is that the VT 67A Connector existed between 1974-2004, and at the moment it was removed, VT 279 was assigned. Statement 2: \\"The VT 67A Connector was removed in 1974 and assigned to the assignment of VT 279 simultaneously in 2004.\\" In this statement, the VT 67A Connector was removed in 1974, which means it ceased to exist since then. Then, in 2004, VT 67A Connector was assigned to the assignment of VT 279 simultaneously. This statement implies that there might be no relation between the initial removal of the VT 67A Connector and the later assignment in 2004.

The University of Manchester is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom and was created in 2004 by the merger of Victoria University of Manchester founded in 1904 and UMIST, founded in 1956, though the university's logo appears to claim it was established in 1824. It includes the Manchester Business School, which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire. The University of Law, the largest provider of vocation legal training in Europe, has a campus in the city.The three Universities are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher education precinct. Together they have a combined population of 76,025 students in higher education as of 2015, although almost 6,000 of them were based at Manchester Metropolitan University's campuses at Crewe and Alsager in Cheshire.One of Manchester's most notable secondary schools is the Manchester Grammar School.

Antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a serious challenge to public health and national security. President establishes inter-agency task force and advisory council. Article:","output":"Title: Obama Administration Tackles Antibiotic Resistance: A New Frontier in Public Health and National Security Introduction: The Obama administration is taking significant strides in addressing the growing concern of antibiotic resistance, which poses a major threat to both public health and national security. Acknowledging the severity of this issue, President Obama has established an inter-agency task force and advisory council to implement effective measures and put forth robust solutions. Step 1: Define the problem of antibiotic resistance Antibiotic-resistant bacteria have emerged as a dire challenge to public health due to their ability to withstand the effects of commonly prescribed antibiotics. The overuse and misuse of these medications have accelerated the development of resistant bacteria, rendering many treatments ineffective and putting countless lives at risk. Step 2: Detail the consequences of antibiotic resistance on public health  If left unchecked, antibiotic resistance will continue to compromise the efficacy of essential medications. This development can lead to increased morbidity and mortality rates, prolonged hospital stays, and a heightened risk of life-threatening infections. Additionally, the economic burden of antibiotic resistance on healthcare systems is projected to be substantial, as the demand for new treatments and prevention strategies will skyrocket. Step 3: Discuss the implications of antibiotic resistance on national security Beyond the public health sector, antibiotic resistance is also recognized as a menace to national security. The proliferation of drug-resistant bacteria can potentially lead to the reemergence of diseases previously controlled or eradicated. Such bacteria may also be weaponized, posing an imminent biosecurity threat in the form of bioterrorism. Step 4: Introduce the Obama administration's inter-agency task force and advisory council To address the mounting threat posed by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, President Obama has created an inter-agency task force and advisory council. The task force will coordinate efforts across various federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), with a clear focus on promoting innovative research, enhancing surveillance, and improving antibiotic stewardship. Step 5: Discuss the role of the advisory council in combating antibiotic resistance The advisory council will serve as a platform for experts from diverse fields to share their insights and propose effective solutions to curb antibiotic resistance. By leveraging the expertise of scientists, healthcare professionals, and policymakers, the council aims to foster a collaborative approach to successfully tackle this unprecedented challenge. Conclusion:  The establishment of the inter-agency task force and advisory council by the Obama administration marks a critical step forward in combating antibiotic resistance. By recognizing the gravity of this issue and rallying both public health and national security efforts, the United States is taking a leading role in addressing one of the most pressing global health crises of our time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Economic spokesman Patrick O'Flynn said the Nato target could be \\"comfortably met\\" by reducing the foreign aid budget, scrapping the HS2 rail link and reducing public funding for Scotland. UKIP also promised more NHS cash and a personal tax allowance of £13,000. The Conservatives said UKIP had already \\"spent\\" its foreign aid and HS2 savings in a number of different ways. So far, both the Conservatives and Labour have refused to say they will ensure defence spending does not dip below the Nato target of 2% of economic output at some point during the next Parliament. UKIP confirmed its defence spending pledge at a campaign event laying out its economic policies. Party leader Nigel Farage said UKIP's plans would give \\"ordinary people a better chance in life\\". He said his party would re-allocate money from the EU and foreign aid and a number of \\"vanity projects... to increasing spending on defence so that we actually can be a credible international country.\\" Mr Farage said: \\"We're the only party that can find extra money for our hard-pressed NHS without increasing borrowing.\\" On the state of the economy, the UKIP leader added: \\"This is a London-led and an asset-led recovery. If you own stocks and shares, if you own substantial property, I accept that this government's policies have not been bad for you. \\"But the rest of Britain... is not feeling any particular bounce. And actually the truth of it is that most households are worse off than they were five years ago or 10 years ago, because of the massive, massive pressure on wages that has come directly as a result of uncontrolled mass migration and unskilled labour coming into this country.\\" Robin Brant, BBC political correspondent Nigel Farage came to Middleton to remind the voters here - a supposedly safe Labour seat - of the by-election UKIP so nearly won last year. He also wants to increase the pressure on the Tories with that spending commitment on defence - something David Cameron is yet to pledge. UKIP was throwing a lot of numbers around - more for the military, more for the NHS, fewer people paying the higher rate of tax. All achievable, it says, under a UKIP government that would save (a massive) £25bn by leaving the EU, ditching HS2 and taking an axe to the bulk of foreign aid. It is all an attempt to make the party more credible on a raft of policies as the election approaches. All rubbish, though, say the Tories, who claim the foreign aid money alone has been 'spent' 16 different ways, so far. Earlier, Mr O'Flynn told BBC Radio 4's Today that UKIP would spend £3bn a year more on defence than the Conservatives during the next Parliament, equivalent to about £16bn over five years. David Cameron has come under intense pressure from some within his own party and an array of senior military figures who say the pledge is crucial to maintaining the country's defence capability. Mr Cameron told MPs on Monday that the 2% target would be met \\"this year and next\\" and a future Conservative government would renew Trident on a like-for-like basis, protect the equipment budget and not allow regular army numbers to fall below 82,000 - pledges he described as \\"bankable assurances that will resonate on the doorstep\\".

A letter from an archdiocese official said that the Rev. Marcel Guarnizo was placed on leave for engaging in intimidating behavior, according to NBCWashington.com. The archdiocese had previously apologized for Guarnizo’s behavior.      The letter was read at all Masses this weekend at St. John Neumann, according to The Washington Post. The pastor there, the Rev. Thomas LaHood, said the removal was not related to the communion standoff, but \\"pertains to actions over the past week or two.\\" He did not elaborate.      Barbara Johnson, the woman who was denied the communion, had asked the archdiocese to remove the priest. Johnson’s family says they hope that action will ensure that others will not suffer the same treatment.      Read full report from NBCWashington.com      On Feb. 25, Johnson attended her mom's funeral at the St. John Neumann Catholic Church in Gaithersburg, Md., with her partner.      When it came time to hand out bread and wine, Guarnizo “issued a strong admonition that only Catholics in a state of grace can receive communion,” Johnson told msnbc.com.      “I went up. I was standing next to my mother’s casket and he covered the bowl, and said, ‘I cannot give you communion because you are with a woman, and in the eyes of the church, that is a sin.’ I stood there with my mouth open in a state of shock for – I don’t know how long,” she said.      As the final insult, Guarnizo failed to attend her mother’s burial, Guarnizo said. “When the funeral home director appears, he says, ‘Father Marcel has taken ill. He says he has a migraine and is unable to accompany your mother’s remains to the cemetery.’ This was, for me and my family, his most egregious act.”      The Diocese of Washington sent a letter of apology within days, saying the priest's behavior wasn't correct.      “When questions arise about whether or not an individual should present themselves for communion, it is not the policy of the Archdiocese of Washington to publicly reprimand the person,” the statement said. “Any issues regarding the suitability of an individual to receive communion should be addressed by the priest with that person in a private, pastoral setting.”      A woman is calling for a Catholic priest's removal from the ministry after he denied her communion at her mother's funeral and then left before finishing the service. The woman, Barbara Johnson, tells her story to msnbc's Tamron Hall.      More content from msnbc.com and NBC News      US News on msnbc.com on Twitter and Facebook ||||| A Gaithersburg Catholic priest who triggered national debate late last month when he denied Communion to a lesbian at her mother’s funeral Mass has been placed on administrative leave from ministry in the Washington archdiocese.            The Rev. Marcel Guarnizo was barred from ministry. (Greg Dohler/TheGazette)      The letter from Bishop Barry Knestout, a top administrator in the archdiocese, which covers Washington and the Maryland suburbs, says the punishment was for “engaging in intimidating behavior toward parish staff and others that is incompatible with proper priestly ministry.”      The archdiocese on Sunday confirmed Guarnizo's removal, and noted that Knestout's letter was read at all Masses this weekend at St. John Neumann. The pastor there, the Rev. Thomas LaHood, added some additional comments, including noting -- and repeating -- that the removal was not related to the Communion standoff, but \\"pertains to actions over the past week or two.\\" He did not elaborate.            In announcing the penalty on Sunday, LaHood spoke at some length about the disagreements that have unfolded in the parish because of the funeral Mass scene.            \\"As we know there’s been disagreement within the parish over how and to whom Communion is distributed. From my perspective this disagreement and related emotions flow from love. Love for Christ, really and truly present in the Eucharist. However, how we live out this love is important. The Scriptures tell us that we are known above all by how we love,\\" he said before reading the letter. After, he said \\"I realize this letter is hard to hear. Please keep mind that this is a first personnel issue, dealing with issues of ministry in the church. Father Guarnizo will have every opportunity to present his position.\\"            An archdiocesan spokeswoman Sunday would not clarify if LaHood's comments meant that Guarnizo would not be penalized for his handling of Barbara Johnson at the funeral.            While it was not clear what transpired within the parish in the past week or so that triggered the penalty, several bloggers have defended Guarnizo and claimed, citing anonymous witnesses, that Johnson's version of the story is inaccurate.            Barbara Johnson was denied Communion at her mother's funeral. (Marvin Joseph/WASHINGTON POST)      Guarnizo has refused to comment on what happened at the Mass.      Johnson declined to comment Sunday beyond this statement:      “The Johnson family continues to pray for the Archdiocese of Washington, Father Guarnizo, and all Catholics during this time of upheaval. While we understand this letter does not pertain to the events that occurred at our mother's funeral, we are hopeful that Bishop Knestout's decision will ensure that no others will have to undergo the traumatic experiences brought upon our family. We urge all Catholics to put aside political points of view, and pray that our Church will remain in Christ's love.\\"      The interaction between Johnson and Guarnizo, who grew up in Northern Virginia and has spent much of his ministry in Russia and Eastern Europe, triggered intense debate and feelings among Catholics on the Web. Some said being in a same-sex relationship makes someone automatically ineligible for Communion, a moment that Catholicism teaches creates the actual presence of Jesus Christ and is not for people outside of a \\"state of grace.\\" Others said the process of determining a person’s “state of grace” is a far more complex and personal, something between a Catholic and God.      In the days after the funeral Mass, the archdiocese issued an apology to Johnson and sent a letter stating that Guarnizo’s refusal of Communion to her was against the policy of Archbishop Donald Wuerl, who has said it is not the right time or place for a spiritual standoff. But in a public statement published by the Post, the archdiocese seemed to imply that both sides were at fault:      “We believe that to receive Communion, a person should be in the state of grace, which means that they are not conscious of having committed a sin serious enough that it ruptures their relationship with God. As with any relationship, it is not just a one-sided judgment that determines what hurts the relationship with God. This determination is based on what the Church teaches objectively from sacred Scripture and tradition of Christian experience. If a person is conscious of having committed a grave sin, he or she may not receive Communion until they have received absolution in the Sacrament of Reconciliation. A person who is conscious of grave sin but has no opportunity to go to Confession may receive Communion for a serious reason, but first that person must pray to Christ expressing their sorrow, also known as a perfect act of contrition, and have the intention of going to Confession as soon as possible.”      According to Johnson, this weekend's homily from St. John Neumann's pastor, the Rev. Thomas LaHood, repeated that the suspension was unrelated to her case. Some local Catholic bloggers have reacted angrily, though, calling for a boycott of donations to the archdiocese.

Three men charged with conspiring to commit domestic terrorism during the NATO summit were plotting to attack President Obama's Chicago campaign headquarters, the Chicago mayor's home and police stations, authorities said Saturday. A police investigation that began early this month revealed that the three suspects are \\"self-proclaimed anarchists\\" and members of the \\"Black Bloc\\" group who traveled together from Florida to Chicago to commit violence as a protest against the NATO summit, authorities said in a statement. Diplomatic marathon: G8 focusing on Greece; NATO, on Afghanistan. \\"Black Bloc\\" was the group blamed for violence that occurred in recent \\"Occupy\\" protests, such as in Rome last year when anarchists in ski masks torched cars and clashed with police and even other Occupy protesters. The three men were planning to destroy police cars and attack four Chicago police district stations with destructive devices as a way to undermine police response to other planned actions at the NATO summit, according to a statement by Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez and Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy. Downtown Chicago financial institutions were also among the proposed targets, authorities said. An Illinois judge set bail at 1.5 million for each of the three suspects: Brian Church, 22, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Jared Chase, 27, of Keene, New Hampshire; and Brent Betterly, 24, who told police he resides in Massachusetts, authorities said. The three men were charged with material support for terrorism, conspiracy to commit terrorism, and possession of explosives or incendiary devices, authorities said. The three men were arrested Wednesday, and charges were announced Saturday, according to authorities. \\"The individuals that we have charged in this investigation are not peaceful protesters. They are domestic terrorists who came to Chicago with an anarchist agenda to harm our police officers, intimidate our citizens and to attack their politically motivated targets,\\" said Alvarez. According to authorities, Church said he wanted to recruit four groups of four co-conspirators -- or 16 people -- and that reconnaissance had already been done on the Chicago Police Department headquarters. The three men also possessed or built improvised exposive or incendiary devices, a mortar gun, swords, a hunting bow, throwing stars, and knives with brass-knuckle handles, authorities said. In court, prosecutors accused the three men of preparing for \\"violence and destruction,\\" such as stockpiling Molotov cocktails.

Thrun told the court that Church made a remark while assembling the Molotov cocktails: \\"Ever seen a cop on fire?\\" Defense attorney Michael Deutsch accused authorities of \\"police misconduct,\\" saying undercover agents infiltrated a \\"peaceful\\" group. \\"They even bought the makings of Molotov cocktails and gave it to them,\\" Deutsch said in court. Outside of court, he called the case a set-up and an example of \\"entrapment to the highest degree.\\" \\"It is sensationalism by the police and the state to discredit the protesters that have come here to nonviolently protest,\\" the attorney said. The National Lawyers Guild, which says it's representing the three defendants, said Chicago police arrested a total of nine activists Wednesday at a house in Chicago's Bridgeport neighborhood and then released six of them. The guild described the three defendants as \\"Occupy activists\\" and said police provided no evidence of criminal intent or wrongdoing. \\"It's outrageous for the city to apply terrorism charges when it's the police who have been terrorizing activists and threatening their right to protest,\\" attorney Sarah Gelsomino with the lawyers guild and the People's Law Office, said in a statement.

New king speaks of need for unity, solidarity among followers of Islam.","output":"Title: The Passing of King Abdullah: A New Era for Saudi Arabia and a Call for Unity Introduction: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has experienced a significant change in its leadership as King Abdullah has been laid to rest in Riyadh. As the nation mourns the loss of its beloved leader, the kingdom has quickly transitioned by appointing his brother Salman to the throne. With this change comes a renewed focus, as the new King, Salman, emphasizes the importance of unity and solidarity among the followers of Islam. Step 1: Royal burial of King Abdullah The death of King Abdullah marks the end of an era for the Saudi Arabian monarchy. As one of the world's most influential leaders, the late King has been buried in a simple, unmarked grave in Riyadh according to Islamic tradition. This solemn event showcases the deep respect the nation has for its late ruler and his adherence to the customs of the Islamic faith. Step 2: Appointment of new King Salman In a swift move to maintain stability and continuity, the kingdom has appointed King Abdullah's brother, Salman, as the new ruler of Saudi Arabia. As the Crown Prince, Salman was the logical choice to ascend to the throne. The Saudi Arabian council of senior religious scholars, the Ulema, has endorsed the new king, reinforcing his position as the rightful ruler of the nation. Step 3: New king's focus on unity and solidarity among followers of Islam In his first public address, King Salman has emphasized the importance of unity and solidarity among the followers of Islam. This renewed focus indicates the new king's intention to maintain the nation's status as a leader in the Islamic world. By urging solidarity and unity, King Salman aims to promote cooperation and understanding between the different Islamic nations, in order to tackle the challenges and issues the global Islamic community faces today. Step 4: Effects on Saudi Arabia and the Islamic world The transition of power to the new King Salman comes at a time when the Islamic world is grappling with various issues such as extremism, political instability, and socioeconomic challenges. The call for unity and solidarity among the followers of Islam, therefore, has significant implications for Saudi Arabia and the broader Islamic world. Should the king's vision of unity be realized, this shift could facilitate greater collaboration and support between Islamic countries, paving the way for a more united and prosperous global Islamic community. Conclusion: The passing of King Abdullah and the appointment of his brother Salman to the throne represent not only a change in leadership for Saudi Arabia but also a chance to promote unity and solidarity among the followers of Islam. As the new king takes on the responsibilities of leadership, the focus on unity is set to shape the future of both Saudi Arabia and the global Islamic community. It is hoped that this renewed emphasis on cooperation will lead to a brighter and more prosperous era for all involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He was best known for his national radio and television acts between 1937 and 1971, and as host of the television program The Red Skelton Show. He has stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in radio and television, and also appeared in burlesque, vaudeville, films, nightclubs, and casinos, all while he pursued an entirely separate career as an artist. Skelton began developing his comedic and pantomime skills from the age of 10, when he became part of a traveling medicine show. Context: Performing the \\"Doughnut Dunkers\\" routine led to Skelton's first appearance on Rudy Vallee's The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour on August 12, 1937. Vallee's program had a talent show segment and those who were searching for stardom were eager to be heard on it. Vallee also booked veteran comic and fellow Indiana native Joe Cook to appear as a guest with Skelton. The two Hoosiers proceeded to trade jokes about their home towns, with Skelton contending to Cook, an Evansville native, that the city was a suburb of Vincennes. The show received enough fan mail after the performance to invite both comedians back two weeks after Skelton's initial appearance and again in November of that year.  On October 1, 1938, Skelton replaced Red Foley as the host of Avalon Time on NBC; Edna also joined the show's cast, under her maiden name. She developed a system for working with the show's writers: selecting material from them, adding her own and filing the unused bits and lines for future use; the Skeltons worked on Avalon Time until late 1939. Skelton's work in films led to a new regular radio show offer; between films, he promoted himself and MGM by appearing without charge at Los Angeles area banquets. A radio advertising agent was a guest at one of his banquet performances and recommended Skelton to one of his clients.  Skelton went on the air with his own radio show, The Raleigh Cigarette Program, on October 7, 1941. The bandleader for the show was Ozzie Nelson; his wife, Harriet, who worked under her maiden name of Hilliard, was the show's vocalist and also worked with Skelton in skits. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","output":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects about this article. Some of them include: 1. Red Skelton's diverse career: Skelton's career spanned various entertainment fields such as radio, television, as well as working in burlesque, vaudeville, films, nightclubs, and casinos. At the same time, he pursued a separate career as an artist. This highlights Skelton's versatility and adaptability as an entertainer. 2. Early start in pantomime and comedy: Skelton began developing his comedy and pantomime skills at the age of 10, when he joined a traveling medicine show. This early exposure to the world of comedy and entertainment played a significant role in shaping his future career and helped him hone his skills from a young age. 3. Relationship with fellow Indiana native Joe Cook: Skelton's appearance on Rudy Vallee's The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour with fellow Indiana native Joe Cook demonstrates their camaraderie as they traded jokes about their hometowns. Their joint appearance on the show led to them being invited back multiple times due to the positive response from fans. 4. Edna Skelton's role in Red's success: Skelton's wife, Edna, played a crucial part in his career, working alongside him, both on and off the stage. As part of the Avalon Time show, she developed a system for working with the show's writers, selecting and adding material while filing unused content for future use. This demonstrates the strong partnership between the couple, which contributed to Skelton's success. 5. Skelton's self-promotion and the role it played in his radio career: Skelton's persistence in promoting himself and MGM led to opportunities in radio. He appeared without charge at Los Angeles area banquets, eventually catching the attention of a radio advertising agent who recommended him to a client. This perseverance and self-promotion resulted in Skelton getting his own radio show, The Raleigh Cigarette Program, in 1941. These aspects and anecdotes about Red Skelton not only provide a glimpse into his life and career, but also serve as an inspiration for aspiring entertainers and individuals looking to make a mark in their respective fields. Skelton's dedication, hard work, and passion for his craft were key factors that contributed to his long-lasting success in the entertainment industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The poster who called this \\"Plotless and pointless\\" literally took the words I would have used in my subject line. The only thing I'd add is \\"passionless.\\" For a film made by a real life married couple and featuring lots of graphic sex scenes this movie manages to make what should be a sultry situation into one beyond ice cold. Dafoe and Colagrande look bored during the sex scenes, and the viewer might as well take a Valium and have done with it. Also, please, the women in the audience have seen WAY too many used tampons in their time, and any guy who is turned on by seeing Willem Dafoe pull a bloody tampon out of his wife's vagina really needs to get therapy.

Burragorang or Burragorang Valley is a locality in the Macarthur Region of New South Wales, Australia, in Wollondilly Shire, it is home to Lake Burragorang, which is impounded by Warragamba Dam, a concrete gravity dam, creates Lake Burragorang, the primary reservoir for water supply for which Australian city, New South Wales? A:","output":"Yes, I can answer this question. Lake Burragorang is created by the impoundment of water by Warragamba Dam, which is a concrete gravity dam located in the Burragorang Valley, a locality within the Macarthur Region of New South Wales, Australia. This valley is situated within the Wollondilly Shire.  Lake Burragorang serves as the primary reservoir for water supply for the city of Sydney, which is the capital of New South Wales. Sydney is the largest and most populous city in Australia, and it relies heavily on the water stored in Lake Burragorang for its water needs. The reservoir plays a crucial role in providing water to Sydney's residents, industries, and businesses. It offers both water storage and flood mitigation for the surrounding areas. Constructed in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Warragamba Dam is one of the largest domestic water supply dams in the world, and its creation resulted in the formation of Lake Burragorang to store the water. The dam itself is situated on the Warragamba River, which is a major tributary of the Hawkesbury-Nepean River system. This river system ultimately drains into the Tasman Sea, providing a fresh water source for Sydney and its surrounding areas. The Burragorang Valley, which was once a series of lush valleys and river gorges, has been submerged beneath the waters of Lake Burragorang since the dam's construction. The valleys are still visible when water levels are low, offering a fascinating glimpse into the area's past. In conclusion, Lake Burragorang, which is located in the Burragorang Valley of the Macarthur Region in New South Wales, Australia, serves as the primary water supply reservoir for Sydney, the capital city of New South Wales. The lake is created by the impoundment of water by Warragamba Dam, a crucial piece of infrastructure that ensures the water needs of the city and its surrounding areas are met."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What were the full names of the two people who had a partnership together that dissolved? from the following article ?  Douglas practised on his own until 1884, when his son, Colin, became ill. He then took Daniel Porter Fordham into partnership and practised as Douglas & Fordham. Fordham was born around 1846 and had been an assistant in Douglas's office since at least 1872. In 1898, having developed consumption, Fordham retired from the practice and went to live in Bournemouth where he died the following year. He was replaced as partner by Charles Howard Minshull, who had been born in Chester in 1858 and who became articled to Douglas in 1874; the practice became Douglas & Minshull. During the first decade of the 20th century, Douglas became less active but, for reasons which are unknown, the partnership was dissolved in 1909. The practice returned to the title of John Douglas, Architect. Minshull went into partnership with E. J. Muspratt in Foregate Street, Chester. When Douglas died, this partnership worked from the Abbey Square address as Douglas, Minshull & Muspratt.Little is known about Douglas's private life and personality. Only two images of him are known to survive. One is a photograph taken in later middle age. The other is a caricature sketch made by an assistant in his office. This shows him in old age, bowed, bent and bespectacled, carrying a portfolio and an ear trumpet. According to architectural historian Edward Hubbard, Douglas's life \\"seems to have been one of thorough devotion to architecture ... which may well have been intensified by the death of his wife and other domestic worries\\". His obituary in the Chester Chronicle stated that he \\"lived heart and soul in his profession\\".Douglas was a dedicated Christian who regularly attended his local church, St Paul's Church, Boughton, a church he rebuilt. His house, Walmoor Hill, included an oratory. He also had a \\"strong sense of national loyalty\\", incorporating statues of Queen Victoria in niches at Walmoor Hill and in his buildings in St Werburgh Street, Chester.

Math Problem Solve -8842*b - 8807*b + 2160 = -17729*b for b.","output":"Step 1: Combine the terms with the variable b.  We have two terms with the variable b: -8842*b and -8807*b. -8842*b - 8807*b = (-8842 + 8807) * b = 35 * b Now, we have the equation as: 35*b + 2160 = -17729*b Step 2: Move the term with the variable b to one side of the equation. To do this, we'll add 17729*b to both sides: 35*b + 17729*b + 2160 = -17729*b + 17729*b (35 + 17729) * b + 2160 = 0 17764*b + 2160 = 0 Step 3: Solve for b. To isolate b, we will subtract 2160 from both sides: 17764*b = -2160 Now, we'll divide both sides by 17764: b = -2160 / 17764 Step 4: Simplifying the fraction. We can simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 2160 and 17764 is 4. b = (-2160 / 4) / (17764 / 4) b = -540 / 4441 So, the solution for the equation is: b = -540/4441"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and","output":"The sentiment of the given movie review sentence can be assessed as predominantly negative. This negative sentiment stems from several factors, which are key in understanding the reviewer's perspective and their overall opinion of the film's elements, specifically the villains. Firstly, the word \\"generic\\" is used to describe the villains, which implies that they lack originality and creativity. It can be inferred that the reviewer finds the portrayal of the villains to be underwhelming, uninteresting, and perhaps even predictable. Using the term \\"generic\\" also suggests that there might be a reliance on stereotypes or commonly used tropes, which might contribute to the overall negative sentiment. Secondly, the phrase \\"lack any intrigue\\" further strengthens the negative sentiment by emphasizing the absence of any engaging or appealing aspects associated with the villains. This statement implies that the villains are not captivating or developed enough to hold the audience's attention or become invested in their characters. It also denotes that the reviewer perceives the lack of intrigue as a significant shortcoming of the movie. However, the reviewer adds a brief comment in parenthesis, mentioning the \\"funny accents\\" as an exception to their otherwise harsh critique. This statement indicates that there is a slight positive aspect to the characterization of the villains, at least in terms of their accents being perceived as humorous. Nonetheless, this positive element appears to be overshadowed by the overwhelmingly negative sentiments expressed previously. In summary, the sentiment of the movie review sentence is predominantly negative, stemming from the reviewer's critique of the villains as being generic and lacking intrigue. There is a small positive sentiment mentioned, specifically about the accents, but this aspect seems to have limited impact on the overall negative sentiment of the sentence."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but  Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible.  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM,  Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets.  Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings,  Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from  Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew  Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").

Now, Donald was a very rich man who had lots of money. He owned many big buildings and fancy things. But even with all the money he had, Donald Trump sometimes looked kind of sad. Have you ever wondered why?  Well, you see, being a grown-up is not always easy and fun. There are times when grown-ups feel tired, stressed, or even a little sad. When Donald Trump was the president of the United States, he had a very big and important job to do. He had to make decisions that affected many people. That's a lot of responsibility, and it can be tough for anyone, even a rich guy like Donald Trump. In addition to his job, Donald Trump also had many people who didn't agree with him or like him very much. Imagine being in a big room with lots of people talking about you and some of them saying not-so-nice things. It would probably make you feel kind of sad, too. But it's important to remember that everyone feels sad sometimes, even people who seem to have everything they want. The best thing we can do when we're feeling sad is to talk to someone we trust, like a family member or a good friend. They can help us feel better and understand that it's okay to feel sad sometimes. So the next time you see a picture of Donald Trump or hear someone talk about him, remember that even rich people can feel sad, and it's important to be kind and understanding because we all have feelings.

This can include simultaneously employing hand gestures, movement, orientation of the fingers, arms or body, and facial expressions to convey a speaker's ideas. Sign languages often share significant similarities with their respective spoken language, such as American Sign Language (ASL) with American English. Grammar and sentence structure, however, may vary to encourage efficiency and fluidity in speaking. It is important to note that just because a spoken language is intelligible transnationally, such as English in the United States and the United Kingdom, does not mean that the sign languages from those regions are as well; ASL and British Sign Language (BSL) were formed independently and are therefore not mutually intelligible. Is this statement correct \\"is english and spanish sign language the same\\"?","output":"No, the statement \\"is English and Spanish sign language the same\\" is not correct. Sign languages are not direct visual translations of spoken languages; they have their own grammar, syntax, and vocabulary. Just as spoken English and Spanish are distinct languages, their respective sign languages are also different.  In the case of English and Spanish sign languages, there are two widely used sign languages associated with these spoken languages: American Sign Language (ASL) is utilized in the United States and other English-speaking countries such as Canada, while Spanish Sign Language (LSE, \\"Lengua de Signos Española\\") is primarily used in Spain. There are also various regional sign languages in Latin American countries where Spanish is spoken, such as Mexican Sign Language (LSM, \\"Lengua de Señas Mexicana\\") in Mexico, and many others. Each of these sign languages has its own unique characteristics that go beyond the differences between English and Spanish in their spoken forms. It is important also to distinguish between signed languages and signed systems that represent spoken languages. For example, Signed Exact English (SEE) and Signed Spanish are systems where the signs are based on the grammar and syntax of the spoken languages. In these systems, signs represent words, morphemes, or letters from the spoken language and are ordered in the same way as they would be spoken. However, these signed systems do not have the same linguistic complexities as natural sign languages and are often used in educational settings or alongside spoken language for clarity. Thus, English and Spanish sign languages are not the same, as each language serves distinct linguistic communities and possesses its own unique grammar, syntax, and vocabulary that goes beyond merely visually representing the spoken form of the languages."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you're given the title of a story consisting of five sentences, numbered 1 through 5.

Here is a goal: To affix fabric onto wood, you can How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of affixing fabric onto wood, you can follow a series of steps that involve selecting the appropriate fabric, preparing the wood surface, and using the right tools and materials to attach the fabric. Here is a detailed and long answer that outlines the steps to successfully affix fabric onto wood: 1. Select the appropriate fabric: Choose a fabric that complements the wood in terms of color, pattern, and texture. The fabric should be durable, easy to clean, and suitable for the intended purpose. Consider factors such as whether the finished product will be used indoors or outdoors, and whether it will be exposed to direct sunlight, moisture, or other environmental factors. 2. Measure and cut the fabric: Measure the dimensions of the wood surface where the fabric will be attached. Add a few extra inches on each side to account for trimming and folding the fabric edges. Use sharp scissors or a fabric cutter to cut the fabric according to the measurements, ensuring straight lines and clean edges. 3. Prepare the wood surface: Clean the wood surface thoroughly to remove any dust, dirt, or debris. If the wood is unfinished, it is advisable to sand the surface smooth and apply a primer or varnish to seal the wood and protect it against moisture damage. If the wood has an existing finish, make sure it's clean and dry before proceeding with the fabric attachment. 4. Gather tools and materials: To affix the fabric onto the wood, you will need the following tools and materials: - Fabric glue: A strong, clear-drying adhesive that is designed specifically for bonding fabric and other materials. - Staple gun and staples: A staple gun with the appropriate size staples for the thickness of the wood and fabric. - Paintbrush or foam brush: To evenly spread glue over the wood surface. - Scissors: For trimming excess fabric. - Ruler or tape measure: To measure fabric and wood. - Pencil or fabric marker: For marking measurements on fabric. - Clean, lint-free cloth or sponge: To clean the wood surface and remove excess glue. 5. Apply the fabric glue: Using a paintbrush or foam brush, evenly apply a thin layer of fabric glue onto the wood surface. Be sure to cover the entire area where the fabric will be affixed. Make sure to work in small sections to prevent the glue from drying before you attach the fabric. 6. Position the fabric: Carefully position the fabric on the wood surface, making sure it is aligned correctly and free of wrinkles. Gently smooth out the fabric, working from the center outward to ensure even adhesion and to avoid air bubbles. Apply firm pressure to the fabric to ensure proper bonding with the wood and glue. 7. Secure the fabric with staples: Starting at one corner of the wood, use a staple gun to secure the fabric in place. Be sure to pull the fabric tight and fold it neatly around the edges if needed. Space the staples evenly, approximately 1-2 inches apart, along the fabric and wood's perimeter. Try to keep the staples hidden if possible, for a cleaner finish. 8. Trim and fold the fabric edges: Using scissors, trim any excess fabric, leaving enough to fold under and create a clean edge. Fold the edges under and use fabric glue to secure them in place. If necessary, you can also use additional staples to hold the folded edges in place. 9. Allow the glue to dry: Give the fabric glue ample time to dry according to the manufacturer's instructions. This usually ranges from a few hours to overnight. Make sure the glue has set completely before using or displaying your finished project. 10. Finishing touches (optional): For a professional finish, consider adding decorative trim or upholstery tacks around the edges of the fabric. This not only conceals any visible staples but also adds a touch of style and elegance to your project. By following these steps, you will effectively accomplish the goal of affixing fabric onto wood, creating a durable, stylish, and functional finished product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His approval rating is the highest it’s been in years, just as he’s set to open his presidential library at Southern Methodist University. Forty-seven percent of Americans approve of Bush, up from 33 percent when he left office as the economy cratered. Bad news for George W. Bush! His newfound popularity comes, as my colleague Dan Balz notes, because of “the passage of time and Bush’s relative invisibility” rather than any re-evaluation of his record. Majorities still oppose his decision to invade Iraq and disapprove of his handling of the economy. But in the interest of history, let’s take a trip down memory lane and look at Bush’s record, issue by issue, and, of course, in charts. 1. Iraq, Afghanistan, and the war on terrorism. Might as well start with the big one. In 2003, before the invasion, Iraq was a brutal dictatorship suffering under a sanctions regime which, according to UNICEF, killed at least 500,000 children. How does it look in 2013? Well, it’s a dictatorship again, at least according to Freedom House, a highly respected arbiter of regime type. Freedom House rates 2013 Iraq as “not free,” giving it scores of 6 (out of 7, with 7 being as unfree as is possible) on both political rights and civil liberties. By comparison, Russia also gets a 6 on political rights, and a 5 on civil liberties, and many critics believe that Putin is running a dictatorial regime at this point. What explains this? I’ll leave it to Freedom House: Iraq’s political rights rating declined from 5 to 6 due to the concentration of power by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and increasing pressure on the political opposition, as exemplified by the arrest and death sentence in absentia of Vice President Tariq al Hashimi, the country’s most senior Sunni Arab politician. Maliki is obviously less brutal than Saddam Hussein, but still, that’s not exactly the ideal result. As for Afghanistan, it’s a similar story. Hamid Karzai is a step up from the Taliban but the country is still “not free,” according to Freedom House: To be fair to Bush, though, at the end of his tenure the country had snuck into the “partly free” category according to Freedom House. It’s slid back under President Obama. And what did it cost to get there? Well, a lot of money, for one thing. The Cost of War project puts the economic tally of both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars at about 4 trillion – with a “t”. And if we don’t pay off the debt accumulated as a consequence of going to war, the interest alone could add over 7 trillion more to that by 2053: This isn’t all Bush, as Obama made the decision to continue the war in Afghanistan. But Bush set in motion policies that wound up costing about 4 trillion. It’s also cost a lot of lives. The most accurate data we have are on U.S. military casualties: 6,648 service members have died in Iraq and Afghanistan to date, a large majority of the deaths occurring under Bush’s presidency. Civilian casualties are harder to count. The UN mission in Afghanistan estimates that 14,728 civilians died there between 2007 and 2012. That, of course, does not include casualties of the invasion and occupation between 2001 and 2006. Iraq is even harder to track. Iraq Body Count, an NGO devoted to tallying deaths in that war, puts the number at between 112,114 and 122,644. The real number could be much higher. The World Health Organization published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine putting the death toll between 2003 and 2006 at 151,000. The medical journal Lancet published a study in 2006 estimating that around 655,000 had died. That survey in particular was very controversial, but regardless of whether upwards of 600,000, or “only” over 100,000, have died, the war has killed a whole lot of people. And of course, this leaves out harder to quantify costs. The U.S. tortured people in the course of all three wars. We flew people to secret prisons and brutally interrogated them, including by using methods that most people would classify as torture. It’s hard to put a number on that, but it’s a real moral cost. What about the wars’ benefits? Well, it’s hard to say, and harder to quantify. Did the war in Afghanistan reduce terrorist attacks on the United States and related targets? Terrorism as a phenomenon is so extraordinarily rare that it’s quite possible it didn’t, and that’s before taking into account potential recruitment effects due to the invasion, which could have made the overall effect positive. This is a problem for counterterrorism policy more generally. Criminologists Cynthia Lum, Leslie Kennedy, and Alison Shirley did a critical review of the literature in 2008 and found no evidence that any widely used counterterrorism practice actually reduces the incidence of terrorist attacks. Twelve studies found that metal detectors and security screening worked, for instance, but another 13 found they were actually harmful to counterterrorism efforts. All 11 studies on military strikes either found no effect or that the strikes backfired. “Perhaps what is equally (if not more) interesting is what we didn’t find from our review,” they write. “Most interventions have never been evaluated, which speaks to the lack of an evidence base for counter-terrorism policy.” That counts for Obama too, but it underscores a key problem with the war on terrorism, including as it was conducted by Bush: it never relied on evidence-based practices to address the problem at hand. As for Iraq, it is, again, tough to draw conclusions. The country has liberalized considerably, to be sure, but all counterproliferation and counterterrorism benefits touted pre-invasion weren’t forthcoming. Indeed, according to Peter Bergen and Paul Cruickshank, the war actually ended up increasing worldwide terrorism sevenfold, due to copycat attacks and recruitment effects. Overall, the economy under Bush (and Alan Greenspan, and Ben Bernanke) was pretty much all right. Unemployment was low, though not sub-4 percent, as it was under President Clinton: And while growth was under the 4-5 percent rates it was averaging during the 1990s, it was hardly bad: Median compensation (or, wages plus benefits) stagnated after growing under Clinton. The bottom three lines are all real average hourly compensation. Indeed, the Hamilton Project’s Michael Greenstone and Adam Looney find that median annual earnings for men actually fell under Bush, after rising under Clinton. Inequality actually rose more slowly under Bush than it did under Clinton: Poverty increased, after having fallen under Clinton: Extreme poverty continued the upward trajectory it’s been on ever since welfare reform: But then 2008 happened. While almost all of the Great Recession has taken place under Obama’s presidency, the groundwork was laid during George W. Bush’s, and the crisis started in his final year. Take, for instance, housing prices. One root cause of the financial crisis was the continued overvaluation of housing stock in the United States. That really took off when Bush was in office, though it began under Clinton: Interestingly, though, the share of the economy devoted to finance didn’t grow a lot while Bush was president. “Finance and insurance,” in particular, was only 8.2 percent of the economy when Bush took office, and never went above that. The main growth was under Clinton: The most obvious case for Bush’s culpability in the crisis is negligence, that he — or his appointees — should have noticed the housing bubble forming, or the dangers of unregulated securities, and acted to stop them. But Bush was also an active deregulator, as his Securities and Exchange Commission exempted large investment banks from limits on their debt-to-equity ratios in 2004, following a lobbying push by, among others, future Bush Treasury Secretary and then Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson. That led to a sharp increase in the debt-to-equity ratio, or the share of bank assets that are borrowed from somewhere. Many analysts believe high debt-to-equity ratios are the defining danger that caused the crisis, as it increased the damage that certain loans going bad could do to banks. Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig, for example, argue that ratios more like 2 to 1 mean that events like those in 2008 would have just challenged banks rather than sinking them outright. All the same, Bush’s initial response to the crisis was better than some imaginable alternatives, though one could find fault with his administration’s failure to bail out Lehman Brothers, which arguably precipitated the crisis outbreak. He worked with Nancy Pelosi to craft a fiscal stimulus package in early 2008, which some researchers concluded increased consumer spending by an average of 3.5 percent. And, of course, Bush and his Treasury secretary Hank Paulson devised the bank bailout package which Alan Blinder and many others credit with preventing an actual depression. In any case, it’s left us with a lot of debt. Even if you don’t blame the crisis on Bush, at least half the debt is directly attributable to his policy choices. Racking up debt isn’t necessarily a bad thing, and some have even argued that surpluses can be economically dangerous, but for whatever it’s worth, Bush played a big role there: It’s also worth noting that Bush was increasing the deficit at a time when the economy was expanding — which is exactly the opposite of what Keynesians believe makes sense, and which also made it more difficult for the country to respond to the recession. Another enduring legacy of the Bush administration is the creation of the current tax structure. With the exception of some minor changes for earners making above 400,000, or 200,000 if you include changes to some tax deductions, the tax code is roughly as it was after Bush’s second tax cut in 2003. That means a lot less revenue: Even at its highest point, revenue under Bush was a full percentage point of GDP below where it was in 2001. That means billions of dollars in annual lost revenue. If, in 2009, the government had taken in as much revenue as a percent of GDP as it had in 2001, it would have gotten about 600 billion more. What about distribution? Well, let’s take a look at the Tax Policy Center’s distributive breakdown of Senate Republicans’ proposal late last year to extend the tax cuts, relative to letting them expire totally: Millionaires would have gotten an 8.1 percent tax cut, while those making under 10,000 got an average tax cut of 4. Of course, everyone making under 200,000, and most making between 200,000 and 400,000, got this exact deal. The public perception is correct: the Bush tax cuts were heavily tilted to benefit wealthier taxpayers. Under Bush, insurance premiums as paid both by workers and their employers roughly doubled, as you can see in this Kaiser Family Foundation chart: And according to KFF, the percentage of firms offering health benefits fell from 68 percent to 59 percent during his tenure. But Bush did inaugurate Medicare Part D, which has provided prescription drug coverage to 73 percent of Medicare recipients. As this Kaiser chart shows, the program came in way cheaper than expected: Then again, that’s largely because prescription drug prices have fallen due to lackluster pharmaceutical innovation. Bush’s crowning accomplishment in this regard is No Child Left Behind, which established testing standards for all elementary and secondary schools for the first time ever. However, its implementation was been somewhat shaky, with many local districts recoiling against its mandates. One frequent cause of grievance is that, as this New America Foundation chart explains, the Bush administration repeatedly signed budgets that provided less than the authorized funding levels for NCLB: Whether or not that money would have actually helped student achievement is, of course, another question. So what happened to student achievement? On math, it rose.FFourth grade math scores, for example, rose for students of all races: But for reading, the results were less impressive. Here’s fourth grade again, by race: Some progress, but not of the same scale you see with math. The Bush administration was pretty hostile to most efforts to combat climate change, between withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol to needing to be sued for the EPA to do anything to combat it. As a consequence, greenhouse gas emissions continued to rise (update: before falling in 2008/2009, as Brad points out to me): As did the sea level: The overall trend is still troubling, and even if year-to-year temperatures didn’t rise, they’re still higher than they’ve ever been. It’s really really bad, you guys. Map source: PEPFAR Worldwide Activities Map. One bright spot on Bush’s record is the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a program to fight HIV/AIDS in the developing world by, among other things, distributing anti-retroviral drugs, preventing transmission from mothers to children, and preventing initial infection through abstinence and condom programs. It worked. One study found that the program saved 1.2 million peoples’ lives, and reduced HIV-related mortality by about 10 percent. It directly supports 5.1 million peoples’ antiretroviral drug regimens. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The text provides an extensive analysis of George W. Bush's presidency primarily through the use of charts and data, focusing on major topics such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the economy, tax policy, healthcare, education, and climate change. Key insights from the text include the following: 1. The invasion of Iraq did not create a clear improvement in the political situation or the lives of the average Iraqi citizen. 2. The Afghanistan war's effectiveness in reducing terrorism remains unclear. 3. The U.S. economy performed reasonably well under Bush before the financial crisis of 2008, with low unemployment and decent growth. However, income inequality and poverty increased. 4. A significant portion of the U.S. national debt is directly attributable to Bush's policy choices, including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and tax cuts. 5. The Bush tax cuts largely benefited wealthier taxpayers. 6. Health insurance premiums doubled during Bush's tenure, while the percentage of firms offering health benefits declined. 7. No Child Left Behind, a landmark education policy under Bush, had mixed results in terms of improving student achievement. 8. Greenhouse gas emissions and sea levels continued to rise under Bush's administration. 9. PEPFAR, a program to fight HIV/AIDS in the developing world, is considered a success, saving 1.2 million lives and reducing HIV-related mortality by around 10%."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? What are some names you should not name your child? What names are you not allowed to give your child?","output":"While these two questions may seem similar at first glance, they have different implications and contexts, thus, they don't have the same meaning. Let us examine each question individually to clarify the differences between them. 1. What are some names you should not name your child? The first question revolves around the idea of social and cultural norms or personal opinions when naming a child. By asking this question, you are seeking guidance on names that may not be advisable or probably frowned upon by society. The reasons could be due to how these names may impact the child's life emotionally, socially, or psychologically. Some factors to consider include: A. Negative connotations or associations: Names with negative cultural-historical contexts or offensive meanings can potentially cause harm to the child's self-esteem or lead to them being teased or bullied. B. Pronunciation, spelling, and readability: Names that are overly long, complicated to spell, or difficult to pronounce can make life challenging for a child, as they will have to correct people throughout their lives. C. Pop culture references and trends: Names that immediately relate to famous celebrities, fictional characters, or popular trends might lack uniqueness, which can be problematic in the long run as these names can quickly become outdated or burdensome. D. Common insults or offensive terms: Names resembling or identical to commonly used offensive language should not be given to a child to prevent further emotional and social harm. 2. What names are you not allowed to give your child? The second question focuses on the legality and restrictions placed by governments or institutions on naming a child. Some countries have strict regulations on the types of names that are deemed acceptable, and there can be legal consequences for choosing prohibited names. The reasons for these restrictions could be: A. Protection against child's best interest: There is a shared belief among certain countries that some names might put a child in a disadvantaged position or even violate their rights. B. Use of symbols, numbers or profanity: In many countries, names containing symbols, numbers, or profanity are not allowed. C. Titles and trademarks: Names with titles, such as 'Doctor,' 'Major,' or 'Judge,' and trademarks, like 'Nike' or 'Apple,' are restricted in some countries. D. Cultural or religious context: Some countries may have specific regulations based on cultural and religious reasons, which dictate the acceptable naming conventions for a child. In conclusion, while both questions involve choosing suitable names for children, the first question focuses on the importance of considering cultural, social, and personal factors when naming a child. On the other hand, the second question deals with the legalities and restrictions imposed on names by governments or institutions. Thus, the two questions have different meanings, emphasizing the discretionary opinions and rules enforced by society and legislation, respectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In some instances, The Powhatan, may refer to one of the leaders of the people. This is most commonly the case in historical writings by the English. The Powhatans have also been known as Virginia Algonquians, as the Powhatan language is an eastern-Algonquian language also known as Virginia Algonquian. The capital village of \\"Powhatan\\" was believed to be in the present-day Powhatan Hill section of the eastern part of Richmond, Virginia, or perhaps nearby in a location which became part of Tree Hill Farm.  Another major center of the confederacy about 75 miles (121 km) to the east was called Werowocomoco. It was located near the north bank of the York River in present-day Gloucester County.  Werowocomoco was described by the English colonists as only 15 miles (24 km) as the crow flies from Jamestown, but also described as 25 miles (40 km) downstream from present-day West Point, measurements which conflict with each other. In 2003 archaeologists initiated excavations at a site in Gloucester County that have revealed an extensive indigenous settlement from about 1200 (the late Woodland period) through the early Contact period. Work since then has added to their belief that this is the location of Werowocomoco. The site is on a farm bordering on Purtain Bay of the York River, about 12 nautical miles (22 km) from Jamestown. The more than 50 acres (200,000 m2) residential settlement extends up to 1,000 feet (300 m) back from the river. In 2004, researchers excavated two curving ditches of 200 feet (60 m) at the far edge, which were constructed about 1400 CE. In addition to extensive artifacts from hundreds of years of indigenous settlement, researchers have found a variety of trade goods related to the brief interaction of Native Americans and English in the early years of Jamestown.  Around 1609, Wahunsunacock shifted his capital from Werowocomoco to Orapakes, located in a swamp at the head of the Chickahominy River, near the modern-day interchange of Interstate 64 and Interstate 295. Sometime between 1611 and 1614, he moved further north to Matchut, in present-day King William County on the north bank of the Pamunkey River, not far from where his brother Opechancanough ruled one of the member tribes at Youghtanund.","output":"This text is about the Powhatan People, an Indigenous group traditionally from Virginia.

Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said it was \\"improbable\\" that she would stand in the bathroom saying nothing while Mr Pistorius was just 3m (10ft) away shouting at her to call the police.      Mr Pistorius said he could not explain why she had not shouted out.      The athlete, 27, denies murder saying the killing was a terrible accident.      Analysis Oscar Pistorius has been on the stand for an entire week - but the back and forth of cross-examination is where testimony is tested and concessions are made. \\"What would a reasonable person do?\\" This was one of prosecutor Gerrie Nel's questions. The answer could be the difference between negligence and intent - although we're not quite there yet. As he was preparing to wrap up for the day, Mr Nel accused the athlete of creating a version of events that did not happen. \\"She had nothing to be scared of except you,\\" Mr Nel charged, but the accused denied this. The prosecutor pointed out that Mr Pistorius was making \\"mistakes\\", a point the judge also noted. The court would not accept his explanation that the mistakes were a result of him being tired. The state has alleged that the pair had an argument in the bedroom and she ran away from him. We don't have any indication of how the state plans to prove this. Neighbours have testified to hearing \\"loud voices\\".      He admits killing Ms Steenkamp but says he fired his gun after mistaking her for an intruder.      He believed she had been in bed when he grabbed his gun, made his way to the bathroom and fired shots through the door.      The prosecution says he deliberately killed her after an argument.      On the third day of his cross-examination, Mr Nel pressed the South African Olympic sprinter to explain the final moments leading up to the shooting.      He asked why he had not checked whether Ms Steenkamp had heard his calls for her to phone the police, or why he had not taken her to safety instead of going to confront the supposed intruder.      Mr Pistorius said it was his personality to confront what he believed was an intruder.      The trial has been adjourned until Monday morning.      'She was scared of you'      Later, Mr Nel questioned Mr Pistorius's account that he had not heard Ms Steenkamp shout or scream during the whole incident.      \\"When you shouted at Reeva to phone the police, she was 3m away from you in the toilet, but she didn't say anything,\\" he said. \\"Why would she not say anything?\\"      Image copyright AP Image caption Reeva Steenkamp's mother, June, has said Mr Pistorius tried to say sorry to the family privately      Image copyright Reuters Image caption Prosecutor Gerrie Nel began the day asking Mr Pistorius about his alarm system at home      Mr Pistorius said he did not know.      The prosecutor accused the athlete of lying, and said he had shot Ms Steenkamp while she was talking to him from the bathroom.      Gerrie Nel: Fierce prosecutor Image copyright Reuters One of South Africa's most prominent lawyers      More than 30 years' experience      Prosecuted former police boss Jackie Selebi on corruption charges, calling him an \\"arrogant liar\\" during cross-examination Pistorius feels 'bull terrier' bite Pistorius trial: Key players      \\"She wasn't scared of an intruder,\\" he said. \\"She was scared of you.\\"      He went on: \\"Are you sure that Reeva did not scream after the first shot?\\"      Mr Pistorius took a long time to answer, and broke down into sobs.      \\"At no point did Reeva shout out or scream,\\" he said.      Mr Nel then disputed his claim, saying he would not have been able to hear if he had just fired his gun.      Prosecution witnesses have testified to hearing a woman scream, but the defence disputes their testimony.      'Fixated' on intruder      At one point the judge admonished Mr Nel, telling him not to call a witness a \\"liar\\" while he was giving evidence.      The BBC's Pumza Fihlani, at court in the capital, Pretoria, explains that lawyers can say witnesses are lying but not call them liars.      Mr Pistorius told the court he had heard a window opening and closing, and had immediately got out of bed and grabbed his gun.      \\"I told Reeva to get down and phone the police,\\" he said.      Oscar Pistorius: The charges Pre-meditated murder of Reeva Steenkamp on 14 Feb 2013      If found not guilty, the judge automatically considers a charge of culpable homicide, or manslaughter      Discharging a firearm in public at Tasha's restaurant on 11 Jan 2013      Discharging a firearm in public by firing it through a car sunroof on 30 Nov 2012      Illegal possession of 0.38 ammunition He denies all charges Read more      Mr Nel asked if he had not looked at Ms Steenkamp, or asked if she had heard the noise.      \\"My whole being was fixated on this person that I thought was in the bathroom,\\" Mr Pistorius said.      Before the cross-examination resumed on Friday, Mr Nel confirmed that Mr Pistorius had asked to meet Ms Steenkamp's family to apologise for killing her.      The double amputee faces life imprisonment if convicted of murdering the 29-year-old model.      If he is acquitted of murder, the court must consider an alternative charge of culpable homicide, for which he could receive up to 15 years in prison.      Mr Pistorius also faces charges of illegally firing a gun in public and of illegally possessing ammunition, both of which he denies.      There are no juries at trials in South Africa, and his fate will ultimately be decided by the judge, assisted by two assessors. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"In a story, there is a man named Oscar Pistorius who was at a trial.

Write some highlights for the following article: Schoolboy Riley Pearson, six, has been suspended for four days for breaking school rules by having Mini Cheddars in his packed lunch. A six-year-old boy who went to school with a bag of Mini Cheddars in his packed lunch has been suspended for four days after teachers said it contravened its healthy eating policy. Riley Pearson, from Colnbrook, near Slough, was excluded from Colnbrook C of E Primary School after teachers discovered the snack and called in his parents. After a meeting with headmaster Jeremy Meek, they were sent a letter telling them Riley would be excluded from Wednesday until Monday because he had been 'continuously breaking school rules'. The school, which was placed in special measures after Ofsted inspectors deemed it 'inadequate' in 2012, introduced a healthy eating policy at the start of term. A letter was sent to parents saying that from 14 January, packed lunches should be 'healthy and balanced'. Parents were told: 'Chocolate, sweets, crisps and fizzy drinks are not allowed. 'If your child's lunchbox is unhealthy and unbalanced they will be provided with a school lunch for which you will be charged.' Today Riley's mother, airport shuttle worker Natalie Mardle, 24, said: 'We just do not see how they have the right to tell us what we can feed our son. 'If anything, Riley is underweight and could do with putting on a few pounds.' Miss Mardle, who is expecting her fourth child, added: 'Having a balanced diet also includes eating some carbohydrates, sugars and fats. 'It is not about excluding some foods, it is about getting the mix right.' Riley’s lunchbox usually contains a sandwich, yoghurt tube, Dairylea Dunkers cheese spread snack, and a packet of Mini Cheddars, with water to drink. His mother, who lives with his father, airport worker Tom Pearson, said the 3ft 9ins tall schoolboy who weighs 3st 2lbs, eats home-cooked meals and plenty of fruit and vegetables at home. Miss Mardle said: 'I would understand the exclusion if he was constantly throwing tables around or bullying other children, but it is just ridiculous for a packet of Mini Cheddars. 'Not balanced': Riley's lunchbox fell foul of the new health eating policy at Colnbrook C of E primary school. Letter to parents: Riley's parents were sent a letter outlining the reasons for his exclusion by the head, Mr Meek. 'Surely the headteacher has better things to do with his time than search lunchboxes?' Riley's parents, who both work at nearby Heathrow Airport, will be attending a meeting with the head on Tuesday to learn whether their son can return to the 290-pupil school. Headteacher Mr Meek said the school had one family who 'do not agree with the policy.' He said: 'We have had a wonderful response and the parents and children are on board and pleased with the way the policy has been impacted on our pupils. The boy was suspended from Colnbrook C of E Primary School, pictured, for bringing in the snack. 'We cannot talk about individual circumstances, but there is one family who are not prepared to support the policy. 'We are in discussions with them about how we move it forward. We have excluded [the pupil] for four days due to lack of support for the policy. 'It is to avoid putting the children in a difficult situation. If the policy is not being abided by, then that potentially harms that pupil.'","output":"A six-year-old boy named Riley was suspended from school for four days because he had Mini Cheddars in his packed lunch.

Question: Given the following context:  The cartoon starts with the arm of an animator drawing a farm scene. The farm scene then colors itself, and the camera zooms in just as the plot follows:  A realistic-looking horse is seen, whinnying (courtesy of Mel Blanc), and a comic triple plays out: The narrator asks the horse to do a trot; the horse obliges. The narrator asks for a gallop; the horse again obliges. The narrator then asks the horse to do a \\"canter\\". The horse turns from realistic to a cartoon horse, with the bugged eyes of, and singing \\"I'm Happy About the Whole Thing\\" (by Harry Warren and Johnny Mercer) in the style of, the vaudeville star Eddie Cantor, vocally impersonated by Kent Rogers. The narrator admonishes the horse, which grins sheepishly. The family dog is seen lazing on the porch, springing to alertness when the newspaper arrives. The dog makes a mad dash to the end of the driveway, gets the paper, comes back to the porch, and immediately starts to read the paper himself, starting with the Sunday comics. He turns to the audience, and says, \\"I can hardly wait to see what happened to Dick Tracy!\\" (This gag would be used by Clampett again in The Great Piggy Bank Robbery.) A hen leaves her eggs unguarded, and a mean-looking weasel stealthily creeps into the henhouse while the narrator frets. Just as he is about to grab the eggs, they all hatch at once, and the chicks shout \\"BOO!\\" in unison. The frightened weasel evokes a Joe Penner catch-phrase, \\"Don't ever DOOO that!\\" and gasps as his heart pounds.

OPT: (i) yes (ii) it is not possible to tell (iii) no","output":"(ii) it is not possible to tell The given premise \\"okay let's get started\\" is an expression of readiness and agreement to begin a specific task, activity, or event. On its own, this statement is too vague to determine the exact nature of the task that needs to be commenced. Consequently, it is not possible to tell whether initiating a rowing action is directly entailed by this phrase. However, it is important to understand the context surrounding the specific statement. The context in which the phrase is used plays a crucial role in ascertaining the intended meaning and whether it is linked to the hypothesis \\"Let's start rowing the boat.\\" If the conversation or scenario involves participants preparing to row a boat, it is easier to assume that the premise refers to that activity. In such a situation, the hypothesis would hold true. In contrast, if the prior context of the statement involves a different activity or event, such as preparing for a meeting or starting a sports game, then the hypothesis \\"Let's start rowing the boat\\" would not be a reasonable inference. Moreover, there could be multiple possible activities that may be relevant to the given premise, making it unclear which hypothesis is valid, further illustrating the ambiguity of the phrase. To summarize, given the lack of specificity in the premise, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Let's start rowing the boat\\" without any additional information that clarifies the context. The premise may or may not be related to the indicated activity, and drawing a connection between the two solely based on the given statement would be illogical."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It's important that people choose if they want to have children or not. Forcing someone to have kids is not nice. 2. Imagine you have two toy cars, and they are racing in different directions.

The closer the angle is to 0 degrees, the more similar the directions are. But we want to find how different their directions are, which is called cosine distance. To find this, we subtract the cosine similarity from 1. So, 1 minus cosine similarity gives us the cosine distance and tells us how different the directions are.

He pointed out that the shallowness of the epicenter and the density of population greatly increased the severity of the earthquake. Teruyuki Kato, a seismologist at the University of Tokyo, said that the seismic waves of the quake traveled a long distance without losing their power because of the firmness of the terrain in central China. According to reports from Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, the earthquake tremors lasted for \\"about two or three minutes\\".\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"The statement that you referred to as being quoted within the given context is by Japanese seismologist Yuji Yagi at the University of Tsukuba. His quotes cover a detailed explanation of the nature and impact of a particular earthquake. The initial part of his quote describes the technical aspects of the earthquake -- that it occurred in two stages along the Longmenshan Fault, clarifying further that the fault line tore in two sections. The first section of this fault line tore approximately seven yards, followed by a second section that sheared about four yards. His quote shows a precise description of the earthquake's progression, providing an indication of the intimidating power behind the natural catastrophe. In addition to sharing specific details about the earthquake's progression, Yagi also discussed its duration and energy release. He reported that the earthquake lasted about two minutes. Furthermore, he indicated that this was an immensely powerful earthquake since it unleashed 30 times the energy of the Great Hanshin earthquake of 1995 in Japan, a disastrous event in its own right that resulted in the death of over 6,000 people. The second part of his quote discusses more about the impact of the earthquake on the population. Yagi highlighted that the severity of the earthquake was amplified due to the shallowness of its epicenter and the density of the population in the affected areas.  Another seismologist, Teruyuki Kato from the University of Tokyo, contributed to the conversation explaining that the seismic waves of the quake traveled a long distance without losing their power because of the firmness of the terrain in central China.  Lastly, reports from Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, confirmed that the earthquake's tremors lasted \\"about two or three minutes\\".

The game can be played for free, but nearly all in-game activities require personal resources that you have available to use.Although there are various activities to keep you busy on Calypso, what most people do first is to find themselves a profession, such as hunting the fierce animals on Calypso, mining the precious minerals and making tools.Then they can think about buying their virtual house or paying a visit to a virtual nightclub or doing any of the other activities that make life bearable. Entropia has its very own economy   and its own currency, the PED (Project Entropia Dollars).Players move real world money into PED which they then use to pay for their life on Calypso.However, the virtual things inside Entropia do have a real value in the outside world, and careful business deals mean that players can actually make real money there.PED can be changed into dollars any time at a rate of 10PED to 1US. What's so impressive about The Entropia Universe is the number of players; currently more than 600,000 representing over 220 countries from planet Earth.A number of players insist that it's a good way to make money.However, the reality of Entropia's economic system is that most people end up paying more than they earn and it's not uncommon to find players who are paying up to 200 a month into their PED account.This might not be the most economical way of spending one's free time.However, some people say that for them the fact that they can escape the realities of the earthbound life and become a different person with a completely different life for a few hours every week is...

First, let's get rid of the 530 from the right side of the equation. To do that, we will subtract 530 from both sides: 570 - 530 = -10*l + 530 - 530 2. Now, it simplifies to: 40 = -10*l 3. Next, we need to get \\"l\\" all by itself. Since it's being multiplied by -10, we can do the opposite by dividing by -10 on both sides: 40 / -10 = (-10*l) / -10 4.

Paragraph: Einstein was displeased with quantum theory and mechanics (the very theory he helped create), despite its acceptance by other physicists, stating that God \\"is not playing at dice.\\" Einstein continued to maintain his disbelief in the theory, and attempted unsuccessfully to disprove it until he died at the age of 76. In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser. This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws. Einstein discovered Louis de Broglie's work, and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for de Broglie waves, which Einstein suggested was the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of mechanics. This paper would inspire Schrodinger's work of 1926.

Several theme parks even have accommodation  so you can stay for a day or two if you want to make a trip into a short holiday. Prices for UK theme parks vary considerably; some have an entrance price which allows you to go on all the rides, while in others you have to pay for every ride individually. It can also make a difference whether you go during peak time or not. For example, tickets always cost more during school holidays and weekends than they do during the weekdays. Theme parks always get very busy during the summer months, so if you don't like crowds, it's usually a good idea to go earlier or later in the year!

Answer the following question: For most substances, when the temperature of the solid is raised high enough, the substance changes to a liquid, and when the temperature of the liquid is raised high enough, the substance changes to a gas. We typically visualize a solid as tiny particles in constant motion held together by attractive forces. As we add heat to the solid, the motion, or the kinetic energy, of the particles increases. At some temperature, the motion of the particles becomes great enough to overcome the attractive forces. The thermal energy that was added to the solid up to this point was absorbed by the solid as kinetic energy, increasing the speed of the molecules. The lowest temperature at which the particles are able to exist in the liquid form is called the melting point .  As a science experiment for his school homework, Kendra is putting two ice cubes on separate pans and then putting those pans on burners set to different temperatures. Ice cube A is set on top of a burner set to a low temperature, and ice cube B is placed on a burner set quite a bite higher. One minute later, Kendra begins writing down what she sees happening to the ice cubes.  Which ice cube will melt faster? Answer:","output":"Ice cube B will melt faster.  Here is why: The scenario provided that heat is being applied to both ice cubes, but at different intensities. Burner B is set at a higher temperature compared to Burner A. Given the nature of matter when heated, the ice cube set at the higher temperature (Ice Cube B) will absorb more thermal energy per unit time than Ice Cube A.  The added thermal energy increases the kinetic energy of the water molecules in the ice, making them move faster. When their movement overcomes the attractive forces that keep them in a solid state (ice), the substance changes to a liquid (water), a process known as melting.  Therefore, since Ice Cube B is exposed to a larger amount of heat energy in the same time period as Ice Cube A, the water molecules in it will gain enough kinetic energy to overcome attractive forces keeping them solid faster compared to Ice Cube A. As such, Ice Cube B will change from solid to liquid form, or in other words, melt faster than Ice Cube A."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: how many qfc stores are there I found the following answer on Google: Quality Food Centers (QFC) is a supermarket chain based in Bellevue, Washington , with 64 stores in the Puget Sound region of Washington state and in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area.

With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\"  Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works.

You can feed your quail many types of food including fruits, vegetables, seeds, small bugs, greenery and table scraps.  Quail can even eat meat if you want them to.  Quail are quite fussy when it comes to treats. But don’t worry, they’ll eat what they like and leave what they dislike so you will soon get to know what to feed them. Remember to dispose of foods that the quail do not eat instead of leaving them to waste away in the quails home. Make sure the water container isn't too deep or big for the quail and that it is in an easy to get to place. You should clean the container at least once a week to prevent a build-up of bacteria. Quail should not eat avocado, caffeine, alcohol, chocolate, salty or sugary treats, uncooked potato, tomato leaves and stems, parsley, citrus fruits and grape seeds as these all are toxic to quail.  Some types of plants are toxic to quail as well, so be aware of what plants you put in their habitat. Do not worry too much on what not to feed your quail as they will avoid toxic foods unless they are at the point of starving hungry.","output":"This article explains that quail can eat a variety of food like bird crumbles, fruits, vegetables, seeds, bugs, and table scraps, but they should avoid toxic foods like avocado, caffeine, alcohol, and certain plants, and it's important to keep their water clean and not too deep."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Last week I received a telephone call from a woman who could not stop crying as she told me that one of my stories had saved her son from committing suicide. In closing she called me a hero.      That got me thinking about what a hero is. Was I a hero because I pulled a family from a burning car? If so, how could I be a hero just because I wrote a story that saved someone's life?      Today I decided to look up the word \\"hero\\" in the dictionary to see exactly what it meant. It read \\"a person who does. something brave\\". As I read on, it also said \\"a person who is good and noble \\".      That statement impressed me more than the part about being brave. So I thought about something very important. Say I was walking into the local Wal-Mart Store and I happened to open, and hold the door for someone as a _ . As they passed me by, I say, \\"How are you today?\\" Most of the time that would be no big deal, but this time let's say it was for someone who was deeply depressed and near the end of the rope. That may have very well been the only kindness or courtesy shown to them in a very long time.      Having been near \\"the end of my rope\\", after my marriage of twenty years ended, I was in such a condition. I was within hours trying to get enough courage to end the pain and misery. When I returned home, someone had sent me a card in the mail which told me how much they would appreciate me as a friend. That wonderful card probably saved my life. That person, without even knowing it, saved a life and became a hero.      Gee, who would have ever thought that anyone can become a hero, and possibly save a life just by being kind and courteous to others? The best part of all is that becoming a hero is free to all who wish to wear such an honor.

The satellite , which carried a payload of both C band and Ku band transponders , was launched on June 24 , 1993 and operated by PanAmSat Corporation . Control of Galaxy IV was lost on May 19 , 1998 when the satellite 's primary control processor failed . The backup control processor had suffered a previously undetected anomaly , and PanAmSat was not able to regain control of the spacecraft . Galaxy IV was declared a loss on May 20 , 1998 . Failure of the primary control processor was attributed to tin whisker growth , a phenomenon in which tendrils grow from solder , causing an electrical short circuit . Engineers believe that a hole developed in the conformal wax coating over the solder , allowing whiskers to develop . The satellite manufacturer , Hughes , has replaced pure tin plating with nickel to alleviate the problem in newer designs , adding 45 to 90 kg per payload . The loss of this satellite was very disruptive to telecommunications in the United States . Pagers were affected greatly ; service was not restored for days . Wire news services , like Reuters , were also affected . The TV network CBS had to use alternate means of transmitting its programs , as did NPR . At the time of failure , Galaxy IV was in geostationary orbit at 99 ° W. This orbital slot was briefly occupied by Galaxy 4R , and is now occupied by the Galaxy VI satellite . Galaxy IV remains in space .  - An Internet service provider (ISP) is an organization that provides services for accessing and using the Internet. Internet service providers may be organized in various forms, such as commercial, community-owned, non-profit, or otherwise privately owned.  - Univision is an American Spanish language broadcast television network that is owned by Univision Communications. The network's programming is aimed at Latino Americans and includes telenovelas and other drama series, sports, sitcoms, reality and variety series, news programming, and imported Spanish-language feature films.  - In telecommunication, a transponder is one of two types of devices. In air navigation or radio frequency identification, a flight transponder is an automated transceiver in an aircraft that emits a coded identifying signal in response to an interrogating received signal. In a communications satellite, a satellite transponder receives signals over a range of uplink frequencies usually from a satellite ground station, amplifies them, and re-transmits them on a different set of downlink frequencies to receivers on Earth, often without changing the content of the received signal or signals.  - The former PanAmSat Corporation founded in 1984 by Reynold (Rene) Anselmo, was a satellite service provider headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut. It operated a fleet of communications satellites used by the entertainment industry, news agencies, internet service providers, government agencies, and telecommunication companies. Anselmo got the idea for PanAmSat from Norm Leventhal, a communications lawyer in Washington, D.C., to whom he had turned to for advice regarding difficulties he was encountering in getting reasonably priced satellite transmission for his Spanish International Network (SIN), the current-day Univision. Anselmo financed the entire project himself and Leventhal's law firm, hiring Martin Rothblatt for special satellite technical advice, filed for approval from the Federal Communications Commission and lining up an initial satellite from RCA Astro-Electronics and a heavily discounted launch from Arianespace.  - A communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunications signals via a transponder; it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on Earth. Communications satellites are used for television, telephone, radio, internet, and military applications. There are over 2,000 communications satellites in Earths orbit, used by both private and government organizations.  - Greenwich is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States.

Hypothesis: The 1977 Gillette Cup lasted more than two months.","output":"Upon reading the provided paragraph, we can collect the necessary information to determine if the hypothesis is true or not. The relevant information from the paragraph is as follows: 1. The 1977 Gillette Cup began on 29 June 1977. 2. The 1977 Gillette Cup ended on 3 September 1977. Now we can compare the lengths of time: Starting date: 29 June 1977 Ending date: 3 September 1977 Here is a breakdown of the months and days involved: 1. From 29 June to 30 June: 1 day (end of June) 2. July: 31 days (full month) 3. August: 31 days (full month) 4. From 1 September to 3 September: 3 days (beginning of September) To get the total duration of the tournament, we add up the days: 1 day + 31 days + 31 days + 3 days = 66 days Now we can compare this to the hypothesis. The hypothesis states that the 1977 Gillette Cup lasted more than two months. As we know, there are generally 30 or 31 days in a month. In this context, \\"more than two months\\" means over 60 days (since 30 days x 2 = 60 days).

Poachers  and hunters have killed off hundreds of thousands of elephants to obtain this precious material. Now, affected areas are taking action. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) announced on Wednesday that key states where poaching takes place have promised to stop the ivory trade and protect Africa's elephants. In the 1980s, as many as 1 million elephants across Africa were killed for their ivory tusks. This continued until 1989, when the Convention on International Trade in Species (CITES) voted to ban all trade in ivory. With trade , demand for ivory fell. Elephant populations slowly began to increase. However, this progress was short-lived. According to the IUCN, 2011 saw the highest levels of poaching and illegal ivory trading in at least 16 years. Around 25,000 elephants were killed in Africa that year. Preliminary data from the IUCN shows even higher levels of illegal trade may have been reached in 2013. \\"With about 22,000 elephants illegally killed in 2012, we continue to face a critical situation,\\" said John E. Scanlon, CITES Secretary-General. \\"Current elephant poaching in Africa remains far too high, and could soon lead to local extinctions if the present killing rate continues.\\" At the African Elephant Summit, key African states where elephants make their home agreed to develop a \\"zero-tolerance attitude\\" towards poaching. The deal calls for maximum sentences for poachers and hunters, and increased cooperation between affected states. Officials are determined to classifying wildlife trading as a serious crime -- and to making sure that the people who commit it are punished. All participants at the conference agreed to sign the deal. With these states coming together, there may yet be hope for elephants. (293 words) What's the best title for this passage?

Former England boss Terry Venables has called on Premier League managers to stop interfering with the selection of their top international stars. Liverpool have been in the spotlight recently after media reports suggested  Brendan Rodgers asked Roy Hodgson to rest Raheem Sterling for England's Euro 2016 qualifying fixture against Estonia last week. Rodgers denied those claims and played down any club-versus-country row, but writing in the Independent on Sunday, Venables said Hodgson should not have to consult Premier League managers when selecting players. Former England assistant manager Terry Venables (pictured next to Steve McClaren) has told Premier League managers to let Roy Hodgson decide who is selected for the national team Liverpool boss OPTIONS: - Brendan Rodgers believes England manager Hodgson could have dealt with Sterling differently - England believes England manager Hodgson could have dealt with Sterling differently - Estonia believes England manager Hodgson could have dealt with Sterling differently - Euro 2016 believes England manager Hodgson could have dealt with Sterling differently - Hodgson believes England manager Hodgson could have dealt with Sterling differently - Independent believes England manager Hodgson could have dealt with Sterling differently - Liverpool believes England manager Hodgson could have dealt with Sterling differently - Premier League believes England manager Hodgson could have dealt with Sterling differently - Raheem Sterling believes England manager Hodgson could have dealt with Sterling differently - Rodgers believes England manager Hodgson could have dealt with Sterling differently - Roy Hodgson believes England manager Hodgson could have dealt with Sterling differently - Steve McClaren believes England manager Hodgson could have dealt with Sterling differently - Terry Venables believes England manager Hodgson could have dealt with Sterling differently - Venables believes England manager Hodgson could have dealt with Sterling differently","output":"Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers believes England manager Hodgson could have dealt with Sterling differently. Venables' opinion on this matter clearly highlights the ongoing issue of club managers attempting to influence international selections to protect their own interests. However, national team managers have the responsibility to pick the best available players for their country, regardless of club pressure. It is essential for the success of a national team, such as England, that they are able to choose from their best talent without restrictions or interference from club managers.  In the case of Raheem Sterling, Rodgers may have had concerns over the fitness and workload of one of his key players, but ultimately, it should be up to Hodgson to evaluate Sterling's condition and make the final decision on whether or not to include him in the squad. The relationship between club and country managers is crucial, and communication between both parties is necessary for the well-being and career progression of the players involved. However, there has to be a balance to ensure the integrity of international football remains protected. Open lines of communication between club managers and national team managers can be beneficial, but it should never be a situation where the club manager dictates who should or should not be selected. In an ideal world, club managers would prioritize the long-term development of their players and understand that representing their country can be an incredible honor and opportunity to improve. This may require clubs to be more understanding and cooperative, and to also have faith in the national team staff when it comes to the management and treatment of players during international breaks. While Premier League managers may be looking out for their club's best interests by protecting their players from potential injuries or overexertion during international fixtures, the national team managers have a responsibility to their country as well. Both parties need to find common ground to ensure that players are not caught in the middle of a club-versus-country dispute. In conclusion, the most logical way to complete the passage is to acknowledge Brendan Rodgers' perspective, but also emphasize that national team managers, like Roy Hodgson, have the ultimate authority in the selection process and should not be influenced by club managers. The best interests of the player, club team, and national team should all be taken into consideration, with open communication and cooperation being key components in successfully managing club-versus-country issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the context: How would Kendall feel as a result? A:","output":"Kendall, having his claims of medical unfitness dismissed by Austin, would be sent off to war with a multitude of emotions, thoughts, and feelings. Let's analyze these potential reactions by focusing on the key components, including psychological and emotional responses, as well as potential implications of Austin's decision on Kendall's mindset: 1. Fear and Anxiety: Being sent to war when one believes they are unfit for it, whether medically or psychologically, can generate intense feelings of fear and anxiety. Kendall might be afraid of the physical threats and dangers typically associated with warfare, including injuries, disabilities, or even death. Moreover, the general uncertainty and unpredictable nature of a war zone might exacerbate these emotions. 2. Resentment and Frustration: Kendall would likely feel resentment and frustration toward Austin for not taking his claims seriously. He might view Austin's decision as unsympathetic, callous, or ignorant of his challenges. This could lead to internal tension between respecting authority and dealing with feeling undervalued or dismissed. 3. Despair and Helplessness: In addition to his potential resentment toward Austin, Kendall may feel abandoned and helpless, especially when faced with the overwhelming nature of war. This sense of despair could stem from feeling like he has no control over his situation or any way of preventing the potential dangers that lie ahead. 4. Insecurity and Self-Doubt: Being sent to war despite expressing unfitness might lead Kendall to question his own abilities and self-worth. This situation may cause him to doubt whether he can successfully complete his military duties or cope with the physical and psychological aspects of war. This growing insecurity could affect his confidence and overall well-being. 5. Isolation and Loneliness: Kendall may feel isolated by Austin's dismissal of his concerns, perhaps even feeling as though his peers and superiors don't understand or care about his struggles. This emotional isolation can cause him to feel lonely and unsupported in a time when camaraderie and trust in fellow soldiers are crucial to staying strong. 6. Determination and Perseverance: Although the situation may be highly distressing, Kendall may find a way to channel his emotions into determination and perseverance. He could use the feelings of resentment and fear as motivation to prove himself capable, or simply to survive the war and return home safely. 7. Hope: Despite the negative emotions and overwhelming feelings, Kendall might hold onto hope that he will be able to endure the war and emerge stronger or more resilient. This hope could be a significant coping mechanism that helps him navigate the challenges of war and face his fears. In summary, Kendall's experience of being sent off to war despite his perceived medical unfitness, due to Austin's disbelief, would likely lead to a flurry of complex emotions and psychological responses. These could range from fear, anxiety, frustration, and resentment, to feelings of despair, insecurity, and isolation. Though holding onto hope and embracing determination may help Kendall cope with the difficult situation, it's important to acknowledge and address the profound impact that being thrust into war under such circumstances can have on a person's mental and emotional well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The referee may punish a player's or substitute's misconduct by a caution (yellow card) or dismissal (red card). A second yellow card at the same game leads to a red card, and therefore to a dismissal.

The captain recruits the three men as scouts. Also at the fort is Corrina Marston, waiting for her missing husband, Colonel Frank Marston. Jed quickly falls in love with Mrs. Marston, sensing her ambivalence about her husband; when the colonel returns, he is revealed to be an unmitigated tyrant. Colonel Marston is driven to redeem himself after a disastrous battle at Shiloh, where over a thousand of his men were killed unnecessarily.

Randy Evan Barnett (born February 5, 1952, in Chicago) is an American lawyer, law professor at Georgetown University Law Center, where he teaches constitutional law and contracts, and legal theorist. He writes about the libertarian theory of law and contract theory, constitutional law, and jurisprudence. After attending Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Barnett worked as a prosecutor in Chicago, Illinois. Barnett's first academic position was at the Chicago-Kent College of Law of the Illinois Institute of Technology. Section 1. All persons are equally free and independent, and have certain natural, inherent and unalienable rights which they retain when forming any government, amongst which are the enjoying, defending and preserving of their life and liberty, acquiring, possessing and protecting real and personal property, making binding contracts of their choosing, and pursuing their happiness and safety.Section 2. The due process of law shall be construed to provide the opportunity to introduce evidence or otherwise show that a law, regulation or order is an infringement of such rights of any citizen or legal resident of the United States, and the party defending the challenged law, regulation, or order shall have the burden of establishing the basis in law and fact of its conformity with this Constitution.  The amendment is a direct cousin of the Tenth Amendment, but it applies to the people of the U.S. and not the states.  Section 1 puts the Declaration of Independence into coded law. That includes its preamble, which allows for people to live their lives the way they see fit. The proposed right of \\"making binding contracts of their choosing\\" would appear to resurrect the legal doctrine of economic due process, which during the Lochner era, was used by the Supreme Court to strike down a wide variety of state and federal laws affecting business, including child-labor and minimum-wage laws.  Section 2 allows all legal persons of the United States to challenge any law that restricts their rights, and puts the burden of proof (fact) on federal, state, and local governments to argue otherwise. Any attempt to establish the constitutionality of any law is thus rested within the government.

It was intended to assist coma patients but is shown to actually be able to bring the dead back to life. With the assistance of their friends, Niko, Clay,  and videographer Eva, they run a successful trial on a recently deceased dog. However, they notice that the dog is behaving differently than it did when it was alive: its cataracts disappear, it loses its appetite, and it demonstrates other strange abilities. Tests reveal that the serum, instead of dissipating, is constructing strange new synapses within the dog's brain. When the dean of their university learns of their underground experiments, their project is shut down. They are also informed that a major pharmaceutical corporation has bought out the company that funded their research. The company and their attorneys confiscate everything associated with the project. Frank and his team sneak back into their lab to duplicate the experiment so that they can prove that they created the serum. During this attempt, things go horribly wrong and Zoe is fatally electrocuted. Unwilling to let her go, Frank uses the serum to resurrect her.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who might have assisted with the underdrawing in Van der Weyden's workshop? from the following article ?  The Annunciation draws heavily on van der Weyden's 1430s Louvre Annunciation, his c. 1455  Saint Columba altarpiece, and the Clugny Annunciation (c. 1465–75), which is attributed to either van der Weyden or Memling. Memling almost certainly was apprenticed to van der Weyden in Brussels until setting up his own workshop in Bruges sometime after 1465. Memling's Annunciation is more innovative, with motifs such as the attendant angels that were absent in the earlier paintings. According to Till-Holger Borchert, not only was Memling familiar with van der Weyden's motifs and compositions, but he might have assisted with the underdrawing in van der Weyden's workshop. The shutters on the right are copied from the Louvre panel, the knotted curtain appears in the Columba triptych's \\"Annunciation\\".A sense of movement is conveyed throughout. The trailing edges of Gabriel's garment fall outside the pictorial space, indicating his arrival. The Virgin's \\"serpentine\\" pose, with attendant angels supporting her, adds to the sense of flow. Memling's use of color achieves a startling effect. The traditional rays of light are replaced with light color indicators; the white clothes rendered in \\"icy\\" blue, the angel to the right in yellow patches seems \\"bleached by light\\", the left-hand angel appears to be steeped in shadow, dressed in clothes of lavender and bearing deep green wings. The effect is iridescent, according to Blum, who writes, \\"this shimmering surface gives [the figures] an unearthly quality, separating them from the more believable world of the bedchamber.\\" The effect deviates from the pure naturalism and realism which typifies Early Netherlandish art, causing a \\"startling\\" juxtaposition, an effect that is \\"unsteadying\\" and contradictory.

Some plants open their leaves during the day. It is during these hours the plant can collect sunlight. At night, the plant closes its leaves to prevent water loss. Many plants respond to the change in the length of the day. As days grow shorter, some plants respond by going dormant. Dormant is when a plant suspends its growth. It does this in order to survive. Shorter days signal the coming of winter. Winter in most areas means extreme cold. It is also very dry in the winter months. As winter approaches, some plants respond by their leaves changing color. After the change in color, they fall off. This dormancy period helps trees. It allows them to survive the cold and dry winter. Plants only want to grow when conditions are right.

It could be any one of these four finalists By Gary Strauss, USA TODAY After thousands of auditions and weeks of performances, NBC's America's Got Talent is down to four acts competing for the Season 5 crown. Tonight (9 ET/PT), three singers and a novelty group seemingly destined for Las Vegas perform for a final time, with a winner to be crowned following Wednesday's two-hour finale (8 p.m. ET/PT). USA TODAY talks to the four finalists ahead of tonight's performances. The angelic 10-year-old with the preternaturally mature voice came late to AGT, among 12 performers selected for an August show based on YouTube video submissions. Evancho's operatic performances have wowed viewers ever since. \\"I don't know where it comes from,\\" Evancho says. \\"It's just a gift from God, I think.\\" Evancho discovered a singing ability after watching Phantom of the Opera as a 7-year-old in Lincoln Township, Pa. She has performed at local talent concerts and Pittsburgh Pirates games. No matter how she does tonight, Evancho — who released the album Prelude to a Dream in November and will perform at Carnegie Hall's Christmas Carol show in December — hopes to make singing a career. \\"I really haven't figured out a plan, but I would like to do concerts and stuff,\\" she says. For now, the fifth-grader — whose performances have pulled in nearly 20 million YouTube views — is looking forward to going home. \\"I'll be glad when this is over. There's a lot of stuff to concentrate on.\\" Part Kabuki theater, part Blue Man Group, Fighting Gravity features 13 Virginia Tech fraternity brothers who have forgone their fall semester to compete on AGT. \\"The worst part was letting down our parents,\\" says Gregg Curtin, a senior from Falls Church, Va. \\"But we all think we're learning life skills about teamwork and time management that you can't learn in school.\\" Like Jackie Evancho and Prince Poppycock, Fighting Gravity was discovered virally, after five original group members performed at a campus talent show. Their subsequent AGT performances have featured crowd-pleasing, over-the-top choreographed moves that the competition's judges say are ideal for the big Las Vegas show venues that all four final acts hope to secure. Fighting Gravity already has received an offer to play Vegas' Hard Rock Cafe on New Year's Eve. \\"We're still debating it,\\" Curtin says. \\"But we're focusing on things one day at a time.\\" The choreography and lighting — done without professional help — is all-consuming. \\"It can be incredibly draining, working 14-hour days,\\" he says. Bluesy singer Grimm didn't make it through an early round of America's Got Talent last year. He auditioned again this year to honor his grandparents, Tom and Laura Butters, who raised him but are still reeling after losing their southern Mississippi home to Hurricane Katrina. \\"I'm surprised and grateful to make it this far,\\" says Grimm, who began singing and playing guitar at local bars at age 12. He's spent the past decade working smallish restaurants and lounges in Las Vegas. His biggest pre-AGT gig? Opening for rock band Heart in 2006. \\"Nothing compares to this show,\\" says Grimm, 30, a self-described nerd whose interests include everything from stamp collecting to panning for gold with his girlfriend, Lucie. AGT is opening potential offers, including recording deals and offers to play larger venues. \\"Everything I've been working for my whole life, it's been an uphill climb. I see the summit in front of me. I'm almost there,\\" he says. If he wins, Grimm plans to buy a home for his grandparents: \\"Hopefully this will get me to the point where I can do something for them.\\" The flamboyant, over-the-top alter ego of John Quale is part performance artist, part opera singer, a persona developed for a 2006 nightclub gig. AGT producers found a Poppycock performance on the Internet and encouraged him to audition. Since widespread exposure on summer's top-rated series, the campy character has gained fans \\"from little kids to grandmothers,\\" he says. \\"The huge outpouring of love has been incredible.\\" Quale isn't talking about how he'll top last week's semifinals performance, a Liberace-fused homage to Uncle Sam. \\"Hopefully it will be a fitting finale performance for this crazy journey that Poppycock has gone on,\\" says Quale, 32. The Los Angeles store clerk, normally shy and reserved, undergoes a massive personality change as Poppycock. \\"I can be dark and withdrawn at times, but when I am Poppycock, I can make fun of myself in a way that people can join in on.\\" Post- AGT, Quale hopes to record a second album and perform stage shows. \\"Offers have started to come in, but I need to be focused on (tonight).\\" You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Question: where does cellular respiration occur I found the following answer on Google: The overall reaction is broken into many smaller ones when it occurs in the body, most of which are redox reactions themselves. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"No, the answer you found on Google does not directly address the question of where cellular respiration occurs. Cellular respiration is a process that occurs primarily in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. It is a series of metabolic reactions that convert nutrients, like glucose, into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the energy currency of the cell. The process can be broadly categorized into three main stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (also called the citric acid cycle or the tricarboxylic acid cycle), and the electron transport chain (oxidative phosphorylation). 1. Glycolysis: This process takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell and does not require oxygen. Glycolysis involves the breakdown of one molecule of glucose (a six-carbon sugar) into two molecules of pyruvate (a three-carbon compound). The process generates a net gain of two ATP molecules and two molecules of the electron carrier NADH. 2. Krebs Cycle: The Krebs cycle occurs in the matrix of the mitochondria. Each pyruvate molecule produced during glycolysis is converted into an acetyl-CoA molecule, which then enters the Krebs cycle. The cycle consists of a series of redox reactions that produce energy-rich molecules like NADH and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2). These molecules are used in the next stage of cellular respiration to generate more ATP. The Krebs cycle also releases two molecules of ATP along with carbon dioxide as a waste product. 3. Electron Transport Chain (Oxidative Phosphorylation): The final stage of cellular respiration takes place in the inner membrane of the mitochondria. The electron carriers NADH and FADH2 generated in the previous stages donate their electrons to the electron transport chain, which powers the synthesis of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. Oxygen serves as the final electron acceptor in the chain, and water is the waste product. This stage is responsible for generating the majority of the ATP produced during cellular respiration, approximately 32-34 ATP molecules per molecule of glucose. In conclusion, cellular respiration mainly occurs in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. Individual processes like glycolysis occur in the cytoplasm of the cell, while the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain are localized within the mitochondria."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They both loved to help people in their own ways. Erin was a kind-hearted girl who loved to share her smiles, hugs, and laughter with everyone she met. She believed that helping others didn't need a price tag, and so she offered her time and energy for free. Erin was like a little sunshine, brightening up everyone's day with her kindness. Jennifer, on the other hand, liked the idea of turning her helpful skills into a little business. She decided to charge for her time because she believed that people would value and appreciate her help more if they paid for it. Jennifer was a very organized girl, and she always made sure to schedule her appointments and manage her time wisely. One sunny afternoon, a little boy named Timmy needed help with his homework. He had a difficult math problem that he just couldn't figure out. Timmy knocked on Erin's door, and she welcomed him with a warm hug. \\"Of course, I'll help you, Timmy!\\" Erin said, her eyes sparkling with enthusiasm. Together, they sat down and tackled the math problem. Timmy couldn't believe how fast Erin helped him understand the math problem, and he thanked her with a big smile. Later that day, Timmy's older sister Sarah needed help with her science project. She was feeling the pressure because it was due the very next day. Remembering how helpful Jennifer was known to be, Sarah decided to seek her assistance. Sarah paid Jennifer for her time, and they got to work. Since Jennifer was so organized and experienced, they finished the science project quickly. Sarah was grateful for Jennifer's help, and she left feeling confident in her project. Both Timmy and Sarah learned something valuable that day. Erin taught Timmy that kindness and love could be shared freely, and he found comfort in her caring approach. Sarah, meanwhile, learned that paying for help could be worthwhile, because Jennifer's expertise saved her time and helped her achieve success for her project. Erin and Jennifer's town continued to flourish as they both shared their talents and strengths with their neighbors.

Groups without leaders or with weak leaders almost always break down. Members of a leaderless group often begin to feel disappointed and helpless. Time is wasted and the tasks are not achieved. There are often arguments and nervousness between people as there is nobody to keep the goals clear. Some people are natural leaders. The well-known cook, Antonio Carlucci says, \\"True leaders are born and you see them in kitchens.\\" They're people who are strong, fair, and humorous. Although a lot of people agree that there are some natural-born leaders, most people now know that leadership can also be taught. Experienced teachers can train almost anyone how to be a successful leader. Good leaders don't make people do things in a controlling way.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What does Beyoncé introduce by name as the song opens? ?  \\"Déjà Vu\\" is a contemporary R&B song, performed in a moderate hip hop groove. It is also influenced by late-1970s funk music, and it contains elements of soul music as well as dance-pop music. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, the song is composed in the key of G minor with a time signature in common time, and a moderate groove of 106 beats per minute. Beyoncé's vocals range from the note of D♯4 to F5. The music is largely based on live instrumentation, including a bass guitar, conga, hi-hat, and horns. A non-live instrument, the Roland TR-808 drum machine, provides the song's heavy and energetic disco beat. Spence D. of IGN Music commented that Beyoncé's vocals on the song are \\"silky smooth\\" and that her vocal range leans toward the high end, hence contrasting to the song's low-end construction. Mike Joseph of PopMatters noted that \\"Déjà Vu\\" is reminiscent of Michael Jackson's \\"Off the Wall\\" (1980). The title refers to the déjà vu phenomenon. The lyrics to \\"Déjà Vu\\" follow the verse–pre-chorus–chorus pattern, and feature two rap verses. It is hook-laden, similar in this respect to \\"Crazy in Love\\". The lyrics detail a woman being constantly reminded of a past lover, shown in the lines, \\"Is it because I'm missing you that I'm having déjà vu?\\" As the song opens, Beyoncé introduces the bass, hi-hat and Roland TR-808 by name. The sounds of the instruments blend as they are being mentioned one after the other; the horns are only audible in the pre-chorus and hook sections, and a short section in the second rap. The bass guitar, which is the first instrument to enter, slides into the main two-bar ostinato. Following the repeated bass slides, the hi-hat and the Roland TR-808 begin playing.After that Beyoncé mentions Jay-Z, the bass glides up for a vibrato-rich fill, giving way to the first rap. Backgrounded with a repeating groove, Beyoncé starts the first verse. The pre-chorus follows, for which the bass changes to a more melodic tone \\"to play something more singing\\",... The answer to this question is:","output":"As the song opens, Beyoncé introduces the bass, hi-hat, and Roland TR-808 by name."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Roman Republic (Latin: Res publica Romana; Classical Latin: [ˈreːs ˈpuːb.lɪ.ka roːˈmaː.na]) was the period of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. During the first two centuries of its existence, the Roman Republic expanded through a combination of conquest and alliance, from central Italy to the entire Italian peninsula. By the following century, it included North Africa, Spain, and what is now southern France. Two centuries after that, towards the end of the 1st century BC, it included the rest of modern France, Greece, and much of the eastern Mediterranean. By this time, internal tensions led to a series of civil wars, culminating with the assassination of Julius Caesar, which led to the transition from republic to empire. The exact date of transition can be a matter of interpretation. Historians have variously proposed Julius Caesar's crossing of the Rubicon River in 49 BC, Caesar's appointment as dictator for life in 44 BC, and the defeat of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. However, most use the same date as did the ancient Romans themselves, the Roman Senate's grant of extraordinary powers to Octavian and his adopting the title Augustus in 27 BC, as the defining event ending the Republic. What marked the beginning of the Roman Republic?","output":"The beginning of the Roman Republic was marked by the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom. This happened around 509 BC, when the people of Rome decided they didn't want a king anymore, and they set up a new type of government called the Roman Republic. This was a big change for Rome and started a new era in history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

I remember back in the late 1970’s when I first started investing in property as a young guy, being taken to a house that felt EXTREMELY cold, strange, and rather chilling. Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property. However despite that being a good location, it was reputation that deterred me on that occasion. Sometimes there are situations where even the best makeover will not work.

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Invention workshops will guide you through the basics of coming up with an idea, building it, and then telling other people about why your idea is important and useful. There are young inventor workshops all over the world that you can sign-up for and participate in. There are also camps available for young inventors that might be of interest. In most cases a simple name describing the function of your invention is sufficient, but a catchy name can also help people remember your product. Keep the name short and to-the-point. Avoid using a confusing or misleading name. Come up with a few different names and ask your friends and family what sounds the best. In order to protect your invention and claim it as your own, you must patent it. A patent is a legal document stating that you came up with the idea and proves that you own the invention. It prevents other people from stealing your idea. The patent process can be complicated so ask your parents for help with this if it’s something you are seriously considering. If you want to mass produce your invention and start selling it to others, you will likely need to raise some money. Investors are individuals who give you money when you are first starting out so you can produce the product. In return, they will get some of the profits from the sales of product.  You can start by asking friends and family to help out. Participating in inventor challenges can be a great start because many of them have cash prizes. Inventor challenge competitions are a great way to show your inventions. Some of these competitions may have specific problems that they are trying to solve, while others are completely open to submit whatever you like. If you have a working prototype, consider submitting it to an open competition.   Find a competition near you and register for it.

Creating a self portrait is not your typical selfie! When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students.

Context: In a course at the LSA summer institute in 1991, Alan Prince and Paul Smolensky developed optimality theory—an overall architecture for phonology according to which languages choose a pronunciation of a word that best satisfies a list of constraints ordered by importance; a lower-ranked constraint can be violated when the violation is necessary in order to obey a higher-ranked constraint. The approach was soon extended to morphology by John McCarthy and Alan Prince, and has become a dominant trend in phonology.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the quartet that wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal? , can you please find it?   Audioslave's history dates back to October 18, 2000, when Rage Against the Machine's lead vocalist Zack de la Rocha announced he was leaving the band, citing a breakdown in its \\"decision-making process\\". Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him \\"the angel at the crossroads\\" because \\"if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today.\\"The chemistry between Cornell and the other three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: \\"He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it. It didn't just sound good. It didn't sound great. It sounded transcendent. And...when there is an irreplaceable chemistry from the first moment, you can't deny it.\\" The quartet wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal, and began working in the studio in late May 2001 with Rubin as producer, while sorting out the label and management issues. A:","output":"The name of the quartet that wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal is Audioslave. The members are Chris Cornell, Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Certainly the stuff he'd been helping Chloe and her gang of followers do for the last few hours was technically illegal. He'd asked them why they were helping him, what did they hope to gain? They'd told him that this is what they did for fun. Chloe assured him that they \\"lived for this kinda shit.\\" Ok, fine. He could sort of see that. Once he was there, helping them come up with the plan and then actually carrying it out, it sure as hell was exciting - probably the most exciting thing he'd ever done. Now that he was home and alone with his misgivings and paranoia, it all seemed like a really stupid idea. If it weren't for Chloe and her mesmerizing enthusiasm, there's no doubt that he wouldn't be doing this at all. But it was too late now. Or was it? It was five in the morning when Paul got back to his apartment. He'd told Chloe that he wanted to get a few hours sleep before the big meeting, but he now realized that there was no way he was going to be able to relax. When he'd stepped out the door twenty-two hours earlier he'd still had his job and was looking forward to a showing the rest of the art team his new designs for some of the higher-level monsters he wanted to add to the game.

In this article, we will walk you through the complete process of buying Orbeez and how to use them correctly for the best experience. Step 1: Purchasing Orbeez Orbeez comes in various vibrant colors and sizes that make them an exciting toy or decoration material. To purchase, you have two options available: buying in-store or online.  Purchasing in-store allows you to see the product's real-time condition and availability. Visit a toy store, craft store, or general supermarket around your location and look for the section of kid's toys or craft materials, where Orbeez are typically available. One of the advantages of a physical store purchase is the opportunity to ask the salesperson for more details about the product in case of any questions or concerns. If you prefer the convenience of online shopping, Orbeez can be easily found on numerous e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, eBay, or specialized toy/craft stores online. To locate the product, type 'Orbeez' in the search bar and browse through the options available. Always remember to read through reviews and ratings to ensure the product's quality before purchasing. Step 2: Soaking Orbeez  Once you have your package of Orbeez, the next step is to prepare them for use - this requires soaking them in water. Below is a simple guide: 1. Open the package: Carefully open the Orbeez package and spread them evenly in a large, shallow tray or bowl.  2. Fill with water: Pour enough water into the tray or bowl to completely submerge the Orbeez. Be cautious that excessively high water levels can cause spills, while insufficient water will not allow the Orbeez to grow to their full potential size. 3. Soak the Orbeez: Allow the Orbeez to soak in the water for at least 4 hours. This step is crucial because Orbeez are made of a superabsorbent polymer that absorbs the water, causing them to expand.  As the Orbeez absorb water, they will start to grow, becoming round, squishy, and amazingly fun to play with. After soaking, it is essential to drain any excess water to prevent molding and prolong the lifespan of your Orbeez.  In conclusion, purchasing a package of Orbeez either in-store or online and soaking them in water for at least 4 hours can equip you with these vibrant, engaging elements for your craft projects, decorations or simply as toys for kids. Enjoy the fun and creativity that comes with this simple yet fascinating product!  In writing the given article, the first step involves detailing the process of purchasing Orbeez, covering both offline and online buying options. This gives our readers a comprehensive idea of where they might find the product.

Three months later, David Abbott, a landscape architect recovering from the sudden death of his wife, moves into the apartment that had been Elizabeth's, after 'discovering' it in what seems to be a fateful happenstance. Elizabeth's spirit begins to appear to David in the apartment with ghostly properties and abilities that make it clear that something is not right. She can suddenly appear and disappear, walk or move through walls and objects, and once takes over his actions. When they meet, they are both surprised, as Elizabeth is still unaware of her recent history and refuses to think she is dead. David tries to have her spirit exorcised from the apartment, but to no avail. Since only David can see and hear her, others think that he is hallucinating and talking to himself. David and Elizabeth begin to bond, as much as that is possible, and he takes her out of town to a beautiful landscaped garden he designed. Elizabeth tells him she senses she has been there before, and in fact, the garden was something she was dreaming of in the opening scenes of the film, where she was awakened by a colleague from cat-napping after working a 23-hour shift in the hospital. Together, assisted by a psychic bookstore clerk, Darryl, Elizabeth and David find out who she is, what happened to her, and why they are connected. She is not dead, but in a coma, her body being kept on life support at the hospital where she used to work. When David discovers that in accordance with her living will, she will soon be allowed to die, he tries to prevent this by telling Elizabeth's sister, Abby, that he can see her and what the situation involves.

Background: Edwin Washington Edwards (born August 7, 1927) is an American politician and member of the Democratic Party who served as the U.S. Representative for Louisiana's 7th congressional district from 1965 to 1972 and as the 50th Governor of Louisiana for four terms (1972-1980, 1984-1988 and 1992-1996), twice as many elected terms as any other Louisiana chief executive. He served a total of 16 years in office, the sixth-longest serving gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at 5,784 days. A colorful, powerful and legendary figure in Louisiana politics, Edwards, who has been dubbed the \\"very last of the line of New Deal Southern Democrats\\", was long dogged by charges of corruption. In 2001, he was found guilty of racketeering charges and sentenced to ten years in Federal prison. Context: Though arguably minor compared to the Edwards scandals of the 1980s and 1990s, the governor was embroiled in several ethics controversies during his first two terms in office. At the time, Edwards was remarkably candid about his questionable practices. When questioned about receiving illegal campaign contributions, he replied that \\"It was illegal for them to give, but not for me to receive.\\" He also insisted he saw no problem with investing in a proposed New Orleans office building called \\"One Edwards Square\\" (it was never actually named that) while still governor, and demonstrated his gambling prowess to the press on one of his frequent gambling trips to Las Vegas. Later, Edwards' commissioner of administration Charles Roemer - father of future governor Buddy Roemer - was convicted of taking bribes and having connections with Mafia boss Carlos Marcello. Edwards managed to avoid direct implication in the Roemer case.  During the governor's first term, a disaffected former Edwards bodyguard named Clyde Vidrine made several high-profile accusations of corruption, including the sale of state agency posts. The accusations were investigated by a grand jury, but the Edwards administration attacked Vidrine's credibility and the investigation stalled. Later, Vidrine published a tell-all book called Just Takin' Orders, which included salacious details of Edwards' frequent gambling trips and extramarital escapades. Vidrine was murdered in December 1986 by the husband of a woman he was guarding, who believed Vidrine was having an affair with his wife.  In a 1976 scandal known as Koreagate, it came to light that Edwards and his wife Elaine had received questionable gifts in 1971, while Edwards was a U.S. representative. South Korean rice broker Tongsun Park was under investigation for trying to bribe American legislators on behalf of the South Korean government, and for making millions of dollars in commissions on American purchases of South Korean rice. Edwards admitted that Park gave Elaine an envelope containing 10,000 in cash, but insisted that the gift was given out of friendship and that there was nothing improper about it. In the course of the controversy, Edwards stated that he thought it was \\"super moralistic\\" for the U.S. government to prohibit American businessmen to accept gifts from foreign officials in the course of their business dealings. The scandal also engulfed Edwards's former congressional colleague Otto Passman of Monroe, who was later acquitted of all charges in the case. Question: were his accusations true?. Whats the answer?","output":"So, a man named Edwin Washington Edwards was a very important person in Louisiana. He was the boss of the state, called the Governor, for a really long time. But some people thought he did bad things while being the boss.  Some people said that he took money that he shouldn't have, and that his friends and helpers did some bad things too. There was a man named Clyde Vidrine who used to work with Edwards and said that Edwards did many wrong things. But it was hard to know if everything he said was true because he didn't have a lot of proof. Later, he wrote a book about all the things he knew and sadly, he was killed by someone else for different reasons. Another time, people talked about a problem called \\"Koreagate\\" where some people from another country, South Korea, tried to give presents and money to powerful people in the United States to make them do things for South Korea. Edwards and his wife got some money too, and some people said that it was wrong. But Edwards said it was just a gift from a friend and nothing bad happened because of it. So, it's hard to know if all the bad things people said about Edwards were true, but some people believed they were. In the end, Edwards had to go to a place called prison after they found out that he did some really bad things with money."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: As soon as you meet, or even see, a person, you form an impression of him based on his posture, gesture and facial expressions. This is why it is important to make a good first impression on the person who will be interviewing you. Within the first 60 seconds of meeting you, the interviewer will have formed an impression about what type of person you are and what kind of employee you would become, and 55% of this will be based only on your body language. Here are some tips to make you that impression a good one. First of all, relax. Think positive thoughts and you are more likely to come across as a positive, confident person during the interview. Dress smartly, as your appearance is one of the first things an interviewer will notice you. Stand up straight, and walk in with your shoulders back and your head up. Try to avoid slowing down as you walk into the room because this suggests fear and uncertainty. Shake hands with the interviewer firmly. You should have a positive handshake and a warm smile. Open your coat or jacket as you sit down shows that you, too, are open. Posture is important. You should be sitting well back in your seat. Sit up straight and lean forward slightly, but not too much. Sitting at too much of an angel expresses discomfort and distrust. Two of the most common   signals are crossing your arms and legs, so try to avoid them. Another important issue is eye contact. Looking someone in the eye shows confidence in yourself and trust in the other person. However, don't overdo it, as too much eye contact or starring will make the other person uncomfortable. Use more eye contact when listening than when talking, and when you look away, look down. Looking up at the ceiling will make you seem bored and rude.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Handel's music for Messiah  is distinguished from most of his other oratorios by an orchestral restraint—a quality which the musicologist Percy M. Young observes was not adopted by Mozart and other later arrangers of the music. The work begins quietly, with instrumental and solo movements preceding the first appearance of the chorus, whose entry in the low alto register is muted. A particular aspect of Handel's restraint is his limited use of trumpets throughout the work. After their introduction in the Part I chorus \\"Glory to God\\", apart from the solo in \\"The trumpet shall sound\\" they are heard only in \\"Hallelujah\\" and the final chorus \\"Worthy is the Lamb\\". It is this rarity, says Young, that makes these brass interpolations particularly effective: \\"Increase them and the thrill is diminished\\". In  \\"Glory to God\\", Handel marked the entry of the trumpets as da lontano e un poco piano, meaning \\"quietly, from afar\\"; his original intention had been to place the brass offstage (in disparte) at this point, to highlight the effect of distance.  In this initial appearance the trumpets lack the expected drum accompaniment, \\"a deliberate withholding of effect, leaving something in reserve for Parts II and III\\"  according to Luckett.Although Messiah is not in any particular key, Handel's tonal scheme has been summarised by the musicologist Anthony Hicks as \\"an aspiration towards D major\\", the key musically associated with light and glory. As the oratorio moves forward with various shifts in key to reflect changes in mood, D major emerges at significant points, primarily the \\"trumpet\\" movements with their uplifting messages. It is the key in which the work reaches its triumphant ending. In the absence of a predominant key, other integrating elements have been proposed. For example, the musicologist Rudolf Steglich has suggested that Handel used the device of the \\"ascending fourth\\"  as a unifying motif; this device most noticeably occurs in the first two notes of \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" and on numerous other...","output":"Based on the given context, the title of the work that reaches its triumphant ending in the key of D major is Handel's \\"Messiah.\\" This oratorio, composed by George Frideric Handel, is celebrated for its beautiful music and orchestral restraint. Throughout the piece, Handel employs various musical devices and techniques to create an integrated and cohesive work to convey its message. One critical aspect of Handel's \\"Messiah\\" is its tonal scheme that leans towards D major, which is associated with light and glory. The musicologist Anthony Hicks summarizes this tonal scheme as \\"an aspiration towards D major.\\" While the oratorio doesn't have a predominant key, it incorporates different shifts in key to reflect changes in mood. The key of D major emerges predominantly during the \\"trumpet\\" movements with their uplifting messages and ultimately brings the masterpiece to its triumphant conclusion. Moreover, musicologist Rudolf Steglich suggests that Handel uses the device of the \\"ascending fourth\\" as a unifying motif throughout the oratorio. The ascending fourth is most noticeably present in the first two notes of the aria \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth,\\" as well as in numerous other parts of the work. Handel's exceptional use of trumpets in \\"Messiah\\" is another significant aspect of his restraint. After they feature in the Part I chorus \\"Glory to God,\\" the trumpets appear only in \\"Hallelujah,\\" the final chorus \\"Worthy is the Lamb,\\" and as a solo in \\"The trumpet shall sound.\\" Musicologist Percy M. Young remarks that the trumpets' rarity throughout the work is what makes their interventions particularly effective. In conclusion, the work referred to here is Handel's \\"Messiah,\\" a masterful oratorio that reaches its triumphant ending in the key of D major. The innovative use of orchestral restraint, trumpet placement, and the tonal scheme revolving around D major all contribute to the work's enduring appeal and its unforgettable, exultant finale."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the sentence \\"Many children are used by drug cartels to sell and carry drugs, guns, and other illegal substances because of their perception of innocence.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"Has these dangers caused and increase or decrease in child labour with drug cartels?\\"","output":"The sentence \\"Many children are used by drug cartels to sell and carry drugs, guns, and other illegal substances because of their perception of innocence.\\" presents an observation of the phenomenon in which drug cartels utilize children for their illicit activities. However, this statement does not directly address the specific question of whether these dangers have caused an increase or decrease in child labor within drug cartels. In order to provide a valid and detailed answer to the question, we must first analyze the factors that may have contributed to the increase or decrease in child labor within drug cartels and discuss any notable trends or shifts within this context. Some factors that could potentially impact the use of child labor by drug cartels include: 1. Law enforcement strategies: If governments and law enforcement agencies have recently intensified their efforts to crack down on drug cartels, these organizations may be more prone to using children, as they are less likely to be suspected by the authorities and can therefore continue their operations more discreetly. In this scenario, the increased dangers would potentially lead to an increase in child labor within drug cartels. 2. Public awareness and advocacy: If there is a growing public awareness and condemnation of child labor in drug cartels, exemplified through various campaigns, documentaries, and investigative journalism pieces, it could potentially dissuade drug cartels from recruiting children. This awareness, in turn, could lead to a decrease in child labor within drug cartels. 3. Economic incentives: In some regions characterized by poverty and lack of access to education, families may view participation in drug cartels as an opportunity for their children to earn income, which can undermine efforts to eradicate child labor. Conversely, broader efforts to alleviate poverty and improve educational opportunities might reduce the demand for child labor within these cartels. 4. Cartel expansion or contraction: The overall size, scale, and territorial control of drug cartels can also influence the use of child labor. An expanding cartel may require more personnel and therefore recruit more children, while a contracting cartel might have less need for child labor. 5. Organizational structure and culture: The organizational structure and culture of each specific cartel can play a significant role in determining the extent to which they utilize children for their operations. Some cartels might be more inclined to use child labor due to historical practices or specific leadership preferences, while others may minimize the practice based on ethical values or a commitment to community welfare. To draw a definitive conclusion on whether the dangers associated with drug cartels have caused an increase or decrease in child labor, a thorough analysis of the aforementioned factors would be required. It is also important to note that these factors may vary across different geographic regions and cartels. Moreover, reliable and comprehensive data on child labor within drug cartels may be difficult to obtain, given the illicit and secretive nature of these organizations. Still, a detailed and long answer to the question would address these variables and any available evidence to provide a more nuanced understanding of the current state of child labor in drug cartels."},{"instruction":"Question: Given this review: \\"Google play Love it\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

There was almost no air pollution at all in Switzerland, while the air in India was almost impossible to breathe it was so polluted.  Which country had fewer people develop asthma? Answer:","output":"Based on the described scenario, it would be Switzerland that likely had fewer people develop asthma. However, this conclusion involves a bit more complex understanding and explanation. Asthma is a chronic disease of the airways that transport air to and from the lungs. No definitive cause of asthma is known, but many environmental factors, such as air pollution, can exacerbate the condition. Individuals suffering from asthma have inflamed bronchial tubes, which leads to sensitivity to various stimuli such as air pollutants, dust, and smoke. Air pollution plays a considerable role in triggering asthma symptoms. Particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide are common pollutants that can provoke asthma attacks. When one is exposed to high levels of these pollutants, it can lead to breathing problems, damage to the lungs, and if severe enough, the development of asthma. Switzerland, known for its clean environment and strict regulations on air pollution, has relatively cleaner air than many parts of the world. This reduces residents' exposure to airborne pollutants that can ignite asthma. On the contrary, India is marked by relatively high air pollution levels. Industrial growth, rapid urbanization, and increasing vehicle emissions play a significant role in this. The particulate matter and other pollutants in the air in India are known to be at dangerously high levels, especially in urban areas. These conditions contribute significantly to respiratory problems including the prevalence of asthma. However, it's essential to remember that while there's a clear link between air pollution and asthma, asthma's exact cause isn't solely dependent on air quality. Factors like genetics, overall health, immune system behavior, and other environmental factors also play a significant role. Therefore, specific individual's health can vary greatly and isn't necessarily indicative of the general population's health. Yet, when considering the overall population, given the described conditions, we would expect fewer cases of asthma development in Switzerland due to lower air pollution compared to India."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How do you do this: How can you lose weight?","output":"Losing weight involves a combination of approaches focused on diet, physical activity, and lifestyle modifications. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you lose weight in a healthy and sustainable way: 1. Set realistic goals: Begin by setting achievable short-term and long-term weight-loss goals. Consult a health professional or use an online calculator to estimate your daily calorie requirements, based on factors such as age, gender, height, weight, and activity level. 2. Create a calorie deficit: To lose weight, you need to consume fewer calories than your body requires. This can be achieved by reducing your calorie intake or increasing your physical activity. Aim for a calorie deficit of around 500 calories per day, which can result in a weight loss of about 1 pound per week. 3. Focus on a balanced diet: A well-balanced diet should include a variety of foods from all food groups, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Ensure you are getting all the essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals necessary for optimal health. 4. Watch your portion sizes: Overeating, even healthy foods, can hinder your weight loss efforts. Practice portion control by using smaller plates, measuring out servings, and being mindful of hunger and satiety signals. 5. Keep a food journal: Maintaining a food diary can help you track your daily calorie intake, monitor your eating habits, and identify areas for improvement. It can also help you stay accountable and motivated. 6. Stay hydrated: Drinking water can help control your appetite, boost metabolism, and aid in digestion. Aim to drink at least 8 cups (64 ounces) of water per day, and consider consuming more if you are physically active. 7. Exercise regularly: Engaging in regular physical activity can help you burn calories, build muscle mass, and improve overall fitness. Combine both cardiovascular (aerobic) exercises, such as walking, running, swimming, or cycling, with strength training exercises, like weightlifting or body-weight exercises, for a well-rounded workout regimen. 8. Get enough sleep: Poor sleep can affect your weight loss efforts by increasing your appetite and hindering your ability to make good food choices. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. 9. Manage stress: Chronic stress can lead to weight gain and make it harder to lose weight. Incorporate stress-reduction practices into your daily routine, such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises. 10. Seek support: Having a support system, whether in the form of friends, family, or a weight-loss group, can provide motivation, encouragement, and accountability throughout your weight-loss journey. 11. Avoid quick fixes: Fad diets and weight-loss supplements may promise rapid results, but they often lack long-term effectiveness and can harm your health. Focus on making permanent lifestyle changes that promote healthy weight loss and maintenance. 12. Be patient and consistent: Weight loss takes time and requires consistent effort. Do not be disheartened if you do not see immediate results. Stick to your plan and remember that progress, no matter how small, is still progress. Remember, it's essential to consult with your healthcare professional before beginning any weight loss plan, particularly if you have pre-existing health conditions or are taking medications. They can help you create a personalized weight loss plan that best suits your needs and ensures your safety."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Bewildered, he is befriended by Alison Smith (Sheila Sim), a London salesgirl turned landgirl and Peter Gibbs (Dennis Price), a British soldier on his way back to camp outside the village. As they leave the station, a mysterious figure jumps from the shadows and pours glue on Alison's hair. Bob and Peter give chase to the town hall, but the only person there is the local magistrate, Thomas Colpeper (Eric Portman), a gentleman farmer for whom Alison has come to work. She learns that she is the glueman's eleventh victim, and that Colpeper has no use for inexperienced landgirls. Next day, she gets a job on another farm, while Bob, curious about the glueman's identity, decides to stay on to help expose him. While attending a lantern-slide lecture about the Pilgrim's Way by Colpeper (well-attended since few local girls are willing to go out at night with servicemen for fear of the glueman), Bob, Peter and Alison all come under the spell of Colpeper's words. Alison is already familiar with this part of the country from a pre-war holiday with her archaeologist fiancé, now missing, presumed dead, in action. Bob also fears that he has lost his girlfriend, who is not answering his letters. Peter is a cynic who studied classical music but opted instead for the money he can earn as a cinema organist. With gangs of children enlisted in unmasking the glueman, all the evidence points to Colpeper. Confronted on the train into Canterbury, he confesses but pleads that he did it for the 'higher good': not only preventing local girls from taking up with GIs while their husbands/boyfriends are away at war, but boosting attendances at his lectures on the national heritage. Peter intends to alert the police but, once in Canterbury, the trio of pilgrims find the blessings they receive outweigh any desire to bring the glueman to book.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"The question you've asked is not entirely clear, so let me try to understand what you might be asking, and then offer a response. You've given an overview of the wine-making process, and then mentioned food particles entering jets. This mention of jets is somewhat confusing and feels disconnected from the wine-making process. However, assuming you're asking about how the presence of food particles would affect grape crushing and fermentation, let's continue. If food particles were present during grape crushing, there is a possibility that these particles would mix with the crushed grapes, affecting the purity of the grape juice (also called must) that eventually goes into the fermentation container. This impurity could potentially impact the fermentation process, the flavor of the wine, or even the clarity of the final product. Now, in terms of the second effect mentioned, I believe you're referring to the yeast being added to the container, which then consumes the sugar from the grapes and produces alcohol. If less grapes are crushed because of the presence of food particles or some other obstacle, this could lead to a reduction in the sugar content of the grape must that goes into the fermentation process. This reduction in sugar content will have a direct effect on the final alcohol content of the wine. When there is less sugar available for the yeast to consume, it will produce less alcohol as a byproduct. Therefore, the effect of fewer grapes being crushed and the presence of food particles in the process could potentially lead to a lower alcohol content in the final wine."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is reported that only a small number of pupils cycle to school (under 2%), although one in three children would actually like to. Experts say that to stay healthy, children need at least one hour of moderate   exercise every day. But only six out of ten boys and four out of ten girls get that. One of the reasons is that parents have developed a habit of driving their children to school when they could just walk or ride a bike to school. Teachers often say that children who walk or ride a bike to school are more ready to listen to their classes, ask and answer questions in class than those driven by car, and the school journey is a good chance for children to learn about road safety and other life skills. Also, for many children, riding a bike is more fun than going to school by car. Most parents know the benefits  . Then what's stopping them from letting their kids ride a bike? Safety is the number one worry for them. But actually riding a bike is not as dangerous as parents think it is.

The answers are important enough that they will be a discussion topic of this year's Senior Day at 9 a.m. March 25 in the House Chamber at the Capitol. The following is a preview of some of the answers for review: We can all agree that older Oklahomans need medical care. But even the best care is worthless if an older patient can't drive to the doctor for ongoing treatment because his or her car has been wrongfully seized in a debt dispute. Therefore, lawyers are part of the prescription for regular medical care for many of the 600,000 Oklahomans age 60 and older. Another example: if a doctor treats an elderly patient for a lung ailment, the doctor's treatment will be undone and he will see the patient again and again, if the patient is sent home to an unheated apartment. Lawyers know how to make landlords heat apartments so the medical treatment can stick. (By the way, a May 16, 2001, article in The New York Times reports on a program at Boston Medical Center providing a walk-in legal clinic in the hospital to help fight their patients' legal and administrative battles.) We also can agree that older Oklahomans - like all citizens - have rights to control their health care until they become incapacitated or these rights are transferred to another by legal document or process. \\"Old\\" is not a legal classification that results in automatic loss of these rights. Moreover, having an old parent does not automatically confer on children the right to make the parents' health care choices. It follows that an important role lawyers provide for aging Oklahomans is not only to create rights - transferring documents such as durable powers of attorney and guardianship orders, but also to monitor their use. In family situations, for example, lawyers must ensure that powers of attorney and guardianships are used to serve only the person transferring or losing rights. They are not to be used to help a family \\"manage\\" their mother or help a doctor or nursing home get permission for a pill or procedure they feel is in the best interest of a patient. Good news: Oklahoma now has a Public Guardianship Program, albeit unfunded, that will supply lawyers to perform this rights-monitoring process Oklahoma grandparents should be able to enjoy their grandchildren, not raise them. But owing to the social problems of divorce and drug use, grandparents are increasingly being called on to raise their grandchildren because of missing parents. Adding to the physical, emotional and financial burden they take on, grandparents face legal problems. All the decisions parents made without a second thought now require evidence of legal authority when made by grandparents.  Question: \\"What can lawyers do for old people?\\" Response: \\"It is the Lawyers duty to help Older  Oklahomans\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct based on the paragraph provided. The paragraph mentions several instances where older Oklahomans require the assistance of lawyers, such as debt disputes, housing issues, health care decisions, and taking care of grandchildren. The role of lawyers in these situations is crucial in ensuring that older Oklahomans have appropriate legal representation and protection of their rights."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please capitalize where necessary: greenland in 50 years","output":"Greenland in 50 Years: In 50 years, numerous changes are expected to occur in Greenland, which encompass various sectors such as climate, environment, politics, and social development. These changes will continue to shape the country's future significantly. The following paragraphs outline some of these potential developments and their implications. Climate Change: As global temperatures continue to rise, the effects of climate change are expected to become more apparent in Greenland. An increase in annual average temperatures could lead to accelerated melting of the Greenland ice sheet, which is the second-largest ice mass in the world. This will subsequently result in a rise in global sea levels, causing flooding in coastal areas and posing risks to communities worldwide. Furthermore, as the Arctic region continues to warm, Greenland may experience drastic changes in precipitation patterns, affecting its ecosystems and water resources. Environment: In the coming decades, environmental shifts in Greenland could lead to a transformation of its unique landscape. Melting ice could expose previously inaccessible regions, which will likely result in increased human activity such as mining, fishing, and tourism. These activities may contribute to environmental degradation and put pressure on the delicate Arctic ecosystems. As a consequence, the native flora and fauna of Greenland may be threatened, with the potential for some species to face extinction. Politics: Greenland's political landscape may also change significantly in the next 50 years. As its natural resources become more accessible, the country is expected to gain more international attention. This could lead to increased pressure from other nations, particularly those with interest in the Arctic, such as the United States, Russia, and China, to strengthen their political and economic ties with Greenland. Furthermore, as a territory of Denmark, Greenland may seek to renegotiate its relationship and pursue greater autonomy or even full independence. Socioeconomic Development: Over the next 50 years, socioeconomic development in Greenland will likely be driven by the changes in its climate and political context. Improvements in infrastructure, education, and healthcare may result from increased investment and collaboration with foreign countries. However, as the economy shifts toward natural resource extraction, there may be a need to address potential issues related to labor and income inequality, environmental sustainability, and cultural preservation of the Indigenous population. In conclusion, Greenland in 50 years is expected to undergo numerous transformations driven by factors such as climate change, environmental shifts, political dynamics, and socioeconomic development. The melting ice, political relations, and environmental issues will play major roles in shaping the country's future landscape. It is crucial for Greenland's government and the global community to work together in addressing these challenges and creating a sustainable future for its population and the environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which Royal Australian Air Force pilot was also part of the 1949/1950 tour of South Africa? A:","output":"A: The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) pilot who was part of the 1949/1950 tour of South Africa was Keith Ross Miller. Born on November 28, 1919, in Sunshine, Victoria, Australia, Miller was not only a skilled aviator but also a prominent cricketer, often regarded as one of the all-time great all-rounders in the sport. Miller attended Melbourne High School and later went on to play cricket professionally. He made his debut on the Australian cricket team, the Baggy Greens, in 1946, earning a reputation for his aggressive batting, exceptional bowling skills, and powerful presence on the field. Additionally, he captained Victoria in Australian domestic cricket and played for New South Wales. When World War II erupted, Miller put his sporting career on hold to enlist in the armed forces. He joined the RAAF in October 1942, and after completing his training, he was assigned as a pilot officer to the United Kingdom. There, he served with the RAAF's No. 169 Squadron, where he flew night fighter operations and was responsible for protecting the UK mainland from enemy attacks. Later, Miller was posted to No. 616 Squadron, where he flew the de Havilland Mosquito, a formidable ground attack aircraft, until the war ended in 1945. In the post-war era, Miller resumed his cricket career, enjoying great success both as a player and a respected leader. Notably, he was part of Sir Donald Bradman's Invincibles, the Australian cricket team that toured England without losing a single match in 1948. The following year, in 1949, Miller was appointed the vice-captain of the Australian cricket team that toured South Africa from 1949 to 1950. During this tour, under the captaincy of Lindsay Hassett, Australia played a five-match Test series against South Africa. Miller's all-rounder capabilities shone through, and he contributed significantly to the team's success, resulting in a clean sweep victory for Australia. Miller played a total of 55 Test matches throughout his career and scored 2,958 runs at an average of 36.97, while taking 170 Test wickets at an average of 22.97. Due to his dual accomplishments as both a cricketer and an RAAF pilot, Keith Miller has left an indelible mark in Australian sports and military history. He passed away on October 11, 2004, at the age of 84, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire future generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest. This is also where relatively few organisms live. Another benefit of Earths magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earths magnetic north pole. Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations.

Premise: So might the environmental, consumer, and public interest group members of the EPA's food quality advisory panel who recently resigned in protest, stating that the agency dithered in endless, fruitless debate rather than doing anything about toxic chemicals that have been around since World War II (the Washington Post , April, 28, 1999). Hypothesis: The EPA was more interested in the success of agribusiness than the safety of the American people. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"Step 1: Identify the key points in the premise. - Members of the EPA's food quality advisory panel resigned in protest. - They claimed the agency was engaged in endless debates rather than doing anything about toxic chemicals that have been around since World War II. Step 2: Identify the key points of the hypothesis. - The EPA was more interested in the success of agribusiness than the safety of the American people. Step 3: Assess if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. The premise outlines the resignation of some members from the EPA's advisory panel and their dissatisfaction with the agency's approach to handling toxic chemicals. The hypothesis states that the EPA prioritizes the success of agribusiness over the safety of the population. Though the premise and hypothesis might be related, the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise. The premise provides evidence of dissatisfaction with the EPA's handling of toxic chemicals, but it does not directly establish the EPA's prioritization of agribusiness interests over public safety. Therefore, we would need additional evidence to support the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Which language is this?","output":"The language in the text provided is French. This particular language is native to France and is officially spoken in many different countries worldwide, across several continents. French, in its standardized form known as Standard French or Parisian French, is an Indo-European language belonging to the Romance group of languages. It evolved from the Gallo-Romance dialects spoken in northern France. French's development was also influenced over the centuries by various other languages and groups, including the Celts, the Romans, the Franks, and the English. French is the official language in 29 countries, like Belgium, Canada, Rwanda, Cameroon, and Haiti. Likewise, it holds a prominent position in many international and multinational companies, organizations, and institutions, including the United Nations, the European Union, and the Olympic Committee, to name a few. Besides, French is the second most studied foreign language after English and is considered an international language of literature and scientific standards. Also, it is one of the six official languages and one of the two working languages (the other being English) of the United Nations, and it is the official language of the Universal Postal Union. The particular text you've provided states: \\"For policies as sensitive as those related to fundamental rights, immigration and the strengthening of security, 'the EU institutions should not seek to replace the Member States but to play a complementary role,' the Parliament specifies.\\" Based on the textual content, it's clear that the passage is discussing matters related to policy-making within the context of the European Union.  The text involves several key focuses in current EU policy discussions, which include basic human rights, immigration, and security enhancement efforts. The context seems to suggest the Parliament's standpoint on these issues, emphasizing their belief that EU institutions should assist and complement the efforts of member states instead of trying to replace them."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The majority of the reviews criticize the movie for various reasons including: 1. A failure to effectively combine film noir and horror comedy elements, resulting in poor timing and flat performances. 2. Derivative content and an unoriginal storyline. 3. A lifeless and disappointing adaptation of the source material, lacking the essence that made the original interesting. 4.

Passage:A member of the Aspietes family, of noble Armenian origin, Constantine was probably a close relative of his contemporary Michael Aspietes, a distinguished general killed in 1176. Like his relative, Constantine too had earned distinction during Manuel I Komnenos' campaign against the Hungarians in 1167. The historian John Kinnamos records that he held the rank of sebastos. He is next recorded as being active in 1190/1, during the Byzantine efforts to suppress the Bulgarian–Vlach rebellion of the brothers Peter and Ivan Asen. The historian Niketas Choniates records that, in an effort to sustain the troops and bolster their morale, Aspietes decided to distribute to them their delayed annual salaries. This act, however, enraged Emperor Isaac II Angelos, who saw in it almost an attempt to bribe the army to support Aspietes in overthrowing him. The emperor had Aspietes arrested and blinded, after which nothing further is known of him. He possibly died in the early years of the 13th century.  Links: a. Michael Aspietes b. Aspietes c.

Write highlights for this article: Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi said Friday that elections taking place this weekend would not be \\"free and fair\\" but that her party still hoped to win as many parliamentary seats as possible. Suu Kyi, who was released in 2010 by Myanmar's military rulers after years under house arrest, said that she believed there had been voting irregularities, illegal activities and intimidation either committed or encouraged by official entities. But Suu Kyi, a pro-democracy figure and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said at a news conference outside her residence in Yangon that she did not \\"at all regret having taken part\\" because the election campaign had raised political awareness among Myanmar's population. Worldwide attention is focused on the April elections, which are seen as a test of the Myanmar government's commitment to removing the fear and paranoia of citizens silenced by nearly five decades of military rule. The government has invited in hundreds of foreign journalists and election observers to witness the voting. The vote, in which credible alternatives to the ruling party will appear on the ballot, was called to fill seats vacated by the promotion of parliamentarians to the Cabinet and other posts last year. Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), is in competition for 44 of the 45 seats up for grabs in the by-elections. It had boycotted previous elections. Its candidate in one constituency has been rejected by the election commission because his parents had taken up foreign residency, Suu Kyi said, adding that the party planned to challenge the candidate's exclusion later. The international community has applauded recent steps toward greater openness in Myanmar, also known as Burma, long secluded from the rest of the world after a military junta grabbed power in 1962. The generals are loosening their grip after international sanctions and criticism over their regime's human rights record. So far this year, the regime has agreed to negotiate with an ethnic rebel group and pardoned hundreds of political prisoners. Top diplomats from the United States, Britain and France have made recent visits to the country after decades of shunning it. Suu Kyi said she believed President Thein Sein, a former general who has taken civilian office, wished for democratic reform, but that she was uncertain how much support he had, notably from the military. She told the hundreds of journalists gathered outside her residence Friday that she didn't plan on becoming a minister in the military-backed civilian government, if a position was offered to her. Under Myanmar's constitution, lawmakers can't hold ministerial office. Asked where she would place Myanmar's democracy on a scale of one to 10, Suu Kyi quipped, \\"We're trying to get to one.\\" She mentioned two recent physical attacks against NLD candidates, which she said she thought were actions of individuals rather than state-sponsored acts. In one of the attacks, somebody used a catapult to fire betel nuts at a candidate's car, she said. Some people in Southeast Asia chew betel nuts as a mild stimulant. The daughter of Gen. Aung San, a hero of Burmese independence, Suu Kyi herself became an inspiration with her long struggle for democracy in the country. She quietly defied Myanmar's military junta for years from from the prison of her crumbling Inya Lake villa in the former capital, Yangon. Suu Kyi, 66, is now a candidate for the parliamentary seat in Kawhmu, a contest analysts say she is all but certain to win. Results are expected about a week after the voting. Suu Kyi has been crisscrossing the country to attend election rallies where she is often greeted like a rock star. But her busy schedule has taken its toll: earlier this week she had to suspend campaigning after falling ill. On Friday, she said she felt somewhat \\"delicate,\\" but was in good enough spirits to joke about her health. She told the reporters at the news conference that if they asked \\"any tough questions, I'll faint straight away.\\" CNN's Paula Hancocks reported from Yangon, and Jethro Mullen from Hong Kong.","output":"Myanmar opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, claims that the upcoming elections will not be \\"free and fair\\" due to numerous irregularities, illegal activities, and intimidation by official entities.

The NLD is in the running for 44 of the 45 seats available in the by-elections. The Myanmar government's commitment to overcoming the fear and paranoia of citizens established by nearly five decades of military rule is being tested by these April elections. The government is allowing hundreds of foreign journalists and election observers to document the voting process. Furthermore, the international community is taking note of Myanmar's movement toward increased openness after enduring many years of sanctions and criticism for their human rights record. Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, acknowledges President Thein Sein's desire for democratic reform but expresses uncertainty regarding the level of support he has, particularly from the military. She also clarifies that she does not intend to hold a ministerial position within the military-backed civilian government if it is offered to her, as the constitution for Myanmar prohibits lawmakers from holding ministerial office. Despite recent setbacks in her campaign due to health issues, Suu Kyi continues to actively participate in election rallies throughout the country, where she garners strong support and enthusiasm.

How is a population defined, and what are the strengths and weaknesses of this definition? Are there some species that at certain times or places are not in populations?.   Q: During interphase, the cell undergoes normal growth processes while also preparing for what, by accumulating energy and building blocks of dna?   Choices:  - proteins division  - chromosome division  - technology division  - cell division  A: The answer is:","output":"cell division Before diving into the answer, let's first clarify how it relates to the given paragraph, which discusses populations and their relevance in ecology and biological sciences. While the question itself is not directly related to populations or ecology, it does concern a fundamental biological process: cell division, and cells are the structural and functional units of all living organisms. Understanding how cells divide and grow is essential to understanding populations and the life cycles of species. Now, onto the main question about interphase, which is a stage in the life cycle of a cell. During interphase, the cell undergoes normal growth processes and also prepares for cell division. The process of cell division is crucial because it is the means by which living organisms grow, develop, and reproduce. Interphase is typically divided into three phases: G1, S, and G2. 1. G1 (Gap 1) phase: The cell grows in size, synthesizes proteins and other cellular components, and checks for any damage to its DNA. The cell accumulates energy and the necessary building blocks (nucleotides) to undergo the next phase, the S phase. During G1, the cell also checks for signals from the body or its environment that might indicate whether it should continue to grow and divide or not. 2. S (Synthesis) phase: In this phase, the cell duplicates its entire DNA, forming two identical copies of each chromosome. These copies will later be distributed to the two daughter cells during cell division. DNA replication is carried out by various proteins, such as DNA polymerase, which synthesizes the new DNA strand using the old strand as a template. 3.

After checking price's, I decided to buy treatment from the store rather than the dermatologist's office for my acne, because the  Pick from: (a). store was cheaper.; (b). dermatologist's office was cheaper.;","output":"After checking the prices, I decided to buy treatment from the store rather than the dermatologist's office for my acne, because the store was cheaper. This decision was influenced by multiple factors, including convenience, product variety, accessibility, and overall value for money. Firstly, the store offered a wider selection of treatments and products at various price points. From over-the-counter creams, gels, and face washes to medications and remedies for different skin types and acne severity, the store provided a vast array of options for me to choose from. This allowed me to find a product catering to my specific needs and preferences while also keeping my budget intact. In contrast, the dermatologist's office had a limited range of products, mostly including prescription medications and treatments that could be costly. While these might have been more effective in some cases, I concluded that it was worth testing an affordable store-bought product first before committing to a professional treatment. Furthermore, purchasing an acne treatment from the store allowed for greater convenience and accessibility. Many stores have extended hours of operation or even 24-hour access, making it much easier for me to buy the required product whenever needed. On the other hand, I would have had to make an appointment with the dermatologist and potentially wait several weeks to see them regarding my acne concerns. Moreover, the store's products typically come with clear instructions and guidelines for usage, enabling me to start the treatment immediately upon purchase. This further adds to the convenience factor and allows me to treat my acne sooner, with the hope of witnessing positive results in a shorter period. An additional point to consider is that, in many cases, store-bought acne treatments are backed by a money-back guarantee or return policy if unsatisfied with the product. This presents a safety net for me and ensures that I can switch to another treatment without facing a significant financial loss. While it is true that a dermatologist would better cater to my needs and provide a more personalized treatment plan, my decision to opt for a store-bought product was based on a careful assessment of the aforementioned factors. By selecting a cost-effective store option, I gained access to a wide variety of treatments, suitable for various acne types and severity levels, which ultimately offered me the opportunity to explore multiple approaches while keeping expenses to a minimum. Therefore, it was the affordability, convenience, product variety, and accessibility provided by the store that made it more appealing for me to purchase an acne treatment there rather than in a dermatologist’s office, which had higher costs and fewer treatment options readily available for immediate purchase."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - Grapes are grown - A selection of grapes are gathered - The grapes are washed - The stems are removed from the grapes - The grapes are crushed and added to a fermation container - Yeast is added to the container - The yeast eats the sugar in the yeast, releasing alcohol -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose people don't want strong coffee happens, how will it affect more grapes crushed.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"No, the perturbation hypothesis suggesting that people don't want strong coffee does not have a direct or indirect effect on the process of fermenting grapes to produce alcoholic beverages like wine. These are two distinct processes involving different raw materials and production methods. The process of fermenting grapes remains the same, regardless of people's preferences for the strength of their coffee. The hypothesis might have a potential indirect effect if people's preference for weaker coffee leads to increased consumption of alternative beverages, such as wine, because they perceive it as a better alternative. However, even in this case, the process of converting grapes into an alcoholic beverage itself remains unaffected. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis about people not wanting strong coffee does not impact the process of crushing grapes, fermentation, or the production of wine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Polarization is the sum of the E-plane orientations over time projected onto an imaginary plane perpendicular to the direction of motion of the radio wave. In the most general case, polarization is elliptical, meaning that the polarization of the radio waves varies over time. Two special cases are linear polarization (the ellipse collapses into a line) as we have discussed above, and circular polarization (in which the two axes of the ellipse are equal). In linear polarization the electric field of the radio wave oscillates back and forth along one direction; this can be affected by the mounting of the antenna but usually the desired direction is either horizontal or vertical polarization. In circular polarization, the electric field (and magnetic field) of the radio wave rotates at the radio frequency circularly around the axis of propagation. Circular or elliptically polarized radio waves are designated as right-handed or left-handed using the \\"thumb in the direction of the propagation\\" rule. Note that for circular polarization, optical researchers use the opposite right hand rule from the one used by radio engineers.

As of 2015, the population was 48,210. It is the county seat of Albemarle County, which surrounds the city, though the two are separate legal entities. Charlottesville has eighteen distinctive neighborhoods. It is named after the British Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The Bureau of Economic Analysis combines the City of Charlottesville with the County of Albemarle for statistical purposes, bringing its steadily growing population to approximately 150,000. Charlottesville is the heart of the Charlottesville metropolitan area, which includes Albemarle, Fluvanna, Greene and Nelson counties.  - Bella Morte is a gothic band that was formed in 1996 in Charlottesville, Virginia, USA. They incorporate elements of metal, dark wave, deathrock, alternative and synthpop. The band's name means \\"beautiful death\\" in Italian. According to Andy Deane, the name was chosen to \\"suggest that beauty can be found in tragedy\\", which is a theme occurring in every Bella Morte album.  - Founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1993, Metropolis Records has developed a strong reputation over the years as a leader in various genres of underground music. Though widely known for electro-industrial, synthpop, future pop, darkwave, and gothic music, the label has always operated with a bent towards all genres of dark alternative music, be it electronics-based or post-punk.  - Bleed the Grey Sky Black is Bella Morte 's fourth release on Metropolis Records . It reached # 1 on Metropolis ' pre-order sales in September 2006 .  - Dark wave or darkwave is a musical term used for dark, usually gothic rock-influenced music that incorporates synthesizers, or elements of new wave and synthpop, although the term is also applied to post-punk bands that produce a dark atmosphere. The label began to appear in the late 1970s in German music media, coinciding with the popularity of new wave and post-punk. Building on those basic principles, dark wave is used to describe dark, introspective lyrics and an undertone of sorrow for some bands. In the 1980s, a subculture developed primarily in Europe alongside dark wave music, whose members were called \\"wavers\\" or \\"dark wavers\\".  - Synthpop (also known as \\"technopop\\"), a subgenre of new wave music first became prominent in the late 1970s and features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic, art rock, disco, and particularly the \\"Krautrock\\" of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the new wave movement of the late-1970s to the mid-1980s.  - Electro-industrial is a music genre drawing on EBM and post-industrial that developed in the mid-1980s. While EBM has a minimal structure and clean production, electro-industrial has a deep, complex and layered sound. The style was pioneered by Skinny Puppy, Front Line Assembly, and other groups, either from Canada or the Benelux. In the early 1990s, the style spawned the \\"dark electro\\" genre, and in the mid-/late-1990s, the \\"aggrotech\\" offshoot. The fan base for the style is linked to the rivethead subculture.  - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music.  - Deathrock is a subgenre of punk rock incorporating horror elements and spooky atmospherics, that emerged on the West Coast of the United States in the early 1980s.

And, rather than fighting for the best possible policies, we may step back and do nothing. Some people go even further. They say that despite the moral and legal objections  , whatever is scientifically possible will be done ----somewhere, sometime. They believe that science will get out of control in the end. This belief is dangerous too, because it a fuels sense of  hopelessness and discourages them from making efforts to build a safer world. In our interconnected world, the lack of agreement in and of the world of science can lead to the failure to control the use of science. Without a common understanding, the challenges of \\"controlling\\" science in this century will be really tough. Take human cloning for example. Despite the general agreement among scientists on its possible huge impact   on traditional moral values, some countries still go ahead with the research and development of its related techniques. The outcomes are hard to predict. Therefore, discussions on how science is applied should be extended far beyond scientific societies. Only through the united efforts of people with hope, can we be fully safe against the misuse of science and can science best serve mankind in the future. Question: What is the main idea of the passage? Answer: Possible answers: (a). Science and its applications bring us many dangers.. (b). The development of science mostly lies in people's attitudes.. (c). Mankind can largely take control of science with their efforts.. (d). The future of science will be influenced by the dangerous ideas.. A:","output":"The main idea of the passage is: (c). Mankind can largely take control of science with their efforts. The author emphasizes the importance of making decisions and taking united efforts to ensure the responsible use of science, rather than giving in to a sense of hopelessness or fear that it will become uncontrollable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Often people may be awakened by a group of carolers beginning to gather at the church. They return home to make final preparation as to the clothes one must wear and also as to his offering for the Christmas service. The most important part of their Christmas service is the love offering. This is the gift in honor of Jesus. At about 8 or 9 o'clock, everyone makes their way to the celebration of the birthday of Jesus. Everyone who attends the service goes forward to lay down their gift upon the raised platform near the Communion table. Not one person will attend the service without giving a gift. Christmas in South Africa is a summer holiday. There is no snow, but it has many flowers, many beautiful varieties of wild flowers being in their full pride. In Ghana, most churches announce the coming of Christmas by decorating the church and homes beginning with the first week in Advent, four weeks before Christmas. This season happens to be the cocoa harvest time, so it is a time of wealth. Everyone returns home from wherever they might be, such as farms or mines. In Africa, it is the traditional dinner of turkey, roast beef, mince pies, suckling pig, yellow rice with raisins, vegetables, and plum pudding, or crackers. In the afternoon, families go out into the country and usually there are games or bathing in the warm sunshine, and then home in the cool of the evening. Boxing Day is also a public holiday of real relaxation usually spent in the open air, which falls on December 26. Question: The writer of this passage mainly wants to   _  .

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  As life in Paris returned to normal, in June 1871, Bizet's appointment as chorus-master at The Opéra was seemingly confirmed by its director, Émile Perrin. Bizet was due to begin his duties in October, but on 1 November, the post was assumed by Hector Salomon. In her biography of Bizet, Mina Curtiss surmises that he either resigned or refused to take up the position as a protest against what he thought was the director's unjustified closing of Ernest Reyer's opera Erostrate after only two performances. Bizet resumed work on Clarissa Harlowe and Grisélidis, but plans for the latter to be staged at the Opéra-Comique fell through, and neither work was finished; only fragments of their music survive. Bizet's other completed works in 1871 were the piano duet entitled Jeux d'enfants, and a one-act opera, Djamileh, which opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. It was poorly staged and incompetently sung; at one point the leading singer missed 32 bars of music. It closed after 11 performances, not to be heard again until 1938. On 10 July Geneviève gave birth to the couple's only child, a son, Jacques. Bizet's next major assignment came from Carvalho, who was now managing Paris' Vaudeville theatre and wanted incidental music for Alphonse Daudet's play L'Arlésienne. When the play opened on 1 October, the music was dismissed by critics as too complex for popular taste. However, encouraged by Reyer and Massenet, Bizet fashioned a four-movement suite from the music, which was performed under Pasdeloup on 10 November to an enthusiastic reception. In the winter of 1872–73, Bizet supervised preparations for a revival of the still-absent Gounod's Roméo et Juliette at the Opéra-Comique. Relations between the two had been cool for some years, but Bizet responded positively to his former mentor's request for help, writing: \\"You were the beginning of my life as an artist. I spring from you\\".In June 1872, Bizet informed Galabert: \\"I have just been ordered to compose three acts for the Opéra-Comique.

Please briefly summarize this news article: The Photo That Changed America's Civil Rights Movement The raw videos depict the last moments of Philando Castile‘s and Alton Sterling‘s lives. Widely shared on social media – one of them live – they have shocked an entire nation. Like the videos that showed the killings of Walter L. Scott, Tamir Rice and Eric Garner in 2014 and 2015, they provide the necessary imagery to force us to address, once again, the pervasive and inherent racial inequalities that still exist across the country. More than 60 years ago, when racial segregation was still the norm in many states, one grieving mother, Mamie Elizabeth Till-Mobley, understood the power of imagery to expose America’s racism. In August 1955, Emmett Till, a black teenager from Chicago, was visiting relatives in Mississippi when he stopped at Bryant’s Grocery and Meat Market. There he encountered Carolyn Bryant, a white woman. Whether Till really flirted with Bryant or whistled at her isn’t known. But what happened four days later is. Bryant’s husband Roy and his half brother, J.W. Milam, seized the 14-year-old from his great-uncle’s house. The pair then beat Till, shot him, and strung barbed wire and a 75-pound metal fan around his neck and dumped the lifeless body in the Tallahatchie River. A white jury quickly acquitted the men, with one juror saying it had taken so long only because they had to break to drink some pop. When Till’s mother Mamie came to identify her son, she told the funeral director, “Let the people see what I’ve seen.” She brought him home to Chicago and insisted on an open casket. Tens of thousands filed past Till’s remains, but it was the publication of the searing image photographed by David Jackson and first published in Jet magazine, with a stoic Mamie gazing at her murdered child’s ravaged body, that forced the world to reckon with the brutality of American racism. For almost a century, African Americans were lynched with regularity and impunity. Now, thanks to a mother’s determination to expose the barbarousness of the crime, the public could no longer pretend to ignore what they couldn’t see. In this video narrated by Bryan Stevenson, an attorney and the executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, has no doubt: “Without the images,” he says “no one would be prepared to believe the violence we’ve witnessed.” In revisiting Jackson’s photograph today, he believes, “that image still has resonance, it still has power. I think it still expresses the pain and anguish of a huge part of our population that is still hoping for basic recognition of their humanity.”","output":"This news article talks about a very sad event that happened a long time ago in 1955, which helped change how people felt about treating others differently just because of their skin color. A young boy named Emmett Till was hurt really badly by two men just because he may have talked to a white woman. Emmett's mom, Mamie, wanted everyone to see how bad racism could be, so she let people take pictures of Emmett after he was hurt. Those pictures made many people realize that racism is wrong and that everyone should be treated fairly. Even today, some people still struggle with racism, but we can learn from Emmett's story to treat everyone with kindness and respect."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hands Google Big Win: The Federal Trade Commission found that Google did not violate antitrust and anticompetition laws, clearing the way for the company to further dominate the Web search field.      WASHINGTON — The Federal Trade Commission on Thursday handed Google a major victory by declaring, after an investigation of nearly two years, that the company had not violated antitrust or anticompetition statutes in the way it arranges its Web search results.      By allowing Google to continue to present search results that highlight its own services, the F.T.C. decision could enable Google to further strengthen its already dominant position on the Internet.      It also enables Google to avoid a costly and lengthy legal war of attrition like the antitrust battle that Microsoft waged in the 1990s. That fight took an enormous toll on Microsoft and opened the door for competitors like Google to become the technology sector’s new leaders. Now, a weakened Microsoft was among those most vocal in complaining that Google was unfairly abusing a monopolistic position to thwart its rivals.      Google, which attracts 70 percent of all search queries in the United States, has used its search business, which generates billions of dollars in profit annually from advertising, to expand into businesses that include maps, restaurant reviews and travel bookings. Competitors worry that the F.T.C.’s decision will allow Google to continue to make inroads at their expense.      The decision sets up a potential conflict with European officials, who are working with Google to resolve similar concerns about the way the company operates its search engine in Europe, where it is even more dominant than in the United States.      Web search has become vital to the success of many businesses. Being ranked higher in search results can mean a great deal more traffic and revenue; being ranked lower can hurt both. Google has long claimed that it uses a neutral algorithm for search queries, something that competitors disputed.      But Jon Leibowitz, chairman of the F.T.C., said that “While not everything Google did was beneficial, on balance we did not believe that the evidence supported an F.T.C. challenge to this aspect of Google’s business under American law.”      The five-member commission voted unanimously to close its investigation without bringing charges, although some staff members argued vigorously that Google should face sanctions for using online search results to draw consumer traffic to its own services. The F.T.C. said it had found that Google’s practices improved its search results for the benefit of users and that “any negative impact on actual or perceived competitors was incidental to that purpose.”      Google did agree to make some minor changes to its search practices related to search advertising. The F.T.C. said those commitments were enforceable if the company violated them, but the agreement avoided a formal consent decree or litigation, weapons that the F.T.C. had available.      One F.T.C. commissioner, J. Thomas Rosch, said in a partial dissent that the commission would not be able to hold Google to its promises in any meaningful way, as it might do through a contempt proceeding or a fine.      Competitors said the war was not over. Fairsearch.org, a group of Google rivals including Microsoft, said Thursday’s action left the F.T.C. “without a major role in the final resolution to the investigations of Google’s anticompetitive practices by state attorneys general and the European Commission. The F.T.C.’s inaction on the core question of search bias will only embolden Google to act more aggressively to misuse its monopoly power to harm other innovators.”      In a less-watched part of the investigation, which will have a less direct impact on consumers, the commission found that Google had misused its broad patents on cellphone technology, and it ordered Google to make that technology available to rivals. That order may benefit phone manufacturers that use either Google’s Android operating system or competing systems. Some F.T.C. officials said that in the long run, the sanctions could be a bigger victory for consumers, encouraging the development of more innovative devices.      But the broadest impact of the F.T.C.’s action is to present more competitive challenges to companies that do specialty searches, for things like travel or shopping. Consumers will continue to see what has now become familiar on Google — the presence of results that link to Google’s other businesses. When a consumer searches for “airfare to Los Angeles,” for example, the most prominent results are generated by Google’s own travel business, rather than by the likes of Expedia, Priceline or Kayak.      On the company’s Web site, David Drummond, a senior vice president at Google and its chief legal officer, wrote, “The conclusion is clear: Google’s services are good for users and good for competition.”      Mr. Leibowitz, the F.T.C. chairman, called Google’s lifting of content from other Web sites “the most troubling of its business practices related to search and search advertising.” The company agreed to stop taking its rivals’ content, particularly reviews of things like restaurants or consumer products, for use in its own specialized search results.      Yelp, a consumer review site, complained that Google took parts of its reviews and placed them in its own results. When competitors objected, Google threatened to remove them entirely from results, something Mr. Leibowitz said “is clearly problematic and potentially harmful to competition because it might harm incentives to innovate.”      Google also agreed to stop contractual restrictions that prevented small businesses from advertising on competing search platforms.      Last year, some F.T.C. staff members pushed hard in reports to the commission that the company’s actions constituted “unfair methods of competition,” an area that, like that of antitrust, is policed by the F.T.C. But the trade commission faced a struggle in proving malicious intent — that Google changes its search algorithm to purposely harm competitors and favor itself.      Antitrust lawyers say anticompetitive behavior cannot be proved simply by showing that a change in the algorithm affects other Web sites and causes sites to show up lower in results, even though studies have shown that users rarely look beyond the first page of search results. ||||| Google will resolve a 20-month antitrust probe by U.S. regulators tomorrow with a voluntary agreement and a consent decree.

Read More      Google will resolve a 20-month antitrust probe by U.S. regulators tomorrow with a voluntary agreement and a consent decree. Close      Google Inc. (GOOG) will resolve a 20-month antitrust probe by U.S. regulators today with a voluntary agreement and a consent decree on the company’s alleged misuse of patents, three people familiar with the matter said.      The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is poised to announce that Google has agreed to voluntarily change some business practices and settle allegations it misused patents to thwart competitors in smartphone technology, said the people, who asked not to be named because the decision isn’t public.      The FTC is expected to close its investigation into whether Google, operator of the world’s most popular search engine, skews its search results to favor its own services without enforcement action, the people said. The FTC’s decision not to take action is a blow to competitors including Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Yelp Inc. (YELP) and Expedia Inc. (EXPE) and comes at a time when the European Union is seeking a “detailed commitment” on search to end its probe into allegations that Google discriminates against rivals.      As part of its voluntary concessions, Google will make changes in the way it uses content from other websites and allow advertisers to export data to other platforms, the people said.

Peter Kaplan, a spokesman for the FTC, and Niki Fenwick, a Google spokeswoman, declined to comment on the resolution of the probe.      Google Opponents      The expected FTC decision was drawing criticism from Google opponents, including the FairSearch.org coalition, an alliance that includes Microsoft and Expedia.      “If the FTC fails to take decisive action to end Google’s anti-competitive practices, and locks itself out of any remedies to Google’s conduct that are offered in Europe later this month, the FTC will have acted prematurely and failed in its mission of protecting America’s consumers,” according to a FairSearch.org blogpost published yesterday.      In another blogpost yesterday, Microsoft vice president and deputy general counsel Dave Heiner accused Google of anticompetitive practices, including continuing “to prevent Microsoft from offering consumers a fully featured YouTube app for the Windows Phone.”      Microsoft has complained about the issue both to the EU and the FTC, Heiner said. Google has blocked Microsoft’s new Windows Phones from operating properly with YouTube, while enabling its own Android phones to access YouTube, Heiner said in the posting.      “These restrictions are just one example of where we believe Google is impeding competition in the marketplace,” Heiner wrote in the posting.

U.S. antitrust regulators added that they have found no evidence to claims that Google unfairly favors its own services in search results.      Google did agree to license patents deemed to be \\"essential\\" for rival mobile devices such as Apple Inc.'s iPhone, Research in Motion Ltd.'s BlackBerry and smartphones running on a Microsoft Corp.'s Windows software. Some of the patents in question came as part of Google's 12.4 billion acquisition of device maker Motorola Mobility Holdings earlier this year.      Regulators say Google is also promising that upon request, it will exclude snippets copied from other websites in its summaries of key information, even though the company had insisted the practice is legal under the fair-use provisions of U.S. copyright law. Despite the fair-use practice, Google already had scaled back on the amount of cribbing, or \\"scraping,\\" of online content after business review site Yelp Inc. lodged one of the complaints that triggered the FTC investigation.      The FTC's investigation focused on allegations that Google has been abusing its dominance in Internet search.      Google's rivals, including Microsoft Corp., say the search company has been highlighting its own services on its influential results page while burying the links to competing sites. Google Inc. has fiercely defended its right to recommend the websites that it believes are the most relevant. The FTC said it saw no evidence of wrongdoing in those recommendations.      Google's stock rose 4.11 to 727.36 in afternoon trading Thursday. Microsoft is down 28 cents at 27.34. |||||","output":"The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigated Google for nearly two years to see if the company broke any rules about being fair to other businesses on the internet. They wanted to find out if Google was playing favorites with its own services in search results. After the investigation, the FTC decided that Google did not break any rules, and they will allow Google to continue showing search results that highlight its own services. This decision is important because it helps Google stay strong on the internet and lets them keep growing. However, some companies like Microsoft are not happy with the decision because they think Google has an unfair advantage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is a test of commonsense. Complete the next sentence: How to stop being judgmental and prejudiced  Learn why prejudice exists.  This can help you understand the roots of your thinking. Studies indicate people are born with an innate tendency to be drawn to those similar to them and judge those who are different.","output":"To stop being judgmental and prejudiced, one should take several steps that involve self-awareness, education, empathy, open-mindedness, and practicing kindness and fairness towards others. 1. Reflect on your beliefs and attitudes: Before you can change your behavior, you must first acknowledge and understand why you are judgmental and prejudiced. Reflect on your personal experiences, upbringing, and social influences that have shaped your perspective. Try to identify any influences that have contributed to your judgments and prejudices, such as family, friends, media, or stereotypes. 2. Educate yourself: Acquire knowledge about different cultures, religions, disability types, genders, sexual orientations, and socioeconomic backgrounds. This will help you become more aware of the diversity in the world and appreciate the common values and shared humanity that unite people. Your increased understanding will help break down barriers and misconceptions about others that contribute to judgment and prejudice. 3. Develop empathy: Imagining yourself in someone else's shoes is a powerful way to develop empathy. When you try to understand others' feelings and experiences, you can better appreciate their situations, challenges, and perspectives. This understanding builds compassion and connection, reducing the likelihood of being judgmental and prejudiced. 4. Challenge your biases: Everyone has unconscious biases based on their background, upbringing, and life experiences. To stop being judgmental and prejudiced, you must recognize and confront your biases. When you catch yourself making a judgment or assumption about someone, ask yourself why you think or feel that way and whether your judgment is based on fact or opinion. 5. Be open-minded: Be receptive to new ideas, perspectives, and experiences. Listen actively to opposing opinions and try to appreciate their point of view, even if you don't agree with it. By exposing yourself to different viewpoints and stepping out of your comfort zone, you can challenge your beliefs, broaden your horizons, and become less judgmental and prejudiced. 6. Surround yourself with diversity: Develop friendships and engage in social activities with people from various backgrounds. This exposure to diverse experiences and perspectives will not only enrich your worldview but also help you eliminate judgment and prejudice. 7. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness practices, such as meditation or deep breathing, can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings. With increased self-awareness, you are better equipped to recognize when you are being judgmental, acknowledge your prejudice, and change your mindset. 8. Hold yourself accountable: Recognize that change takes time and effort, and you may encounter setbacks along the way. It's important to hold yourself accountable when you notice yourself displaying judgmental or prejudiced behavior. Reflect on your actions and take steps to rectify the situation, such as apologizing, or challenging yourself to change your thoughts and actions in future interactions. 9. Be kind and fair: Treat people with compassion, kindness, and fairness, regardless of their background. Adopt a respectful approach to engage in conversations with others, striving to understand their perspective before offering your own. By doing so, you are less likely to judge people and less likely to develop or display prejudice. In conclusion, to stop being judgmental and prejudiced, it is essential to understand the roots of your thinking, develop self-awareness, educate yourself, develop empathy, challenge your biases, be open-minded, surround yourself with diversity, practice mindfulness, hold yourself accountable, and be kind and fair towards others. It's an ongoing process, but with commitment and self-reflection, you can change your mindset and become a more accepting and compassionate person."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choices: i. yes ii. it is not possible to tell iii. no","output":"ii. it is not possible to tell The given statement, \\"A man blends fruit at a juice stand in a strip mall\\", does not provide enough information for us to definitively conclude that \\"A man is making a smoothie.\\" While it is possible that the man could be making a smoothie, as smoothies often involve blending fruit, blending fruit is also a common step in making many other types of beverages and dishes. In the context of a juice stand, the man could also be preparing fresh juice, which involves the blending of fruit, but doesn't necessarily result in a smoothie. The difference lies in the fact that smoothies typically have a thicker, more substantial texture than juices, often as a result of incorporating components like yogurt, milk, ice cream, or protein supplements. Juices, on the other hand, aim to extract the liquids and flavors from fruits and sometimes vegetables, often resulting in a thinner, more watery consistency than smoothies. Furthermore, smoothies often contain additional ingredients such as ice, dairy products or alternatives, and sometimes sweeteners or flavor enhancers. These are not specifically mentioned in the statement, and their absence or presence could make a significant difference in the final product.  In conclusion, with the information provided, it's impossible to say definitively if the man is making a smoothie or another type of blended fruit drink or dish.

If \\"A little girl holding a camera.\\", does it logically follow that \\"The girl has a camera.\\"?","output":"Yes, it logically follows that \\"The girl has a camera\\" if the statement is \\"A little girl holding a camera.\\" Let's analyze the given statement and the logical conclusion in more detail. The statement \\"A little girl holding a camera\\" provides us with two primary pieces of information: 1. There is a little girl. 2. This girl is holding a camera. By using the word \\"holding,\\" the statement tells us that the little girl has the camera in her possession, and she is physically carrying or grasping it. The act of holding something implies that the person or subject has control or ownership of the object, at least for the time being. Now, let's consider the conclusion statement: \\"The girl has a camera.\\" The word \\"has\\" signifies possession or ownership. In this context, having a camera means that the girl owns, possesses, or is in control of the camera. Comparing the initial statement with the conclusion, we can observe that the information provided in the conclusion matches the information given in the original statement. The conclusion specifies that the girl possesses or is in control of a camera, and since we know from the initial statement that the girl is holding the camera, it is reasonable to deduce that she has it. Therefore, it is logically valid to conclude that \\"The girl has a camera\\" when given the statement \\"A little girl holding a camera.\\" This conclusion accurately portrays the relationship between the little girl and the camera based on the information provided. While \\"holding\\" highlights the physical action of having a camera, \\"has\\" describes the possession, ownership, or control of the camera, all of which are true in this scenario."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question.

She looks online and finds out about two cities in Minnesota that are several hundred miles apart. Jamestown has a very famous water park and uses coal to generate the city's electricity.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Given Jennifer's stance on the environment, which city shouldn't she move to?  Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels.

As he drove toward the Murrah Federal Building in the Ryder truck, McVeigh carried with him an envelope containing pages from The Turner Diaries – a fictional account of white supremacists who ignite a revolution by blowing up the FBI headquarters at 9:15 one morning using a truck bomb. McVeigh wore a printed T-shirt with the motto of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Sic semper tyrannis (\\"Thus always to tyrants\\", according to legend what Brutus said as he assassinated Julius Caesar, also shouted by John Wilkes Booth immediately after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln) and \\"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants\\" (from Thomas Jefferson). He also carried an envelope full of revolutionary materials that included a bumper sticker with the Thomas Jefferson slogan, \\"When the government fears the people, there is liberty.

She kept these little books after all the others had gone back.  She had read and reread them--cullings from Chaucer, from Spenser, from the Elizabethan lyrists, the border balladry, fierce, tender, oh, so human--till she knew pages of them by heart, and their vocabulary influenced her own, their imagery tinged all her leisure thoughts.

What was the full name of the person who painted four lunette murals?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Pennsylvania State Capitol houses the chambers for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, the Pennsylvania Senate, and the Harrisburg chambers for the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. The Capitol contains 475 rooms and has four floors, not including a mezzanine between the first and second floors, and a basement.  The bronze entrance doors of the capitol lead into the rotunda on the first floor with the grand staircase in the center. The staircase in the rotunda is an imperial staircase, similar to the one in the Palais Garnier in Paris, France. The staircase leads to the mezzanine between the first and second floors, before dividing into two staircases leading to the second floor. Edwin Austin Abbey painted four allegorical medallions around the base of the capitol dome, detailing the \\"four forces of civilization\\": Art, Justice, Science, and Religion. Four lunette murals were also painted by Abbey and \\"symbolize Pennsylvania's spiritual and industrial contributions to modern civilization\\". The lunettes are situated in the recesses of each arch in the rotunda. The rotunda is paved with tiles, hand-crafted by Henry Chapman Mercer, from the Moravian Pottery and Tile Works. Mercer produced 16,000 square feet (1,500 m2) of tile, which includes \\"377 mosaics, representing 254 scenes, artifacts, animals, birds, fish, insects, industries and workers from Pennsylvania history\\".

Answer based on context: After a low-scoring victory in Detroit, the Seahawks played their Week 2 home-opener against their fellow NFC West rival, the Arizona Cardinals.  Unlike Game 1, Seattle's offense got off to a strong start, as RB Shaun Alexander got a 2-yard TD run, while QB Matt Hasselbeck completed a 49-yard TD pass to WR Darrell Jackson.  That's how the rest of the first half would end up.  In the third quarter, the score of the period was Arizona kicker Neil Rackers completed a 43-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Seahawks got a 1-yard TD run by FB Mack Strong.  The Cardinals would get a touchdown, which would come in the form of a 40-yard TD pass from QB Kurt Warner to WR Bryant Johnson, but fortunately, Seattle would maintain the lead for the win.  The Seahawks would extend their home winning streak to 11 straight games and improved to 2-0.

Adenine always pairs with thymine, and guanine always pairs with cytosine ( Figure below ). Because of this complementary nature of DNA, the bases on one strand determine the bases on the other strand. These complementary base pairs explain why the amounts of guanine and cytosine are present in equal amounts, as are the amounts of adenine and thymine. Adenine and guanine are known as purines . These bases consist of two ring structures. Purines make up one of the two groups of nitrogenous bases. Thymine and cytosine are pyrimidines , which have just one ring structure. By having a purine always combine with a pyrimidine in the DNA double helix, the distance between the two sugarphosphate backbones is constant, maintaining the uniform shape of the DNA molecule.

Context: Several molecular mechanisms of antibacterial resistance exist. Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains. For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extrachromosomal DNA. Antibacterialproducing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterialresistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes. Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials. Crossresistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.

In these species, an egg hatches to produce a larva, which is generally wormlike in form. This wormlike form can be one of several varieties: eruciform (caterpillarlike), scarabaeiform (grublike), campodeiform (elongated, flattened and active), elateriform (wirewormlike) or vermiform (maggotlike). The larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa, a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon. There are three types of pupae: obtect, exarate or coarctate.
