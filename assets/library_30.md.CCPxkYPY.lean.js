Since the arrangement is circular, fix one person to break the symmetry, leaving 7! ways to arrange the remaining 7 people. Step 2: Calculate arrangements where Alice and Bob sit next to each other. Treat Alice and Bob as a single unit. This leaves us with 7 units (AliceBob and the other 6 people). Arrange these 7 units in a circle, which gives us 6! arrangements (fix one unit to break the circle). Within the AliceBob unit, Alice and Bob can switch places in 2! ways. So, the total number of arrangements where Alice and Bob are together is 6! times 2!. Step 3: Subtract the number from Step 2 from the number in Step 1 to find the number of valid arrangements: [ 7! - 6! times 2! = 5040 - 1440 = 3600 ] Thus, there are boxed{3600} ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table so that Alice and Bob do not sit next to each other."},{"instruction":"Let T be a subset of {1, 2, 3, ldots, 60} such that no pair of distinct elements in T has a sum divisible by 5.

Prove statements (2) and (3) for an equilateral triangle with a side length of 3. To achieve this, we follow these steps:  1. Design and Construct the Division for an Equilateral Triangle With Side Length 5 1. **Description of the Initial Approach:**    - Let's divide the base (BC) into three equal parts. Let the divisions be (D) and (E).    - Draw perpendiculars from (D) and (E) to opposite sides, intersecting at (F) and (G) respectively along the height of the triangle.    ![Diagram for Division](https://i.imgur.com/zYjRati.png) 2. **Selection of Division Points:**    - On (BG), take a point (M_1) close to (G) ensuring (CM_1 > 1).    - Draw a line from (A) to (M_1). Let this intersect (FD) at (N_1). 3. **Successive Divisions:**    - Extend to form further divisions as follows:      - Draw (BN_1) intersecting (EG) at (M_2).      - Continue this pattern so that (A) connects to (M_2), where (AM_2) intersects (DF) at (N_2).    - Repeat this pattern until the desired number of triangles is reached. The above procedure will produce the required division where the number of resulting triangles is constrained by practical counting of intersections and drawing lines.  2. Verify the Solution to Ensure Satisfaction 1. **Checking division makes 100 triangles: **    - By carefully counting as per the construction steps, we can indeed derive exactly 100 triangles, thus fulfilling the first statement.    - It’s easier to see if we draw them in practical steps on a paper or software. 2. **Ensuring non-overlapping triangles: **    - To refine and split further ensuring no overlap:      - Adjust the points (N_1, M_2, N_2, dots).      - Each step’s shifting ensures the triangles are almost perfect in space defined ensuring non-overlapping. 3. **Generalize for any ( k ) triangles by ensuring each triangle shares sides exactly as per our requirements:**    - Ensuring shared vertices or edges:      - Follow each triangle formed by careful intersection vertically and horizontally ensures stated conditions. # For an Equilateral Triangle With Side Length 3 1. The same approach would work for this scenario as well. 2. Using same internal bisecting ( k-times ) ensures:    - Dividing as per step 1.    - Achieving triangle count ( k ).    - Avoiding overlaps by following the stated geometry.

We can model this growth over two years using the formula for compound growth, which is given by the initial amount multiplied by (1 + x)^n, where n is the number of periods (years, in this case). Given that: - Initial visitors in 2021 = 2 million - Visitors in 2023 = 2.88 million - n = 2 years We have: [2(1+x)^2 = 2.88] Dividing both sides by 2: [(1+x)^2 = 1.44] Taking the square root of both sides: [1+x = sqrt{1.44}] [1+x = 1.2] Solving for x: [x = 1.2 - 1] [x = 0.2] Converting to percentage: [x = 20%] Therefore, the average growth rate of the number of visitors received by Changsha during the May Day holidays from 2021 to 2023 is boxed{20%}.

Without loss of generality, let (x_{1}) be the maximum value among (x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{n}) and (y_{1}) be the maximum value among (y_{1}, y_{2}, cdots, y_{m}). 4. **Case Analysis:**    - **Case 1: (x_{1} = y_{1})**      - If (x_{1} = y_{1}), cancel (x_{1}) on the left and (y_{1}) on the right. The remaining sums still equal each other:            x_{2} + x_{3} + cdots + x_{n} = y_{2} + y_{3} + cdots + y_{m}            - By the inductive hypothesis, this simplified equation satisfies the problem statement.        - **Case 2: (x_{1} > y_{1})**      - Define (x'_{1} = x_{1} - y_{1}). Then, rewrite the equation as:            x'_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3} + cdots + x_{n} = y_{2} + y_{3} + cdots + y_{m}            - Notice that both sides still satisfy the condition for the new sum (S').      - From (y_{1} geq frac{S}{m}):                S' = S - y_{1} leq S - frac{S}{m} = S cdot frac{m-1}{m} < mn cdot frac{m-1}{m} = n(m-1)              - According to the inductive hypothesis, the reduced form is valid, and hence the original equation is valid.    - **Case 3: (x_{1} < y_{1})**      - Similar arguments as in **Case 2** by defining (y'_{1} = y_{1} - x_{1}) and proceeding with an analogous process to validate the problem's condition. # Conclusion: From the steps above and mathematical induction, it can be concluded that in the equation (x_{1} + x_{2} + cdots + x_{n} = y_{1} + y_{2} + cdots + y_{m}), it is indeed possible to cancel out some terms such that the remaining parts still form a valid equation.

Therefore, there are no solutions for n geq 2. 6. **Case 2: a neq 1 or b neq 1**    If a neq 1 or b neq 1, we need to consider other possible values of a and b.    - If a = 1 and b = 2, then:      [      2 = 2 cdot 7^m - p cdot 2^n      ]      Rearranging, we get:      [      2 cdot 7^m = p cdot 2^n + 2      ]      which implies:      [      7^m = frac{p cdot 2^n + 2}{2}      ]      This equation is not possible for integer values of m, n, and p.    - If a = 2 and b = 1, then:      [      2 = 7^m - 2 cdot p cdot 2^n      ]      Rearranging, we get:      [      7^m = 2 cdot p cdot 2^n + 2      ]      which implies:      [      7^m = 2 cdot p cdot 2^n + 2      ]      This equation is not possible for integer values of m, n, and p. 7. **Case 3: k neq 0 Rightarrow 7|p Rightarrow p = 7**    If p = 7, then:    [    7^m - 7 cdot 2^n = 7^k    ]    Rearranging, we get:    [    7^{m-1} - 2^n = 1    ]    which has no solutions (modulo 4, we get 2|m-1). Therefore, the only possible values for k are 13 and 97, both of which are prime numbers.

Prove that when the number of points labeled 1 is less than 662, there is at least one good point on the circle.","output":"1. **Initial Condition**:    First, let's consider the general case: points are distributed on a circle, each labeled with either +1 or -1. We need to prove that if the number of points labeled -1 is less than 662, then there is at least one \\"good point\\". 2. **Inductive Hypothesis**:    Use mathematical induction. We will prove a more general statement: if the circle has 3n+2 points and the number of points labeled -1 is at most n, then there exists at least one \\"good point\\". 3. **Base Case**:    When n=1, the number of points on the circle is     [    3n + 2 = 3 cdot 1 + 2 = 5.    ]    Since there are at most 1 point labeled -1 and the remaining 4 points are labeled +1, it is clear that there exists at least one good point. 4. **Inductive Step**:    Assume the statement is true for n=k. That is, on a circle with 3k+2 points, if there are at most k points labeled -1, then there exists at least one good point. 5. **Case for n=k+1**:    We show the statement holds for n=k+1. On a circle with 3(k+1)+2=3k+5 points, suppose there are at most k+1 points labeled -1. Choose any labeled -1 point and its two nearest neighbors that are labeled +1.

By the inductive hypothesis, since the remaining number of points labeled -1 is at most k, there exists at least one good point P among the remaining points. 7. **Reinstate Removed Points**:    Since point P is among the remaining points on the reduced circle, it must be labeled +1. Restoring the three removed points does not affect the sum of the labels encountered when starting from P and traveling around the circle in either direction. Thus, P remains a good point on the original circle of 3k+5 points. 8. **Conclusion**:    By mathematical induction, the statement holds for all n. Specifically, for 3 cdot 661 + 2 = 1985 points, where the number of points labeled -1 is less than 662, there is at least one good point. Hence, the problem's statement is validated.

Now, we'll construct quadratic polynomials that have each of these pairs of roots and their conjugates, thus ensuring rational coefficients: - For (3 - sqrt{8}) and (3 + sqrt{8}), the polynomial is:   [(x - (3 - sqrt{8}))(x - (3 + sqrt{8})) = (x - 3)^2 - 8 = x^2 - 6x + 1.] - For (5 + sqrt{11}) and (5 - sqrt{11}), the polynomial is:   [(x - (5 + sqrt{11}))(x - (5 - sqrt{11})) = (x - 5)^2 - 11 = x^2 - 10x + 14.] - For (15 - sqrt{28}) and (15 + sqrt{28}), the polynomial is:   [(x - (15 - sqrt{28}))(x - (15 + sqrt{28})) = (x - 15)^2 - 28 = x^2 - 30x + 197.] - For (-2 - sqrt{3}) and (-2 + sqrt{3}), the polynomial is:   [(x - (-2 - sqrt{3}))(x - (-2 + sqrt{3})) = (x + 2)^2 - 3 = x^2 + 4x + 1.] Combining these, each pair of roots contributes 2 to the degree of a polynomial.

This implies there is a subset of lengths that sums to exactly 99 cm.    - Hence, we can always find two sets of rods each summing to 99 cm.    - Use two 1 cm rods to complete the fourth side of the rectangle:            text{One rectangle side of length } 99 cm quad text{ another of length } 1 cm            Form a rectangle with sides 99 cm and 1 cm. 5. **Alternative Methods**:     - **Geometrical Construction**:         - Place 102 rods in a circle with total length 200 cm.         - By symmetry, there must be two opposite pairs which divides the perimeter into equal halves.         - From these pairs, derive equal group lengths to form rectangle sides.     - **Considering the Largest Rod**:         - Ensure all smaller rods are less than half the perimeter, and the largest segmentation assures completing the fourth side exactly to the specified total length. # Conclusion: When N = 102, it is possible to guarantee that all pieces can be combined to form the outline of a rectangle.

The problem is to determine the minimum number of airlines. It's known that even if one airline company ceases operations, it's still possible to travel between any two cities (possibly with transfers) using the remaining airlines. Here's a step-by-step detailed solution. 1. **Initial Observation and definition of connectivity:**    If a network of 15 cities is connected such that one can travel between any two cities, the network has to have at least 14 connections (since a tree with 15 nodes has 14 edges, ensuring full connectivity).    \`\`\`    If we consider any network with 15 cities connected: minimum number of airlines required = 14.    \`\`\` 2. **Variables and Inequalities:**    Let’s denote the number of airlines each company A, B, and C owns as a, b, and c respectively.        According to the problem, any two airline companies together are sufficient to maintain full connectivity among the 15 cities. Thus, we form the following inequalities:        When companies A and B are considered:    [    a + b geq 14    ]    When companies B and C are considered:    [    b + c geq 14    ]    When companies C and A are considered:    [    c + a geq 14    ] 3. **Sum of Inequalities:**    Adding these three inequalities:    [    (a + b) + (b + c) + (c + a) geq 14 + 14 + 14    ]    Simplifying,    [    2(a + b + c) geq 42    ]    [    a + b + c geq 21    ]        So the minimum total number of airlines required by all three companies is 21. 4. **Constructing an Example:**    Next, we need to show an example that confirms 21 airlines suffice. Consider a specific construction where each company contributes to maintaining the full connectivity of cities when either one of them is not present.    The example from the problem depicts it as shown in the referenced diagram (Fig. 157), showing precise configurations wherein there are exactly 21 airlines:        - Each airline company's network contributes to the overall connectivity such that the removal of any one company's airlines still allows travel among all cities. 5. **Conclusion:**    Hence, the minimal number of airlines required in the country, such that even if one company ceases operations the connectivity conditions are still met, is:    [    boxed{21}    ]"},{"instruction":"On a board, five natural numbers are written.

Since both of these sums are divisible by (e), we have:    [    e mid (a + b + c) quad text{and} quad e mid (b + c + d)    ] 3. **Formulation of Difference:**    Subtract the equation (e mid (a + b + c)) from the equation (e mid (b + c + d)):    begin{align*}    & (b + c + d) - (a + b + c) mid e     & Rightarrow d - a mid e    end{align*} 4. **Analysis of the Difference (d - a):**    Since (0 leq a leq d leq e), it follows that:    [    0 le d - a < e    ]    Given that (d - a) divides (e), the only possibility (under the natural numbers constraint (d - a geq 0)) is:    [    d - a = 0    ]    Thus,    [    d = a    ] 5. **Substitution and Inequality Chain Result:**    Since (a le b le c le d), and we have now (d = a ), that implies:    [    a = b = c = d    ] 6. **Consideration of Fifth Number (e):**    Given that the sum (b + c + e) is divisible by (a) (which we already established to be equal for (a, b, c, d)), it must be verified if (e) also follows the same pattern. Formulating further, if the numbers on the board match the form where:    [    a = b = c = d = x    ]    for a natural number (x), then (e) must either be (x) or a multiple of (x). Yet since (a, b, c, d = x), there are natural cases left. 7. **Unification of Conclusion:**    The problem confirms the obligatory necessity among these numbers where at least four will always be equal, based on the assumption paths used universally.

We first find the center and the radius of the circle. Then, we consider S as a constant in the equation S=2x+y and express y in terms of x, which represents a line. When the line is tangent to the circle, the distance from the center of the circle to the line is equal to the radius of the circle. We can then construct an equation in terms of S and find the solutions to this equation, which will give us the maximum and minimum values of S. This problem involves the properties of the intersection of a line and a circle, including the standard equation of a circle and the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The key to solving this problem is to transform the problem of finding the maximum and minimum values of S into finding when the line y = -2x + S is tangent to the circle (x-1)^{2}+(y+2)^{2}=4. Let's follow these steps: 1. The center of the circle is (1, -2) and the radius is r = sqrt{4} = 2. 2. The line can be rewritten from S = 2x + y as y = -2x + S. 3. The distance d from the center of the circle to the line is given by the formula: d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}, where (x_0, y_0) is the center of the circle and Ax + By + C = 0 is the equation of the line. In our case, A = -2, B = 1, C = -S, and (x_0, y_0) = (1, -2). 4. Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get: d = frac{|-2 cdot 1 + 1 cdot (-2) - (-S)|}{sqrt{(-2)^2 + 1^2}} = frac{|S - 4|}{sqrt{5}}. 5. When the line is tangent to the circle, the distance from the center of the circle to the line is equal to the radius of the circle, so we have: frac{|S - 4|}{sqrt{5}} = 2. 6. Solving this equation for S, we find two solutions: S_1 = 4 + 2sqrt{5} and S_2 = 4 - 2sqrt{5}.

Let's consider the first row of ( A_0 ): ( 1, 2, ldots, 2011 )    Since ( B ) is distinct, these numbers must occupy different columns in ( B ).    - Clearly, 1 is the leftmost entry in the first row of ( B ).    - Let ( m ) be the smallest number not in the first row of ( B ). Since each row is ordered, ( m ) must be the first entry of its own row.    - This causes 1 and ( m ) to be in the same column of ( B ), a contradiction.    Using induction, this argument applies to each subsequently larger set, leading us to conclude that all elements ( 2011j - 2010, ldots, 2011j ) must occur in their respective rows in ( B ).    Hence, ( B ) would need to be identical to ( A_0 ), which results in the needed contradiction. 4. **Extended Proof for ( A_0 ) and ( A_k ):**    Given ( A in {A_1, ldots, A_{2010}} ):    Suppose ( A = A_k ) for some ( k ) where ( 1 le k le 2010 ).    - Swap operations in ( A_k ) result in ( 2011k - 2010 ) and ( 2011k + 1 ) occupying the same column of ( A_0 ) but the same row in ( A_k ).    To proceed, assume contrary to our claim, there is a legally numbered grid ( B ) distinct from both ( A_k ) and ( A_0 ) not meeting the required property. 5. **Argument by Contradiction:**    Apply the logic from the first proof to the first ( k-1 ) rows and then to the last ( 2011 - k - 1 ) rows. This implies that grid ( B ) may differ from ( A_k ) only in the ( k )-th and ( (k + 1) )-st rows.    However, such a scenario only allows one of two possibilities: ( B ) is either ( A_0 ) or ( A_k ), adding to the contradiction. 6. **Conclusion using Pigeonhole Principle:**    By the pigeonhole principle, if Alice's grids include ( A_0 ), there must exist some ( k ) such that ( A_k ) is not among Alice’s grids.    - If Bob initially sets his grid to ( A_0 ), he needs only one swap to transform it to ( A_k ), guaranteeing his victory.     - Should ( A_0 ) not exist in Alice's grids, no swaps are necessary. # Conclusion: [ boxed{1} ]"},{"instruction":"Define an odd function f(x) on mathbb{R} with a period of 2.

This implies ( e_n mid A cdot d_n + B = x_{n+1} ). Therefore, ( e_n mid gcd(x_{n+1}, x_n) = d_{n+1} ). Hence, ( e_n mid e_{n+1} ). 3. **Stabilization of ( e_n ):**    Since ( e_n mid B ) and ( B neq 0 ), the sequence ( {e_n} ) is a non-increasing sequence of positive integers that is bounded below by 1. Therefore, ( {e_n} ) must eventually stabilize at some value ( e ).

The recurrence relation becomes:    [    e cdot x'_{n+1} = A cdot e cdot gcd(x'_n, x'_{n-1}) + e cdot B'    ]    Dividing through by ( e ), we get:    [    x'_{n+1} = A cdot gcd(x'_n, x'_{n-1}) + B'    ] 5. **Boundedness of the New Sequence:**    Define ( d'_n = gcd(x'_n, x'_{n-1}) ) and ( e'_n = gcd(d'_n, B') ). Since ( e_n = e ) for ( n geq N ), we have ( e'_n = 1 ) for ( n geq N ). This implies ( gcd(x'_n, x'_{n-1}) = 1 ) for ( n geq N ). 6. **Implication for ( A ) and ( B ):**    Since ( e'_n = 1 ), the original sequence must satisfy ( gcd(A, B) = 1 ). Otherwise, ( gcd(A, B) ) would divide all terms starting from ( x_3 ), leading to a contradiction. 7. **Boundedness of ( d_n ):**    We have:    [    d_{n+1} = gcd(x_{n+1}, x_n) = gcd(A cdot d_n + B, x_n)    ]    Using properties of gcd, we get:    [    d_{n+1} = gcd(A cdot d_n + B, d_n) = gcd(B, d_n)    ]    Since ( d_n ) is bounded by ( B ), the sequence ( {d_n} ) is bounded. 8. **Conclusion:**    Since ( d_n ) is bounded, ( x_{n+1} = A cdot d_n + B ) is also bounded.

Substitute ( x = y = 1 ) into condition (1), we get:    [    f(f(1)) = f(1).    ] 5. Now let ( x = 1 ) and ( y = f(1) ) in the original functional equation:    [    f(f(f(1))) = f^2(1).    ] 6. Hence,    [    f^2(1) = f(1).    ] 7. This implies that ( f(1) ) must be a fixed point. The two possible fixed points are ( f(1) = 1 ) or ( f(1) = 0 ). However, since ( f: mathbb{R}_{+} rightarrow mathbb{R}_{+} ), ( f(1) = 0 ) is not possible. 8. Therefore, ( f(1) = 1 ), indicating that ( x = 1 ) is a fixed point of ( f ). 9.

If ( 0 < alpha < 1 ), use condition (1) again:     [     1 = f(1) = f left( frac{1}{a} cdot a right) = f left( frac{1}{a} right),     ]     implying:     [     f left( frac{1}{a} right) = frac{1}{a}.     ]     Given ( 0 < alpha < 1 ), we have ( frac{1}{a} > 1 ). This results in a similar contradiction as above. 14. Hence, ( x = 1 ) is the only fixed point, and ( f(x) = frac{1}{x} ) satisfies all given conditions.

How many fourdigit positive integers are increasing?","output":"To determine the number of four-digit positive integers that are increasing, we need to find the number of integers ( n ) such that reversing the digits of ( n ) produces a number larger than ( n ). Here is a step-by-step solution: 1. **Identify the condition for an increasing number:**    A four-digit number ( n = overline{ABCD} ) is considered increasing if ( overline{DCBA} > overline{ABCD} ). Since reversing the digits means comparing ( overline{DCBA} ) and ( overline{ABCD} ), we will consider two cases for our calculation:  2. **Case I: Different first and last digits (not palindromic):**    For the number ( overline{ABCD} ), we require that ( D ) must be greater than ( A ) to ensure that ( overline{DCBA} > overline{ABCD} ). Let's handle this:    - **Choices for ( A ):** There are 9 choices for ( A ) (1 through 9, as leading digit cannot be 0).    - **Choices for ( D ):** For each choice of ( A ), there are ( (10 - A) ) choices for ( D ) to ensure ( D > A ).    - **Choices for ( B ) and ( C ):** There are no restrictions on ( B ) and ( C ), so there are 10 choices for each (0 through 9).   Start by calculating combinations for each choice of ( A ):    - If ( A = 1 ): ( D ) can be 2 through 9 ( implies ) 8 choices.    - If ( A = 2 ): ( D ) can be 3 through 9 ( implies ) 7 choices.    - If ( A = 3 ): ( D ) can be 4 through 9 ( implies ) 6 choices.    - Continue in this manner until ( A = 9 ), where there are no valid choices for ( D ).

So, the number of increasing four-digit numbers in this case is:   [   36 times 100 = 3600   ] 3. **Case II: Numbers of the form ( overline{ABBA} ) (palindromic):**    - For these numbers, reversing the digits does not provide a different number (since ( overline{ABBA} = overline{ABBA} )).    - Such numbers are not increasing by definition.    - There are: ( 9 ) choices for ( A ) (1 through 9) and 10 choices for ( B ) (0 through 9).

Points (X), (Y), and (Z) are on the minor arcs (AB), (CD), and (EF) respectively. We need to find the square of the smallest possible area of triangle (XYZ). 2. **Fixing Points on Vertices:**    By symmetry and continuity arguments, the minimum area triangle (XYZ) will occur when (X), (Y), and (Z) are at the vertices of the hexagon. This is because moving (Z) to the closest vertex on arc (EF) minimizes the distance to the line segment (XY). 3. **Possible Triangles:**    The vertices of the hexagon can form two types of triangles:    - Equilateral triangle (e.g., (ACE))    - Right triangle (e.g., (ACF)) 4. **Calculating the Area of Triangle (ACF):**    - (AF = 10) (side length of the hexagon)    - (FC = 20) (two side lengths of the hexagon)    - (AC) is the diagonal of the hexagon, which can be calculated as follows:      [      AC = sqrt{AF^2 + FC^2} = sqrt{10^2 + 20^2} = sqrt{100 + 400} = sqrt{500} = 10sqrt{5}      ] 5. **Area of Triangle (ACF):**    - Using Heron's formula:      [      s = frac{AF + FC + AC}{2} = frac{10 + 20 + 10sqrt{5}}{2} = 15 + 5sqrt{5}      ]      [      text{Area} = sqrt{s(s - AF)(s - FC)(s - AC)} = sqrt{(15 + 5sqrt{5})(5 + 5sqrt{5})(-5 + 5sqrt{5})(5 - 5sqrt{5})}      ]      Simplifying the terms inside the square root:      [      text{Area} = sqrt{(15 + 5sqrt{5})(5 + 5sqrt{5})(5sqrt{5} - 5)(5sqrt{5} - 5)}      ]      This calculation is complex, so we use the simpler method of calculating the area directly using the base and height:      [      text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times AF times FC times sin(60^circ) = frac{1}{2} times 10 times 20 times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = 50sqrt{3}      ] 6. **Square of the Area:**    [    left(50sqrt{3}right)^2 = 2500 times 3 = 7500    ] The final answer is (boxed{7500})."},{"instruction":"Sandy bought 65 books for 1080 from one shop and some books for 840 from another shop.

By analogy, if the tens digit is '0':    - Tens digit must match in 109 and 704, this is:      - The common tens digit must contradict the conditions for 124 (here no other digit single). 9. Hence, the effective digit 'other than' 0 or 1 works: let’s analyze valid positions: 10. The assumptions must precisely parse attempted digits each matching the computational condition set.    - Second number's (704) hundreds position digit '7'.    - Third number (124) tens position with must be ‘2’. 11.

(()Ⅱ()) Determine whether there exists a value of (m) such that points (A), (B), (C), and (D) lie on the same circle, and provide an explanation.","output":"Let's tackle the problem step by step. **(Ⅰ)** First, we will calculate the eccentricity of the ellipse. The standard form of the ellipse is given by [frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1] where (a^2) corresponds to the larger of the numerical coefficients of (x^2) and (y^2) and (b^2) to the smaller one. For our ellipse, (x^{2} + 2y^{2} = m), which can be rewritten as [frac{x^2}{m} + frac{y^2}{frac{m}{2}} = 1.] This yields (a^2 = m) and (b^2 = frac{m}{2}), and so (a = sqrt{m}) and (b = sqrt{frac{m}{2}}). Using the definition of eccentricity (e), which is (e=sqrt{1-frac{b^2}{a^2}}), we get [e = sqrt{1 - frac{frac{m}{2}}{m}} = sqrt{1 - frac{1}{2}} = sqrt{frac{1}{2}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.] Therefore, the eccentricity of the ellipse is (boxed{frac{sqrt{2}}{2}}). **(Ⅱ)** Next, we consider whether points (A), (B), (C), and (D) can lie on the same circle. For points (A), (B), (C), (D) to be on the same circle, the perpendicular bisectors of chords (AB) and (CD) must intersect at the center of this circle, which would be point (M). Given (M(2, 1)) is the midpoint of chord (AB), the endpoints (A(x_1, y_1)) and (B(x_2, y_2)) satisfy (x_1 + x_2 = 2cdot 2) and (y_1 + y_2 = 2cdot 1), leading to (x_1 + x_2 = 4) and (y_1 + y_2 = 2). The slope of the line (AB) as the perpendicular bisector of (CD) must then be (-1), as it's perpendicular to (CD). Therefore, the equation of line (AB) is (y - 1 = -(x - 2)), which can be rearranged as (x + y - 3 = 0). Substituting this into the ellipse equation and simplifying, we get a quadratic equation (3x^2 - 12x + 18 - m = 0). The length of chord (AB) can be computed using the distance between two points on the line (x + y - 3 = 0), which gives us [|AB| = sqrt{2} cdot |x_1 - x_2| = sqrt{frac{8m - 48}{3}}.] For (CD), the equation of its perpendicular bisector, which passes through (M), is (x - y - 1 = 0). Substituting into the ellipse yields (3x^2 - 4x + 2 - m = 0). If (C(x_3, y_3)) and (D(x_4, y_4)) are points on this line, the midpoint of (CD) will also be (M), and (x_3 + x_4 = frac{4}{3}), leading to [|CD| = sqrt{2} cdot |x_3 - x_4| = sqrt{frac{24m - 16}{9}}.] The distance (d) from point (M) to line (AB) can be computed using the point-line distance formula, yielding [d = frac{|frac{1}{3} - 3|}{sqrt{2}} = frac{4sqrt{2}}{3}.] By the Pythagorean theorem, (|MA|^2 = |MB|^2 = d^2 + left(frac{|AB|}{2}right)^2) needs to be equal to (left(frac{|CD|}{2}right)^2) for all points to lie on the same circle centered at (M) with radius (frac{|CD|}{2}). For this to be true, (|AB| < |CD|) must hold. Therefore, points (A), (B), (C), and (D) lie on the same circle with center (M) if (|AB| < |CD|), which implies that there exists a value of (m) such that this condition is satisfied.

Draw a diagonal that is fully contained inside the quadrilateral. This diagonal divides the quadrilateral into two triangles.    - Any light bulb placed inside one of these triangles will light up the sides of the quadrilateral that are part of that triangle. Hence, at least two sides of the quadrilateral will be fully lightened.    - Therefore, for ( n = 4 ), it is not possible to have a point inside the quadrilateral such that each side has a point that is not lightened. 3. **For ( n = 5 ):**    - Consider a pentagon.

Hence, angle DKA = 90^circ. 4. Based on the geometric configuration, KM_{1} is the Simson line for point D with respect to the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The Simson line of a point on the circumcircle of a triangle is the line that contains the feet of the perpendiculars dropped from the point to each of the sides of the triangle. 5. Therefore, KM_{1}, being the Simson line, indicates that the points K, M_{1}, and the foot of the perpendicular from D to AB are collinear. 6. Consequently, the point N on KM_{1} that intersects the extension of AB is a notable point where the angle angle DNA can be determined. 7. Since KM_{1} is the Simson line, it inherently leads to the conclusion that the angle angle DNA involves the right angles formed by the perpendiculars from D. 8. Finally, the Simson line property confirms that the angle between these constructed lines involving point D will always be right angles at those intersections on the circumcircle's sides.

Given ( r = frac{|a_0|}{1 + |a_0|} ), then: [ sum_{k=0}^{n} | alpha |^k < frac{1}{1-r}. ] 5. Simplify using (1 + |a_0|): [ 1 + |a_0| leq r frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} < 1 + |a_0|. ] We get the final contradiction implying ( |alpha| > frac{|a_0|}{1 + |a_0|} ).

Additionally, it is given that f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (-infty, 0]. 2. **Evaluating given condition**: We are given that f(-2) = 1. Since f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (-infty, 0], for any x leq -2, f(x) geq f(-2) = 1.

What is the speed of the man walking?","output":"First, let's convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s, because the length of the train is given in meters and the time in seconds. Speed in m/s = Speed in km/hr * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) Speed of train in m/s = 63 * (1000 / 1) * (1 / 3600) Speed of train in m/s = 63 * 1000 / 3600 Speed of train in m/s = 63000 / 3600 Speed of train in m/s = 17.5 m/s Now, we know the train takes 71.99424046076314 seconds to pass the man. During this time, the train covers its own length plus the distance the man walks in the same direction. Let's denote the speed of the man as Vm (in m/s). The distance the man covers in 71.99424046076314 seconds is Vm * 71.99424046076314. The total distance covered by the train while passing the man is the length of the train plus the distance the man walks. So we have: Distance covered by train = Speed of train * Time taken to pass the man 1200 m + (Vm * 71.99424046076314) = 17.5 m/s * 71.99424046076314 s Now we can solve for Vm: 1200 m + (Vm * 71.99424046076314) = 1259.973208063356 m Vm * 71.99424046076314 = 1259.973208063356 m - 1200 m Vm * 71.99424046076314 = 59.973208063356 m Vm = 59.973208063356 m / 71.99424046076314 s Vm ≈ 0.8333333333333334 m/s So the speed of the man walking is approximately 0.8333333333333334 m/s.

This gives us the equation:    S + C + 1 (captain) + K = 15 2. Legs: The total number of legs is the sum of the legs of the sailors, the cook, the captain, and the cats. Sailors, the cook, and cats each have 2 legs, but the captain has only one leg. This gives us the equation:    2S + 2C + 1 (captain) + 4K = 43 We know there is only one cook on the ship, so C = 1.

Since the directrix is a horizontal line, the parabola opens either upwards or downwards. In this case, because the directrix is above the potential vertex of the parabola, the parabola opens downwards.  Let's denote the equation of the parabola in the form x^{2}=-2py, where p>0 indicates the distance from the vertex to the focus (and also to the directrix). The directrix equation is given by y=-frac{p}{2} for a downward-opening parabola. However, since our directrix is y=2, we adjust our understanding to match the orientation and find that the directrix is actually y=2, indicating a positive value. This suggests we need to correct our approach to align with the standard conventions and the given directrix. Given the directrix y=2, and knowing that the parabola opens downwards, we can infer that the vertex is located above the directrix. The standard form of a parabola opening downwards is x^{2}=-4ay, where a is the distance from the vertex to the focus (and equivalently to the directrix).  Setting the directrix equation to y=2, we aim to find the corresponding value of a that satisfies this condition. Given the directrix is at y=2, and considering the parabola's symmetry and properties, we deduce that a=2 to ensure the directrix is correctly positioned at y=2. This leads to a misunderstanding in the initial assumption about the form and properties of the equation, which should be directly related to the standard form of a parabola opening downwards. Correcting the approach based on the standard parabolic equation and its orientation, we find that the equation of the parabola, considering it opens downwards and the directrix is y=2, is indeed x^{2}=-8y. This is derived from the corrected understanding that the standard form for a downward-opening parabola with a directrix above it is x^{2}=-4ay, and with the directrix at y=2, we find that a=2, leading to the equation x^{2}=-8y. Therefore, the correct standard equation of the parabola, given its directrix y=2, is boxed{x^{2}=-8y}, which corresponds to option boxed{D}."},{"instruction":"Nancy had 101 homework problems.

The discriminant Delta of the quadratic equation related to f(x) being 0 means the function touches the x-axis at one point, thus Delta = a^{2}-4(-b) = a^{2}+4b=0. This leads to the relationship b = -frac{a^{2}}{4}. Substituting b in a+4b, we get: [ a+4left(-frac{a^{2}}{4}right) = a - a^{2} ] Therefore, a+4b=0 is based on the assumption that a - a^{2} = 0, which does not necessarily hold for all values of a.

The sum of the roots, given by Vieta's formulas, is -(frac{-a}{1}) = a = (m-4) + (m+1) = 2m-3. Rearranging gives us m = frac{1}{2}(a + 3). Since this shows a direct relationship between m and a, not affirming m = a + 3 directly, option B is incorrect. 3. **Analyzing Option C:** From the previous analysis, we have a = 2m - 3 and b = -frac{a^{2}}{4}. Substituting a into the equation for b, we obtain: [ b = -frac{1}{4}(2m - 3)^{2} ] This directly matches option C, confirming its correctness. 4. **Analyzing Option D:** For the equation to have roots at x_{1} = m-4 and x_{2} = m+1, the difference squared (x_{1} - x_{2})^{2} = 25 is derived from the relation a^{2} + 4b - 4c + 4 = 25. Considering a^{2}+4b=0 from the range of f(x), we simplify to 4 - 4c = 25, leading to the conclusion that c = -frac{21}{4}, which matches option D and proves it correct.

Consider a point ( X ) which is the center of a circle that intersects the given circle with center ( O_1 ) at diametrically opposite points. The radius of this circle is ( r ). 2.

Since m_1 neq m_2, the lines are not parallel. Two lines are coinciding if they have the same slope and the same y-intercept.

The merchant wants to create a 60-pound mixture that sells for 3.00 per pound. The total revenue from selling this mixture is therefore 60 pounds * 3.00/pound = 180. The merchant is using 10 pounds of cashews, which cost 6.00 per pound, so the total cost for the cashews is 10 pounds * 6.00/pound = 60. Since the total cost of the mixture is 180 and we already know the cost of the cashews, we can find the cost of the peanuts by subtracting the cost of the cashews from the total cost: Total cost of peanuts = Total cost of mixture - Cost of cashews Total cost of peanuts = 180 - 60 Total cost of peanuts = 120 Now, we need to find out how many pounds of peanuts the merchant is using. We know the total weight of the mixture is 60 pounds and that 10 pounds of that is cashews, so the weight of the peanuts is: Weight of peanuts = Total weight of mixture - Weight of cashews Weight of peanuts = 60 pounds - 10 pounds Weight of peanuts = 50 pounds Now we can find the price per pound of peanuts by dividing the total cost of peanuts by the weight of peanuts: Price per pound of peanuts = Total cost of peanuts / Weight of peanuts Price per pound of peanuts = 120 / 50 pounds Price per pound of peanuts = 2.40 So, the price per pound of peanuts is boxed{2.40} ."},{"instruction":"Given an infinitely decreasing geometric series.

Next, consider the sums of the squares of the terms. The squares of the terms at odd positions also form a geometric progression with the first term ( b_1^2 ) and a common ratio ( q^2 ). Hence, the sum is:    [    S_{text{odd}^2} = frac{b_1^2}{1 - q^4}    ] 6. Similarly, the squares of the terms at even positions form a geometric progression with the first term ( b_1^2 q^2 ) and a common ratio ( q^4 ).

Chad saves 40% of his total earnings. He saved 460 this year, which represents 40% of his total earnings. To find out 100% of his earnings, we can set up a proportion: 40% / 100% = 460 / Total Earnings To solve for Total Earnings, we can use cross-multiplication: 40% * Total Earnings = 100% * 460 0.40 * Total Earnings = 460 Total Earnings = 460 / 0.40 Total Earnings = 1150 Now we know Chad's total earnings for the year were 1150.

Thus, cubing each entry and summing, the expression for the sum of the cubes of the elements in the nth row becomes  sum_{k=0}^n binom{n}{k}^3.  We need to find a formula or expression for this sum. A known identity (often proven by a combinatorial argument) states that  sum_{k=0}^n binom{n}{k}^3 = binom{2n}{n}.  This translates the problem into evaluating g(n) = log_{10} (binom{2n}{n}).  Using Stirling's approximation for large n, binom{2n}{n} approx frac{4^n}{sqrt{pi n}}.

Given that f(x) = f(2-x), we can substitute -x for x in this equation to get f(-x) = f(2+x). Using the property of odd functions from step 1, we substitute -f(x) for f(-x) to get -f(x) = f(2+x). 3. Rearranging the equation from step 2, we find that f(2+x) = -f(x). This implies that if we add 2 to the argument of f, the function value changes its sign. 4. Applying the result from step 3 again but to f(2+x), we get f(4+x) = -f(2+x). Since f(2+x) = -f(x), substituting this into the equation gives f(4+x) = -(-f(x)) = f(x). 5. The result from step 4 shows that f(x) is a periodic function with a period of 4. This means that f(x+4k) = f(x) for any integer k. 6.

Since we know the total number of soccer players (250) and the number of boys playing soccer (195), we can find the number of girls playing soccer by subtracting the boys from the total soccer players: 250 soccer players - 195 boys playing soccer = 55 girls playing soccer Finally, to find out how many girl students are not playing soccer, we subtract the number of girls playing soccer from the total number of girls: 108 girls - 55 girls playing soccer = 53 girls not playing soccer So, there are boxed{53}  girl students at Parkway Elementary School who are not playing soccer."},{"instruction":"Beth had a set of some gold coins.

It is given that:      [      T_{1}=1, quad T_{2}=5      ]    - For ( n geqslant 3 ), the recurrence relation is given by:      [      T_{n} = T_{n-1} + 4T_{n-2} + 2T_{n-3}      ]    Using the recurrence relation and initial values, we calculate step by step:    - For ( T_{3} ):      [      T_{3} = T_{2} + 4T_{1} + 2 = 5 + 4 cdot 1 + 2 = 11      ]        - For ( T_{4} ):      [      T_{4} = T_{3} + 4T_{2} + 2T_{1} = 11 + 4 cdot 5 + 2 cdot 1 = 11 + 20 + 2 = 33      ]    - For ( T_{5} ):      [      T_{5} = T_{4} + 4T_{3} + 2T_{2} = 33 + 4 cdot 11 + 2 cdot 5 = 33 + 44 + 10 = 87      ]    - For ( T_{6} ):      [      T_{6} = T_{5} + 4T_{4} + 2T_{3} = 87 + 4 cdot 33 + 2 cdot 11 = 87 + 132 + 22 = 241      ]    - For ( T_{7} ):      [      T_{7} = T_{6} + 4T_{5} + 2T_{4} = 241 + 4 cdot 87 + 2 cdot 33 = 241 + 348 + 66 = 655      ]    - For ( T_{8} ):      [      T_{8} = T_{7} + 4T_{6} + 2T_{5} = 655 + 4 cdot 241 + 2 cdot 87 = 655 + 964 + 174 = 1793      ]    - For ( T_{9} ):      [      T_{9} = T_{8} + 4T_{7} + 2T_{6} = 1793 + 4 cdot 655 + 2 cdot 241 = 1793 + 2620 + 482 = 4895      ]    - For ( T_{10} ):      [      T_{10} = T_{9} + 4T_{8} + 2T_{7} = 4895 + 4 cdot 1793 + 2 cdot 655 = 4895 + 7172 + 1310 = 13377      ]    Hence, ( T_{10} = 13377 ). 2. **Finding the units digit of ( T_{2013} ):**    - We observe that ( T_{n} ) modulo 5 shows a repeating pattern. Examining the initial values modulo 5:      [      begin {align*}      T_1 & = 1,       T_2 & = 0,       T_3 & = 1,       T_4 & = 3,       T_5 & = 2,       T_6 & = 1,       T_7 & = 0,       T_8 & = 3,       T_9 & = 0,       T_{10} & = 2,       end {align*}      ]      Observing these values, we identify that the sequence of ( T_n mod 5 ) seems to repeat every 24 terms.    - To find ( T_{2013} mod 5 ), we calculate:      [      2013 mod 24 = 21      ]      Hence, ( T_{2013} mod 5 = T_{21} mod 5 ).    - From the periodic pattern set previously:      [      T_{21} mod 5 = 3      ]        Hence, the units digit of ( T_{2013} ) is 3. # Conclusion: - ( T_{10} = 13377 ) - The units digit of ( T_{2013} ) is 3.

We start by observing the given angle relationship: [ angle MHD + angle MLD = 180^circ ] 2. This indicates that the quadrilateral (MLDH) is a cyclic quadrilateral (a quadrilateral whose vertices all lie on the circumference of a circle). This conclusion follows from the property of cyclic quadrilaterals that the sum of the opposite angles is (180^circ). 3. Given (MD) is the diameter of this circle, the cyclic quadrilateral (MLDH) can also be described as having its diameter (MD). This follows from the circle's property where an angle subtended by a diameter at the circumference is a right angle. 4. We need to further analyze the given information about the segments (KH) and (AK): [ KH = frac{1}{2} AB = AK = DL ] 5. Given (KH = DL), the quadrilateral (KLDH) is an isosceles trapezoid (trapezoid with equal non-parallel sides). Therefore, (KLDH) can also be inscribed in a circle, meeting the criteria for a cyclic quadrilateral. 6. As these circles coincide with three common points (L), (D), and (H), the circles containing (KLDH) and (MLDH) are the same. This allows us to infer that the relevant properties and conclusions about the angles and segments hold consistently across both quadrilaterals. 7. Finally, considering (MD) as the diameter and the isosceles trapezoid property of (KLDH), we determine the following angle relationship at point (K): [ angle MKD = 90^circ ] Thus, we conclude that: [boxed{angle MKD = 90^circ} ]"},{"instruction":"the Cartesian coordinate system xOy, the distance from point A({m,sqrt{m}}) to the xaxis is 4.

The distance from a point to the x-axis is determined by the absolute value of the y-coordinate of the point. Therefore, the distance from point A({-m,sqrt{m}}) to the x-axis is given by the y-coordinate, which is sqrt{m}. 2. Given that this distance is 4, we set the y-coordinate equal to 4 to find the value of m:    [    sqrt{m} = 4    ] 3. Squaring both sides of the equation to solve for m:    [    m = 4^2 = 16    ] 4. Substituting m = 16 into the coordinates of point A, we find the x-coordinate as -m, which becomes -16. 5. Therefore, the coordinates of point A are (-16, 4).

Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas into this equation, we get: [ -2m + 5 + 4 = m^{2} + 6 ] Simplifying this equation: [ m^{2} + 2m - 3 = 0 ] Factoring the quadratic equation: [ (m + 3)(m - 1) = 0 ] Thus, m = -3 or m = 1.

Our goal is to determine the maximum number of birds (Chizh) that can be simultaneously seated on these posts. 2. **Proof by Contradiction:**    To show that it is impossible to have all 25 posts occupied by Chizhs. Assume, for contradiction, that all 25 posts are occupied by a Chizh.    - Focus on the Chizh that landed last. Since it occupies the last unoccupied post, it must have caused a Chizh from one of its adjacent posts to fly away. This is due to the problem's condition that a Chizh will fly away if another Chizh lands on one of the neighboring posts. Therefore, having all 25 posts occupied leads to a contradiction. 3. **Establishing the Maximum:**    Now, let's present a scenario where 24 Chizhs can occupy the posts.    - Number the posts sequentially from 1 to 25.    - Consider the initially empty setting of the posts and proceed sequentially. 4. **Step-by-Step Occupation:**        Assume that all posts from (1) to (k) are occupied and (k leq 23).    We will demonstrate how to extend this to all posts from (1) to (k+1) being occupied.        - As soon as all posts from (1) to (k) are occupied:      - The next Chizh will land on the ((k+2))-th post (where (k+2 leq 25)).      - Immediately, another Chizh will occupy the ((k+1))-th post, causing the Chizh on the ((k+2))-th post to fly away.    - Consequently, the posts from (1) to (k+1) will be occupied. 5. **Iterating this Process:**        By iterating this process for values of (k) from (1) to (23), we can show that we can occupy the first 24 posts. 6. **Conclusion:**    By following the established systematic approach, we can conclude that the maximum number of birds (Chizhs) that can be simultaneously seated on the 25 posts is (24).

Find the minimum length of (BD) if (AI = BC = CD = 2).  1. **Understanding given conditions**:     We are given that (ABCD) is cyclic (inscribed in a circle), and (I) is the incenter of (triangle ABD). Additionally, we know (AI = BC = CD = 2). 2. **Equal arcs and bisectors**:    Since (AI) is the bisector of (angle BAD) and (BC = CD), arcs (BC) and (CD) must be equal. Therefore, point (C) lies on the angle bisector (AI). 3. **Using Lemma about Equal Chord Segments**:    According to a specific lemma, (CI = CB = CD = 2). This places point (C) such that it defines equal lengths from the center to the endpoints of a chord. 4. **First Method with Perpendiculars**:    - Let (K) and (N) denote the feet of perpendiculars dropped from points (C) and (I) to segment (BD) respectively.    - In triangles (triangle BKC) and (triangle ANI), since (CI = IN), and both these perpendiculars are radii of the inscribed circle of (triangle ABD), segment (BD) bisects (CI) at point (L).    - Therefore, (CL = IL = 1). 5. **Chord Segment Theorem Application**:     - Since (BD) bisects (CI) at (L), using the Power of a Point theorem, we have:      [      BL cdot DL = AL cdot CL      ]      Let (BL = x) and (DL = y).

We need to prove that we can erase one number such that the sum of the remaining numbers is not divisible by any number on the blackboard. 2. **Calculate the sum ( S ) of all numbers on the blackboard:**    [    S = n + (n+1) + (n+2) + cdots + (2n-1)    ]    This is an arithmetic series with the first term ( a = n ) and the last term ( l = 2n-1 ).

This means that each number in the sequence has a unique residue modulo any number in the sequence. 6. **Contradiction argument:**    Assume for contradiction that for every ( x ) in the sequence, ( S' ) is divisible by some number in the sequence. This implies that each ( S' ) is divisible by exactly one number in the sequence, since there are ( n-1 ) sums and ( n-1 ) numbers. 7. **Special case analysis:**    Consider ( x = n ). The new sum is:    [    S' = frac{n(3n-3)}{2}    ]    Since ( n ) is odd, ( frac{3n-3}{2} ) is an integer. Note that:    [    n < frac{3n-3}{2} < 2n-1    ]    This means ( frac{3n-3}{2} ) is a number in the sequence. Therefore, ( S' ) is divisible by both ( n ) and ( frac{3n-3}{2} ), which contradicts the assumption that each ( S' ) is divisible by exactly one number in the sequence. 8. **Conclusion:**    The contradiction shows that our assumption is false. Therefore, there must exist at least one number ( x ) such that ( S' ) is not divisible by any number in the sequence.

This distance ( d ) is invariant, meaning it does not change with each step. 2. **Step Description**:    - At each step, one of the pebbles is moved to a new lattice point such that the distance between the pebbles remains ( sqrt{d} ).    - This implies that if pebble ( A ) moves to ((x_i, y_i)) and pebble ( B ) moves to ((z_i, t_i)), then the new coordinates must satisfy the condition ( (x_i - z_i)^2 + (y_i - t_i)^2 = d ). 3. **Induction on ( d )**:    - We proceed by induction on ( d ), considering three cases based on the value of ( d mod 4 ). 4. **Case 1: ( d equiv 1 pmod{2} )**:    - Here, ( p ) and ( q ) are of opposite parity (one is even, the other is odd).    - For any vector ( vec{r_i} = (u_i, v_i) ) such that ( u_i^2 + v_i^2 = d ), ( u_i ) and ( v_i ) must also be of opposite parity.    - Therefore, the sum ( x_i + y_i ) (coordinates of pebble ( A )) is always even, and the sum ( z_i + t_i ) (coordinates of pebble ( B )) is always odd.    - Since the parity of the sums ( x_i + y_i ) and ( z_i + t_i ) are different, the pebbles can never switch positions. 5. **Case 2: ( d equiv 2 pmod{4} )**:    - Here, both ( p ) and ( q ) are odd.    - For any vector ( vec{r_i} = (u_i, v_i) ) such that ( u_i^2 + v_i^2 = d ), ( u_i ) and ( v_i ) must also be odd.    - Therefore, ( x_i ) and ( y_i ) (coordinates of pebble ( A )) are always even, and ( z_i ) and ( t_i ) (coordinates of pebble ( B )) are always odd.    - Since the parity of the coordinates ( x_i, y_i ) and ( z_i, t_i ) are different, the pebbles can never switch positions. 6. **Case 3: ( d equiv 0 pmod{4} )**:    - Here, both ( p ) and ( q ) are even.    - For any vector ( vec{r_i} = (u_i, v_i) ) such that ( u_i^2 + v_i^2 = d ), ( u_i ) and ( v_i ) must also be even.    - Therefore, all coordinates ( x_i, y_i, z_i, t_i ) are even.    - We can divide all coordinates by 2, reducing the problem to a smaller lattice with ( d ) divided by 4.    - By induction, if it is not possible to switch positions for the reduced ( d ), it is not possible for the original ( d ). Since in all cases, the pebbles cannot switch positions while preserving the distance, we conclude that it is not possible to switch the positions of the pebbles.

Thus, z must be a purely imaginary number, z = yi. 5. **Consider positive and negative y:**    - Since z satisfies the original equation if and only if -z does, we initially consider y to be positive and later account for negative y by doubling the number of roots. Note that y ne 0 because z = 0 does not satisfy the original equation. 6. **Substitute z = yi into the equation:**    - Substituting z = yi into e^z = frac{z - 1}{z + 1}, we get e^{iy} = frac{iy - 1}{iy + 1}. 7. **Analyze angles:**    - As y increases from 0 to infty, the angle of iy -1 decreases from pi to frac{pi}{2}, and the angle of iy+1 increases from 0 to frac{pi}{2}. The angle of frac{iy - 1}{iy + 1} decreases from pi to 0. 8. **Find intervals for y:**    - For each interval from 2npi to (2n + 2)pi, there is exactly one y in (2npi, (2n + 1)pi) that makes frac{iy - 1}{iy + 1} and e^{iy} equal, and no y in [(2n + 1)pi, (2n + 2)pi] does. 9. **Count the roots:**    - We find 5 positive roots for y in the intervals (0, pi), (2pi, 3pi), (4pi, 5pi), (6pi, 7pi), and (8pi, 9pi). We stop at 9pi because 9pi < 30 < 10pi. 10. **Consider negative roots and conclude:**     - Since there are 5 positive roots for y, and by symmetry, there are also 5 negative roots for y.

Step-by-Step Analysis: 1. **Introduction of Concept of Angular Spread:**    To explore the problem conveniently, let's introduce the concept of the angular spread of a polygon with respect to the origin O. From the point O, draw lines to every vertex of a polygon M. The angle subtended by these lines at O is called the angular spread of polygon M at O. 2. **Example of Single Polygon:**    Referring to Figure 1-24, consider the angular spread angle AOB. Clearly, every point of the polygon M lies within this angular region angle AOB. To solve for the smallest value of m, a polygon with the smallest angular spread is critical. 3. **Case with Two Polygons:**    When there are exactly two polygons that are properly positioned, as per the problem's conditions, m=1 as there exists such a single line through the origin which intersects both polygons. 4. **Case with Three or More Polygons:**    Consider three polygons ( M_1, M_2, ) and ( M_3 ) as shown in Figure 1-25. Given they are properly positioned, there must exist a line through the origin that intersects ( M_1 ) and ( M_3 ), and another line that intersects ( M_2 ) and ( M_3 ).

From the problem's conditions, there exists a line ( l ) through the origin that intersects both M and M'. The line ( l ) either aligns with ( l_1 ) or ( l_2 ) or falls between them. This implies:    - If ( l ) coincides with ( l_1 ) or ( l_2 ), then m=2.    - If ( l ) is between ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ), given the angular spread beta geq alpha of ( M' ) about the origin, there must be another line ( l' ) intersecting both ( M' ) and lying outside the interval ( angle alpha ) formed by ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ).    - If ( l' ) coincides with ( l_1 ) or ( l_2 ), ( m=2 ).    - If ( l' ) lies within ( angle alpha )'s external region, at least one line ( l_1 ) or ( l_2 ) falls between ( l ) and ( l', intersecting both polygons. 7. **Conclusion:**    From above considerations, it's clear that each polygon ( M' ) intersects at least one of the lines ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ).

The difference between the jars left undamaged and the jars good for sale gives us the number of additional jars that were damaged: 585 jars - 565 jars = 20 jars These 20 jars that were additionally damaged must have come from the totally damaged cartons. Since each carton contains 20 jars, we can find out the number of totally damaged cartons by dividing the number of additionally damaged jars by the number of jars per carton: 20 jars / 20 jars/carton = 1 carton Therefore, there was boxed{1}  carton that was totally damaged."},{"instruction":"Paula initially had enough paint for 40 identically sized rooms.

The difference between the areas is ( B - A ), so we have: ( B - A = frac{A + B}{6} )  (Equation 2) Now we can solve these two equations simultaneously. From Equation 1, we can express ( B ) in terms of ( A ): ( B = 1,800 - A )  (Equation 3) Substitute Equation 3 into Equation 2: ( (1,800 - A) - A = frac{A + (1,800 - A)}{6} ) Simplify the equation: ( 1,800 - 2A = frac{1,800}{6} ) ( 1,800 - 2A = 300 ) Now, solve for ( A ): ( 2A = 1,800 - 300 ) ( 2A = 1,500 ) ( A = frac{1,500}{2} ) ( A = 750 ) So, the area of the smaller part is boxed{750}  hectares."},{"instruction":"Solve the congruence 13m equiv 9 pmod{47}, as a residue modulo 47.

Conclusion: Thus, it is impossible to sequentially remove the numbers as described. The removal sequence impedes the requirement that sums consistently remain divisible by eleven after each stage.

This implies that the false coin must be among the remaining two coins ( D ) and ( E ).     - If Cat Basilio states that there is a false coin among ( A ) and ( B ), then ( D ) and ( E ) are genuine, because you had paid a false coin ( C ).     Therefore, in the first step, we can have one of the following conclusions:     - Either identify three genuine coins, and reduce the problem to two coins (D and E),     - Or identify one false coin among the three coins, reducing the problem to identifying which specific coin is false among these three (A, B, C). 2. **Second Question:**     If from the first step, you determined that the false coin is among ( D ) and ( E ):     - Pay one genuine coin (say ( A )) to Cat Basilio, and ask him about the pair ( D ) and ( E ).     Cat Basilio's truthful answer will directly tell you whether one of ( D ) or ( E ) is false or if both are genuine.     - If ( D ) or ( E ) contains a false coin, you will further narrow it down.     - If no false claim, the previous paid coin ( C ) is confirmed false.     Alternatively, if from the first step, the false coin was among ( A, B, ) and ( C ):     - Pay a genuine coin (from step 1) to Basilio, and ask about any two of the other three.

We have three choices for this mapping, as the image can be 1, 2, or 3.

We have three choices for the fixed point, and for each choice of fixed point, there are two choices for the common image of the other two elements.

Now we can find the equation of the tangent line l that passes through M. Using the point-slope form of the line equation: y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), we have y - 2 = frac{4}{3}(x - 0), simplifying and putting into the standard form gives: 4x - 3y + 6 = 0. Since line l is parallel to line l', their slopes must be equal. Hence, a must be 3 for line l': 4x - ay + 2 = 0 to be parallel to l. Setting a=3 gives us the equation of line l': 4x - 3y + 2 = 0. The distance between two parallel lines of the form Ax + By + C_1 = 0 and Ax + By + C_2 = 0 is given by the formula: d = frac{|C_2 - C_1|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}. Using this formula, the distance between lines l and l' is: d = frac{|6 - 2|}{sqrt{4^2 + (-3)^2}} = frac{4}{sqrt{16 + 9}} = frac{4}{sqrt{25}} = frac{4}{5}.

Rick and Sophia spend the same amount of money, while Jose spends 1.5 times the amount Rick spends. Emma receives a 20% discount on her meal, which would originally cost as much as Jose's meal. The group decides to share the cost of the appetizer equally among themselves. If Jose ate lunch worth 60, what is the total cost of lunch for all five friends after dividing the cost of the appetizer and including taxes at 8%?","output":"First, let's calculate the cost of each person's meal before taxes and the shared appetizer. Jose's meal cost 60. Rick and Sophia each spent the same amount as Rick, so Rick's meal cost is the same as Jose's, which is 60. Adam spent two-thirds as much as Rick, so Adam's meal cost is 2/3 * 60 = 40. Emma would have spent as much as Jose without the discount, so her meal would have cost 60. With a 20% discount, Emma's meal cost is 60 - (20% of 60) = 60 - 12 = 48. Now, let's calculate the total cost of the meals before taxes and the shared appetizer: Total meal cost = Adam's + Rick's + Jose's + Sophia's + Emma's Total meal cost = 40 + 60 + 60 + 60 + 48 Total meal cost = 268 Next, let's calculate the cost of the appetizer shared by the five friends: Shared appetizer cost = 20 / 5 friends = 4 per friend Now, let's add the shared appetizer cost to each friend's meal cost: Adam's total = 40 + 4 = 44 Rick's total = 60 + 4 = 64 Jose's total = 60 + 4 = 64 Sophia's total = 60 + 4 = 64 Emma's total = 48 + 4 = 52 Now, let's calculate the total cost of the meals including the shared appetizer: Total cost including appetizer = Adam's total + Rick's total + Jose's total + Sophia's total + Emma's total Total cost including appetizer = 44 + 64 + 64 + 64 + 52 Total cost including appetizer = 288 Finally, let's calculate the total cost including taxes at 8%: Total cost including taxes = Total cost including appetizer * (1 + tax rate) Total cost including taxes = 288 * (1 + 0.08) Total cost including taxes = 288 * 1.08 Total cost including taxes = 310.56 The total cost of lunch for all five friends after dividing the cost of the appetizer and including taxes is boxed{310.56} ."},{"instruction":"a plane Cartesian coordinate system, color the point set left{(m, n) mid m, n in mathbf{Z}_{+}, 1 leqslant m, n leqslant 6right}  such that each unit square has exactly two red vertices. How many different coloring schemes are there?","output":"# Problem: In the XY-plane coordinate system, consider the point set left{(m, n) mid m, n in mathbb{Z}_{+}, 1 leq m, n leq 6right} Each point is colored either red or blue. The problem asks for the number of different ways to color these points such that each unit square in the grid has exactly two red vertices. 1. **Notation and Definitions**:    - The grid consists of points ((m, n)) where (m) and (n) are integers between 1 and 6, inclusive.    - We need to color the points either red or blue such that each unit square has exactly two red vertices. 2. **Consider the First Row**:    - There are a total of 6 points in the first row.    - Each point can be colored either red or blue independently.    - Therefore, there are (2^6 = 64) possible colorings for the first row alone.    - Now, we split these 64 cases into two categories:      1. No two consecutive points are of the same color (red and blue alternate).      2. At least two consecutive points share the same color. 3. **Case 1: No Two Consecutive Points Are the Same Color**:    - If no two consecutive points are the same color, the sequence alternates perfectly between red and blue.    - There are only 2 such possible arrangements (starting either with red or blue).    - For each following row, the second row's corresponding points will have exactly two valid arrangements as well because they must maintain the alternating pattern to ensure that each unit square formed with the first row has two red vertices.    - Therefore, for each of the 6 rows, there are only 2 valid configurations.    - Thus, total valid configurations in this case is:      [      2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 = 2^6 = 64      ] 4. **Case 2: At Least Two Consecutive Points Are the Same Color**:    - Out of the (2^6 = 64) first-row colorings, exactly 2 are alternating.    - Thus, (64 - 2 = 62) colorings have at least two consecutive points the same color.    - For these 62 configurations, coloring the following rows to satisfy the condition of each unit square having exactly two red vertices can be done in only one way per row (there are (62) ways in the first row, and only one way in following rows to keep proper configurations).    - So, there are (62) valid configurations for each of the following 5 rows.    - Therefore, total valid configurations in this case:      [      62 times 1 times 1 times 1 times 1 times 1 = 62      ] 5. **Total Number of Configurations**:    - Summing up the valid configurations from both cases:      [      64 text{ (all alternating from Case 1)} + 62 text{ (at least two consecutive points the same color from Case 2)} = 64 + 62 = 126      ] # Conclusion: Thus, the total number of different ways to color the points in the grid such that each unit square has exactly two red vertices is: boxed{126}"},{"instruction":"f 45  [ 28  { 37  ( 15  * ) } ] = 57, then * is equal to what number?","output":"Let's solve the equation step by step: 45 - [ 28 - { 37 - ( 15 - * ) } ] = 57 First, we need to simplify the expression inside the innermost parentheses: 37 - ( 15 - * ) Since we don't know the value of *, we'll just leave it as is for now.

Applying this formula to our problem, we have: |overrightarrow{a} + 2overrightarrow{b}|^2 = |overrightarrow{a}|^2 + (2overrightarrow{b})^2 + 2overrightarrow{a} cdot (2overrightarrow{b}) 4. Now, we plug in the given values: |overrightarrow{a} + 2overrightarrow{b}|^2 = 2^2 + (2 cdot 1)^2 + 2 cdot 2 cdot 1 cdot cos(60^{circ}) 5. Simplifying the expression, we get: |overrightarrow{a} + 2overrightarrow{b}|^2 = 4 + 4 + 4 cdot frac{1}{2} = 12 6. Taking the square root of both sides, we obtain the magnitude of |overrightarrow{a}+2overrightarrow{b}|: |overrightarrow{a} + 2overrightarrow{b}| = sqrt{12} = 2sqrt{3} Thus, the magnitude of |overrightarrow{a}+2overrightarrow{b}| is boxed{2sqrt{3}}."},{"instruction":"Removing the jokers from a standard deck of cards, we have 52 cards remaining.

The segments are drawn until there are no points left. The first player can win if they can choose the directions of all the drawn segments such that the sum of the resulting vectors is the zero vector. Otherwise, the second player wins. Who wins under optimal play?  Solution: # Step 1: Understanding the Game Setup 1. Consider the grid 49 times 69 with 50 times 70 = 3500 vertices. 2. Each player connects two vertices with segments. 3. No vertex can be an endpoint of more than one segment. # Step 2: Pairing the Vertices 1. Let's break down the marked vertices into pairs where each pair can form a horizontal segment of length 1. 2. Start by identifying all such pairs in the grid. # Step 3: Develop Winning Strategy for the First Player  Initial Move: 1. The first player makes the first move by connecting two points from any arbitrary pair of vertices.  Subsequent Moves: 2. Analyze the second player's move:    - If the second player connects two points within the same pair, the first player continues by connecting another pair of vertices.    - If the second player connects points from different pairs, the first player then connects the remaining two points from these pairs.  Explanation: 1. We need to consider the scenario if the first player is forced to respond to both types of moves mentioned. # Notice the Key Detail: 1. The total number of vertices 3500 is divisible by 4. Hence, the game board can always be partitioned into smaller paired groups. 2. Under optimal play, each player will aim to form pairs whose total sum of vectors can be counterbalanced. # Managing Vectors: 1. In any \\"pair of the first type\\" (two segments inside original pairs):    - Choose directions such that the sum of the two vectors is a zero vector. 2. In any \\"pair of the second type\\" (cross-segment pairs):    - Choose directions so that one vector can be horizontally neutralized by the other’s opposite direction. # Structuring the Endgame: 1. The first player ensures combinations of vectors are zeroed out by controlling the direction of vectors from pairs that he initiated and forced through responses. 2. The final two segments left (one initiated at the start by the first player and one final segment from the last unpaired point), can always be chosen to zero out given a symmetric choice of directions throughout the game. # Final Move Dynamics: 1. With the first player making the response move at every stage, the sum adjusted will always align. # Conclusion: Given the ability of the first player to pair adjacent pairs and align vectors optimally, the first player can always ensure the total sum of vectors to be zero at the end through correct directional choices under symmetric optimal strategy.

In an equilateral triangle ( Delta ABC ), each side (a = b = c) and each angle ( angle A = angle B = angle C = frac{pi}{3} ). 3. The area ( Delta ) of an equilateral triangle with side length (a) is given by:     [     Delta = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} a^2     ] 4.

The number of ways to select 4 crayons from 14 can be calculated by the combination formula: [ binom{14}{4} = frac{14!}{4!(14-4)!} = frac{14 times 13 times 12 times 11}{4 times 3 times 2 times 1} = 1001 ] The calculation gives us 1001 ways to select 4 crayons from the 14 non-red crayons. Since the selection of the red crayon is fixed, the number of ways to select the 5 crayons including the red one is also 1001.

Thus, we have: [|x - (-1)| = 6] Simplifying the expression inside the absolute value gives us: [|x + 1| = 6] The absolute value equation |x + 1| = 6 has two solutions because the number x + 1 could be 6 or -6 (since the absolute value of both 6 and -6 is 6). Solving for x in both cases: 1. If x + 1 = 6, then subtracting 1 from both sides gives x = 6 - 1, which simplifies to x = 5. 2.

Similarly, the remaining lifespan of the rear tire is 1 - frac{x}{9000}, and after swapping to the front, the lifespan decreases by frac{1}{11000} for every thousand kilometers traveled. Since both tires wear out at the same time, the remaining lifespan of the front tire divided by frac{1}{9000} equals the number of kilometers it can still run, and the remaining lifespan of the rear tire divided by frac{1}{11000} equals the number of kilometers it can still run. Since the tires wear out simultaneously after swapping, the distance traveled after swapping is the same for both tires. Therefore, we can set up an equation to solve this problem. Let's denote the distance at which the tires should be swapped as x kilometers. The remaining lifespan of the front tire when swapped is 1 - frac{x}{11000}, and it will then act as the rear tire, losing frac{1}{9000} of its lifespan for every thousand kilometers traveled.

Let g(x) = f(x) - frac{lambda}{x}. We then need g(x) to be increasing on [1,2]. This requires that g'(x) geq 0 for any x in [1,2]. Consequently, x-(2a+2)+frac{2a+1}{x}+frac{lambda}{x^2} geq 0 Rightarrow x^3-(2a+2)x^2+(2a+1)x+lambda geq 0. Now, (2x-2x^2)a+x^3-2x^2+x+lambda geq 0 for a in left[frac{1}{2}, 2right]. Since x in [1,2] gives 2x-2x^2 leq 0, we only need to consider a=2. Therefore, 2(2x-2x^2)+x^3-2x^2+x+lambda geq 0 Rightarrow x^3-6x^2+5x+lambda geq 0 for all x in [1,2]. Let h(x) = x^3-6x^2+5x+lambda. Then h'(x) = 3x^2-12x+5 and we need h(x) to be decreasing on [1,2]. Thus h'(x) leq 0 on [1,2], and h(x) attains its minimum at x=2.

Consider the number ( 25 ) and its multiples.        - Notice that ( 25 times 4 = 100 ).    - By examining the multiples of ( 25 ), we observe that the last two digits of any multiple are influenced by ( 25 ). 2. Let ( k cdot 25 ) represent a multiple of ( 25 ).        Depending on the value of ( k mod 4 ), the last two digits of ( k cdot 25 ) will be:    - ( k mod 4 = 0 rightarrow k cdot 25 equiv 00 mod 100 )    - ( k mod 4 = 1 rightarrow k cdot 25 equiv 25 mod 100 )    - ( k mod 4 = 2 rightarrow k cdot 25 equiv 50 mod 100 )    - ( k mod 4 = 3 rightarrow k cdot 25 equiv 75 mod 100 )        From the above four cases, we conclude:    - The last two digits of any multiple of ( 25 ) are constrained to be one of {00, 25, 50, 75}.    - None of these pairs end in 55, which means none of these will have both of the last two digits as 5. 3.

If it is horizontal, then the remaining part of the worm coincides with (W(wU)). If the domino is vertical, the cell to its left must also be part of a vertical domino, and the worm that remains after removing these two vertical dominoes coincides with (W(w)). Second, the same logic applies to (D(wRR)) as each vertical or horizontal domino can be dissected progressively backward leading to the previously formed worms. For the third relation (D(wUR)), consider a domino covering the top-rightmost cell in (W(wUR)). If the domino is vertical, the worm corresponds to (W(wU)), and its displacement by removing previous dominos leads to (D(wU)). The horizontal segmentation aligns similarly when tracing the worm decomposition: [ D(wUR) = 2D(wU) - D(w) ] Because each unique worm is split differently by adjusting the dominos' vertical and horizontal positions. The proof for (D(wRU)) follows analogously by tracing dominos' placements backward conforming to the (D) values for (wR).

Hence, if a figure can be drawn without lifting the pencil and without retracing any line, it has at most two nodes where an odd number of line segments converge. 8. **Converse Statement:**     - Consider a figure with at most two odd nodes. For such figures, it is indeed possible to draw them without lifting the pen from the paper.     - **Proof by induction:**       - **Base Case:** A figure consisting of a single line segment is trivially drawable with start and end points as the same (or different as considered).       - **Inductive Step:** Assume that any figure with up to ( n ) segments can be drawn as required. Now consider a figure with ( n+1 ) segments. If we start at one odd node and traverse the segments, ensuring we enter and exit through every even node, we always manage to end at the other odd node, thus always being able to complete the drawing. Conclusively, such a figure is drawable if and only if the number of odd nodes is no more than two. [ boxed{} ]  Part (b): 1. **Fixing the Streets of Moscow:**     - Consider Moscow’s street map. Every street segment is represented in a way to visualize the traversing process. 2. **Representation and Understanding:**     - Represent each segment with two close lines having common endpoints. Intersections and dead-ends are considered nodes (even or odd deciding on intersections and street ends). 3. **Ensuring Street Traversal Twice:**     - As shown in previous discussions, for a grahical representation where each street segment is considered as drawing line segments, if each node (intersection or dead-end) has double the lines, this implies each street gets traversed twice. 4. **Ensuring no Triple Traversal:**     - If we were to traverse each street exactly thrice, that would infer, in our graphical representation, each street intersecting thrice to respective nodes.     - Evaluate three odd intersections (\\"crossroads\\"): Assuming if three odd intersections imply infeasibility of drawing such lines in single draw without lift. Conclusively, each street segment in Moscow can be traversed exactly twice, but not possible thrice.

Let's represent an arbitrary odd number. Any odd number can be written in the form 2n + 1, where n is an integer.     x = 2n + 1  2. We now calculate the square of this odd number:     (2n + 1)^2      3. Expand the square:     (2n + 1)^2 = (2n + 1) (2n + 1) = 4n^2 + 4n + 1  4. Subtract 1 from the square of the odd number:     (2n + 1)^2 - 1 = 4n^2 + 4n + 1 - 1     Simplifying, we get:     4n^2 + 4n  5. Factor out the 4 from the expression:     4(n^2 + n)  6. Notice that the product n(n + 1) is always even. This is because n and n + 1 are consecutive integers; one of them must be even. Therefore, n(n + 1) is even, and can be written as 2k for some integer k. 7. So we can further write:     4(n(n + 1)) = 4 times 2k = 8k     Which is clearly divisible by 8. 8.

Tell me, who are your neighbors? asked the traveler. Everyone answered this question in the same way.  This information is insufficient! said the traveler.  But today is my birthday, don't forget that, said one of the guests.  Yes, today is his birthday! confirmed his neighbor. With this information, the traveler was able to deduce how many knights were at the table. How many knights are there?","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem**:    The question occurs on an island where there are knights (who always tell the truth) and liars (who always lie). The traveler asks each of the five guests who their neighbors are. All guests respond identically. A key point is introduced when one guest mentions it is their birthday, and their neighbor confirms this statement. Using this information, we can determine the number of knights sitting at the table. 2. **Possible Scenarios**:    Each guest might provide one of the following types of responses:    - \\"Both my neighbors are knights.\\"    - \\"One neighbor is a knight and the other is a liar.\\"    - \\"Both my neighbors are liars.\\" 3. **Analyzing the Statements**:    Suppose everyone is asked, \\"Who are your neighbors?\\"    - If everyone answered, \\"Both my neighbors are knights,\\" then:      - The traveler would immediately conclude that everyone around the table is a knight, since a knight only tells the truth, and only knights would make such a statement.  4. **Special Consideration of the Birthday Statement**:    - One guest mentions it's their birthday.    - The neighbor confirms the birthday.    This introduces a situation where one guest is affirmed by another; therefore, at least one of these guests must be a knight. 5. **Considering the Consistent Answer**:    Since everyone gave the same answer and considering the birthday scenario, we infer:    - If the answer was \\"both my neighbors are knights,\\" this couldn't match the birthday situation because while affirming a birthday, one of them would still need to always lie, creating a contradiction. 6. **Further Analysis**:    - Assume they responded, \\"one neighbor is a knight, and the other is a liar.\\" This answer would align with the table configuration as it satisfies the alternating pattern of knights and liars:       - Knight ( K ) - Liar ( L )       - Knight ( K ) - Liar ( L )       - Knight ( K ) - Liar ( L ) 7. **Confirming the Scenario**:    - For the \\"one knight one liar\\" pattern, consider the table:       - Knight ( K ) mentioning their truthful statement aligning with the liar, whose lying behavior fits the neighbor's birthday confirmation. 8. **Eliminating the Possibilities**:    - The configurations:      1. If all were knights, they wouldn't respond consistently about the neighbors with the birthday comment.      2. If knights and liars alternate (one knight, one liar), every knight must sit adjacent to lie at least one direction. 9. **Validating**:    - The only configuration that matches the problem constraints is indeed \\"one knight and one liar\\" scenario.

Through each two of them the line is drawn, and among the other given points, the one nearest to this line is marked (in each case this point occurred to be unique). What is the maximal possible number of marked points for each given  n ? *Proposed by Boris Frenkin (Russia)*","output":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of marked points for a given ( n ) points on a plane, where no three points are collinear. Let's denote this maximum number by ( f(n) ). 1. **Base Case ( n = 3 )**:    - For ( n = 3 ), any triangle formed by the three points will have each point marked when considering the lines formed by the other two points. Therefore, ( f(3) = 3 ). 2. **General Case ( n > 4 )**:    - Consider a slightly deformed regular polygon with ( n ) vertices. In such a configuration, each point can be the nearest to the line formed by any two other points. This gives us ( f(n) = n ) for ( n > 4 ). 3. **Special Cases ( n = 4 )**:    - For ( n = 4 ), we need to show that ( f(4) = 3 ). Suppose we have four points ( A, B, C, D ). Without loss of generality, assume that the triangle ( triangle ABC ) has the smallest area among the four possible triangles formed by any three of the four points. Since the distances from a line to points are unique, the smallest area triangle is also unique. Therefore, point ( D ) cannot be the nearest to any line formed by the points ( A, B, C ). Hence, ( f(4) = 3 ). 4. **Constructive Approach for ( n = 3k, 3k+1, 3k+2 )**:    - For ( n = 3k ), we can consider ( k ) isolated triangles, each contributing 3 marked points, giving us ( f(3k) = 3k ).    - For ( n = 3k+1 ), we can take ( k ) isolated triangles and one extra point very close to the joining line of two vertices from different triangles, giving us ( f(3k+1) = 3k+1 ).    - For ( n = 3k+2 ), we can take ( k ) isolated triangles and two extra points forming a very small angle with one of the triangle vertices, giving us ( f(3k+2) = 3k+2 ). Thus, the maximum number of marked points for each given ( n ) is ( f(n) = n ) for ( n > 4 ).

Proposition C is incorrect. - **Proposition D**: If a > |b|, then a^{2} > b^{2}.

If we break the cycle between points (n) and 1, we can transform the cyclic arrangement into a linear arrangement of (n) points. The number of ways to color these (n) points linearly, ensuring adjacent points have different colors, is (4 cdot 3^{n-1}). This is because there are 4 choices for the first point, and for each subsequent point, there are only 3 choices to ensure it differs from its neighbor.    [    text{Total linear coloring ways} = 4 cdot 3^{n-1}    ] 4. However, in the cyclic arrangement, the first and last points (points 1 and (n)) must also be different in color. Therefore, we need to adjust the count from the linear case. 5. If the 1st and (n)th point (or region) are different, then the total ways to reconnect the cycle validly are already calculated as (4 cdot 3^{n-1}). 6. If the 1st and (n)th points are colored the same, this effectively transforms the cycle to a smaller cycle of (n-1) points (since the points can be treated as a single point). The number of ways to color this smaller cycle is given by (a_{n-1}). 7. Combining these, the total count (a_n) of valid colorings for (n) points can be summarized as:    [    a_n + a_{n-1} = 4 cdot 3^{n-1}    ] 8. Rearrange to express (a_n), we get:    [    a_n = 4 cdot 3^{n-1} - a_{n-1}    ] 9. By establishing this recurrence relation, we can see that:    [    a_n - 3^n = - (a_{n-1} - 3^{n-1})    ] 10. This rearranges to a pattern:    [    a_n - 3^n = (-1)^{n-2} (a_2 - 3^2)    ] 11. We know from simpler cases that (a_2 = 12), hence:     [     a_2 - 9 = 12 - 9 = 3     ] 12. Therefore,     [     a_n - 3^n = 3 (-1)^{n-2}     ] 13. Adding (3^n) to both sides, we obtain the formula for (a_n):     [     a_n = 3^n + 3 (-1)^{n-2}     ] 14. Plugging in (n = 6):     [     a_6 = 3^6 + 3 (-1)^{6-2} = 729 + 3 = 732     ] 15. Thus, the number of valid ways to color the hexagon such that no two adjacent regions share the same color is:     [     boxed{732}     ]"},{"instruction":"a basketball game, a team scores using threepoint shots, twopoint shots, and onepoint free throws.

We need to prove that if ( P_{1986} ) and ( P_0 ) are the same point, then the triangle ( A_1 A_2 A_3 ) is equilateral. 1. **Investigate the Effect of Rotations**:     - Each rotation changes the direction of the vector ( overrightarrow{A_1 P_0} ) by ( 120^circ ) while preserving its length.     - After three such rotations around points ( A_1, A_2, A_3 ), we essentially perform a cyclic rotation. 2. **Three Consecutive Rotations**:     - Let's consider the three consecutive rotations:         [         overrightarrow{A_1 P_0} rightarrow overrightarrow{A_2 P_1} rightarrow overrightarrow{A_3 P_2} rightarrow overrightarrow{A_1' P_3}         ]     - By rotating ( P_0 ) around ( A_1 ), then around ( A_2 ), and finally around ( A_3 ), we see that ( P_3 ) returns the vector ( overrightarrow{A_1 P_0} ) to its original direction because each rotation by ( 120^circ times 3 = 360^circ ). 3. **Vector Addition and Parallel Translation**:     - Observe that ( overrightarrow{A_1 P_0} = overrightarrow{A_1' P_3} ).

We are told that T_{7} gt T_{6} gt T_{8}. Let's analyze this information step by step: 1. **Understanding the Product of Terms**: The product of the first n terms, T_{n}, can be expressed as T_{n} = a_{1} cdot a_{2} cdot ldots cdot a_{n}. Given the nature of a geometric sequence, we can also express this as T_{n} = a_{1} cdot q^{n-1}. 2. **Analyzing T_{7} gt T_{6} gt T_{8}**: This inequality implies that the 7th term of the sequence, a_{7}, is greater than 1, and the 8th term, a_{8}, is less than 1 but greater than 0. This is because for the product of terms to decrease when going from T_{6} to T_{8}, the added term (which is a_{7} when going from T_{6} to T_{7} and a_{8} when going from T_{7} to T_{8}) must be such that a_{7} gt 1 and 0 lt a_{8} lt 1. 3. **Determining the Value of q**: Since a_{7} gt 1 and 0 lt a_{8} lt 1, it follows that the common ratio q must satisfy 0 lt q lt 1. This is because only in a geometric sequence with a common ratio between 0 and 1 do the terms decrease in value but remain positive, which aligns with our findings from the given inequalities. 4. **Evaluating Options A and B**: Given our conclusion that 0 lt q lt 1, option A is correct, and option B is incorrect. 5. **Considering T_{13} and T_{14}**: For T_{13}, since it is the product of the first 13 terms, and we know a_{7} gt 1, the product T_{13} will be greater than 1 because it includes the term a_{7}^{13}, which is greater than 1. For T_{14}, it includes the product (a_{7} cdot a_{8})^{7}, which we have established is less than 1. Therefore, T_{13} gt 1 gt T_{14}. 6. **Evaluating Options C and D**: Given our analysis, option C is correct because it accurately reflects the relationship between T_{13}, T_{14}, and 1, while option D is incorrect.

The unit's digit of a number raised to the 41st power will be the same as the unit's digit of the number raised to the first power (since any number raised to a power that ends in 1 will have the same unit's digit as the base number itself). Therefore, the base of the first term must have a unit's digit of 1 to ensure that the unit's digit of the entire product is boxed{4} ."},{"instruction":"Will was drawing super heroes on a sheet of scrap paper.

Are they necessarily symmetrical with respect to either the axes or the center of the ellipse?","output":"To address the question of whether two equal triangles inscribed in an ellipse are necessarily symmetrical with respect to either the axes or the center of the ellipse, let's analyze the problem in detail. 1. **Understanding the problem**: We are given an ellipse and two equal triangles inscribed within it. We need to determine whether these triangles must be symmetrical with respect to either the axes or the center of the ellipse. 2. **Symmetry definitions**:    - **Symmetry with respect to an axis**: A figure is symmetric with respect to an axis if, when the figure is reflected over that axis, it maps onto itself.    - **Symmetry with respect to the center**: A figure is symmetric with respect to the center if rotating it by 180 degrees about the center maps the figure onto itself. 3. **Analyzing the symmetry**:    - Consider an ellipse centered at the origin with semi-major axis (a) and semi-minor axis (b).    - Suppose two equal triangles are inscribed in the ellipse. For simplicity, let’s assign coordinates to the vertices of the first triangle as (A_1(x_1, y_1)), (A_2(x_2, y_2)), and (A_3(x_3, y_3)).    - The second triangle, being equal in terms of both shape and area, has vertices at (B_1(x_1', y_1')), (B_2(x_2', y_2')), and (B_3(x_3', y_3')). 4. **Checking for symmetry**:    - **Axis Symmetry**: If the triangles are symmetric with respect to either the vertical or horizontal axes, reflecting one triangle over the axis should map it onto the other triangle.    - **Center Symmetry**: If the triangles are symmetric with respect to the center, rotating one triangle 180 degrees around the ellipse’s center should map it onto the other triangle. 5. **Counter-example**:    - To show that symmetry is not necessary, consider the following:      - Create two identical triangles within the ellipse, but place them in positions where no simple reflection or rotation aligns them.      - An illustrative example (depicted in Figure 3, if available) might show two triangles with vertices at different positions within the bounds of the ellipse such that neither symmetry condition is satisfied. 6. **Conclusion**:    - Given that two identical triangles can be arranged inside an ellipse without satisfying symmetry conditions, we conclude that the triangles do not necessarily have to be symmetrical either to the axes or the center.

She spent half of her 600, which is: 600 / 2 = 300 Now, let's calculate the discount she received. A 20% discount on 300 is: 20% of 300 = 0.20 * 300 = 60 So, Sandi's discount amount is 60.

For any pair of students, there is at least one club in which both students participate together. We need to prove that there is at least one club where at least ( frac{2}{3} ) of the total number of students from the class are members. **Step 2: Assume There is No Club with All Students** First, consider the trivial case where there exists a club that includes all students. If that is the case, then the condition is trivially satisfied. For our proof, we will assume that no single club includes all students. **Step 3: Identify the Largest Club** Suppose the most populous club is the mathematics club (denoted as ( M )). Let the students in this club be referred to as mathematicians. Assume there are ( n ) students in total. **Step 4: Consider a Student Not in the Largest Club** Consider a student named Vasya who is not part of the mathematics club. According to the problem's condition, Vasya must share at least one club with each member of the mathematics club. Let’s call this shared club the photography club (denoted as ( P )). **Step 5: Ensure the Largest Club is the Largest** Since the mathematics club ( M ) is the most populous, Vasya cannot be together with all mathematicians in ( P ). Otherwise, ( P ) would be larger than ( M ), contradicting our assumption. Therefore, there must be another club where Vasya and some subset of mathematicians meet, let’s call this the dance club (denoted as ( D )).  **Step 6: Assign Remaining Mathematicians to Other Clubs** Each mathematician is a member of exactly two clubs due to the stated condition: one could be ( P ) (if they join Vasya in photography) and the other could be ( D ) (if they join Vasya in dance). **Step 7: Generalize to All Students** Let's generalize this. Any student outside the mathematics club must similarly be in both ( P ) and ( D ). **Step 8: Count Memberships** Since every student is in two clubs and ( n ) is the total number of students, the math gives: [ text{Total club memberships} = 2n ] The sum of all memberships across the three clubs can be represented as ( |M| + |P| + |D| = 2n ). Thus, the average membership per club is: [ frac{|M| + |P| + |D|}{3} = frac{2n}{3} ] By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one of these clubs must include at least ( frac{2n}{3} ) students, because if each club had fewer than ( frac{2n}{3} ), their total would be less than ( 2n ), which is a contradiction. **Conclusion:** Thus, the mathematics club (or the most populous club by our assumption) includes at least ( frac{2}{3} ) of the total students in the class.

We know that for any three numbers A, B, and C, the product of the LCM and HCF of these numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. That is: LCM(A, B, C) * HCF(A, B, C) = A * B * C Substituting the known values, we get: 1248 * 32 = 24 * 36 * C Now, let's solve for C: 1248 * 32 = 24 * 36 * C 39936 = 864 * C C = 39936 / 864 C = 46.222222... Since C must be an integer (as we are dealing with HCF and LCM which are defined for integers), and the HCF of A, B, and C is 32, C must be a multiple of 32. The number we calculated, 46.222222..., is not an integer, so we must have made a mistake in our assumptions. Let's re-evaluate our assumptions. The HCF of A and B (24 and 36) is 12, not 32. This is because 24 = 2^3 * 3^1 and 36 = 2^2 * 3^2, and the HCF is the product of the lowest powers of common prime factors, which is 2^2 * 3^1 = 12. Since the HCF of A, B, and C is given as 32, and 32 is not a factor of either 24 or 36, it must be that C is a multiple of 32 and that 32 is the HCF of all three numbers. This means that C must be 32 itself, as any other multiple of 32 would not have 32 as its HCF with 24 and 36. Therefore, the third number C is boxed{32} ."},{"instruction":"Alice decides to consult a fortunetelling app. Each time she uses it, the app has a 1/3 chance of predicting her future correctly.

Prove that when ( m > 2n ), the first player (A) can always win. 2. Determine the range of ( alpha ) such that if ( m > alpha n ), the first player (A) can always win.","output":"1. Let's begin with part (1). We are given two piles of matchsticks with (m) and (n) matchsticks respectively, where (m > n). It is stated that each player can only remove a number of matchsticks from one pile that is a multiple of the number the other pile contains. The player who removes the last matchstick wins. We need to prove that if (m > 2n), the first player can always win.     2. We express (m) in terms of (n) as follows:    [    m = pn + q quad text{where} quad p geq 2 quad text{and} quad 0 leq q < n    ] 3. If (q = 0), then (m) is an exact multiple of (n), i.e., (m = pn). The first player can win by removing all (pn) matchsticks from the pile with (m) matchsticks, leaving the second player with no moves left. 4. If (q > 0), we consider the new game situation ((q, n)):    - If ((q, n)) is a losing position for the second player, the first player can remove (pn) matchsticks from the first pile, putting the second player in a losing position ((q, n)), hence the first player wins.    - If ((q, n)) is a winning position for the second player, the first player can reduce the piles to ((n + q, n)) by selecting (pn - n) matchsticks, i.e., ((p - 1) cdot n). The second player must take (n) matchsticks from the first pile, transforming the game back to ((q, n)), leading the first player to victory.    Therefore, we can conclude that when (m geq 2n), the first player can always win. (blacksquare) 5. Moving to part (2), we want to find the value (alpha) such that if (m > alpha n), the first player can always win. Moreover, (alpha) is given to be (frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2}). We will verify this. 6. We claim that for (m geq n):    - If (m > beta n), ((m, n)) is a winning position,    - If (m leq beta n), ((m, n)) is a losing position.    Here, (beta) is (frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2}). 7. For (m > beta n), let (m = pn + q ) where (p geq 1) and (0 leq q < n ).    - If (q = 0), removing all (pn) matchsticks results in a win for the first player.    - If (0 < q < n):      - If (n leq beta q), the first player can remove (pn) matchsticks leaving ((q, n)), which is a losing position.      - If (n > beta q), we derive (m = pn + q > beta n ). Thus, (p < beta). However, if (p = 1), it contradicts (beta n > n + q ). This shows that (p geq 2). Thus, removing ((p-1)n) leads to ((n + q, n)). 8. Now, (frac{n + q}{n} = 1 + frac{q}{n} leq 1 + frac{1}{beta} = beta). Thus, we ensure ((n + q, n)) is a losing position since (beta n geq n + q). 9. Consequently, facing a winning position, the player will either directly win or transfer the winning position into a losing one. 10. If the initial starting position ((m, n)) satisfies (n < m leq beta n < 2 n) hence ensuring unique moves leading to a configuration ((m-n, n)):     [     m - n leq (beta - 1)n     ]     Rearranging, results in:     [     frac{m - n}{n} leq beta - 1     ]     Thus, implying:     [     n > beta(m - n)     ]     Proving ((m-n, n)) is a winning configuration for the first player. 11.

Dillingerová) Hint: How many digits can the sums and differences of 5digit numbers have, and how would you calculate them manually?","output":"To determine Richard's two five-digit numbers, we follow the given conditions and constraints rigorously. Let's break down the steps. 1. **Identify the potential length of sums and differences:**    - The sum of two five-digit numbers can be either five or six digits. Given the sum starts with 11, it must be a six-digit number, denoted as (11***1).    - The difference can be at most a five-digit number since one five-digit number subtracted from another cannot be more than five digits. Since the difference starts with 2 and ends with 11, it is indeed a five-digit number, denoted as (2***11). 2. **Label the numbers with variables:**    Denote:    [    begin{array}{rl}    & ABCDE     + & abcde     hline    1 & 1***1    end{array}    ]    [    begin{array}{rl}    & ABCDE     - & abcde     hline    2***11    end{array}    ]    Here, uppercase letters represent digits of one number, and lowercase letters represent digits of the other. Each digit must be unique, and one number must only have odd digits and the other only even digits. 3. **Sum Constraints:**    For the sum to start with 11, (A + a) must be 11 (for simplicity, we can initially ignore the possibility of carrying over from a smaller place value creating 11):    [    A + a = 11    ]    This implies (A) and (a) must be an odd and even number pair, such as ({6, 5}) or ({7, 4}), etc. 4. **Difference Constraints:**    For the difference to start with 2:        - If the difference was 4-digit, (A - a ) would produce a small number. However, starting with 2 explicitly refers to a big gap.    - So, (A - a = 3).    Hence, combining with sum constraints:    [    begin{cases}    A + a = 11     A - a = 3    end{cases}    ]    Solving this system:    [    begin{array}{l}    2A = 14 implies A = 7     2a = 8 implies a = 4    end{array}    ] 5. **Sum's End Constraint:**    For the sum to end with 1:    [    E + e = 1 quad text{or} quad E + e = 11     ]    Simultaneously, the difference ends with 11:    [    E - e = 1 quad text{or} quad E = 0, e = 1, text{impossible}.    ]    Solving-compatible (E=1) and (e=0). 6. **Choose consistent digits:**        - To ensure sequences of none repeated digits: Fill the remaining digits based on initial conditions:    - (1,0) for last. 7. **Identify other digits:**    - To ensure correct middle sequence without repetition: (3,6) given permissible by pairs for sum-difference compatible 6 exceeds 3.    - Fill remaining (9,8), complete consistent combinations (Note: middle digit set/cycle cross match shorter remaining combinations).

Using the first equation: [ c = 4 - d ] [ 90d + 60(4 - d) = 90d + 240 - 60d = 30d + 240 ] We need 30d + 240 to be divisible by 100. Simplifying, we get: [ 30d + 240 equiv 0 pmod{100} ] [ 30d equiv -240 pmod{100} ] [ 30d equiv 60 pmod{100} ] [ d equiv 2 pmod{3.333} ] Here, d must be an integer, so finding the lowest integer satisfying the condition in the domain 0 leq d leq 4, we check the possible values: 1. **If d = 2:**    [ c = 4 - 2 = 2 ]    [ 90 cdot 2 + 60 cdot 2 = 180 + 120 = 300 text{ cents} = 3 text{ dollars} ]    This is a whole number of dollars, so 2 donuts is a working solution. This calculation confirms that John bought 2 donuts, and the total cost aligns with a whole dollar amount. Therefore, the answer is 2.

It turns out that the outer vertices of all the squares lie on the same circle. Prove that triangle ABC is isosceles.","output":"1. Suppose squares are constructed externally on the sides of the triangle ABC as follows:     - On side AB, we have square ABB_1A_1,     - On side BC, we have square BCC_2B_2,     - On side CA, we have square ACC_3A_3.     Each pair of indices (i, j) denotes the vertices that complete the square on side ij. 2. Given that the external vertices A_1, B_1, B_2, C_2, C_3, A_3 of these squares lie on a common circle S. 3. The perpendicular bisectors of the segments A_1B_1, B_2C_2, A_3C_3 pass through the center of the circumcircle S. 4. Notably, the perpendicular bisectors of these segments coincide with the perpendicular bisectors of the sides AB, BC, CA of triangle ABC. This implies that the center of the circle S coincides with the circumcenter O of the triangle ABC. 5. Denote the radius of the circumcircle described around triangle ABC as R. The distance from O to the line B_2C_2 equals: [ O_{2} = R cos A + 2R sin A ] where angle A varies with respect to each vertex at point O. 6.

The above formula simplifies when the equalities are maintained if:      [      begin{align*}      &cos(45^{circ} + 2A) = cos(45^{circ} + 2B) = cos(45^{circ} + 2C)       end{align*}      ] 8. One principal scenario is when angle A = angle B = angle C = 60^{circ} forming an equilateral triangle. When angle A neq angle B, solving the angles configuration establishes:     [     left(45^{circ} + 2Aright) + left(45^{circ} + 2B right) = 360^{circ}     ]     securing angle A + angle B = 135^{circ}. Hence angle C = 45^{circ}, and corresponding measures form:     [     angle A = 45^{circ}, angle B = 90^{circ}, angle C = 45^{circ}     ] 9.

We need to determine the number of sets of four vertices of this 22-gon that form the vertices of trapezoids. 1. **Circumscribe the polygon:** Place the given regular 22-gon K_{1}, K_{2}, ldots, K_{22} inside a circle. 2. **Define trapezoid via parallel chords:** Each trapezoid's sides are defined by a pair of parallel chords with endpoints at points K_{1}, ldots, K_{22}. 3. **Chords connecting adjacent vertices:**     - Consider a chord connecting two adjacent vertices of the polygon, for example, K_{6}K_{7}.     - There exist 10 other chords parallel to it (such as K_{5}K_{8}, K_{4}K_{9}, and so forth).     - Therefore, we get a set of parallel chords that contain 11 chords in total. 4. **Number of parallel pairs of chords:**     - From these 11 parallel chords, we can select pairs of them to form parallel sides of a trapezoid.     - The number of ways to choose 2 parallel chords from 11 is given by the combination:       [       binom{11}{2} = 55       ]     - This set up can be done for each set of parallel chords involving one step to the next (e.g., K_2K_3, K_3K_4, etc.). In total, there are 11 such sets. 5. **Second step of chord connections:**     - Take the chord connecting vertices through one other vertex, like K_{6}K_{8}.     - There are 9 other chords parallel to it (e.g., K_{5}K_{9} and so on).     - So we get another set of parallel chords with 10 elements. 6. **Number of pairs for second set:**     - From these 10 parallel chords, pairs can be selected in:       [       binom{10}{2} = 45       ]     - This is true for each of the 11 similar setups. 7. **Total combinations:**     - Combining all sets, the total number of trapezoids is given by:     [     11 times 55 + 11 times 45     = 605 + 495      = 1100     ] 8. **Adjustment for rectangles counted twice:**     - Note that rectangles have both diagonals as diameters in an inscribed polygons.

[     text{Total number of rectangles} = binom{11}{2} = 55.     ]     - Rectangles were counted twice, so we need to subtract twice this amount:       [     1100 - 2 times 55 = 990.     ] # Conclusion: The number of sets of four vertices that form a trapezoid in a regular 22-gon is ( boxed{990} )."},{"instruction":"The line x2y1=0 intersects the parabola y^{2}=4x at points A and B.

The coordinates of point C are ______.","output":"To find the coordinates of point C on the parabola y^{2}=4x that forms a right angle angle ACB with the line x-2y-1=0, intersecting at points A and B, we proceed as follows: 1. **Express Points on the Parabola and Line Intersection**:   Let's denote the intersection points as A({x_1},{y_1}) and B({x_2},{y_2}). For any point C on the parabola, its coordinates can be represented as C({t^2},2t) due to the parabola's equation y^{2}=4x. 2. **Solve the System of Equations**:   Given the line equation x-2y-1=0 and the parabola equation y^{2}=4x, substituting 4x for y^2 in the line equation gives us y^{2}-8y-4=0.  3. **Use the Quadratic Equation Relationships**:   From the quadratic equation, we know that the sum and product of the roots are given by y_{1}+y_{2}=8 and y_{1}cdot y_{2}=-4. Similarly, since x=2y+1 for the line, we find x_{1}+x_{2}=18 and x_{1}cdot x_{2}=1. 4. **Apply the Right Angle Condition**:   The condition angle ACB=90^{circ} implies overrightarrow{CA}•overrightarrow{CB}=0. This leads to the equation ({t^2}-{x_1})({t^2}-{x_2})+(2t-{y_1})(2t-{y_2})=0. Simplifying this equation with the given sums and products of x_i and y_i, we obtain t^{4}-14t^{2}-16t-3=0. 5. **Factor and Solve for t**:   The equation simplifies to (t^{2}+4t+3)(t^{2}-4t-1)=0. Since t^{2}-4t-1=0 would imply point C lies on the line, contradicting the distinct positions of A, B, and C, we discard this solution. Thus, we solve t^{2}+4t+3=0 to find t_{1}=-1 and t_{2}=-3. 6. **Determine Coordinates of Point C**:   Substituting t_{1}=-1 and t_{2}=-3 into the coordinates of point C on the parabola, we get the possible coordinates for point C as (1,-2) or (9,-6).

For ( 20 ) as the longest side (when ( 8 < x leq 20 )): - We need ( 20^2 < 12^2 + x^2 = 144 + x^2 ), - Thus, ( 400 < 144 + x^2 ) leading to ( x^2 > 256 ) and therefore ( x > 16 ). Combining these conditions: - ( x ) must be greater than 16 and less than approximately 23.3. - ( x ) must satisfy ( 8 < x < 32 ). The integer values of ( x ) satisfying these conditions are ( 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 ).

The time it takes to pass the signal pole is 18 seconds, so we can calculate the speed of the train as follows: Speed of the train ( = frac{text{Distance covered}}{text{Time taken}} ) Since the distance covered is the length of the train when it passes the signal pole, we have: Speed of the train ( = frac{300 text{ meters}}{18 text{ seconds}} ) Now, when the train crosses the platform, it has to cover the length of itself plus the length of the platform. The time it takes to pass the platform is 39 seconds. We can express the total distance covered when the train crosses the platform as ( 300 + L ) meters. Using the same formula for speed, we have: Speed of the train ( = frac{300 + L}{39} ) Since the speed of the train is the same in both cases, we can set the two expressions for speed equal to each other: ( frac{300}{18} = frac{300 + L}{39} ) Now we can solve for ( L ): ( 300 times 39 = 18 times (300 + L) ) ( 11700 = 5400 + 18L ) Subtract 5400 from both sides: ( 11700 - 5400 = 18L ) ( 6300 = 18L ) Divide both sides by 18: ( L = frac{6300}{18} ) ( L = 350 ) So the length of the platform is boxed{350}  meters."},{"instruction":"Given distinct positive real numbers (x_1 < x_2 < ldots < x_{2n+1}), show that: [ x_1  x_2 + x_3  x_4 + ldots  x_{2n} + x_{2n+1} < left( x_1^n  x_2^n + ldots  x_{2n}^n + x_{2n+1}^n right)^{1/n}.","output":"Let ( x_i ) be distinct positive reals satisfying ( x_1 < x_2 < ldots < x_{2n+1} ).

Given ( f(y) = y - y + z - (y^m - y^m + z^m)^{1/m} = z - z = 0 ), and since ( f'(x) > 0 ) for ( 0 < x < y ), this implies ( f(x) < 0 ) for ( 0 < x < y ).

These two positions are at (1, 1) and (2018, 1), which are differently colored. 2. **Movement Overview**:    - Each knight can move in a way that changes both coordinates (one coordinate by 20 and the other by 17), jumping to cells of the opposite color from their current cell. 3. **Path and Moves**:    - Determine the sequence of cell pairs (S_i, K_i) that outline a path between S and K such that:      - Each knight alternates between two colors because each move switches the cell's color.      - The total number of moves for a knight to reach from S to K would thus be odd, as noted from the alternating colors. 4. **Winning Strategy for Sasha**:    - Redefine each position in the game as a pair (A, B) where A is Kolya's knight's current cell and B is Sasha's knight's current cell.        - Sasha's strategy involves:      - If Sasha's knight is on S_i, he moves to K_i.      - If Sasha's knight is on K_i, his move depends on Kolya's knight's position:        - If Kolya’s knight stands at K, Sasha moves to S_{i+1}.        - Otherwise, Sasha moves back to S_i.     5. **Game State and Progression**:    - Since the board and number of possible positions (states) are finite and moves are deterministic, the game must end eventually.    - Sasha's strategy inherently prevents Kolya from recreating any previous game position because the moves back and forth between cells either introduce new positions or end up at the goal state. 6. **Handling Game Constraints**:    - When Sasha’s knight reaches positions S_i and K_i recurrently:      - Verify new positions generated in each state transition to ensure compliance with game rules, particularly not revisiting previous configurations.      - If \`s\` is on S_i and \`k\` is on Uneq K, (U, K_i) hasn't been seen before under Sasha's optimal play.      - Similarly, if \`s\` is on K_i\` and \`k\` is on Uneq K, (U, S_i) is new; thus, Sasha can move there.          - These steps ensure Sasha continually follows a viable path until Kolya runs out of valid moves or possibilities to avoid repeating positions, thereby losing. This comprehensive strategy guarantees Sasha will always have a valid move, ultimately making Kolya run out of options and resulting in Sasha’s victory. # **Conclusion**: The winner with optimal play is   boxed{text{Sasha}}"},{"instruction":"Point (x,y) is randomly picked from the rectangular region with vertices at (0,0),(2023,0),(2023,2024), and (0,2024).

What type of integers are q and r?","output":"Let's denote the two-digit integer q as (10a + b) where (a) and (b) are the digits of q, with (a) being the tens digit and (b) being the units digit. Since q and r have the same digits but in reverse order, r can be represented as (10b + a). The positive difference between q and r is (q - r = (10a + b) - (10b + a)). Simplifying this, we get: (q - r = 10a + b - 10b - a) (q - r = 9a - 9b) (q - r = 9(a - b)) Since the difference is less than 60 and the greatest possible value is 54, we can write: (9(a - b) < 60) (a - b < frac{60}{9}) (a - b < 6.67) Since (a) and (b) are integers, the maximum difference (a - b) can have is 6 (because 7 would make the difference 63, which is greater than 60). Given that the greatest possible value of (q - r) is 54, we can write: (9(a - b) = 54) (a - b = 6) This means that (a) and (b) are consecutive multiples of 9, with (a) being the larger digit. The largest two-digit number that satisfies this condition, with the tens digit being 6 more than the units digit, would be 96 (where (a = 9) and (b = 3)).

The problem asks whether the sum (7 + 7^2 + ldots + 7^{4K}) is divisible by (400) for any natural number (K). 2. Let's consider the entire sum (S_K = 7 + 7^2 + 7^3 + ldots + 7^{4K}). 3. First, group the terms in sets of four: [ S_K = left(7 + 7^2 + 7^3 + 7^4right) + left(7^5 + 7^6 + 7^7 + 7^8right) + ldots + left(7^{4K-3} + 7^{4K-2} + 7^{4K-1} + 7^{4K}right) ] 4. Observe that each group of four terms represents a geometric series: [ 7 + 7^2 + 7^3 + 7^4 = 7(1 + 7 + 7^2 + 7^3) ] 5. Recognize that the sum of the series (1 + 7 + 7^2 + 7^3) is a geometric series sum: [ 1 + 7 + 7^2 + 7^3 = frac{7^4 - 1}{7 - 1} = frac{2401 - 1}{6} = 400 ] 6. Hence, the sum of each group of four terms is: [ 7 + 7^2 + 7^3 + 7^4 = 7 times 400 = 2800 ] 7. Now consider each segment (7^{4i-3} + 7^{4i-2} + 7^{4i-1} + 7^{4i}) for (i = 1, 2, ldots, K), which generalizes to: [ left(7^{4(i-1) + 1} + 7^{4(i-1) + 2} + 7^{4(i-1) + 3} + 7^{4(i-1) + 4}right) = 7^{4(i-1)} times 400 ] 8. The entire summation can now be expressed as a product of these sums: [ S_K = 400 left(1 + 7^4 + 7^8 + ldots + 7^{4(K-1)}right) ] 9. Clearly, every term within the series (1 + 7^4 + 7^8 + ldots + 7^{4(K-1)}) is a power of (7^4), which simplifies as a geometric series again. 10. Thus, the factor (400) is a common multiple, and (S_K) is a multiple of (400). 11. Therefore, (S_K) is divisible by (400).

Let the two zero points of f(x) be x_{1}, x_{2}(x_{1} < x_{2}), thus x_{1}in(0,ln(2a-2)], x_{2}in(ln(2a-2),1), it must be that f(0)=1-b > 0, f(1)=e-2a+2-b > 0.

Since the train itself is 1 km long and the tunnel is 70 km long, the total distance is: Total distance = Length of train + Length of tunnel Total distance = 1 km + 70 km Total distance = 71 km Now, we calculate the time it takes for the train to travel this distance at its speed: Time = Total distance / Speed Time = 71 km / (4/3 km/min) To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal: Time = 71 km * (3/4 min/km) Time = 213/4 min Time = 53.25 min The train entered the tunnel at 5:12 am, so we add the time it takes to pass through the tunnel to this time: 5:12 am + 53.25 min = 5:12 am + 53 min + 0.25 min = 5:12 am + 53 min + 15 seconds (since 0.25 min is a quarter of a minute, which is 15 seconds) Adding 53 minutes to 5:12 am gives us 6:05 am, and then adding 15 seconds gives us a final time of 6:05:15 am.

So, we can write: y = frac{1}{cos^2x} + frac{1}{sin^2x} = frac{sin^2x + cos^2x}{sin^2xcos^2x} = frac{1}{sin^2xcos^2x}. Now, using the identity for sin(2x), we can rewrite y again: y = frac{1}{left(frac{sin(2x)}{2}right)^2} = frac{4}{sin^2(2x)}. To find the minimum value of y, notice that sin^2(2x) oscillates between 0 and 1, so frac{4}{sin^2(2x)} will achieve its minimum value when sin^2(2x) is at its maximum. Since the maximum value of sin^2(2x) is 1, the minimum value of y occurs when sin^2(2x) = 1 or when sin(2x) = pm1. This happens when 2x is an integer multiple of pi/2, but not an integer multiple of pi, because only then do we have |sin(2x)| = 1 without sin^2(2x) being zero (which would make y undefined).

(ii) Assume when n = k (k geqslant 1, k in mathbb{N}^{*}), f(k) = k holds, then when n = k + 1,  (a) If k + 1 = 2m (m in mathbb{N}^{*}), then f(k + 1) = f(2m) = f(2) cdot f(m) = 2m = k + 1.  (b) If k + 1 = 2m + 1 (m in mathbb{N}^{*}), then f(2m + 2) = f[2(m + 1)] = f(2) cdot f(m + 1) = 2(m + 1) = 2m + 2,  since 2m = f(2m) < f(2m + 1) < f(2m + 2) = 2m + 2, and f(2m + 1) in mathbb{N}^{*}.  So f(2m + 1) = 2m + 1 = k + 1,  thus, when n = k + 1, the analytical expression holds. Combining (i) and (ii), we conclude that f(n) = n (n in mathbb{N}^{*}) holds. The final answer is boxed{f(n) = n}."},{"instruction":"Consider a sequence with n letters A, n letters B, and n letters C.

Thus, n=1 works. 2. **General case (n geq 2)**: Consider a case where the sequence is constructed for n geq 2. For instance: [ text{ACBABC} cdots text{ABC} ] The repetition of such patterns causes issues. We need to closely analyze the reduction in combinations of letters. Consider the following pairings for some adjacent four-letter segments (they cover one reduction operation for these examples): [ begin{array}{cccccc} mathrm{ABCA} & mathrm{BCAC} & mathrm{CACB} & mathrm{ACBA} & mathrm{CBAB} & mathrm{BABC}  mathrm{CAB} & mathrm{ABB} & mathrm{BBA} & mathrm{BAC} & mathrm{ACC} & mathrm{CCA}  mathrm{BC} & mathrm{CB} & mathrm{BC} & mathrm{CB} & mathrm{BC} & mathrm{CB}  mathrm{A} & mathrm{A} & mathrm{A} & mathrm{A} & mathrm{A} & mathrm{A} end{array} ] Notice for each possible row transformation, the reduction yields sequences of both B and C until eventually resulting in only one type. This creates cycles or stable patterns unfitting the required termination condition. 3. **Modular Arithmetic Analysis**: Next, using a more formal and abstract approach: Let 0, 1, 2 represent A, B, C respectively. For any given position in resulting rows: [ x_{i+1, j} equiv 2left(x_{i, j} + x_{i, j+1}right) pmod{3} ] Ultimately, computing the sum of 3n variations and its reduction does not match the required condition under modular arithmetic for higher values of n. 4. **Final Synthesis**: From the inductive and modular arguments, numerical patterns above, and consistent deterministic reduction results, we conclude:     - For n geq 2, any sequence through iterative steps leads to cyclic patterns or mismatched final results. Thus, the only valid solution fitting all reduction conditions for n values is n=1. # Conclusion: [ boxed{n=1} ]"},{"instruction":"triangle ( A B C ), the base of the height ( C D ) lies on side ( A B ), and the median ( A E ) is equal to 5.
