Roy Barnes will spend his first day as a private citizen by starting his new job as a full-time, pro-bono (unpaid) lawyer at the Atlanta Legal Aid Society. The decision by Barnes, the most improbable casualty of Election Day 2002, to go to work for legal aid was almost as unexpected as his November defeat. As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids. of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation. based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis. civil justice. The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Babysitter Jeannie (voiced by Julie Bennett) is instructed to look after the baby while his mother (also voiced by Julie Bennett) goes out. However, Jeannie pays more attention to talking on the telephone apathetically than her actual babysitting. In the midst of Tom and Jerry's usual fighting, they see the baby crawling out of its pram. Any attempt to return the baby to where it came from simply results in the baby escaping from the pram again. During one escape, the baby crawls into Spike's dog house. Tom accidentally grabs Spike instead of the baby, and is promptly attacked, scratched and bit. This time, Tom angrily brings the baby back to Jeannie herself, who hits Tom over the head with a broom, thinking that Tom has taken the baby away from her. Realising that the baby is no longer worth the trouble, Tom does nothing the next time that it crawls from its pram. However, he and Jerry are forced to react after the baby crawls down to the street and into a 100-story mixed-use skyscraper construction site. The baby crawls from one steel beam to another while the two look on. Jerry manages to catch up, and saves the baby from crawling off a wooden plank lying on the 50th floor by grabbing his diaper. The diaper comes loose, and the baby falls, but he is then caught by Tom. Tom attempts to put the baby's diaper back on, but in the impending confusion, ends up putting the diaper on himself while the baby crawls off, nonchalantly. Tom and Jerry catch up with the baby, only to lose it again, and fearing that it has crawled into a cement mixer on the 30th floor, the two dive straight in, only to find that the baby never did enter the mixer but instead playing with a hammer. The baby then playfully bonks Tom on the head. Answer:","output":"Tom and Jerry fear that the baby has crawled into a cement mixer at a 100-story mixed-use skyscraper construction site.

In his pursuit to become healthier, he thought it was essential to not only improve his physical health but also his mental well-being. Cycling offered an all-encompassing experience that allowed him to achieve both of these goals simultaneously. Step 1: Benjamin started by identifying the different types of bikes available and their intended purposes. This step was necessary since bikes were designed for various terrains and activities, such as mountain biking, road cycling, and leisure riding. Step 2: After thorough research, Benjamin chose a hybrid bike that was suitable for both on and off-road cycling. This choice allowed him to explore nature trails and ride on paved paths without having to switch bikes. Step 3: To ensure that he was making the most out of his biking experience, Benjamin invested in essential safety gear such as a helmet, reflective clothing and accessories, lights for nighttime visibility, and a high-quality bike lock. Step 4: Benjamin also took the time to learn basic bike maintenance skills. This step proved to be invaluable as it allowed him to keep his bike in top condition and saved him money on costly repairs in the long run. Step 5: With his bike ready and safety measures in place, Benjamin started to incorporate cycling into his daily routine. He decided to ride his bike to work, run errands, and visit friends whenever possible. Not only did this help him meet his fitness goals, but it also allowed him to reduce his carbon footprint – another source of satisfaction to him. Step 6: In addition to his daily rides, Benjamin joined a local cycling group on weekends. This allowed him to socialize, discover new routes, learn from experienced cyclists, and hold himself accountable for his exercise goals. Step 7: To track his progress, Benjamin used a fitness tracker and cycling apps that provided insights into his performance, such as distance, speed, and duration. These tools motivated him to stay committed to cycling and see the tangible results of his efforts. Step 8: Benjamin's commitment to cycling soon led to noticeable improvements in his health and wellness. His cardiovascular endurance increased, his muscles became stronger, and his stress levels decreased significantly due to the meditative effects of cycling and spending time outdoors. Step 9: As Benjamin continued to see positive results from his cycling endeavors, he also started making healthier food choices. Nutrition played a significant role in optimizing his performance on the bike and helped in reaching his weight loss goals. With perseverance and a comprehensive approach, Benjamin successfully integrated cycling into his lifestyle, reaching not only his physical fitness goals but also reaping the emotional and mental rewards that came along with it.

Walking, it might've taken ten minutes to get there, but on Chloe's Vespa it was a hair-raising three-minute ride away.

However, it is thought that St Michael's Church, mentioned in the Domesday entry for the ancient parish of Manchester, was in Ashton (also spelt Asheton, Asshton and Assheton). The town itself was first mentioned in the 12th century when the manor was part of the barony of Manchester. By the late 12th century, a family who adopted the name Assheton held the manor on behalf of the Gresleys, barons of Manchester. Ashton Old Hall was a manor house, the administrative centre of the manor, and the seat of the de Ashton or de Assheton family. With three wings, the hall was \\"one of the finest great houses in the North West\\" of the 14th century. It has been recognised as important for being one of the few great houses in south-east Lancashire and possibly one of the few halls influenced by French design in the country. The town was granted a Royal Charter in 1414, which allowed it to hold a fair twice a year, and a market on every Monday, making the settlement a market town.According to popular tradition, Sir Ralph de Assheton, who was lord of the manor in the mid-14th century and known as the Black Knight, was an unpopular and cruel feudal lord. After his death, his unpopularity led the locals to parade an effigy of him around the town each Easter Monday and collect money. Afterwards the effigy would be hung up, shot, and set on fire, before being torn apart and thrown into the crowd. The first recorded occurrence of the event was in 1795, although the tradition may be older; it continued into the 1830s.The manor remained in the possession of the Assheton family until 1514 when its male line terminated. The lordship of the manor passed to Sir George Booth, great-great grandson of Sir Thomas Ashton, devolving through the Booth family until the Earls of Stamford inherited it through marriage in 1758. The Booth-Greys then held the manor until the 19th century, whose patronage, despite being... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose unpopularity led the locals to parade an effigy of him around the town each Easter Monday and collect money?, what is it ? Answer:","output":"The first name of the person whose unpopularity led the locals to parade an effigy of him around the town each Easter Monday and collect money is Ralph. This individual was Sir Ralph de Assheton, also known as the Black Knight, who was the lord of the manor in the mid-14th century. He was known for being an unpopular and cruel feudal lord, and after his death, his notoriety made the townspeople perform this annual ritual in his memory."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The direction of transformations in energy (what kind of energy is transformed to what other kind) is often determined by entropy (equal energy spread among all available degrees of freedom) considerations.

(CNN) -- Since taking the helm of Yahoo after years in Google's upper echelon, Marissa Mayer has been at the center of plenty of talk not focused on turning around the once-mighty Web giant. As Silicon Valley's most prominent woman, her appearance, her motherhood and the way her policies will affect female employees have all, fairly or not, been the subject of spirited discussion. Now, a two-page photo spread in September's Vogue magazine has them talking again. In the photo, Mayer lies upside-down on a backyard lounge chair, wearing a blue Michael Kors dress. Her blond hair fans out at the foot of the chair, her Yves Saint Laurent stiletto heels point toward the top and she holds a tablet computer featuring a stylized image of her face. \\"However, still wincing over Marissa Mayer all stretched out for","output":"Vogue, while simultaneously trying to prove she's a serious CEO,\\" tweeted one observer. Critics argue that the photo undermines Mayer's accomplishments as a business leader and reinforces negative stereotypes about women in tech. But others say the backlash is unwarranted and that Mayer's decision to be featured in a fashion magazine can be seen as a powerful statement for women in the industry. This isn't the first time Mayer has faced scrutiny over her appearance and decisions. When she was named CEO of Yahoo in 2012, much of the conversation revolved around whether she would succeed and how she would balance work and her upcoming motherhood. Mayer's decision to shorten maternity leaves and ban telecommuting at Yahoo sparked debates on issues parents face in the workplace, with many questioning her commitment to promoting a family-friendly environment at the tech giant. But as the company's first female CEO, Mayer has also helped to make strides for women in leadership. Under her guidance, the proportion of women in leadership roles at Yahoo increased from 23 percent in 2013 to 24 percent in 2016. She also invested in programs aimed at supporting women entrepreneurs and raising awareness about gender inequality in the industry. The Vogue photo spread, though controversial, highlights a key issue: the persistent double standard that exists for prominent women in business and technology. Women in these industries often face a Catch-22 situation – embracing femininity can lead to critiques and doubts about their competence, while adopting traditionally masculine traits in order to be taken seriously can result in accusations of being \\"unlikable\\" or \\"unfeminine.\\" Mayer's choice to be featured in a fashion-forward photo in one of the world's leading magazines shows her refusal to be limited by traditional perceptions of what a tech executive should look like and act. In showcasing her unique blend of style and substance, Mayer is forging her own path and breaking down barriers for other women in the field. She sends the powerful message that a woman can embrace her femininity while also being a strong leader and running a major company. Moreover, she has openly talked about her career, her success, and her family life, hoping to inspire women to pursue a career in the tech industry. Mayer has been open about her journey as a mother, and how she balances her executive position with raising her children. This transparency contributes to clearing obstacles that other women might face when considering entering tech leadership roles. While the Vogue photo might have generated intense debate, it ultimately allowed important discussions to be had about the expectations and stereotypes surrounding women in leadership positions, particularly within the tech industry. As one of the most visible female leaders in technology, Mayer has the power to redefine and reshape these expectations, demonstrating that women can succeed in male-dominated industries and embrace their personal style without sacrificing their professional credibility."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Claret wine is produced in the region surrounding which French city????","output":"Claret wine is predominantly produced in the region surrounding Bordeaux, a French city located along the Garonne River in the southwestern part of the country. The Bordeaux wine region is one of the world's most famous and prestigious wine-producing areas, with a history that dates back nearly 2,000 years. The term \\"claret\\" is commonly used in the United Kingdom and other English-speaking countries to refer to the red wines from this region. The Bordeaux region consists of six primary sub-regions or appellations, namely Médoc, Graves, Pomerol, Saint-Émilion, Sauternes, and Barsac. Covering over 100,000 hectares of vineyards, it is home to over 8,000 wine-producing estates or châteaux, each crafting wines with distinct characteristics and flavors. The claret wines produced in Bordeaux are typically blends of several grape varieties, with the most important ones being Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Cabernet Franc. Other grape varieties that may also be included in the blends are Petit Verdot, Malbec, and, occasionally, Carménère. Bordeaux's unique terroir, characterized by its diverse soils, varying climate conditions, and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and the Gironde Estuary, plays a crucial role in the quality and taste of claret wines. The region experiences mild winters and long, warm summers, providing ideal conditions for grape cultivation. The soil composition varies across the Bordeaux region, with some areas having gravel and limestone soils while others have clay or sand-based soils. These differences in terroir result in distinct styles of claret wines that are appreciated worldwide. Bordeaux claret wines are generally categorized into Left Bank and Right Bank wines, based on the location of the vineyards relative to the Gironde Estuary and the Garonne and Dordogne rivers that it encompasses. Left Bank wines, coming from the Médoc and Graves regions, are often Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant with more structured tannins, while Right Bank wines, originating from the Pomerol and Saint-Émilion regions, tend to have a higher proportion of Merlot, offering rounder and fruitier flavors. The production process of claret wines in Bordeaux follows strict regulations and guidelines set by the region’s appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) system, which helps maintain the quality, standards, and authenticity of the wines. Each step of the wine-making process, from grape growing and harvesting to fermentation and aging, is governed by these rules. Typically, Bordeaux red wines, including clarets, are aged in oak barrels for a period of time, which imparts complexity, structure, and additional flavor dimensions to the wines. In conclusion, Bordeaux, a renowned French city, is at the heart of claret wine production. The region's unique terroir and the blending of different grape varieties contribute to the exceptional quality and variety of claret wines that have gained popularity and acclaim around the globe. With their rich history, adherence to strict production standards, and diverse range of styles and flavors, Bordeaux claret wines continue to hold a prestigious position in the world of wine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN)  -- President-elect Barack Obama's victory speech Tuesday night  compares favorably with a number of historic orations, a linguist said Thursday. Barack Obama speaks at a rally in Chicago, Illinois, after winning the presidency Tuesday night. \\"His goal was to be understood by the widest possible audience during his victory speech, and he seems to have done a great job doing it,\\" said Paul J.J. Payack, president of the Austin, Texas-based Global Language Monitor, which analyzed the speech for content, tone and length. \\"He's at his best communicating directly and forthrightly with this audience and using different types of rhetorical devices,\\" Payack said, noting that the speech was written to a seventh- or eighth-grade level. That's lower than the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech (grade 8.8), President Reagan's 1987 \\"Tear Down This Wall\\" speech (grade 9.8) and even Obama's own 2004 Democratic Convention speech (grade 8.3), Payack said. In the four years since then, \\"he has learned to speak more directly and more succinctly when he's giving a major address,\\" the word aficionado said. He spoke admiringly of Obama's repeated use of the phrase \\"Yes, we can,\\" calling it \\"very effective.\\" \\"That's a very short, direct sentence,\\" Payack said. \\"Almost like a drumbeat hammering into people's minds and hearts.\\" He added, \\"something like that comes across as a very effective rhetorical device.\\" That phrase compares with Reagan's \\"Tear Down This Wall\\" and President Kennedy's \\"Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country,\\" delivered in his inaugural speech. At about 2,000 words, the speech was short enough not to lose the audience's attention but long enough to cite specifics and cover the subject matter, Payack said.  Watch Obama's victory speech ». Twelve of those words were \\"hope\\" or variations of the word, which indicates optimism about the change (used nine times) he has promised to effect. Another 23 of the words were \\"will,\\" another way of making the speech forward-looking. Though most of Obama's verbs were in the active voice, 11 percent of the sentences were in the passive voice, a dependable method of deflecting responsibility, Payack said. He cited Obama's \\"There will be setbacks and false starts\\" as an example. \\"He's spreading the responsibility around,\\" Payack said. \\"He didn't say, 'I will have setbacks. I will be wrong. I will make mistakes.' He used the passive voice for those types of constructions.\\" But the vast majority of the hopeful references were in the active voice, he said. \\"It's very personal and very active. 'I promise we, as a people, will get there.' \\" The speech was notable for what it omitted, too, Payack said. In this case, the absence of a reference to the September 11 terrorist attacks indicates a change in tone, he said. In his closing phrase, Obama repeats the mantra, \\"Yes, we can,\\" which serves as a call to action, an acknowledgment that the country faces hard work, Payack said. Obama is saying, \\"I'm asking you to do something big, but we can do it together,\\" Payack said. \\"We are the change; we are the hope.\\" What are highlight points for this article?","output":"This article is talking about how good President-elect Barack Obama's victory speech was.

The reviewer described the movie as 'amazingly stupid' and advises potential viewers to 'stay away from it'. Such negative language diminishes the perceived quality and value of the product. 3.

Authorities believe the child, Shaniya Davis, was kidnapped, raped and murdered after being reported missing November 10. Her body was found six days later on a roadside about 30 miles from her hometown of Fayetteville, North Carolina. Her funeral was Sunday. O'Neal said in a statement released by his team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, that he was touched after seeing Davis' story on CNN sister network HLN's \\"Nancy Grace\\" show. \\"What happened to her was tragic.

There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.  I am facing a new situation today: Michael and his brother Brandon grew up in the same house together. They however devoloped completely different hobbies. Michael liked to go outside and play sports. Brandon on the other hand enjoyed reading and playing games on his computer.

Convinced that it is the same jug, he buys it and journeys to the derelict airfield.  Stovall remembers the events of 1942, when the 918th Bomb Group at Archbury had gained a reputation as the 'hard luck group'. After a particularly disastrous mission, group commander Colonel Keith Davenport appears exhausted and demoralized. His defeatist attitude spreads to other senior leaders of the group, including his Air Exec, Lieutenant Colonel Ben Gately. Ordered to fly another mission the next day, at a dangerously low altitude, Davenport protests to his friend, Brigadier General Frank Savage, the Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations at VIII Bomber Command. Later, Savage reluctantly shares with Major General Pritchard, the commanding general of VIII Bomber Command, his belief that Davenport has become too emotionally close to his men and may no longer be fit to command. That night, Pritchard and Savage visit the group headquarters to investigate the cause of the mission's heavy losses. Pritchard realizes that Savage is right: Davenport has become over-protective and is unwilling to discipline his men even for costly mistakes.

Reports say the French National Front (FN) has received loans worth several million euros from a Russian bank. Russia remains under EU-US sanctions. The sanctions target Russian state banks, defence and energy industries, and close aides to President Vladimir Putin. They are expected to be renewed next month, to keep up pressure aimed at defusing the conflict in Ukraine. The West accuses Russia of helping the separatists in eastern Ukraine with soldiers and heavy weapons - something Russia denies. UKIP members, along with nationalists from France, Italy and some other countries, opposed the European Parliament resolution. The MEPs' votes were reported by the Votewatch Europe website. In the past, UKIP leader Nigel Farage has expressed some admiration for Mr Putin. Bulgarian Socialists also voted against the resolution. Russia maintains strong ties with Bulgaria, based on centuries-old shared culture and religion.

EU states should \\"take action against this threat of an emerging 'Nationalist International',\\" it said. It referred to a St Petersburg meeting in March between Russian nationalists and other far-right European activists. The MEPs also accused Russia of \\"hybrid warfare, deliberately blurring the lines between military/paramilitary activity and political activism\\". Russia \\"can no longer be treated as, or considered, a 'strategic partner',\\" the resolution said, echoing the official EU position.

On February 28, 1861, the Provisional Confederate Congress established a provisional volunteer army and gave control over military operations and authority for mustering state forces and volunteers to the Confederate president, Jefferson Davis, a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy and colonel of a volunteer regiment during the Mexican War. In March 1861, the Provisional Confederate Congress established a more permanent Confederate States Army.  - Robert Edward Lee (January 19, 1807  October 12, 1870) was an American general known for commanding the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia in the American Civil War from 1862 until his surrender in 1865. The son of Revolutionary War officer Henry \\"Light Horse Harry\\" Lee III, Lee was a top graduate of the United States Military Academy and an exceptional officer and military engineer in the United States Army for 32 years. During this time, he served throughout the United States, distinguished himself during the MexicanAmerican War, and served as Superintendent of the United States Military Academy.  - George Gordon Meade (December 31, 1815  November 6, 1872) was a career United States Army officer and civil engineer involved in the coastal construction of several lighthouses. He fought with distinction in the Second Seminole War and the MexicanAmerican War. During the American Civil War he served as a Union general, rising from command of a brigade to command of the Army of the Potomac. He is best known for defeating Confederate General Robert E. Lee at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863.  - Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania German: \\"Pennsylvaani\\"), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. The commonwealth borders Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east.  - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City.  - The Battle of Gettysburg (with an sound) was fought July 13, 1863, in and around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, by Union and Confederate forces during the American Civil War. The battle involved the largest number of casualties of the entire war and is often described as the war's turning point. Union Maj. Gen. George Meade's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, ending Lee's attempt to invade the North.  - The Battle of the Wilderness, fought May 57, 1864, was the first battle of Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's 1864 Virginia Overland Campaign against Gen. Robert E. Lee and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia in the American Civil War.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Information:  - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.  - Chamber pop (or \\"ork-pop\\") is a subgenre of indie pop or indie rock which grew in the mid 1990s as a reaction against the fuzz distortion and \\"lo-fi aesthetic\\" prominent in alternative music. Inspired partly by the era's lounge music revivalism, chamber pop is typified by the use of strings, horns, and piano, and a dissociation from contemporary genres of the time, like grunge or electronica. The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson heavily influenced much of the genre, as did composer Burt Bacharach. Specific works which helped define chamber pop include the Beach Boys' albums \\"Pet Sounds\\" (1966) and \\"Smile\\" (196667), as well as the majority of Louis Phillipe's productions for él Records (198489).  - Twee pop is a subgenre of indie pop that maintained a reasonable amount of success and notoriety distinctive from the overall indie pop current.  - Athens (formally known as Athens-Clarke County) is a consolidated citycounty in the U.S. state of Georgia, in the northeastern part of the state, comprising the former city of Athens proper (the county seat) and Clarke County. The University of Georgia, the state's flagship public research university, is located in this college town, and contributed to its initial growth. In 1991, after a vote the preceding year, the original city abandoned its charter to form a unified government with Clarke County, referred to jointly as Athens-Clarke County. As of the 2010 census, the consolidated city-county (including all of Athens-Clarke County except Winterville and a portion of Bogart) had a total population of 115,452; all of Clarke County had a population of 116,714. Athens is the sixth-largest city in Georgia, and the principal city of the Athens-Clarke County, Georgia Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had a population of 192,541 as of the 2010 census. Athens-Clarke County has the smallest geographical area of a county in Georgia.  - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.  - I Am Not A Freemdoom is the second album by Masters of the Hemisphere, released in 2000 on Kindercore Records. It is a concept album containing a comic book, for which the songs provide the soundtrack.  - Masters of the Hemisphere is the first full album by the Athens , Georgia based indie pop band of the same name . Though it lacks the elaborateness of their followup , the heavily concept - based I Am Not A Freemdoom , it still maintains the essential element of the band 's indie pop songcraft , drawing comparisons to R.E.M. , among others .  - Indie pop is a subgenre and subculture of alternative/indie rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The style is inspired by punk's DIY ethic and related ideologies, and it generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Indie pop differs from indie rock to the extent that it is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free. Its substyles include chamber pop and twee pop.  - Kindercore Records is an independent record label based in Athens, Georgia, which was founded in 1996 by Ryan Lewis and Daniel Geller to document the emerging music scene in Athens, Georgia.  - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.  - A concept album is an album unified by a larger purpose or meaning to the album collectively than to its tracks individually. This may be achieved through a single central narrative or theme, or through a sense of artistic cohesiveness. The scope and definition of a \\"concept album\\" varies, and there is no consensus over what exactly the term constitutes.  - Masters of the Hemisphere are an American indie pop group, founded by Bren Mead and Sean Rawls. The two moved to Athens, Georgia, to attend college in 1996. There they met Ryan Lewis, co-founder of Kindercore Records, who played drums at the first Masters of the Hemisphere show. Jeff Griggs (also of The Mendoza Line) soon replaced Lewis. In 1997 Kindercore released their debut seven-inch ep, \\"Going on a Trek to Iceland\\". The group then recorded their first full length album, the eponymous \\"Masters of the Hemisphere\\", which was released on Kindercore Records in 1998. The band soon expanded to a four-piece, adding multi-instrumentalist Adrian Finch. Several singles and compilation appearances followed, including a release on the Happy Happy Birthday To Me Records singles club, before the band released their second full length, the concept album \\"I Am Not a Freemdoom\\", also on Kindercore. The record garnered mixed reviews, which in part was likely due to the album's rather complicated concept, regarding an island of reservoir-dwelling creatures being enslaved by an evil dog. The \\"Permanent Stranger\\" EP followed in 2002, on the dcBaltimore2012 label. The band split up after their next album, 2002's well received \\"Protest a Dark Anniversary\\". A recording of their then-final show at Athens, Georgia's 40 Watt Club was later released as \\"The Last Show Ever\\".

Premise: \\"Perhaps one day we'll even achieve that.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"One day it is possible we achieve that.\\"? Possible answers: -yes -it is not possible to tell -no","output":"Yes, if the premise \\"Perhaps one day we'll even achieve that\\" is true, it entails the hypothesis \\"One day it is possible we achieve that.\\" The reason for this is that the premise itself suggests the possibility of accomplishing the particular objective or goal in question. Analyzing the premise, \\"perhaps\\" indicates uncertainty but also the existence of an opportunity to achieve something. \\"One day\\" implies that it may be achieved in the future, even if such a time is unspecified. \\"We'll even achieve that\\" means there exists a specific task, goal, or accomplishment that the speaker is talking about. Taken together, the entire premise implies a non-zero probability of success in achieving the discussed objective at some point in the future. Drawing from the premise, the hypothesis \\"One day it is possible we achieve that\\" logically follows. In fact, the hypothesis and the premise are very closely related. It emphasizes that there's potential to achieve the given task in the future without making any definitive claims about when it will happen. The hypothesis simply reiterates the idea of possibility already present in the original premise. In conclusion, based on the premise \\"Perhaps one day we'll even achieve that,\\" it is accurate to assume the hypothesis \\"One day it is possible we achieve that\\" to be true. Both the premise and the hypothesis acknowledge the potential for success in the future without providing a fixed time frame for that accomplishment.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. According to the above context, answer the following question. What is likely true about the politics regarding gun rights in the US? Pick from: [i] not enough information. [ii] Many individuals have varying opinions regarding what should be done about the shootings in the US.. [iii] It is heavily divided and contended among citizens and politicians.. [iv] Most of the citizens that own guns feel threatened about the notion of new laws calling for gun control.. A:","output":"The politics regarding gun rights in the US are likely heavily divided and contended among citizens and politicians. This is evident from the various opinions expressed by different groups, such as the Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day campaign, which has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians, and celebrities, but rejected by gun rights advocates such as the National Rifle Association. The different views on gun ownership and control demonstrate that the politics surrounding this issue are indeed highly contentious and polarizing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Overall, both sentences convey a similar meaning: The Bill's Cathy Stoller Center houses athletic teams, certain offices, and the Department of Exercise Science. However, there are slight differences in the specific elements mentioned within each sentence: 1. In the first sentence, \\"all intercollegiate athletic teams\\" are mentioned, while the second sentence refers to \\"all University athletics teams.\\" This difference does not change the meaning significantly, as \\"intercollegiate athletic teams\\" can be understood as the university's athletic teams. However, the second sentence is more general by mentioning \\"all University athletics teams.\\" 2. In the first sentence, \\"sports offices\\" are mentioned, while the second sentence refers to \\"the Intercollegiate Athletic Offices.\\" This difference is also minor, as both terms possibly refer to the same entity, but the second sentence is more specific about the type of offices. Step 3: Evaluate if both sentences mean the same. The two sentences have similar meaning but contain minor differences in detail. As a result, they can be considered roughly equivalent, but not exactly the same. The second sentence is more specific in the type of offices and more general in the mention of athletic teams."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The first draft of the Convention included political killings, but these provisions were removed in a political and diplomatic compromise following objections from some countries, including the USSR, a permanent security council member. The USSR argued that the Convention's definition should follow the etymology of the term, and may have feared greater international scrutiny of its own Great Purge. Other nations feared that including political groups in the definition would invite international intervention in domestic politics. However leading genocide scholar William Schabas states: “Rigorous examination of the travaux fails to confirm a popular impression in the literature that the opposition to inclusion of political genocide was some Soviet machination. The Soviet views were also shared by a number of other States for whom it is difficult to establish any geographic or social common denominator: Lebanon, Sweden, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, the Philippines, the Dominican Republic, Iran, Egypt, Belgium, and Uruguay. The exclusion of political groups was in fact originally promoted by a non-governmental organization, the World Jewish Congress, and it corresponded to Raphael Lemkin’s vision of the nature of the crime of genocide.”  Question: What was the primary concern of other nations who objected to including political groups in the definition of genocide?","output":"The primary concern of other nations who objected to including political groups in the definition of genocide was the potential invitation of international intervention in domestic politics. These nations feared that by encompassing political groups in the definition, it would create a gateway for external forces to interfere in their internal affairs, infringing upon their sovereignty and potentially destabilizing their political systems. This hesitance to include political killings within the scope of genocide was driven by various countries' desire to preserve their autonomy and maintain control over their own political landscape, rather than having external entities dictate or judge their actions."},{"instruction":"In this task, you will be given a short story.

Article: A group inspired by the running of the bulls in Pamplona is planning to unleash bulls in several U.S. cities to sprint through fenced-in courses as daredevils try to avoid being trampled.      The Great Bull Run is set to kick off Aug. 24 at a drag-racing strip south of Richmond, Virginia. A second event is planned for Oct. 19 at an Atlanta-area horse park that hosted events for the 1996 Olympics. More events are planned later for Texas, Florida, California, Minnesota, Illinois and Pennsylvania.      Bull runs _ when the animals are released to run alongside participants as spectators cheer _ are common in Spain and can drum up controversy. Injuries often occur, as do deaths, though they are much rarer. Some groups attack the treatment of the bulls used in the runs.      About 5,000 people have signed up to participate in the Virginia event, and the number grows by about 50 each day, said Rob Dickens, co-founder and chief operating officer of The Great Bull Run. And with 2,000 signed up for the Conyers, Georgia, event, Dickens expects 5,000 to 7,000 to run there in October.      The U.S. events will last one day each, unlike the annual weeklong festival in Pamplona, when bull runs are held every morning. Author Ernest Hemingway wrote about the festival in his 1926 novel \\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" which helped it gain worldwide notoriety and attract spectators from around the globe.      Organizers acknowledge that the Great Bull Run is likely to start out on a smaller scale than its Spanish counterpart. But they note that other physically challenging activities such as extreme off-road runs and obstacle races have become increasingly popular in the U.S., and they see bull running as a natural follow-up.      \\"I think it's just a progression where we are becoming more and more active as a society,\\" Dickens said. \\"There's this fitness craze that started with running. I think this is just an extension of all that, but making it more interesting to the general public.\\"      Dozens of people are injured each year in the San Fermin festival at Pamplona, most by tripping and falling. Bulls have killed 15 people since record-keeping began in 1924.      Last month in Spain, a University of Utah college student and an Australian woman were gored by bulls. During one run, participants and spectators screamed as a bull tossed a Spaniard to the ground and attacked him, with fellow runners trying to pull the animal away by its tail. The man was eventually dragged to safety.      Organizers of the U.S. events plan to include several safety features, making them \\"quite different than the running of the bulls in Spain,\\" Dickens said.      Unlike the narrow, cobblestone streets of the Spanish runs, the U.S. events will use fencing that will include coves, or notches, so participants can get out of the way quickly.      Dickens said organizers are partnering with ranches who will supply the bulls, and veterinarians will monitor their health. \\"We're not using the Spanish fighting bulls that are bred to be very aggressive for the entertaining aspect of bullfighting,\\" Dickens said.      Bulls will be released in waves of six at a time, giving the animals and people a \\"better opportunity to complete the course safely,\\" Dickens said.      Before running, participants will be required to sign waivers. Dickens, an attorney, acknowledges that waivers won't prevent lawsuits but likened it to sky-diving or operating a rock-climbing wall: \\"The waivers for the most part ensure that even if you get sued, they're not going to win.\\"      Researchers are still trying to figure out why some people are drawn to potentially dangerous activities. One theory is that some people get a surge from routine activities, but others need more thrilling or exciting behaviors to get the same feeling, said Dr. Jonathan Becker, assistant professor of clinical psychiatry at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.      \\"To get that same sort of euphoric feeling that you feel at the end of a jog, they may need to jog with bulls for example,\\" Becker said.      Organizers say they're planning each U.S. event as an all-day experience, with plenty of activities such as a tomato fight, also modeled after a Spanish festival. But they hope the bull runs draw participants who have always wanted to participate but couldn't make the trip to Spain.      \\"You can go running down the street anytime you want, but to run with bulls _ that's something that doesn't come along very often,\\" Dickens said.      ___      Felberbaum reported from Richmond, Virginia. ||||| Thousands of daredevils have already signed up to sprint alongside bulls when The Great Bull Run comes to the U.S. this August.

We call on the USDA to investigate these entities immediately.\\"      Organizers at the Great Bull Run say they are \\"wholly committed to the health and safety of the animals we work with.\\"      \\"Unlike the running of the bulls in Spain, we don't kill the bulls in a bullfight, nor do we abuse them in anyway,\\" organizers state on the event website. \\"We don't hit them, shock them or deprive them of food, water, light or sleep. In fact, we have a veterinarian on site at all times to make sure the bulls are treated properly and are perfectly healthy before, during and after each run.\\"      Organizers of the U.S. events plan to include several safety features, making them \\"quite different than the running of the bulls in Spain,\\" Dickens said.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. Instructions: You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or qualitative relationships such as a relationship in economics or a scientific law and a story that makes use of the concepts or the relationship described in the provided paragraph. You need to come up with a question about the story that requires an understanding of the relationship described in the background paragraph. The generated question should not be answerable without both the background and story. Write a question about the story that requires a relationship in the background paragraph to answer. Check whether your question requires both the background paragraph and the story to answer. If your question can be answered by only one of these, try to rewrite your question so that it requires both. Note that \\"flipping\\" a word in the question can give rise to a new question where the answer will be different from the original question. Often, \\"flipping\\" a word gives rise to flipping the direction of the relationship, for example, from \\"increase\\" to \\"decrease.\\" Input: Background Paragraph: People protect areas that might flood with dams. In dire situations, they use sandbags ( Figure below ). Dams are usually very effective, but high water levels sometimes cause a dam to break. In that case, flooding can be catastrophic. Flood waters can also overflow a dam. People may line a river bank with levees to protect against floods. These are high walls that keep the stream within its banks during floods. Flood protection in one location sometimes causes problems elsewhere. For example, a levee in one location may just force the high water upstream or downstream. This will lead to flooding in a different location. Sometimes water gets so high that the river must be allowed to flood.  Story: There are two neighboring towns in the middle of the United States with a river running through both of them. One town, Glenview, just installed a new set of levees due to concerns about the river flooding. The other town, Binnington, is located just upstream from Glenview and has not yet installed any flood protection. Output:","output":"Question: After Glenview installed the new set of levees, what might be the impact on flooding in the upstream town of Binnington, if the river water level rises significantly? Explanation: To answer this question, one must understand the causal relationship mentioned in the background paragraph, which is that \\"a levee in one location may just force the high water upstream or downstream\\" and the story, which tells us about two towns: Glenview (with newly installed levees) and Binnington (without flood protection). The question requires the understanding of the relationship between levees and the potential redistribution of high waters to answer how Binnington might be affected by the flood protection installed in Glenview."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Build a movie plot around this: What does the homeless man who follows Brad demand? Two dollars The answer to this question is:","output":"Title: \\"Two-Dollar Destiny\\" Step 1: Establish Setting and Main Characters The movie is set primarily in a large city in the United States. Brad, a successful businessman, is our main character. He is a workaholic and initially lacks empathy for others. A key secondary character is Mark, the homeless man who follows Brad. Step 2: Introduce Conflict One day, Brad encounters Mark, a homeless man in his mid-30s who appears to be suffering from mental health issues. Mark approaches Brad and demands two dollars. At first, Brad dismisses the man, wanting nothing to do with him. Step 3: Build Tension Despite Brad's initial dismissal, Mark begins to follow him around the city. Mark's persistence attempts to get the two dollars from Brad piques Brad's interest, making him wonder why this specific amount is so important to the homeless man. This, in turn, leads Brad to develop a strange fascination with Mark, prompting him to observe the man and his daily routine. Step 4: Connection between Characters As Brad spends more time watching Mark, he begins to learn about the homeless man's tragic past. Once a struggling artist, Mark lost his family, home, and career after a series of unfortunate events. The two dollars he seeks from Brad is a symbol of the last artwork he sold before his life spiraled out of control – it had been priced at just two dollars. Step 5: Transformative Experience Brad's newfound understanding of Mark's story prompts him to reevaluate his own life and priorities. Witnessing the hardships faced by Mark, Brad starts to develop empathy and compassion for others, including those less fortunate. Step 6: Climax One day, while following Mark, Brad watches as Mark is confronted by a group of violent thugs. Noticing the situation escalating, Brad steps in to assist Mark and fights off the attackers. In the aftermath, Mark reveals that the persistence in asking for two dollars was not about the money, but rather about finding someone who genuinely cared enough to help him, regardless of his circumstance. Step 7: Resolution Deeply moved by Mark's story and their shared experience, Brad decides to give Mark the two dollars, acknowledging the significance of the gesture. However, he goes a step further and offers Mark a job at his company as well, determined to help the homeless man rebuild his life. Brad's involvement with Mark and the impact it has on his life inspire him to dedicate more time and resources to improving the lives of the less fortunate in the city. Step 8: Closing The film concludes with a scene showing Brad and Mark, now good friends and coworkers, organizing a charity event to benefit the homeless. Brad's personal growth culminates in a heartfelt speech, in which he expresses gratitude to Mark for teaching him the importance of compassion and empathy. Ultimately, the answer to the question \\"What does the homeless man who follows Brad demand?\\" is not just \\"Two dollars,\\" but also a life-changing relationship that transforms the lives of both men."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer. Question: what is probably true about jimbob? Options: - not enough information   - they adopted a monkey   - he was not really his parents child   - he was different === The correct answer is The answer to this question is:","output":"- he was different Jimbob was different from other children, as described in the story. He had unusual physical features like a shock of black hair and razor teeth from birth, and as he grew, his arms became longer and his head seemed smaller. His appearance made other kids feel scared, which eventually made his mother realize that he was different."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The son of a physician, Kunstler was born in New York City and attended DeWitt Clinton High School. He was educated at Yale College, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1941, and Columbia University Law School from which he graduated in 1948. While in school, Kunstler was an avid poet and represented Yale in the Glascock Prize competition at Mount Holyoke College. Kunstler served in the U.S. Army during World War II in the Pacific theater, attaining the rank of Major, and received the Bronze Star. In 1974-1975, Kunstler defended a prisoner charged with killing a guard during the Attica Prison riot. Under cross-examination, Kunstler forced Correction Officer Donald Melven to retract his sworn identification of John Hill, Kunstler's client, and Charles Pernasilice (defended by Richard Miller), admitting he still retained \\"slight\\" doubts that he confessed to investigators at the time of the incident. Kunstler focused on pointing out that all the other prosecution witnesses were testifying under reduced-sentencing agreements and called five prison inmates as defense witnesses (Miller called none), who testified that other prisoners hit the guard.  Despite Justice King's repeated warnings to Kunstler to \\"be careful, sir\\", Kunstler quickly became \\"the star of the trial, the man the jurors watch most attentively, and the lawyer whose voice carries most forcefully\\". Although the prosecution was careful to avoid personal confrontation with Kunstler, who frequently charmed the jury with jokes, on one occasion Kunstler provoked a shouting match with the lead prosecutor, allegedly to wake up a sleeping jury member. The jury convicted Hill of murder and Pernasilice of attempted assault. When Kunstler protested that the defendants would risk being murdered due to the judges remanding them, King threatened to send Kunstler with them. New York Governor Hugh Carey granted executive clemency to Hill and the other inmates in 1976, even though Hill's name was not on the recommended list of pardons delivered to the governor and his appeals were still pending.  In June, Kunstler and Barbara Handshu, representing another inmate at Attica, Mariano Gonzales, asked for a new hearing on the role of FBI informant Mary Jo Cook.

Tight City Council races: Veteran aldermen head for runoffs UPDATED at 9:43 p.m. Posted by Hal Dardick and John Byrne at 7:10 p.m.; check back for updates on results. City Council incumbents in several wards were beating back challenges tonight but at least two longtime aldermen appeared headed for April runoff elections. Ald. Sandi Jackson, 7th, who faced questions about how much time she spends in Washington D.C. with her children and husband, U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., had about 53 percent of the vote with 97 percent of precincts reporting in her Southeast Side ward. And Ald. George Cardenas, 12th, held a comfortable lead with 55 percent of the vote and all precincts in the ward reporting unofficial results, despite challenges from opponents backed by state Sen. Tony Munoz and Ald. Ricardo Munoz, 22nd. Ald. Scott Waguespack, 32nd, a frequent Daley critic in his first re-election race, collected 66 percent of the vote in his North Side ward against three challengers, with all precincts counted, according to unofficial results. And Ald. Robert Fioretti, 2nd, held 55 percent of the vote with 95 percent of precincts reporting as he tried to fend off attorney Genita Robinson and four others in the ward, which extends west from the South Loop well into the West Side Perhaps the biggest potential upset of the evening was in the 47th Ward on the Northwest Side, where longtime Ald. Eugene Schulter pulled out of the race at the last minute and threw his support behind ally Tom O’Donnell. With 94 percent of the vote counted, Ameya Pawar was just above the 50 percent mark. O’Donnell had 44 percent of the vote. The election was guaranteed to change City Council, even before the results of today's voting were reported. Nine of the 50 current aldermen were not on the ballot. In six wards, aldermen appointed by Mayor Richard Daley in the past 19 months were running in their first council election. More than half a dozen other aldermen faced serious challenges. One of the most hotly fought contests was in the 50th Ward on the far North Side, where Bernard Stone, the city’s second-longest serving alderman, faced an intense challenge from Debra Silverstein, a CPA, political worker and neighborhood volunteer who is the wife of the ward’s Democratic committeeman. Stone won by less than 700 votes four years ago in a runoff contest, and the next year Sen. Silverstein beat him in the committeeman’s contest. Since then, two of Stone’s political workers went to jail for trying to manipulate ballots. Lawyer Michael Moses, architect Greg Brewer and Ahmed Khan, whose family owns a popular local grocery store, rounded out the field. With more than 70 percent of the vote counted, Stone had about 38 percent of the vote, and Silverstein had about 33 percent. The other candidates had a total of about 30 percent, but all were well behind the two leaders. At campaign headquarters, Stone sat quietly at a long table signing volunteer work slips while his employees milled about yelling into cell phones. \\"I'm leading\\" Stone said. \\"So there's no question I'm in the runoff.\\"Despite his optimism, however, Stone acknowledged that it had been \\"a long day.\\"\\"We haven't reached the 50 percent mark yet, but we keep moving up,\\" said Stone, who was dressed in a gray suit and pink tie. \\"The only thing is, of course, there's more candidates and that makes it tougher.\\" Stoned added that turnout so far appeared to be lower than it was in 2007. City election officials predicted turnout from 40 to 45 percent, and aldermen said they were seeing similar numbers. To win outright on Tuesday, a candidate had to capture more than half the overall vote. In wards where no one got the outright majority, runoff elections between the two candidates with the most votes will be held April 5. The make-up of the new council and the inevitable jockeying for leadership posts will help create a new power equation at City Hall, which has long been dominated by outgoing Mayor Richard Daley. For more than two decades Daley has had an iron grip on the council and won easy passage of his initiatives, leaving aldermen to tinker around the edges of governance.But aldermen have considerable muscle to flex, if they choose to do so. They pass laws, vote on the city’s 6 billion-plus budget and have final say on all major appointments, including the key post of police superintendent.Unions, other political power players and the pro-business group, For a Better Chicago, have in recent weeks poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into council races. Another incumbent under heavy fire was Sharon Denise Dixon, 24th of the West Side, who faced 17 challengers, including former Ald. Michael Chandler. In the 7th Ward, Jackson was one of five sitting aldermen being challenged by the sons or daughters of former aldermen. Jackson declared victory over Darcel Beavers, the daughter of Cook County Commissioner William Beavers, was hoping to turn the tables on Jackson after losing to her in 2007. \\"This really was a very, very hard fought campaign, you all,\\" Jackson said, addressing more than 50 campaign volunteers and supporters at her headquarters in the 7100 block of South Exchange Avenue. \\"But tonight, the people of the 7th Ward have spoken.\\" In the 25th Ward, influential Ald. Daniel Solis was being challenged by Ambrosio “Ambi” Medrano Jr., the son of a former alderman sent to prison for public corruption, and Cuahutemoc Morfin, vice president of a Pilsen chamber of commerce. In the South Side's 6th Ward, Roderick Sawyer, the son Eugene Sawyer, who was elevated from alderman to mayor after the death in office of Harold Washington, was taking on Ald. Freddrenna Lyle. With about 78 percent of the vote counted, Lyle was leading the pack, but falling short of the majority e needed to avoid a runoff. She had 44 percent of the vote, to 25 percent for Sawyer, with the other three candidates in that contest far behind. Also on the South Side, Ald. Pat Dowell, 3rd, was being challenged by Ebony Tillman, the daughter of former Ald. Dorothy Tillman. Ald. Howard Brookins Jr., 21st, the son of a state senatorbest known for his successful battle to get a Walmart approved for his South Side ward, is being challenged by Sheldon Sherman, the son of former Ald. Niles Sherman, and three other people.One of the most highly publicized races was in the 20th Ward, where freshman Ald. Willie Cochran, a former police officer, was being challenged by Che “Rhymefest” Smith, a rap artist, attorney George Davis and two others. Cochran jumped out to an early lead. With 44 percent of precincts reporting, Cochran had 45 percent of the vote, to 20 percent for Che Smith. First-term Ald. Robert Fioretti, 2nd, who represents an area that extends from the South Loop well into the West Side, faced a spirited challenge from attorney Genita Robinson, who runs a youth tutoring and mentoring program, and four other candidates. Ald. Scott Waguespack, 32nd, who has developed a reputation for independence during his first term, was being challenged by three other men who had ties to regular Democrats. Meanwhile, Ald. George Cardenas, 12th, faced Jose Guereca, who had the backing of former Cardenas ally Sen. Tony Munoz, and Jesus “Jesse” Iniguez, who was backed by Ald. Ricardo Munoz, 22nd. Three others were in the contest. In one of the hardest fought open races, to replace outgoing Ald. Vi Daley, 43rd, Michele Smith, the ward’s Democratic committeeman, and Tim Egan, a hospital executive, were among nine candidates trying to represent Lincoln Park.In the North Side 47th Ward, Tom O'Donnell, an ally of longtime alderman Eugene Schulter, finds himself in a tight race. With 79 percent of precincts reporting, O'Donnell, who launched his campaign late last year as Schulter dropped out at the last minute, found himself with just 44 percent of the vote. He trailed Ameya Pawar, 30, a program assistant in Northwestern University's Office of Emergency Management, who had 50.3 percent of the total. The 46th Ward, where longtime Ald. Helen Shiller is calling it quits, had 11 candidates. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"This article is about City Council elections in different wards.

What prevents a group of well-intentioned billionaires from kindly pouring in, say, €10B into Greece's banks in order to save the country and Greeks from financial collapse? I live in Belgium, Brussels. What would prevent me from taking a mortgage on my house in a Greek bank hoping for a Grexit? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Choices:  (a). no.  (b). yes.","output":"There are multiple factors that prevent a group of well-intentioned billionaires from pouring €10B into Greece's banks to save the country and Greeks from financial collapse. Here are some of the key reasons: 1. Legal restrictions: International financial regulations, as well as regulatory laws in respective billionaires' countries, may limit the transfer of such large sums of money into another country's banks. These regulations are in place to curb money laundering, tax evasion, and other illicit financial activities. 2. Moral hazard: Introducing a large sum of money to a country's banks to alleviate financial collapse could inadvertently encourage riskier behavior in the future. Banks may take more risks, knowing that they may be bailed out by outside sources if a crisis occurs again. 3. Economic repercussions: Injecting €10B into Greece's banks could lead to inflation, as the country experiences a sudden influx of money. This could hurt the overall economic situation in the country and be counterproductive to the intended goal of stabilizing Greece's financial condition. 4. Political considerations: A large influx of money from private individuals could create or perpetuate the idea of dependence on external forces for financial stability. This could lead to political disagreements within Greece and potential resentment toward the donating billionaires, as their actions could be perceived as interfering with Greece's autonomy. 5. Return on investment: Billionaires would likely consider the potential return on investment (ROI) before deciding to inject funds into Greece's banks. It may not be an appealing investment opportunity if the overall financial condition of the country is unstable, as the chances of getting a substantial ROI could be low. Regarding your second question about taking a mortgage on your house in a Greek bank hoping for a Grexit, there are several issues to consider: 1. Risk: Taking a mortgage from a Greek bank involves a high degree of risk, especially considering the unstable financial environment in Greece. This may not be a wise financial decision, as there is no guarantee of a Grexit, and the potential consequences could have a lasting negative impact on your finances. 2. International regulations: There are likely regulations and policies in place that govern international mortgages, which could make it difficult or impossible for you to secure a mortgage with a Greek bank while residing in Belgium. 3. Cross-border complexities: Securing a mortgage in a foreign country can be complicated due to differences in regulations, legal systems, and consumer protection laws. This may increase the financial burden and complexity of managing the mortgage, as well as the overall risks associated with your investment. In conclusion, these two questions are not the same. The first question deals with the potential actions of a group of billionaires that could potentially save Greece from financial collapse. The second question focuses on an individual seeking a mortgage from a Greek bank, possibly hoping to gain an advantage in the event of Greece's exit from the European Union. Therefore, the correct answer to your multi-choice problem is (a) no."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Who wants to buy a horse farm? , can you please find it?   When criminal mastermind Erwin \\"Doc\\" Riedenschneider is released from prison after seven years, he goes to see a bookie named Cobby in an unnamed Midwest river city (probably Cincinnati), who arranges a meeting with Alonzo Emmerich, a lawyer. Emmerich listens to Doc's plan to steal jewelry worth half a million dollars or more. Doc needs 50,000 to hire three men—a \\"box man\\" (safecracker), a driver, and a \\"hooligan\\"—to help him pull off the caper. Emmerich agrees to provide the money and assume the responsibility for disposing of the loot. Doc hires Louie Ciavelli, a professional safecracker. Ciavelli only trusts Gus Minissi, a hunchbacked diner owner, as the getaway driver. The final member of the gang is Dix Handley, a friend of Gus. Dix explains his goal to Doll Conovan, who is in love with him. His dream is to buy back the horse farm that his father lost during the Great Depression. During the crime (an 11-minute sequence in the film), the criminals carry out their work. Ciavelli hammers through a brick wall to get into the jewelry store, deactivates a door alarm to let in Doc and Dix, and opens the main safe using home-brewed nitroglycerine (\\"the soup\\"). On their way out, Dix slugs an arriving security guard, who drops his revolver, which discharges and wounds Ciavelli in the belly. The men get away unseen, but a police manhunt begins.

Argentina remains one of 17 countries still banning British cattle for breeding because of the outbreak of mad cow disease in 1980s.

It does not provide any direct evidence of new tensions arising from this specific ban. While it is entirely possible that there may be some discontent or disagreement between Argentina and the United Kingdom due to the ban on British cattle for breeding, it is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph. This ban might be just one of the many factors influencing the relations between these nations, and it would be necessary to obtain further information to evaluate the impact of this decision on their relationship. Moreover, it is important to consider that the ban on British cattle stems from legitimate health concerns linked to the mad cow disease outbreak. Mad cow disease, or Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), is a fatal neurodegenerative disease in cattle that can be transmitted to humans, causing a severe and eventually lethal condition known as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD). Argentina, as a sovereign country, has the right to apply precautionary measures, such as the ban in question, to safeguard its people's health and its domestic livestock industry. Furthermore, trade partnerships between nations are multifaceted, and it is likely that Argentina and the United Kingdom engage in several other forms of economic and diplomatic cooperation. While the ban on British cattle for breeding may cause some strain between the two countries, it is also important to examine the extent to which the other aspects of their bilateral relations balance and potentially mitigate the impact of that disagreement. In conclusion, the paragraph only provides information about Argentina's continued ban on British cattle for breeding due to the mad cow disease outbreak. It does not establish a clear link between this ban and the emergence of new tensions between Argentina and the United Kingdom. For a more accurate assessment, it would be necessary to gather more information on the context surrounding this ban as well as any recent changes or incidents related to the two countries' political, economic, and diplomatic relations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose More plant roots grow into the rock happens, how will it affect MORE recyling.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"No, the supposed perturbation of \\"More plant roots grow into the rock\\" would not have a direct or indirect effect on the recycling process described. Here's how I reason this: Step-by-step: 1. First, let's understand the given process. It involves collecting items, sorting them, removing trash, sending it to a landfill, processing the rest through a baler machine, forming them into bales, and shipping them to manufacturers. 2. Now, let's define the perturbation hypothesis: \\"More plant roots grow into the rock.\\" This is a biological and geological event implying that increase in vegetation or an increase in plant root penetration into the soil or rock layers. 3. The next step is to check if this perturbation has any direct or indirect effect on the described recycling process. To impact the recycling process, the perturbation would need to affect one or more steps of the process. 4. However, an increase in plant roots growing into the rock is predominantly associated with land management, ecology, and geology. It's hard to see a plausible connection between this and the item collection, processing, or shipping activities in the recycling process. 5. Even in an indirect perspective, unless the growth of plant roots into the rock would somehow lead to an increased production of recyclable waste or affect the infrastructure used for recycling, it's hard to envision a connection. And these would be highly indirect and speculative at best. Therefore, based on these steps and the provided information, we can reason the perturbation proposed does not realistically impact the process of recycling as described. Therefore, it will not affect the outcome of 'MORE recycling'. Meaning the perturbation hypothesis of \\"More plant roots grow into the rock\\" would in general not lead to more recycling, considering the steps identified."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This political party was different from the others because they truly cared about the people and what they were going through. You see, Greece was going through a very difficult time. They had what's called an \\"economic crisis.\\" This means that many people didn't have jobs, and they didn't have enough money to buy the things they needed. Lots of people were very sad and worried about their future. But Syriza wanted to help. They saw that the people needed someone to understand what they were going through, and they wanted to make things better for everyone. Syriza listened to the people's problems and worked hard to fix them. A man named Manos, who was 32 years old, explained why Syriza was different from other political parties. He said that Syriza was successful because they understood what was happening in society. That means they knew what people were worried about and were able to help them out. Syriza also managed to connect with the people. They talked to many people from different walks of life and listened to their stories. They made the people feel important and heard, which is something that not all political parties are good at doing. Because of their caring and understanding ways, Syriza was able to gain the trust of the people. The people saw that this party was different, and they believed that Syriza could help them during the difficult time in Greece. So, as the economic crisis continued, Syriza became more and more popular. People believed in them and wanted them to be in charge. That's how Syriza found success during the economic crisis. In conclusion, Syriza was a special political party that managed to connect with the people during a tough time.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Grant, Biscuit, and Milo are punks living in Queens. Bored with their lives, they decide to move to Los Angeles, and set out on a cross-country drive. In Utah they assist Elvis impersonator \\"Daredelvis\\" with getting his trailer unstuck. Later, Grant sees a mirage of a cowboy on horseback. While camping in the Arizona desert they are attacked by a gang of vicious rednecks, and Milo is murdered by their leader, Missoula. Grant and Biscuit escape and collapse in the desert, where Grant again sees a vision of the cowboy. The local sheriffs do not believe the boys' story, having no record of Missoula or his gang and being unable to find Milo's body as evidence of the murder. Grant resolves to track down the gang and avenge Milo's death, despite Biscuit's reservations. Heading back into Utah, they find one of the gang's trucks overturned and several of the members dead. Before dying, one of them reveals that they planned to turn themselves in but were killed by Missoula, who is headed north through Wyoming to Montana. The boys also meet Jessie, a young woman who runs a gas station and towing business. Catching up to Missoula's truck, Grant and Biscuit engage in a high-speed shootout with Missoula and his buddy Blix, but swerve off the road and crash. They are rescued by Jessie, who teaches Grant how to shoot and ride a horse and strikes up a romance with him.

I discovered this place not too terribly long ago, and as Paolo D. said, 28GO is minimalistic (but cool), Anime Ramen & Teriaki takes the idea and runs.  Don't get me wrong: I like my anime.  I grew up on the staples of Akira, Fist of the North Star, Vampire Hunter D and a good ol' fashioned Studio Ghibli film or five.  This place really took me to that nerdtastic time in my life.  The set-up is great: Bright, cheery, with upbeat J-Pop playing as anime dressed girls greet you in Japanese.  The art is everywhere, but is very nice and classy (I do wish they had some of the old-school classics, but what they had was fun).  On TV, some Pokemon episode was playing.  When we walked in, we were the only ones there.  About halfway through our meal, the place became packed.  Talk about good timing.  The food, however, was just right for the outing.  Their gyoza is pretty darn tasty, as are their HUGE bowls of ramen.  Everything was hot and flavorful.  Even their boba teas were excellent and sweet.  Service was very nice.  The girls checked by often, but not enough to become overbearing.  They were always on top of things, and super friendly.  I appreciate the effort they put into their costumes.  It's not as crazy as some theme restaurants that I've been, but it still makes it point that the name of their game is anime.

Write a summary based on this article: George Zimmerman can be released on 150,000 bail as he awaits trial for the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, a judge ruled Friday during a hearing that saw Zimmerman apologize to Martin's parents for the teenager's death.      FILE - In this Thursday, April 12, 2012 file photo, George Zimmerman, right, stands next to a Seminole County Deputy during a court hearing in Sanford, Fla. Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer... (Associated Press)      Tracy Martin, left, and Sybrina Fulton, parents of slain teen Trayvon Martin, speak to each other during a public town hall meeting with legal experts and political leaders on Thursday, April 19, 2012,... (Associated Press)      Circuit Judge Kenneth Lester set several conditions Friday for Zimmerman's release, which he said would not occur Friday, but he did not say when exactly Zimmerman could go free. Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, also wants his client to be allowed to live in another state because of threats made against him, and wear a GPS monitor to track his whereabouts.      Wearing a charcoal suit, white shirt and gray tie _ but also shackled and appearing to have on a bulletproof vest _ Zimmerman took the witness stand to deliver a short statement to Martin's parents, who were there.      \\"I wanted to say I am sorry for the loss of your son. I did not know how old he was. I thought he was a little bit younger than I am. I did not know if he was armed or not,\\" Zimmerman said in his first public comments about the shooting.      The judge said he would hold another hearing on whether Zimmerman could go out of state if details could not be worked out with law enforcement.      Zimmerman cannot have any firearms, drink alcohol or use illegal drugs and must observe a curfew between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m. Zimmerman surrendered his passport at the start of the hearing.      Zimmerman, 28, is charged with second-degree murder in the Feb. 26 shooting of the 17-year-old Martin. He claims self-defense and has said Martin was the aggressor in their confrontation at a gated community where Martin was staying. Zimmerman was a neighborhood watch volunteer at the community, where he also lived.      The lack of an arrest for 44 days spurred protests nationwide in which participants chanted and held signs that said, \\"Arrest Zimmerman Now!\\" Anger over a delay in Zimmerman's arrest led to the Sanford police chief stepping down temporarily and the recusal of the prosecutor who normally handles cases out of Sanford.      Earlier, Zimmerman's parents and wife testified by phone in the hearing at the Seminole County Criminal Justice Center, saying he is not a flight risk nor a threat to the community. Zimmerman's family members were testifying by phone because they say they have been threatened.      \\"He is absolutely not a violent person,\\" his wife, Shellie Zimmerman, testified.      Zimmerman's father, George Zimmerman Sr., said that even when confronted his son was likely to \\"turn the other cheek.\\" The father also described what he said were his son's injuries Feb. 27, the morning after Martin was shot and killed.      \\"His face was swollen quite a bit. He had a protective cover over his nose. His lip was swollen and cut. And there were two vertical gashes on the back of his head,\\" the elder Zimmerman testified.      Zimmerman's mother, Gladys, said her son was \\"very protective\\" of vulnerable people such as the homeless and children. She described how he got involved in a mentoring program for children in Orlando, noting that both of the children he mentored were African-American like Martin.      Gladys Zimmerman said she was concerned about her son's safety in that program because he traveled twice a month to a dangerous neighborhood.      \\"He said, \`Mom, if I don't go, they don't have nobody,'\\" Gladys Zimmerman said.      Prosecutor Bernardo de la Rionda asked the family members about two incidents. In 2005, George Zimmerman had to take anger management courses after an undercover law enforcement officer accused him of attacking him as he tried to arrest Zimmerman's friend. In another incident, a girlfriend accused Zimmerman of attacking her. No charges were filed.      Zimmerman asked to meet with Trayvon Martin's parents before the hearing, but the family's lawyers said this was not the time.      \\"We believe (the) Zimmerman request is very self-serving, considering the timing of it 50 days later, right before his bond hearing,\\" said Justin R. Campbell _ an assistant to attorney Benjamin Crump _ in an email Thursday.      Legal experts had earlier predicted Zimmerman would likely be granted bail. Key factors include his ties to the local community and that he doesn't appear to be a flight risk since he turned himself in voluntarily after he was charged last week. He also has never been convicted of a serious crime, which would indicate he doesn't pose a threat to society.      \\"Although it's not routine for people charged with murder to get bond, they do get bond, and I think there is an excellent argument to be made in his specific case for him to be released on bond,\\" said defense attorney Randy McClean, who practices in Seminole County, about 15 miles northeast of Orlando.      Kim Cannaday, a spokeswoman for the Seminole County Sheriff's Office, said she couldn't comment on what security procedures would be in place for Zimmerman if he is released. The sheriff's office does have the ability to monitor defendants outside the county if a judge requests a GPS monitor be used as a condition of release.      ___      Anderson reported from Miami. ||||| George Zimmerman stunned a Florida court today by taking the stand and apologizing to the parents of Trayvon Martin, who were sitting in the courtroom during Zimmerman's bond hearing.      \\"I am sorry for the loss of your son. I did not know how old he was. I thought he was a little bit younger than I am. I did not know if he was armed or not,\\" Zimmerman said addressing Martin's family directly.      Martin's father, Tracy Martin, cried tears of anger after the apology, his attorney Ben Crump told reporters after the hearing.      Zimmerman took the stand wearing a dark suit with his hands shackled to a belt around his waist. He appeared to be wearing a bullet-proof vest beneath his loose-fitting suit.      His surprising testimony came the same day that ABC News exclusively obtained a photograph showing the bloodied back of Zimmerman's head, which was apparently taken three minutes after he shot and killed Martin. The photo could give credence to Zimmerman's claim that Martin had bashed his head against the concrete as Zimmerman fought for his life.      Click here to view the image. Warning: graphic content.      The bond hearing concluded this morning with Judge Kenneth Lester agreeing to allow Zimmerman, who is charged with second degree murder, to post a 150,000 bond to get out of jail. The prosecution had argued that Zimmerman should be denied bail or that it should be set at 1 million.      Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, told reporters after the hearing that he does not expect Zimmerman to be out of jail for a couple of days because it will take some time to come up with the money for bail.      After the court hearing, O'Mara rejected the suggestion that they were \\"pandering\\" to the parents, and said Zimmerman wanted to apologize after hearing the parents on TV said that he had never done so.      \\"He wanted to respond. I took it that the family wanted to hear from him and he wanted to say it… It should have been done in a private setting but that wasn't afforded him,\\" O'Mara said.      Ben Crump, a lawyer for Martin's parents, said the family was furious that Zimmerman could \\"give this self serving apology so he could get a bond.\\" One of the lawyers for the family called the apology \\"disingenuous and insincere.\\"      Zimmerman, 28, is being held on charges of second-degree murder for the Feb. 26 shooting of Martin, 17, which could carry a life sentence if he is convicted.      The exclusive photo obtained by ABC News shows blood trickling down the back of Zimmerman's head from two cuts. It also shows a possible contusion forming on the crown of his head. The original police report that night notes that the back of Zimmerman's head was wet, and that he was bleeding from the nose and head.      Zimmerman told police that night that he shot and killed the teenager in self-defense after Martin punched him and pounced on him. Zimmerman told police that Martin then bashed his head into the concrete sidewalk during the altercation that took place in the tidy middle-class development of the Retreat at Twin Lakes in Sanford, Fla.      Zimmerman was treated at the scene by paramedics, then cuffed and driven in a police cruiser to the Sanford police station. He was questioned for hours and later released. In police surveillance video obtained last month by ABC News, Zimmerman's wounds are not apparent, and there were no bandages on his head.      Zimmerman was not admitted to a hospital or given stitches the night of the incident.      The person who took the photograph of a bloodied Zimmerman, asking not to be identified, told ABC News exclusively that they did not see the scuffle that night, but did hear it. The person recalled seeing Martin's prostrate body on the wet grass and said the gunpowder burns on Martin's gray hoodie were clearly visible.      The photographer said that after the shooting, Zimmerman asked the photographer to call his wife. When the photographer asked him what to say, Zimmerman blurted out, \\"Man, just tell her I shot someone.\\"      Investigators have seen the photo.      Crump, the Martin family attorney, is skeptical.      \\"How bad could it have been if they didn't take him to the hospital [and] didn't stitch him up,\\" he said in a statement to ABC News in response to the image. \\"The special prosecutor has seen all the evidence and still believes George Zimmerman murdered Trayvon Martin.\\"      Testifying today, Zimmerman's father, Robert, a former magistrate, told the court that the day after Martin was killed he saw injuries his son suffered.      \\"His face was swollen quite a bit,\\" Robert Zimmerman said. \\"There was a protective cover over his nose, his lip was cut and there were two vertical gashes on the back of his head.\\"      Zimmerman's parents and wife Shellie testified at the hearing by phone because they did not want to make a public appearance out of fear for their safety.      In a dramatic moment during the hearing, a detective, under questioning from O'Mara, admitted that it has no clear evidence that Zimmerman attacked Trayvon Martin first.      Zimmerman's family testified that he should be granted bail because, they said, he is not a violent person.      \\"He's absolutely not a violent person or a threat to the community,\\" said Shellie Zimmerman, who is a nursing student.      In 2005, Zimmerman was arrested in Orange County, Fla., and accused of battering a police officer and obstructing justice. He pleaded to a lower charge and was ordered to attend an anger management program.      Both his wife and father testified that Zimmerman had seen two men in civilian clothes shoving his friend against a wall and that the officers never identified themselves as police. However, a police affidavit claimed that when the officers showed their badges Zimmerman said, \\"I don't care who you are.\\"      In a second incident, prosecutor Bernie de la rionda said that a woman got an injunction against Zimmerman after he pushed her and slapped her mouth. Shellie Zimmerman testified that her husband was defending himself after the woman attacked him and drew blood. She said that Zimmerman got an injunction against the woman. ||||| After George Zimmerman took the stand during his bond hearing and told Trayvon Martin's parents that he was sorry for the loss of their son, a Florida judge Friday set Zimmerman's bond at 150,000.      The judge set a number of conditions, including GPS monitoring. The judge said Zimmerman wouldn't have the opportunity to be released Friday, because his attorney and state authorities needed to hammer out the monitoring and other logistics.      Friday's bond hearing also included testimony from one of the state's main investigators in the case, with Zimmerman attorney Mark O'Mara challenging the state's assertions. Under questioning, the investigator said the state didn't have evidence to contradict Zimmerman's account that Martin started the fight that led to the shooting, but he did say evidence did call into question other parts of Zimmerman's account.      Zimmerman, 28, was charged on April 11 with second-degree murder in the February death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, after the case sparked a heated, national debate over racial profiling and saw thousands of protesters demand Zimmerman's arrest. Martin's family contends Zimmerman racially profiled their son, who was black, and was walking back from a convenience store in Sanford, Florida.      Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who is Hispanic, maintains he acted in self-defense. His family says he did not profile Martin. (Timeline of case)      The following is a running account of the bond hearing:      [Updated at 12:14 p.m. ET] The state's attorney in today's bond hearing, reacting to reporters' questions about O'Mara's assault on the prosecution's case, said that not all evidence has been publicly revealed.      \\"We did not put our entire case on today. Let's leave it at that,\\" he told reporters outside the courthouse.      [Updated at 11:55 a.m. ET] Mark NeJame, an Orlando lawyer and CNN legal analyst, said O'Mara's move to put Zimmerman on the stand during the bond hearing \\"was a calculated risk to humanize George Zimmerman.\\"      \\"We've heard a lot of negative things for weeks now, and we've now heard a living breathing person\\" make an apology, NeJame said.      [Updated at 11:15 a.m. ET] The hearing is over. Zimmerman stood up and shook hands with his attorney, Mark O'Mara, before sitting down again to wait to be taken from the courtroom.      [Updated at 11:10 a.m. ET] The judge has set a bond of 150,000, with conditions.      The conditions include:      - GPS monitoring      - Zimmerman would have to contact authorities every three days      - No contact with the victim's family      - No possession of firearms      - No use of controlled substances, other than those prescribed by a physician.      As for O'Mara's request that Zimmerman be allowed to reside away from Florida, the judge said O'Mara and the state should get together and determine whether that can be accomplished.      Because O'Mara and the state need to meet about the arrangements for monitoring, Zimmerman will not have an opportunity to be freed today. the judge said.      [Updated at 11:07 a.m. ET] The state's attorney is now making a case against leniency when it comes to the bond decision, and has asked for no bond, or a bond of 1 million.      The state's attorney argued that Zimmerman is a danger to the public, citing not only the second-degree murder charge, but a previous charge of battery against a law enforcement officer, which was discussed at length earlier in the hearing.      [Updated at 11:02 a.m. ET] The hearing is now turning back to the issue of bond. O'Mara is asking the judge for:      - 15,000 bond.      - The ability of Zimmerman to leave the state      - Secrecy over Zimmerman's whereabouts      O'Mara, speaking to Zimmerman's ability to pay bond, noted that Zimmerman cannot work in public because of the case's publicity, and that his wife is not working because she is in school.      [Updated at 10:58 a.m. ET] The prosecuting attorney is now questioning Zimmerman. He asked whether Zimmerman had ever said he was sorry when he spoke to police. Zimmerman responded that he had told one of the investigators that \\"I felt sorry for the family.\\"      The prosecutor told Zimmerman that if that's true, it must have been recorded. He asked Zimmerman if he was sure, and Zimmerman said he was \\"fairly certain.\\"      [Updated at 10:55 a.m. ET] \\"I wanted to say I am sorry for the loss of your son,\\" Zimmerman said on the stand, apparently addressing Martin's parents, who are in the room. (Watch video of apology)      Zimmerman also said he thought Martin was older, and that he \\"didn't know if (Martin) was armed or not.\\"      [Updated at 10:54 a.m. ET] Zimmerman is about the address the court. His attorney has called him to the stand.      [Updated at 10:53 a.m. ET] The prosecuting attorney, after saying \\"I didn't know we were going to be trying the case today,\\" is back to ask questions of state attorney's investigator Dale Gilbreath, after O'Mara asked questions challenging the state's assertions.      The prosecutor asked Gilbreath whether there was any evidence indicating that Zimmerman's account that Martin bashed his head against a sidewalk wasn't true. Gilbreath said yes.      [Updated at 10:47 a.m. ET] O'Mara is back to questioning state attorney's investigator Dale Gilbreath, one of the investigators in the case.      O'Mara asked whether Gilbreath knows who started the fight between Zimmerman and Martin, or had any evidence as to who started the fight. Gilbreath said no.      O'Mara asked whether Gilbreath had any evidence contradicting Zimmerman's statement to Sanford police on the night of the incident that Zimmerman: 1) turned toward his car after losing sight of Martin; and 2) that Martin started the fight that led to the shooting. Gilbreath said no.      [Updated at 10:36 a.m. ET] A prosecuting attorney is now questioning state attorney's investigator Dale Gilbreath, after Zimmerman's attorney took issue with wording in a probable cause affidavit that Gilbreath had signed. Gilbreath is one of the investigators in the Martin shooting case.      Like O'Mara, the prosecuting attorney is asking Gilbreath about the affidavit, and about evidence that Gilbreath collected. The general thrust of the questioning is designed to bolster the affidavit's credibility, after O'Mara questioned word choices in the affidavit.      Gilbreath testified he has reviewed other evidence documents other than what has been discussed in the hearing. The prosecutor asked Gilbreath whether Martin had a right to be in the neighborhood - Gilbreath said yes. Gilbreath also was asked if there was no evidence that Martin was committing any crime, and again Gilbreath said yes.      [Updated at 10:28 a.m. ET] O'Mara still is questioning state attorney's investigator Dale Gilbreath about the way that the probable cause affidavit - which supported the second-degree murder charge - was written.      O'Mara is now taking issue with a line that says Zimmerman \\"disregarded\\" a police dispatcher. On the tape that has been released to the public, Zimmerman indicated that he was following Martin, and the dispatcher said that authorities didn't need Zimmerman to do that.      O'Mara, through his questioning of Gilbreath, is basically suggesting that \\"disregarded\\" was the wrong word, because Zimmerman did not hang up with the dispatcher, and therefore did not disregard him.      O'Mara also is taking issue with the affidavit saying that Zimmerman \\"confronted\\" Martin. O'Mara is contending that Gilbreath has offered no evidence that Zimmerman confronted Martin, and that other, less antagonistic words, should have been used since Gilbreath had no evidence that Zimmerman confronted him. Such words, O'Mara said, would be \\"came up to,\\" or \\"spoke with.\\"      [Updated at 10:19 a.m. ET] O'Mara, while questioning state attorney's investigator Dale Gilbreath, is now taking issue with other language choices in the probable cause affidavit.      O'Mara has noted that the only two quotes in the affidavit from Zimmerman - taken from a police call that Zimmerman made to notify police that he had seen a suspicious person - are of Zimmerman using expletives. O'Mara asked why - out of everything Zimmerman said - only those two quotes were included in the affidavit.      Gilbreath responded that he didn't type the affidavit. O'Mara pointed out that Gilbreath swore to it, and Gilbreath agreed that he had.      [Updated at 10:14 a.m. ET] O'Mara, while questioning state attorney's investigator Dale Gilbreath, has taken issue with the word \\"profiled\\" in the probable cause affidavit supporting the second-degree murder charge.      The affidavit, which Gilbreath had signed, says that Zimmerman profiled Martin. O'Mara asked why the affidavit says profiled, rather than \\"noticed\\" or \\"saw.\\" Gilbreath said he couldn't remember who wrote the word, saying it was a collaborative document.      [Updated at 10:09 a.m. ET] O'Mara has called Dale Gilbreath, an investigator with the state attorney's office, to the stand. Gilbreath is one of the investigators in the Martin shooting case.      Gilbreath has indicated that he didn't expect to testify today.      [Updated at 10:05 a.m. ET] O'Mara asked Zimmerman's mother whether she has come to know her son as someone who comes to the defense of people. She said yes.      She said he has stood up for children and homeless people in and around his community. She also testified that he had been a mentor for two African American children.      [Updated at 10:04 a.m. ET] O'Mara asked Zimmerman's mother about Zimmerman's previous charge of battery against a law enforcement officer. She said that Zimmerman was involved in an altercation with a plainclothes ATF agent because he was coming to the defense of a friend, who was being roughed up. The officer didn't identify himself as a law enforcement officer, she said.      [Updated at 10:02 a.m. ET] Zimmerman's mother, like his father and wife earlier this morning, said that if Zimmerman is released on bond, his location and the places where he would be allowed to go should be kept secret, because he and the family have received threats.      [Updated at 9:53 a.m. ET] O'Mara has now called Zimmerman's mother to the phone.      [Updated at 9:51 a.m. ET] Now being questioned by O'Mara, Zimmerman's father testified about Zimmerman's appearance after the February 26 shooting. The father said Zimmerman's face was swollen \\"quite a bit,\\" had a protective cover over his nose, and had two vertical gashes on the back of his head.      According to an Orlando Sentinel story later confirmed by Sanford police, Zimmerman told authorities that after he called 911 about a suspicious person (later identified as Martin), and after he briefly lost track of Martin, the teen approached him. After the two exchange words, Zimmerman said, he reached for his cell phone, and then Martin punched him in the nose. Zimmerman said Martin pinned him to the ground and began slamming his head into the sidewalk.      [Updated at 9:47 a.m. ET] The prosecution is asking Zimmerman's father about Zimmerman's previous charge of battery against a law enforcement officer, basically having the father acknowledge that he knows Zimmerman faced that charge. Like the exchange that the prosecution had with Zimmerman's wife a few minutes ago, they went over the fact that Zimmerman took anger management classes as a result of that charge, which was reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor.      [Updated at 9:41 a.m. ET] O'Mara is asking Zimmerman's father about his financial ability to help post bond. The father, who said he was retired, said he and his wife have some savings, but very little. He said he had a mortgaged home, and that he was willing to secure the home as part of a bond arrangement.      [Updated at 9:39 a.m. ET] O'Mara is now questioning Zimmerman's father, Robert Zimmerman Sr., who, like Zimmerman's wife, is testifying by phone. A notary public has sworn Robert Zimmerman in.      [Updated at 9:36 a.m. ET] O'Mara questioned Zimmerman's wife about the previous allegations against Zimmerman - including a charge of battery on a law enforcement officer and an altercation with a woman - that the prosecuting attorney brought up. Through questioning, Zimmerman's wife testified that the battery charge was reduced to a misdemeanor through a pretrial diversion program in which he took anger management classes, and that she believes he completed those classes. She also testified that in the altercation with the woman, Zimmerman was not arrested, and that the woman attacked Zimmerman and drew blood, and that as a result, Zimmerman got an injunction against that woman.      [Updated at 9:30 a.m. ET] The prosecuting attorney summed up the previous allegations - including the charge of battery on a law enforcement officer - and then asked Zimmerman's wife whether she still believes Zimmerman isn't a danger to the community. \\"Absolutely he is not a violent person,” nor is he a threat to the community, she responded.      [Updated at 9:24 a.m. ET] The prosecution is now questioning Zimmerman's wife about her assertion that Zimmerman poses no danger to the community. The prosecuting attorney is pointing out that Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder, and that Zimmerman is accused of a violent act.      The prosecuting attorney also is asking Zimmerman's wife about his previous brushes with the law, including a charge of battery of a law enforcement officer. He also brought up a woman's previous allegations that the woman and Zimmerman were in an altercation - Zimmerman's wife answered that she is aware that Zimmerman needed to defend himself from an attack by the woman, that the woman drew blood, and that Zimmerman filed for a protective order because of the incident. The prosecutor is asking her whether she is aware of those charges and allegations in the past, and she said she is.      [Updated at 9:20 a.m. ET] Zimmerman's wife said she fears for Zimmeran's safety and the safety of their family, and that is part of the reason why she is testifying by phone.      Asked if she believes Zimmerman is a danger to society, she said no. She said she has \\"no concerns whatsoever\\" about him.      [Updated at 9:18 a.m. ET] O'Mara is asking Zimmerman's wife about the family's financial ability to post bond. O'Mara is saying that Zimmerman is indigent; Zimmerman's wife said that she has talked to other family members about scraping up everything they could in anticipation of posting bond.      [Updated at 9:15 a.m. ET] With Zimmerman's wife on speakerphone, O'Mara has begun asking her questions. Asked if she would do everything in her power to ensure that Zimmerman - should he be granted bail - return to court when he is required to do so, she said yes. And she said she would contact the court if she lost contact with him.      [Updated at 9:11 a.m. ET] The court has called Zimmerman's wife on the phone. A notary public is with Mrs. Zimmerman and is swearing her in.      [Updated at 9:08 a.m. ET] Lester has begun the proceeding. After the attorneys identified themselves to the judge, O'Mara kicked off the bond request and told the judge that witnesses are available by phone. The court is calling those witnesses now. As we noted earlier, Zimmerman's family has offered to give testimony by phone.      [Updated at 9:04 a.m. ET] Zimmerman, wearing a dark gray suit, white shirt and light gray tie, has entered the courtroom and has seated himself next to O'Mara.      [Updated at 9:00 a.m. ET] Martin's parents are, indeed, in the courtroom, and they've taken their seats. O'Mara, Zimmerman's attorney, also is standing the courtroom, waiting for the proceeding to begin.      [Updated at 8:59 a.m. ET] Check out this piece on why evidence in the case may come up in the bond hearing. The prosecutor, Corey, has the burden of showing why bond should not be set or that it should be high. The burden is referred to as \\"proof of guilt is evident or presumption of guilt is great.\\" Corey would have to convince Lester that a jury would convict Zimmerman.      [Updated at 8:55 a.m. ET] The bond hearing is expected to begin in minutes. Martin's parents are expected to be at the hearing, and this would be the first time that they and Zimmerman are in the same room, CNN's Martin Savidge tells us from the site.      O'Mara filed a motion that asks the court to allow Zimmerman's family members to provide testimony at the bond hearing by telephone. The state attorney's office did not object. |||||","output":"George Zimmerman, the man accused of the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, has been granted the possibility of release on a 150,000 bail by the judge. Zimmerman apologized to Martin's parents for the teenager's death during the court hearing. The judge set several release conditions for Zimmerman, including that he cannot have any firearms, drink alcohol, or use illegal drugs, and must observe a curfew between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m. Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, requested that his client be allowed to live in another state due to threats made against him and wear a GPS monitor to track his whereabouts. Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder in the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, but claims self-defense and that Martin was the aggressor in their confrontation. The case gained national attention as protests demanded Zimmerman's arrest, leading to the Sanford police chief stepping down temporarily and the recusal of the prosecutor who normally handles cases out of Sanford."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - In logic, a logical connective (also called a logical operator) is a symbol or word used to connect two or more sentences (of either a formal or a natural language) in a grammatically valid way, such that the sense of the compound sentence produced depends only on the original sentences.  - A formal system or logical calculus is any well-defined system of abstract thought based on the model of mathematics. A formal system need not be mathematical as such; for example, Spinoza's \\"Ethics\\" imitates the form of Euclid's \\"Elements\\".. Spinoza employed Euclidiean elements such as \\"axioms\\" or \\"primitive truths\\", rules of inferences etc. so that a calculus can be build using these. For nature of such primitive truths, one can consult Tarski's \\"Concept of truth for a formalized language\\".   - In logic, a substructural logic is a logic lacking one of the usual structural rules (e.g. of classical and intuitionistic logic), such as weakening, contraction, exchange or associativity. Two of the more significant substructural logics are relevant logic and linear logic.  - In mathematical logic, a sequent is a very general kind of conditional assertion.  - In mathematics, a theorem is a statement that has been proved on the basis of previously established statements, such as other theoremsand generally accepted statements, such as axioms. A theorem is a logical consequence of the axioms. The proof of a mathematical theorem is a logical argument for the theorem statement given in accord with the rules of a deductive system. The proof of a theorem is often interpreted as justification of the truth of the theorem statement. In light of the requirement that theorems be proved, the concept of a theorem is fundamentally \\"deductive\\", in contrast to the notion of a scientific law, which is \\"experimental\\".  - In logic, a rule of inference, inference rule or transformation rule is a logical form consisting of a function which takes premises, analyzes their syntax, and returns a conclusion (or conclusions). For example, the rule of inference called \\"modus ponens\\" takes two premises, one in the form \\"If p then q\\" and another in the form \\"p\\", and returns the conclusion \\"q\\". The rule is valid with respect to the semantics of classical logic (as well as the semantics of many other non-classical logics), in the sense that if the premises are true (under an interpretation), then so is the conclusion.  - Proof theory is a major branch of mathematical logic that represents proofs as formal mathematical objects, facilitating their analysis by mathematical techniques. Proofs are typically presented as inductively-defined data structures such as plain lists, boxed lists, or trees, which are constructed according to the axioms and rules of inference of the logical system. As such, proof theory is syntactic in nature, in contrast to model theory, which is semantic in nature.  - In proof theory, a structural rule is an inference rule that does not refer to any logical connective, but instead operates on the judgment or sequents directly. Structural rules often mimic intended meta-theoretic properties of the logic. Logics that deny one or more of the structural rules are classified as substructural logics.  - Idempotency of entailment is a property of logical systems that states that one may derive the same consequences from many instances of a hypothesis as from just one . This property can be captured by a structural rule called contraction , and in such systems one may say that entailment is idempotent if and only if contraction is an admissible rule . Rule of Contraction : from A , C , C  B is derived A , C  B. Or in sequent calculus notation ,  frac (  Gamma , C , C  vdash B ) (  Gamma , C  vdash B )  - In logic, a rule of inference is admissible in a formal system if the set of theorems of the system does not change when that rule is added to the existing rules of the system. In other words, every formula that can be derived using that rule is already derivable without that rule, so, in a sense, it is redundant. The concept of an admissible rule was introduced by Paul Lorenzen (1955).  - Paul Lorenzen (March 24, 1915  October 1, 1994) was a German philosopher and mathematician, founder of the Erlangen School (with Wilhelm Kamlah) and inventor of game semantics (with Kuno Lorenz).    After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'idempotency of entailment' exhibits the relationship of 'instance of'. Find the answer from the choices below.

The European leg of their tour began on May 28, 1982, at the Stadion am Bieberer Berg in Offenbach am Main. This was their first performance in Germany, and had an attendance of around 40,000 spectators.When they were not on the road, the duo went into the studio to work on what was to be a reunion Simon & Garfunkel album, tentatively entitled Think Too Much, with Garfunkel adding harmony vocals to a bunch of new songs for which Simon had already laid down some backing tracks. They set a release date of spring 1983 to coincide with their planned North American tour, but after increasingly acrimonious delays and disagreements, Simon told Warner Brothers he could no longer work with Garfunkel and that the project as an S&G album was cancelled. Thus Garfunkel dropped out of the project, which then became Simon's November 1983 solo album Hearts and Bones.Several years would pass before Simon & Garfunkel worked together again. Their next joint public appearance was in 1990, when they performed for their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Washington (CNN) -- Troubling questions over Georgia's controversial death penalty system will remain unresolved for now, after the Supreme Court declined Monday to review an appeal from a death-row inmate who received unwanted help from state prosecutors on his legal representation. The justices without comment rejected Jamie Ryan Weis' request for relief. He says he sat in jail for years after the state ran out of money to pay for his lawyers. Weis said prosecutors then suggested that a judge appoint two public defenders, even offering the names of two overworked and inexperienced attorneys who did not want the job. Weis' current legal team calls that a blatant conflict of interest. At issue is whether OPTIONS: - CNN' constitutional right to a speedy trial and competent defense were short-circuited by an ongoing budget shortfall. - Georgia' constitutional right to a speedy trial and competent defense were short-circuited by an ongoing budget shortfall. - Jamie Ryan Weis' constitutional right to a speedy trial and competent defense were short-circuited by an ongoing budget shortfall. - Supreme Court' constitutional right to a speedy trial and competent defense were short-circuited by an ongoing budget shortfall. - U.S.' constitutional right to a speedy trial and competent defense were short-circuited by an ongoing budget shortfall. - Washington' constitutional right to a speedy trial and competent defense were short-circuited by an ongoing budget shortfall. - Weis' constitutional right to a speedy trial and competent defense were short-circuited by an ongoing budget shortfall.","output":"At issue is whether Jamie Ryan Weis' constitutional right to a speedy trial and competent defense were short-circuited by an ongoing budget shortfall. The situation raises concerns about the fairness and effectiveness of Georgia's death penalty system, specifically in relation to the provision of adequate legal representation for defendants. The fact that the Supreme Court has declined to review Weis' appeal means that these complex issues will remain unresolved for the time being, leaving other death-row inmates in the state potentially vulnerable to similar challenges in securing their legal rights. The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees the right to a speedy trial and effective counsel for defendants in criminal cases. In Weis' case, his initial legal representation was withdrawn due to the state's budgetary issues, leaving him without counsel for an extended period. When state prosecutors then recommended two public defenders who were both overworked and inexperienced, it further complicated matters, as their reluctance to take on the case could have jeopardized Weis' chances of receiving a fair trial and proper legal defense. The fact that the Supreme Court chose not to review this appeal highlights the difficulty in addressing systemic flaws within the death penalty framework. States may face funding shortages and other logistical issues that can inadvertently impact a defendant's right to a fair trial. Additionally, issues of conflict of interest, as demonstrated in Weis' case, can further undermine public trust in the system's ability to ensure justice is served. In order to prevent similar issues from arising in the future, potential solutions could involve increased oversight and regulation of the legal representation process for death penalty cases. This may require additional funding and resources to be allocated to public defender offices, along with the implementation of more stringent guidelines and requirements for the attorneys appointed to these roles. By improving the quality and availability of legal representation in capital cases, states can minimize the risk of unconstitutional practices and help guarantee that defendants' rights are fully protected throughout the legal process."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The perturbation described concerns the decrease in wind during nighttime. Wind is primarily a result of atmospheric pressure differences caused by uneven heating of the Earth's surface. It doesn't have a direct effect on the movement of tectonic plates or the force they exert, as tectonic plate movement is primarily driven by processes in the Earth's mantle, such as convection currents, mantle plumes, and forces related to the Earth's rotation.

This nature-inspired decor piece is perfect for adding a touch of coastal charm to any space, and it's a great way to display your collection of seashells gathered from your beach adventures. In this article, we'll guide you through the steps to create your very own driftwood and seashell wall hanging that will impress your guests and add a calming ocean vibe to your living space. Step 1: Collect your materials To begin your project, you'll need to gather a few essential materials. These include: - A selection of seashells in different shapes and sizes - A piece of driftwood, approximately 12-18 inches long - A drill and small drill bit - A pair of scissors - A roll of sturdy string, such as twine or hemp cord - Optional: beads or additional decorative elements Step 2: Wash your seashells Before starting the assembly, it's important to give your seashells a thorough cleaning. This will remove any dirt, sand or debris that might still be clinging to them. Simply soak the shells in a bucket of warm water mixed with a mild detergent for about 15 minutes. After soaking, gently scrub each shell with a soft brush, then rinse with clean water and let them dry completely. Step 3: Drill holes in the shells Next, you'll need to create small holes in each of your seashells to enable them to be strung onto the string. Using a small drill bit, carefully drill a hole near the top of each shell. To prevent cracking, start with a small pilot hole and gradually increase the size until you have the desired hole size for your string to pass through. Step 4: Cut your string Cut multiple pieces of string to the desired length for your wall hanging. The length may vary depending on how many shells you have and your preferred style – some may want longer strands with multiple shells, while others may opt for shorter strands with just one or two shells. Remember to leave extra length for tying knots and attaching to the driftwood. Step 5: Tie the string to the driftwood Lay your driftwood piece on a flat surface, and arrange the cut strings along the length of the driftwood, spacing them evenly apart. One by one, secure each string in place by tying a secure knot around the driftwood. Ensure that the knots are tight and will hold the weight of the shells. Step 6: Add shells to the string Thread the seashells onto each piece of string by passing the string through the drilled holes. You can create a variety of patterns by mixing and matching different shell types and sizes. If desired, you could also add beads or other decorative elements to further personalize your wall hanging. Step 7: Hang your driftwood Finally, it's time to display your DIY driftwood and seashell wall hanging. Choose a spot on your wall where you'd like to hang the piece, ensuring that it can support the weight of the assembled wall hanging. You can either attach a hanging hook directly to the wall or use a piece of string to create a small loop at the top of the driftwood for easy hanging. Conclusion: A driftwood and seashell wall hanging is a creative and unique way to bring a touch of beach-inspired decor to your home. By following these simple steps, you can create a stunning art piece using natural materials that hold special memories from your seaside adventures. So, get crafting and give your home a lovely, coastal makeover with your very own DIY driftwood and seashell wall hanging."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

These specialized formulas are intended to provide your cat with the right kind of nutrition for its age, size and health. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: 1. The first option talks about products that help develop teeth and promote weight loss, but it does not focus on the specific nutritional needs of older cats. Additionally, the sentence structure is confusing, making it difficult to understand the point. 2. The second option suggests that older cats need more protein, milk, or fiber, but it does not provide any information on specific nutrients that older cats actually need. Moreover, it recommends reading package instructions, which is not directly connected to the topic of choosing dry cat food based on age. 3. The third option suggests looking for canned cat food products and checking health and age information on food labels. Although it mentions the consideration of the cat's age, it does not provide any specific guidelines for choosing the appropriate dry cat food. Also, the focus switches to canned cat food, which is irrelevant to the main topic of dry cat food."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) suffered its first trial loss in a lawsuit claiming its talc-based products including Johnson’s Baby Powder contain cancer-causing asbestos, with a New Jersey jury on Thursday ordering J&J; and another company to pay 37 million in damages.      FILE PHOTO: A Johnson & Johnson building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo      The verdict of liability in Middlesex County Superior Court in New Brunswick came as J&J; fights thousands of cases claiming its talc products can also cause ovarian cancer. The jury found J&J; and another company liable after more than two months of trial.      The lawsuit was brought by New Jersey resident Stephen Lanzo, who said he developed mesothelioma after inhaling dust that was generated through his regular use of J&J; talc powder products since his birth in 1972.      Mesothelioma is a deadly form of cancer closely associated with exposure to asbestos. It affects the delicate tissue that lines body cavities, most often around the lungs, but also in the abdomen and elsewhere.      The jury awarded Lanzo 30 million and his wife 7 million in compensatory damages. It found J&J; was responsible for 70 percent of the damages and said a unit of France-based Imerys SA (IMTP.PA), its talc supplier, was responsible for 30 percent.      The jury will return on Tuesday for further proceedings to determine whether to award punitive damages, according to an online broadcast of the trial by Courtroom View Network.      J&J; denied the allegations and says Johnson’s Baby Powder does not contain asbestos or cause cancer.      J&J; in a statement said it was disappointed but would withhold further comment until the trial’s completion. Gwen Myers, an Imerys spokeswoman, said Imerys plans to appeal and is confident talc did not cause Lanzo’s cancer.      The Lanzos did not respond to requests for comment.      J&J;, based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, faces talc-related lawsuits by 6,610 plaintiffs nationally, largely based on claims it failed to warn women about the risk of developing ovarian cancer by using its products for feminine hygiene.      In five trials in Missouri involving ovarian cancer lawsuits, juries found J&J; liable four times and awarded the plaintiffs a total of 307 million. In California, a jury awarded a now-deceased woman 417 million.      But in October, a Missouri appellate court threw out the first verdict there for 72 million and a California judge tossed the 417 million verdict. J&J; is seeking to reverse the other verdicts.      Asbestos claims are a more recent challenge for J&J.; It won the only other asbestos-related trial in November when a Los Angeles Superior Court jury ruled in its favor.      (This story corrects headline to show case was J&J;’s first trial loss in an asbestos-related case involving talc, not first loss in talc cancer lawsuit. Corrects paragraph 1 to say both J&J; and another company have been ordered to pay 37 mln, not just J&J;) ||||| (CNN) Johnson & Johnson and talc company Imerys SA must pay 117 million in damages to a couple after the husband, a New Jersey banker, got cancer after decades of using talcum powder.      The Middlesex County, New Jersey, jury ordered the companies to pay 80 million in punitive damages Wednesday. Last week, it awarded banker Stephen Lanzo 30 million in compensatory damages and his wife 7 million in damages.      Lanzo said he used Johnson & Johnson products like Shower to Shower and Baby Powder for more than 30 years, and he claimed that inhaling the powder caused his mesothelioma , an aggressive and deadly cancer that impacts the lining of the lungs.      Deposits of talc, one of Earth's softest minerals , are often located near deposits of the minerals that constitute asbestos, and studies have shown the risk of cross-contamination during mining. Johnson & Johnson said its talc products do not contain asbestos, which, it noted, has been a legal requirement since the 1970s.      Lanzo's case was the first to go to trial in New Jersey, the home state of Johnson & Johnson.      Johnson & Johnson and other talcum powder companies face thousands of separate but related cases that draw a connection between genital talc use and ovarian cancer.      The Lanzos' lawyers accused the company of holding back information from its customers about the health risks of asbestos in its talc products since the 1960s.      Johnson & Johnson argued that it did extensive testing to make sure its products were not contaminated.      \\"Johnson's Baby Powder has been used for more than 120 years and it does not contain asbestos or cause mesothelioma,\\" the company said in a statement Wednesday. \\"After suffering multiple losses through court rulings and at trial, plaintiff's attorneys have shifted their strategy and are now alleging that talcum powder is contaminated with asbestos, despite multiple independent, non-litigation-driven scientific evaluations which have found that our baby powder does not contain asbestos.      \\"Throughout this trial, we were prevented from presenting evidence we believe would have been important to the jury in their deliberations, which forced us to file multiple mistrial motions. We will continue to defend the safety of Johnson's Baby Powder and immediately begin our appeal, and we believe that once the full evidence is reviewed, this decision will be reversed.\\"      Gwen Myers, a spokeswoman for talc supplier Imerys, said in a statement last week, \\"Our hearts go out to those affected by all forms of cancer. We are disappointed by the jury's decision, but we remain confident that talc did not cause Mr. Lanzo's cancer. The evidence was clear that his asbestos exposure came from a different source such as the asbestos found in his childhood home or schools, and the jury's decision is inconsistent with a recently published study of workers who mined and milled talc all day over the course of more than 50 years that did not find a single case of mesothelioma.      Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.      \\"Imerys follows all FDA and other regulatory guidelines and utilizes rigorous testing to ensure that our talc meets the highest quality standards, and we are just as confident in the safety of our products as ever. We intend to appeal this decision and will continue to stand by the safety of our product.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and its talc supplier Imerys SA have been ordered by a New Jersey jury to pay 80 million in punitive damages and 37 million in compensatory damages.

You still awake?\\" Quiet. Jan pulled herself out of the bed and stood up, looking around the dark room for anything. She needed something, something that she could grab onto, and hold, hold until it hurt, hold until blood made racing red lines down her arms, until her hands were raw. She left the room and walked quietly into the now guest room that had been Rob's. Opening the closet, she found the teddy bear that Rob had once confided in and held it in her arms tight as she slumped down on the bed. A quiet sobbing rang through the house accompanied only by the chime of the grandfather clock in the living room every fifteen minutes. As Jan lay on the guest room bed she soon resorted to deep gasps, knowing that meager tears would never be forceful enough to express her worry to those that listened. \\"Just bring him home, bring him home, bring him home,\\" she mumbled over and over, each time changing the tone slightly in a desperate attempt to make her pleading sound more real. She could hear the occasional snore of her husband and she hated him for it. What kind of person could find sleep at a time like this? Why wasn't he awake worrying? Why wasn't he with her? Her thoughts became dark like blood, evil little monsters eating at her sanity. If her son was crazy and not just a drug addict she could see how easy it was to fall over the line. \\"Please God, please God, please God, please Rob, Please Rob, Please Rob, Please Rob.\\" Soon, a sleep came but it was peppered with demons.

Helen A:","output":"Title: The Curse of the Emerald Tiara Genre: Historical Fiction/Adventure/Drama Plot Summary: In ancient Troy, a mysterious visitor arrives with a gift and a secret that would shape the fate of the city. As King Priam welcomes Helen, a beautiful and enchanting woman, new alliances are formed and a legend is born. The Curse of the Emerald Tiara explores the trials and tribulations faced by the people of Troy, and the consequences brought about by a valuable artifact - the Emerald Tiara. Act 1: The story begins in the thriving city of Troy, where King Priam rules with wisdom and fairness. When Helen arrives from Sparta and is welcomed by Priam as a guest, the people of Troy are stunned by her beauty and grace. Helen's husband, King Menelaus of Sparta, had been distant and unloving, prompting her escape. Secretly, Helen brings with her the prized possession of Sparta, the Emerald Tiara - an enchanted artifact rumored to grant great power to its possessor. As the enchanting Helen captures the heart of Prince Paris, King Priam's son, love quickly blossoms between the two. Act 2: On discovering Helen's presence in Troy along with the stolen Tiara, a furious Menelaus demands her return and wages war against Troy. The Trojan War begins, and the Emerald Tiara takes center stage. As the fighting rages, King Priam becomes concerned about the tiara's influence on their city and the people. A prophecy is revealed that whoever holds the Emerald Tiara will experience great power but also unleash destructive bloodshed upon their kingdom. Cursed by the tiara, tensions rise within the city, with friendships strained and trust tested. King Priam grows increasingly desperate to restore peace while retaining the city's honor, but as his family begins to fragment, that peace seems ever more elusive. Act 3: As the battle escalates, the tiara's dark curse begins to take effect. Helen, who has grown to love the Trojans, chooses to return the Tiara in hopes of undoing its damage before it's too late. Paris, torn between his love for Helen and loyalty to his father, decides to embark on a perilous journey to Sparta to return the enchanted artifact. With the help of several brave warriors, Paris crosses enemy lines and delivers the Emerald Tiara back to Menelaus, allowing the curse to be lifted. However, the consequences of their actions can no longer be reversed. Paris says a heartfelt goodbye to Helen, who has chosen to remain in Sparta and face her responsibilities. Act 4: The Trojan War continues to rage, but the people of Troy have regained the strength of unity and purpose. Together, they face their enemies with courage, motivated by their love for their city and their King. As the war nears its end, King Priam summons Paris, honoring him for his bravery and selflessness, and reinstating him as heir to the throne. Conclusion: Though the Curse of the Emerald Tiara brought destruction and suffering to Troy, it also taught its people invaluable lessons about love, loyalty, and sacrifice. The film ends with a somber yet hopeful tone, as the Trojans rebuild their lives and city, stronger and more united than ever before. Through the legend of Helen, Paris, and the Emerald Tiara, the resilience and spirit of Troy will never be forgotten."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

From the moment we stepped inside, we were transported to a culinary paradise where every dish, every flavor, and every moment exceeded our expectations. The ambiance at Gourmet Haven was inviting and warm, with tastefully curated lighting that perfectly balanced the room's intimate setting. The beautiful decor, featuring a pleasant fusion of modern and vintage accents, instantly conveyed a sense of sophistication without being overly pretentious. As soon as we were seated, our knowledgeable and professional waiter, Tom, greeted us with a genuine smile. Throughout our entire evening, he was attentive and efficient without being intrusive. Tom's familiarity with each dish and his ability to gracefully articulate the menu's offerings made it incredibly easy for us to make our selections. We started our meal with a shared appetizer of truffled mushrooms with goat cheese crostini. The earthy, aromatic flavor of the truffle melded perfectly with the tangy, creamy goat cheese, resulting in a decadent and rich flavor sensation. As for the crostini, they were crisp and expertly prepared, providing just the right textural contrast. For our entrees, my husband opted for the pan-seared Chilean sea bass, while I decided on the grass-fed filet mignon. The sea bass was cooked to perfection - the delicate, flaky texture and buttery flavor was enhanced by a light, citrusy beurre blanc sauce that showcased the fish's freshness. My filet mignon was equally impressive, cooked exactly to the requested medium-rare. It was tender, juicy, and accompanied by a silky red wine reduction that perfectly accentuated the meat's inherent succulence. We also shared a side of garlic mashed potatoes, which were creamy, flavorful, and had just the right amount of garlic infused in them. I also appreciated that the portion size was generous without being overwhelming, allowing us to enjoy every last bite. To conclude our meal, we decided to indulge in the signature dessert - a delectable dark chocolate lava cake with vanilla bean ice cream. The warm, gooey lava cake was an absolutely divine combination of rich, velvety dark chocolate and a gooey center that practically melted in our mouths. The accompanying ice cream was the ideal complement, its creamy, natural vanilla flavor balancing the intensity of the chocolate. And, just when we thought our experience couldn't get any better, the restaurant surprised us with a complimentary glass of sparkling wine as we were celebrating our anniversary, adding an extra touch of thoughtfulness to our memorable evening. In conclusion, our dining experience at Gourmet Haven was an absolute delight from start to finish. The exquisite food, the impeccable service, and the enchanting atmosphere have earned this extraordinary establishment a well-deserved spot on our list of must-return restaurants.

Both sentences discuss the functioning of provisional councils, where they have started operating or acting as national governments for independent countries. In the first sentence, \\"The provisional councils had already begun to operate more or less as national governments of independent countries,\\" the verb \\"operate\\" is used to describe how these councils have been functioning. The phrase \\"more or less\\" emphasizes that they are not fully functioning as national governments but are close to it.

In the second sentence, \\"The provisional councils had already begun acting more or less as national governments of independent countries,\\" the verb \\"acting\\" is used instead of \\"operate.\\" This also conveys a sense that the councils are behaving or taking action in a manner that aligns with national governments, but not completely, as they are still only \\"more or less\\" functioning in that capacity. Though the two sentences use slightly different wording, both are expressing the idea that provisional councils have started to function in a manner that closely resembles national governments, even if they may not be fully there yet.

Options：  A. wilderness  B. encyclopedia  C. magazine  D. commercial  E. countryside Answer:","output":"B. Encyclopedia The most suitable option for looking up information about a sloth is an encyclopedia. Encyclopedias are comprehensive reference works that contain extensive and detailed information on a wide range of subjects, including animals like the sloth. They are designed to provide a reliable, authoritative source of knowledge for readers, with entries written by experts in their respective fields who curate and consolidate facts on various topics. An encyclopedia typically presents factual information in an organized, easily accessible manner, enabling readers to quickly find and understand the information they are looking for. In the context of researching a sloth, an encyclopedia would likely provide information on the animal's taxonomy, physiology, habitat, behavior, and ecological role, among other relevant details. Here are brief descriptions of the other options that are less suitable for looking up what a sloth is: A. Wilderness: This term refers to a natural environment that remains largely undisturbed by human intervention. While one might encounter a sloth in the wilderness, this option does not represent a collection of writings that provide information on the sloth. C. Magazine: Magazines are periodicals that typically focus on a specific subject or theme. They contain articles, essays, and illustrations created by various authors and designers. While it's possible that a magazine might feature an article about sloths, the overall scope of a magazine is not likely to be comprehensive or authoritative enough to provide the depth of information required to thoroughly understand what a sloth is. D. Commercial: This term generally refers to a profit-oriented business activity or an advertisement promoting a product or service. A commercial does not represent a collection of writings and is not an appropriate source for looking up information about a sloth. E. Countryside: This term refers to rural or undeveloped areas outside of cities and towns, typically characterized by natural landscapes and agricultural land. While sloths might inhabit some countryside regions, this option does not represent a collection of writings that provide information on the sloth. In conclusion, the best source for researching information about a sloth is an encyclopedia. Unlike other options, an encyclopedia is designed to provide a reliable, comprehensive, and easily accessible source of information on a wide range of subjects, including animals like the sloth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Model Alexandra Sereda Brutally Assaulted by Boyfriend After Ending their Relationship Subheading: Pavel Ushanov Attack Leaves Model Alexandra Sereda Bruised and Battered **Article Body:** In a tragic turn of events, 27-year-old model Alexandra Sereda was brutally assaulted by her 33-year-old boyfriend, Pavel Ushanov, after she voiced her desire to end their two-year-long relationship. The shocking incident took place in her apartment, leaving Sereda with numerous injuries and deep emotional scars. The young model and Ushanov had reportedly been dating for two years when she decided to put an end to their relationship. Assertions suggest that out of blind rage and malice, Ushanov resorted to physical violence, blatantly ignoring his now ex-girlfriend's personal choice and autonomy. Sereda's terrifying ordeal allegedly involved her being constantly beaten for ten grueling minutes. Ushanov reportedly did not hold back in venting out his anger, as he relentlessly kicked and punched his former partner. The model was left with visible bruises, cuts, and marks from the brutal beating that took place in the supposed safety of her own home. In a stroke of courage and determination, Sereda managed to find an opportunity to escape the wrath of her attacker. Despite her injuries and overwhelming fear, the model made a run for safety after finally being able to open the door to her apartment. Swiftly, she fled from the scene and sought immediate help. After the attack, authorities stepped in to address the alarming situation and apprehend Ushanov for his heinous actions. As the story of Sereda's assault unfolds, her strength and determination to come out of the situation alive is garnering praise and admiration. This unfortunate incident sheds light on the pervasive issue of domestic violence affecting countless individuals worldwide. In relationships, any expression of aggression and violence – whether physical, verbal, or emotional – is not only unacceptable but also criminal. Moreover, this attack serves as a reminder that both men and women in our society need to recognize the importance of respecting personal boundaries and decisions, especially when it comes to ending relationships. Nobody should ever have to suffer or endure physical harm for asserting their personal choices or leaving a toxic relationship. As more details come to the fore about Sereda's traumatic experience, it is essential to offer her support and emotional healing as she steadily recovers from the physical and emotional repercussions of the harrowing incident. Furthermore, it is crucial to foster a culture that condemns violence and promotes healthy, consensual relationships to prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? better characters , some genuine quirkiness and","output":"The phrase \\"better characters, some genuine quirkiness\\" can be considered as having a positive connotation. Let's break down the phrase and analyze its components to better understand this perspective. 1. \\"Better characters\\": This part implies that the characters being referred to are an improvement in comparison to another set or group of characters. The word \\"better\\" suggests a positive change or enhancement in the quality or depth of the characters. In the context of literature, film, or television show, this can be highly appreciated, as people tend to be drawn towards well-developed, complex, and realistic characters. The indication of character improvement is, therefore, a positive element in this phrase. 2. \\"Some genuine quirkiness\\": The word \\"quirkiness\\" refers to peculiar or unconventional traits, adding uniqueness to individuals, situations, or occurrences. In this phrase, the term \\"genuine\\" emphasizes a sense of authenticity, implying that the quirkiness is not forced or artificial. In various forms of art or entertainment, audiences typically appreciate authenticity and originality. When something is described as having \\"some genuine quirkiness,\\" it implies that it possesses a certain level of uniqueness that sets it apart from others and makes it memorable and appealing. This aspect also contributes positively to the overall perception of the phrase. It is essential to note that, like many phrases, the interpretation may change depending on the context in which the phrase is used.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The New York Times announced Wednesday that it intended to charge frequent readers for access to its website, a step being debated across the industry that nearly every major newspaper has so far feared to take. Starting in early 2011, visitors to NYTimes.com will get a certain number of articles free every month before being asked to pay a standard and fixed fee for unlimited access. Subscribers to the newspaper's print edition will receive full access to the site. But executives of The New York Times Company said they could not yet answer fundamental questions about the plan, like how much it would cost or what the limit would be on free reading. They stressed that the amount of free access could change with time, in response to economic conditions and reader demand. Still, publishers fear that money from digital subscriptions would not make up for the resulting loss of audience and advertising income. NYTimes.com is by far the most popular newspaper site in the country, with more than 17 million readers a month in the United States, according to Nielsen Online, and analysts say it is the leader in advertising income, as well. That may make it better positioned than other general-interest papers to charge--and also gives The Times more to lose if the move produces an opposed result. The Times Company has been studying the matter for almost a year, searching for common ground between pro-and-anti pay campaigns--a debate mirrored in dozens of media-watching blogs-- and the system will not go into effect until January 2011. Executives said they were not bothered by the possibility of absorbing barbs  for moving cautiously. \\"There's no prize for getting it quick,\\" said Janet L. Robinson, the company's president and chief executive. \\"There's more of a prize for getting it right.\\" Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?

Please answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Development of the Vertebral Column and Thoracic cage Development of the vertebrae begins with the accumulation of mesenchyme cells from each sclerotome around the notochord. These cells differentiate into a hyaline cartilage model for each vertebra, which then grow and eventually ossify into bone through the process of endochondral ossification. As the developing vertebrae grow, the notochord largely disappears. However, small areas of notochord tissue persist between the adjacent vertebrae and this contributes to the formation of each intervertebral disc. The ribs and sternum also develop from mesenchyme. The ribs initially develop as part of the cartilage model for each vertebra, but in the thorax region, the rib portion separates from the vertebra by the eighth week. The cartilage model of the rib then ossifies, except for the anterior portion, which remains as the costal cartilage. The sternum initially forms as paired hyaline cartilage models on either side of the anterior midline, beginning during the fifth week of development. The cartilage models of the ribs become attached to the lateral sides of the developing sternum. Eventually, the two halves of the cartilaginous sternum fuse together along the midline and then ossify into bone. The manubrium and body of the sternum are converted into bone first, with the xiphoid process remaining as cartilage until late in life.   Q: The accumulation of what cells begin the development of the vertebral column and thoracic cage?

He denies any wrongdoing and says the accusations are politically motivated. \\"I am sad,\\" Lula said in New York. \\"It is a big farce, a big lie, a big pyrotechnic show. \\"What's happening isn't getting me down, but just motivates me to go out and talk more.\\" Judge Sergio Moro, who is overseeing Operation Car Wash, the investigation into corruption allegations at Petrobras, said there was \\"sufficient evidence of [Lula's] responsibility\\". The money that the ex-president allegedly received was laundered through the purchase and renovation of a beach apartment, prosecutors say. The flat was built by a construction company implicated in the scandal. His wife, Marisa Leticia, and six others have also been indicted. Lula was accused by prosecutors of being the \\"boss\\" of the scheme, estimated to have cost the company more than 2bn (Â£1.5bn). Several politicians and Petrobras executives have been arrested and sentenced as a result of the two-year inquiry. Investigators believe overpriced contracts with Petrobras were given in return for bribes. Some of the illicitly-obtained money was used to finance the electoral campaign of top Brazilian politicians, they allege.

In that same interview, Cudi said that while he believes in God, he considers himself spiritual but not religious.

Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Color is very important in our daily life. It can influence our choice of purchase when we go shopping and can also affect the way we look and feel. A person can be naturally attracted to one particular color1 while finding another color1 repulsive. The influence of color1 on human emotions and feelings is very powerful and designers, advertisers, artists and even doctors use  _ in their professions for different purposes. Every day, without even thinking about it, we use color1 to communicate our feelings. For example, the color1 we choose to wear is one way of expressing ourselves. It says something about the person, how he or she feels, and how he or she wants others to feel about the wearer. In other words, color1 talks. A person who wants to appear stylish and mature will usually wear dark color1s or black. A person who wishes to appear youngish, pure and innocent dresses in white, like the choice of a bride's wedding gown. Also clothed in white are doctors, dentists, nurses and hospital in-patients as the color1 expresses comfort, cleanliness and professionalism. Brown, blue or grey clothes are the usual color1s worn by office workers so as not to draw unnecessary attention to them. They are, in a way, conveying the message that they want to be noticed for their work, not their appearance. People who wear bright, strong color1s like to be attractive and these color1s are particularly popular with actresses, singers and party goers. In the past, common people were not allowed to wear certain color1s. In Thailand, for example, only kings, queens and members of the royal family could wear purple while in ancient China, yellow was the color1 reserved for the emperor and the empress. Nowadays, people can wear whatever color1 they like or as they think appropriate. Question: If a girl chooses to wear a red dress to a party, it implies that she wants to   _  .

Given the question: The U.S. State Department has asked American embassies and consulates around the world to identify certain groups that should get extra scrutiny when they apply for visas. A series of directives also instructs U.S. diplomatic posts overseas to review the social media accounts of visa applicants who are suspected of terrorist ties or of having been in Islamic State group-controlled areas. The diplomatic cables sent by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson directed embassies to convene security and intelligence working groups to determine criteria for \\"population sets\\" that would warrant increased scrutiny before traveling to the U.S. Even if the applicant otherwise qualifies for a visa, those identified as meeting the criteria would require additional scrutiny, leading to a possible visa denial. It is the first evidence of a plan for the \\"extreme vetting\\" of foreigners entering the United States that President Donald Trump promised during his campaign. The four cables sent between March 10 and March 17 do not define which groups would be considered among the \\"population sets\\" requiring more scrutiny. But in the first glimpse into what \\"extreme vetting\\" may look like under the Trump administration, one of Tillerson's memos would have added to the interview process questions about an applicant's workplaces, employers, addresses and travel history going back 15 years, as well as all email addresses and social media handles used in the last five years. The questions were withdrawn in a following memo, pending approval of the list by another federal agency. The directives, first reported by Reuters, quickly drew criticism from rights groups and others who've accused Trump of discriminating against Muslims through his now-suspended ban on travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \\"These measures could provide license for discrimination based on national origin and religion,'' human rights group Amnesty International wrote in a letter to Tillerson on Thursday. \\"They...

Mark Duell and Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 07:39 EST, 30 September 2012. |. UPDATED:. 19:24 EST, 30 September 2012. Early morning sunlight streams through the trees and caresses the ivy-clad cottage they surround. This sight is a timely reassurance that, while the days may be getting colder,  autumn’s spectacular show of colour can enchant our senses and warm our hearts. Cloaked in shades of red, gold and green, the Tu Hwnt i’r Bont tearooms in Conwy, North Wales, this weekend seemed to become part of its surrounding countryside, the structure only given away by the white of its windows. The 15th century cottage is transformed at this time of year by its coat, a massive Virginia creeper, changing from deep green to copper red. Beautiful scene: A spectacular autumn view as October approaches, with the low morning sun's golden rays highlighting the rainbow of colours starting to break through in the Conwy Valley in North Wales. Formerly a courthouse which served the. nearby market town of Llanrwst, the cottage, known locally as ‘the red. house’, was taken over in the 1930s by two elderly ladies who made money. by inviting locals around for evenings of musical entertainment. It is now owned by the National Trust. and leased by Tim Maddox, a former Londoner who escaped the city a. decade ago to run the tearooms and enjoy a slower pace of life with his. wife and three children. The building sits on the edge of the. Snowdonia national park, alongside an Inigo Jones bridge which straddles. the rushing River Conwy. Mr Maddox, 47, who used to work in publishing,. said: ‘It’s unbelievably picturesque. The trees, the hills and the. mountains are just breathtaking. The drive as you approach is fantastic. 'The view changes every day. The colours, the trees. I have to remind. myself not to take it for granted.’ Autumn brilliance: The Tu Hwnt i'r Bont tearooms is a quaint 15th century cottage on the west bank of the River Conwy, and the historic building is a very popular attraction for tourists at this time of year. It’s hard to imagine that just three. weeks ago many of us were bathing in sunshine and 85F heat - but at. least some areas were still looking beautiful this weekend, ahead of the. start of October. Rain and. gale force winds are set to batter Britain this week as the miserable. autumn shows no signs of improvement, after a month that saw parts of. England experience a 50 per cent rise in rainfall. Flood warnings are. already in place for today and more may follow as rain falls on already. soaking ground. Met Office forecaster Helen Waite said: ‘Northern England had an average of one and half times its monthly rainfall - and temperatures across the country were about half a degree below average.’ However she added that last month’s rainfall across the country was average thanks to the dry and sunny start. Meanwhile, there is more wet weather to come as we enter October tomorrow. Ms Waite said: ‘It’s still quite unsettled and there is a band of rain moving south through the day (Sunday). It’s also very windy, and there are some gales around the coast and the hills. ‘On Monday there will be scattered showers, most persistent in the North-West and perhaps quite heavy at times. It’s still quite blustery and it’s still looking unsettled.’ Leafing summer behind: The first signs of autumn are evident in Pollok Park in Glasgow. Sunshine: A couple make the most of the sunshine along Tynemouth beach, North Tyneside, as the sun rises after a week of bad weather. Life's a beach: A man walks his dog along Tynemouth beach after a week of terrible weather in the north east. It comes after seven kittens, three. cats and four chickens were rescued by the Royal Society for the. Prevention of Cruelty to Animals on Friday from a property that was. marooned due to flooding. The. welfare charity’s chief inspector Mark Gent offered to help after. hearing the animals’ owner could not get back to their home near. Stillingfleet, North Yorkshire, because of the high water. Mr. Gent travelled along a badly-flooded stretch of road to the house,. where he safely recovered the animals, which included five two-week old. kittens and two nine-week old kittens. Helping hand: Seven kittens, three cats and four chickens were rescued by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals on Friday from a property that was marooned due to flooding. Saved: The welfare charity's chief inspector Mark Gent offered to help after hearing the animals' owner could not get back to their home near Stillingfleet, North Yorkshire, because of the high water. Meanwhile on Tuesday another band of. rain will arrive in the UK, which could cause problems on top of the wet. weather already seen in some parts. There will also be strong winds on. the western coast. More. scattered showers are forecast for Wednesday, but there could be some. sunny spells and it may be a little less windy. Thursday and Friday are. expected to be reasonably pleasant but crisp. ‘Temperatures. are set to be slightly below average during the day with perhaps some. frost at night, which is not unusual for October,’ Ms Waite added. Taken to safety: The RSPCA travelled along a badly-flooded stretch of road to the house, where they safely recovered the animals, which included five two-week old kittens and two nine-week old kittens. Cat eyes: The owner of these animals was much happier after they were rescued in North Yorkshire.

Article: Today, when there are many top graduates looking for top jobs, graduates can differentiate  themselves by obtaining a double major or even a double degree. Increasingly, employers are looking for individuals who are not only competent and intelligent, but who have different skill sets and who are knowledgeable in many areas. Part of the appeal to employers is that your extra work demonstrates a willingness to take on difficult tasks. Additionally, if your majors overlap  , you are able to show potential employers that you have both _ and depth of knowledge. By studying for a double major, although you will be studying for only one degree, you will be focusing on two related and integrated subjects that complement   each other. Classes overlap between the majors, meaning fewer classes are required than with a double degree, so it is easier to finish within four years. In contrast, with the more rigorous   double degree, you will be studying for two different degrees in two completely different areas of study. Although pursuing such a course    of study allows students to complete two wholly separate degrees in less time than if they  were to earn them separately, many strong students still find it incredibly difficult to complete in four or five years. If you are committed to a double major/degree, it is wise to do a little bit of planning. Some students try to find two courses of studies that are related, while others seek to round out their academic studies by choosing two completely unrelated fields. For double majors, common pairings include: (i) economics and a foreign language; (ii) political science or government and journalism; (iii) economics and psychology. For double degrees, common pairings include: (i) engineering and a business program such as finance or accounting; (ii) engineering and economics. Question: Which statement is CORRECT according to the passage? Options: A: Economics is a major while engineering is a degree. B: Every college student should take a double major or degree.

And the answer is?","output":"The actress you are referring to is Mackenzie Phillips, who played Julie Horvath on the TV sitcom \\"One Day at a Time.\\" Mackenzie Phillips recently revealed that she had a 10+ year long consensual relationship with her father, John Phillips. Mackenzie Phillips, born November 10, 1959, is the daughter of John Phillips, a musician and member of the 1960s folk-pop band The Mamas & the Papas, and Susan Adams, a former model. Mackenzie started her acting career at a young age, and \\"One Day at a Time\\" brought her considerable fame during the 1970s and 1980s. In her 2009 memoir titled \\"High on Arrival,\\" Mackenzie Phillips courageously shared her difficult personal history, including her struggles with drug addiction and her incestuous relationship with her father. According to Mackenzie, the relationship began when she was 19 years old and continued on and off for over a decade. The relationship was not only consensual but also appears to have been fueled in part by their shared drug addiction. Mackenzie had been in and out of rehab multiple times and was eventually fired from \\"One Day at a Time\\" due to her addiction issues. Mackenzie Phillips' revelations about her relationship with her father stirred up substantial controversy and shock. Several members of her family, including her half-siblings, were divided on the truth of her claims, and her story elicited strong emotions and disbelief from the public. Some people applauded her bravery for coming forward, while others criticized her for airing such private information. Regardless, Mackenzie's story serves as an example of the importance of speaking the truth about taboo subjects, shedding light on the complexity of family relationships, and the particular challenges facing children of celebrities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Due to his erratic driving, Dave determines Elrod is driving his Lamborghini drunk and sets to arrest him. Elrod, objecting to being sent to jail tells Dave of a decayed corpse that he and Kelly had found up in the swamp.When Dave goes to investigate he remembers a murder he had witnessed as a teenager where a chained prisoner was shot in the swamp and disappeared into the bog. The discovery opens a string of events that ties to several murders in that area that had occurred recently mostly to young runaways and prostitutes. The clues seem to point to a former friend of Dave's, Julius \\"Baby Feet\\" Balboni (John Goodman) whose ties with the mafia had caused the two to drift apart and become strained enemies. Julius denies knowing the prostitute whose murder is being investigated. However his story does not corroborate, leading Dave to suspect more to the story.Meanwhile, the discovery of a second body prompts the FBI to become involved in the case, and Dave is partnered with an agent called Rosie Gomez (Justina Machado) whose insight into the case gains Dave's respect and the pair team up to solve the case.

By Meghan Keneally President Obama has paid tribute to President Kennedy at the Medal of Freedom ceremony today as he presented awards to former President Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, country singer Loretta Lynn and newspaper editor Ben Bradlee. In his opening remarks, Obama highlighted the slain President’s sister-in-law Ethel Kennedy, calling her ‘one of my favorite people’ in a room full of dignitaries. He went on to also give President Kennedy’s grandson Jack a shout out by praising his basketball skills. Aside from the fact that the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy’s assassination comes this Friday, the Democrat was mentioned because he was the one to establish the Medal of Freedom initiative which is the highest civilian honor in the country. A tell-all book about the 2012 election revealed that Obama reportedly told aides that he could only take OPTIONS: - Ben Bradlee ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Bill Clinton ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Chelsea ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Democrat ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Ethel Kennedy ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Hillary ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Huma Abedin ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Jack ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Kennedy ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Loretta Lynn ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Medal of Freedom ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Medal of Freedom award ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Meghan Keneally ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Obama ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Oprah Winfrey ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - Richard Lugar ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. - White House ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program.","output":"Bill Clinton ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program. This ending highlights the relationship between Obama and Clinton that was portrayed in the tell-all book about the 2012 election. Despite their political alliance and common party affiliation, the two leaders occasionally had their differences, which is not uncommon in the world of politics. The sentence illustrates that Obama reportedly found it challenging to be in the company of Clinton for extended periods, and by publicly criticizing Obama's handling of the national health insurance program rollout, Clinton appeared to reciprocate the sentiment. Such disagreements between prominent political figures demonstrate that, although they may belong to the same party and share common goals, their opinions and approaches can differ significantly. The discussion of these disagreements in a tell-all book serves to shed light on the behind-the-scenes relationships and tensions within the world of politics, and offer a more complete understanding of the decision-making process. As shown in this case, the relationship between Obama and Clinton was not without its challenges, but they still managed to work together on various issues in order to advance their shared political goals. In conclusion, the sentence demonstrates the complex relationships and occasional disagreements that can exist between political leaders, even within the same party. The public discourse and reported difficulties between Obama and Clinton, as well as Clinton's criticism of the national health insurance program rollout, show that their working relationship encompassed both cooperation and conflict. These nuances are essential for understanding the dynamics within the political sphere and gaining a deeper insight into the motivations and approaches of influential figures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He is one of four sons of Anna Pearl (nee Hite), a maid, and William Henry Cosby Sr., who served as a mess steward in the U.S. Navy. During much of Cosby's early childhood, his father was away from home in Navy service and especially during WWII. As a student, he described himself as a class clown. Context: Cosby left Temple to pursue a career in comedy. He lined up standup jobs at clubs in Philadelphia and then in New York City, where he appeared at The Gaslight Cafe beginning in 1961. He booked dates in cities such as Chicago, Las Vegas, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. In the summer of 1963, he received national exposure on NBC's The Tonight Show. This led to a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records, who, in 1964, released his debut LP Bill Cosby Is a Very Funny Fellow...Right!, the first of a series of comedy albums. His album To Russell, My Brother, Whom I Slept With was number 1 on Spin Magazines list of \\"The 40 Greatest Comedy Albums of All Time\\", calling it \\"stand-up comedy's masterpiece\\".  While many comics of the time were using the growing freedom of that decade to explore material that was controversial and sometimes risque, Cosby was making his reputation with humorous recollections of his childhood. Many Americans wondered about the absence of race as a topic in Cosby's stories. As Cosby's success grew he had to defend his choice of material regularly; as he argued, \\"A white person listens to my act and he laughs and he thinks, 'Yeah, that's the way I see it too.' Okay. He's white. I'm Negro. And we both see things the same way. That must mean that we are alike. Right? So I figure this way I'm doing as much for good race relations as the next guy.\\"  In 1983, he released the concert film Bill Cosby: Himself; it is widely regarded as \\"the greatest comedy concert film ever\\". Younger, well-established comics like Jerry Seinfeld have credited Cosby as an innovator both as a practitioner of the genre of standup comedy, as well as a person who paved the way for comics to break into sitcom television. Seinfeld said of Cosby: \\"He opened a door for all of us, for all of the networks to even consider that this was a way to create a character, was to take someone who can hold an audience just by being up there and telling their story. He created that. He created the whole idea of taking a quote-unquote 'comic' and developing a TV show just from a persona that you see on stage.\\" Comedian Larry Wilmore also saw a connection between Bill Cosby: Himself and the later success of The Cosby Show, saying: \\"It's clear that the concert is the template for The Cosby Show.\\"  Cosby performed his first TV standup special in 30 years, \\"Bill Cosby: Far From Finished\\", on Comedy Central on November 23, 2013. Cosby's last show of the \\"Far From Finished\\" tour was performed at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre in Atlanta, Georgia on May 2, 2015.  In 2014, Cosby was set to release his new standup special Bill Cosby 77 on Netflix. The release of the film was canceled due to allegations of sexual assault. Question: Did he perform on tv?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Bill Cosby performed on TV.

News article: What Does the Nobel Peace Prize Mean for Obama? Deputy assistant to President George W. Bush and deputy press secretary from September 2006 to January 2009 Well, those Norwegians were up to their tricks again this morning. Just when you forgot that they were up there, what with autumnal darkness descending on the northern region, they send up a flair to announce their presence by awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to a U.S. president who, while espousing \\"hope\\" for peace, has demonstrated little in the acquiring of \\"actual\\" peace. As if to inconveniently punctuate the silliness, NASA today bombed the moon. In the president's defense, he's had precious little time for actual achievement, being barely nine months into his term. But never mind that. The Nobel committee was fairly explicit that Obama's hope of achieving peace was all that was required, presumably making countless Miss Universe contestants equally eligible. Oh, they mentioned plans for nuclear weapons reductions as well, but of course the smart people would have quickly noted that President George W. Bush reduced stockpiles by nearly 4000 weapons from 6000, making new reductions of a few hundred relatively inconsequential. No, as with all things Obama, it's far better to bet on a hopeful vision than to wait around for what are inevitably becoming disappointing results. Here's the irony: in the Nobel committee's over-reach, rather than honor the U.S. president, they've instead awarded an albatross around his neck and opened him up to mockery. As an American, I'm happy for the president's recognition, but my hope is that over time his record shows him to be deserving -- not for his hopeful quest, but for actual achievement. Democratic member of Congress from Maryland When the Nobel committee announced President Obama as the Peace Prize recipient, thus began the sarcasm, second-guessing and chatter. Some opined that selecting President Obama is either a repudiation of our former president or premature for this one. Perhaps it is neither. Perhaps the international community is reaffirming our promise as practitioners of peace and diplomacy and protectors of human rights? Perhaps the Nobel committee sees the work undone and acknowledges at once both our imperfection and our desire to keep working? Obama has spoken with clarity about the quest for nuclear nonproliferation, dialogue and engagement in the Middle East, the aspirations of women in the Arab world, and the alleviation of disease and hunger in Africa and in this hemisphere. He began the difficult task of turning words into action for peace and justice, artfully balancing grit and diplomacy with Iran, North Korea, and in the Sudan. Our president is being recognized as a peacemaker and an inspiration for millions around the globe. But, this honor for the president is not just about the individual. We chose Obama as our face, our handshake extended to the world. In this peace prize, the world is expressing its gratitude for peace to come. Democratic strategist and senior fellow at New York University's Wagner School of Public Service Obama's winning the Nobel less than a year into his term shows how much the world values and welcomes affirmative and inspiring leadership from the president of the United States. On my plane Friday leaving Frankfurt for the Middle East, passengers were congratulating me as an American for this tribute to Obama -- and his proof that we are once again the America they hope for. All of us should take heart and pride from this. Despite the jeers about the Nobel from those who cheered our loss of the Olympics, what the prize represents is a powerful asset in the arsenal of our democracy. The way FDR, JFK and Ronald Reagan enlarged and conveyed the idea of America strengthened our influence and ideals around the globe, both while they were in office and long afterwards. In Obama, we have a president who commands such heights, not one who is disdained or despised -- and we are better for it. This was an extraordinary moment in a young presidency of high purpose that is renewing our country's international standing. But this is also a hard and unrelenting time, and Obama will have to re-earn his Nobel Prize everyday -- from North Korea to Iran and Iraq, and, in the coming weeks especially, Afghanistan. The prize doesn't tell him what decisions to make; it does tell us that we have a president with a new chance to lead in the world instead of going it alone. This Nobel is not premature; it comes at just the right time. Instead of simply witnessing history already made, it can help Obama bend history in the direction of our best hopes. Secretary of labor from 1993 to 1997; professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley President Obama's only real diplomatic accomplishment so far has been to change the direction and tone of American foreign policy from unilateral bullying to multilateral listening and cooperating. That's important, to be sure, but it's not nearly enough. Had the world not suffered eight years of George W. Bush, Obama would not have won the prize at this early stage of his presidency. I'd rather he had won it after Congress agreed to substantial cuts in greenhouse gases comparable to what Europe is proposing, after he brought Palestinians and Israelis together to accept a two-state solution, after he got the United States out of Afghanistan and reduced the nuclear arms threat between Pakistan and India, or after he was well on the way to eliminating the world's stockpile of nuclear weapons. Perhaps the Nobel committee can give him only half the prize now and withhold the other half until he accomplishes one or more of these crucial missions. Speechwriter to Vice President Dan Quayle; contributor to National Review Online's \\"The Corner\\" blog After the incredulity and snickering at a Nobel Prize for significant achievement in international affairs going to a promulgator of vaporous \\"hope,\\" with no foreign policy accomplishments, at time of multiple crises, the White House must respond delicately. Unfortunately, this is another instance for Obama of excessive reward for mere potential. He should be offended. Even the worst frauds on the past recipient list had to work a lot harder for their prizes. So aides owe the president a dose of reality. Otherwise, the prize may exacerbate his vanity and narcissism, which are his most visible flaws, and inflate his cult of personality, which won't create jobs or end wars. One hopes our president understands that the award is a bribe to continue apologizing for America, going soft on rogue nations and despots with nuclear goals, and backing away from the non-peaceful challenges of Afghanistan and Islamic extremism. If not, he'll learn when Americans next vote. The moment requires a nuanced, non-political performance. Obama must be able to convey genuine modesty. If that isn't in his repertoire, handlers should hire the best Broadway acting coach they can get. Oh, and donate the million bucks to a soup kitchen -- times being not so hopeful here at home. Every American has to be proud that President Obama has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. And there is, of course, an enormous amount that the president has done to end the United States' estrangement from the world community. But that being said, the prize was necessarily awarded more for what Obama has said he wants to accomplish than for any concrete achievements. Moreover, many of the tough decisions the president faces going forward involve the possible use of force -- in Afghanistan imminently, as well as potentially in Iran and even in North Korea if circumstances should require a change in approach in both regions. The most immediate impact of the prize is that it will burnish the president's image and stature, which have both been somewhat tarnished given the intractable challenges he is facing at home and abroad. The hope has to be that the president's enhanced image will make it easier to negotiate constructive settlements to ongoing conflicts as well as to begin to put in place a process to settle the Arab-Israeli conflict. At the same time, the president must remain resolute in his pursuit of America's interests around the world. That the Nobel Committee called Obama \\"the world's leading spokesman for its agenda\\" should not in any way obscure the fact that the president, no doubt, will have to make some very challenging decisions involving U.S. troops and the possible use of force in the weeks and months to come. White House staffer to Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush; chairman of BGR Group I'm trying to be proud that my president has won the Nobel Peace Prize. But I have no idea what his accomplishment could be that deserves this or any other award. Shouldn't there be some positive contribution toward peace in a place where there is conflict? I think we should all be more embarrassed than proud. I assume Obama did not apply, but surely he could have quietly told the committee, \\"thanks, but no thanks\\" prior to a public announcement. But, if Ed McMahon just shows up at your door with balloons and the Nobel Prize, what are you supposed to do? Say no? I don't think the Nobel committee has done Obama any favors. Americans will see this as contrived and undeserved. It will breed resentment, and, for the first time, Obama may face every politicians' worst nightmare: ridicule.

(ii) woman was many years older.","output":"The man chose to retire before the woman did although the woman was many years older. This situation might raise some eyebrows or seem counterintuitive at first glance, but upon further examination, several factors could have contributed to this choice. Firstly, individual preferences differ when it comes to retirement age. The man may have had personal reasons for deciding to retire early, despite being younger than the woman. For instance, he might have been experiencing health issues or stress from work that prompted him to reevaluate his priorities and choose early retirement. Secondly, financial circumstances could have played a significant role. The man might have been more successful in his career than the woman, accumulating enough savings and investments that allowed him to retire comfortably while still being able to fulfill his financial obligations. On the other hand, the woman could have started her career or managed her finances later in life, or perhaps she had additional family responsibilities that required her to continue to work and contribute to the household for a longer period. Thirdly, career progression opportunities could also be a factor. The woman, despite being older, may still have felt professionally fulfilled and motivated to continue working, perhaps because of a recent promotion, an engaging work environment, or the opportunity to take on new challenges at her job. Meanwhile, the man may have felt like he had achieved all he could professionally or that he was not as satisfied with his career trajectory, which contributed to his decision to retire. It's important to consider gender dynamics as well. In some societies and professions, there may be more pressure on men to work and provide for the household, which could lead to earlier burnout and the desire to retire once financial independence is achieved. Women, on the other hand, might have faced other types of work-life challenges, including potential interruptions to their careers due to family and childcare responsibilities. In such cases, the woman may choose to continue working in order to make up for the lost time or capitalize on later-career opportunities. Lastly, personal ambitions and life goals could have influenced their decision. Perhaps the man was determined to retire early to embark on a new venture, such as starting his own business or pursuing an interest in a creative, philanthropic, or intellectual capacity outside his typical job setting. The woman, on the other hand, might have derived a strong sense of identity and purpose from her career, which led her to remain actively involved in her work even as she aged. In conclusion, the man's decision to retire before the woman, despite her being older, could be a result of a multitude of factors, including individual preferences, financial circumstances, career progression opportunities, gender dynamics, and personal ambitions. It's crucial to remember that everyone's life journey is unique, and what might be suitable for one person may not necessarily be the right fit for another."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

At the suburban home, Betty sold cosmetics to Christine because","output":"Christine, a dedicated homemaker, was always on the lookout for high-quality products that could elevate her self-care routine and enhance her natural beauty. Despite their vastly different lifestyles, Christine cherished the bond she shared with Betty, a career-driven woman who found solace in sharing her favorite beauty secrets with others. Over the years, the two women developed a mutual understanding and respect for one another. This made their connection even more meaningful, as it transcended the simple exchange of beauty products, evolving into a heartwarming friendship that filled their lives with joy, laughter, and endless conversations about the transformative power of self-care. Each time Betty arrived at Christine's home with her dazzling assortment of cosmetics, she felt a spark of excitement knowing that she was helping her friend unleash her inner confidence, achieve her desired look, and feel truly at peace with herself. Christine, on the other hand, eagerly anticipated these moments and welcomed Betty with a beaming smile, her eyes instantly gravitating towards the new products displayed in Betty's sleek black case. Upon examining the carefully selected items, Christine was consistently impressed by the range of innovative formulas, nourishing ingredients, and sophisticated packaging that Betty's cosmetic brand had to offer. From velvety foundations that melted seamlessly into her skin to vibrant lipsticks that added a touch of elegance to any ensemble, these cosmetics provided Christine with the tools she needed to craft a personal beauty routine that harmonized with her delicate features and enchanting personality. As the two women sat together surrounded by the warm glow of afternoon sunlight, they would meticulously swatch and discuss each product, comparing its appearance on their skin and sharing expert tips for maximizing their performance. In these moments, time seemed to slow down, and the world beyond the gentle hum of Christine's suburban home became a distant memory. As their bond deepened, Betty and Christine began to appreciate not only the power of cosmetics but also the strength of their friendship.

Q:Information:  - The early - mid - 1990s English band Submarine followed in the footsteps of many of its contemporaries , including The Flaming Lips , Mercury Rev , Boo Radleys and My Bloody Valentine with its own vision of noise pop , before morphing into Jetboy DC , which continues sporadically to this day .  - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - Jonathan Daniel Donahue (born May 6, 1966 in Kingston, New York) is an American rock musician. He has been an integral member of two of North America's more influential indie/experimental bands of the 1990s; The Flaming Lips and Mercury Rev.  - Psychedelic rock is a style of rock music that is inspired or influenced by psychedelic culture and attempts to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD. It may use novelty recording techniques, electronic instruments or effects, and sometimes draws on sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music.  - The Flaming Lips are an American rock band formed in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in 1983. Instrumentally, their sound contains lush, multi-layered, psychedelic rock arrangements, but lyrically their compositions show elements of space rock, including unusual song and album titlessuch as \\"What Is the Light? (An Untested Hypothesis Suggesting That the Chemical [In Our Brains] by Which We Are Able to Experience the Sensation of Being in Love Is the Same Chemical That Caused the \\"Big Bang\\" That Was the Birth of the Accelerating Universe)\\". They are also acclaimed for their elaborate live shows, which feature costumes, balloons, puppets, video projections, complex stage light configurations, giant hands, large amounts of confetti, and frontman Wayne Coyne's signature man-sized plastic bubble, in which he traverses the audience. In 2002, \\"Q magazine\\" named the Flaming Lips one of the \\"50 Bands to See Before You Die.\\"  - Mercury Rev is an American indie rock band formed in 1989 in Buffalo, New York. Original personnel were David Baker (vocals), Jonathan Donahue (vocals, guitars), Sean Mackowiak, a.k.a. \\"Grasshopper\\" (guitars, clarinet), Suzanne Thorpe (flute), Dave Fridmann (bass) and Jimy Chambers (drums).  - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.  - In music, an arrangement is a musical reconceptualization of a previously composed work. It may differ from the original work by means of reharmonization, melodic paraphrasing, orchestration, or development of the formal structure. Arranging differs from orchestration in that the latter process is limited to the assignment of notes to instruments for performance by an orchestra, concert band, or other musical ensemble. Arranging \\"involves adding compositional techniques, such as new thematic material for introductions, transitions, or modulations, and endings... Arranging is the art of giving an existing melody musical variety\\".  - Buffalo is a city in western New York state and the county seat of Erie County, on the eastern shores of Lake Erie at the head of the Niagara River. , Buffalo is New York state's 2nd-most populous city after New York City, with 258,703 residents. The metropolitan area has a population of 1.13 million.  - Noise rock is a style of experimental rock rooted in noise music. The genre, which gained prominence in the 1980s, makes use of the traditional instrumentation and iconography of rock music, but incorporates atonality and especially dissonance, and frequently discards typical songwriting conventions. Noise rock developed from early avant-garde music, sound art, and rock songs featuring extremely dissonant sounds and electronic feedback. The New York no wave scene, featuring such artists as Mars and Teenage Jesus and the Jerks in the late 1970s, was an essential development in noise rock.   - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.  - Noise pop is a subgenre of alternative rock developed in the mid-1980s in the UK and US that mixes dissonant noise or feedback, or both, with the melodic instrumentation and production elements more often found in pop music, making it more melodic than noise rock.  - Oklahoma (Cherokee: \\"Asgaya gigageyi\\" /  ; or transliterated from English as  (\\"òàlàhoma\\"), Pawnee: \\"Uukuhuúwa\\", Cayuga: \\"Gahnawiyogeh\\") is a state located in the South Central United States. Oklahoma is the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous of the 50 United States. The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words \\"okla\\" and \\"humma\\", meaning \\"red people\\". It is also known informally by its nickname, \\"The Sooner State\\", in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on the choicest pieces of land before the official opening date, and the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which opened the door for white settlement in America's Indian Territory. The name was settled upon statehood, Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged and Indian was dropped from the name. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma became the 46th state to enter the union. Its residents are known as \\"Oklahomans\\", or informally \\"Okies\\", and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City.  - The flute is a family of musical instruments in the woodwind group. Unlike woodwind instruments with reeds, a flute is an aerophone or reedless wind instrument that produces its sound from the flow of air across an opening. According to the instrument classification of HornbostelSachs, flutes are categorized as edge-blown aerophones.  - Space rock is a subgenre of rock music; the term originally referred to a group of early, mostly British, 1970s progressive and psychedelic rock bands such as Hawkwind, Gong, and Pink Floyd, characterised by slow, lengthy instrumental passages dominated by electronic organs, synthesizers, experimental guitar work and science fiction or outer space-related lyrical themes.  - David Lawrence \\"Dave\\" Fridmann is an American record producer and musician. From 1990 onwards he co-produced most releases by Mercury Rev and The Flaming Lips. Other bands he has worked with include Weezer, Saxon Shore, Neon Indian, Wolf Gang, Ammonia, Ed Harcourt, Sparklehorse, Café Tacuba, Elf Power, Mogwai, Thursday, Mass of the Fermenting Dregs, The Delgados, Low, Phantom Planet, Gemma Hayes, Goldrush, Tapes 'n Tapes, Hopewell, Black Moth Super Rainbow, Number Girl, Jed Davis, Zazen Boys, Sleater-Kinney and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah. He has recently worked on new recordings with MGMT, Neil Finn, The Cribs, OK Go, Tame Impala, Baroness and Spoon.  - Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the Western world as a softer alternative to rock and roll. The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other.  - The clarinet is a musical-instrument family belonging to the group known as the woodwind instruments. It has a single-reed mouthpiece, a straight cylindrical tube with an almost cylindrical bore, and a flared bell.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"In evaluating whether the premise entails the hypothesis, it is vital to provide a comprehensive understanding of both the premise and the hypothesis and then analyze their connection. Premise: \\"And there are tax revolutions going on currently.\\" The premise asserts that there are ongoing tax revolutions at the present time. To better understand this statement, we need to clarify the term \\"tax revolutions.\\" A tax revolution refers to a significant shift or change in the tax system or taxation policies within a country or across multiple countries. This could involve changes in tax rates, implementation of new taxes, or the elimination of existing ones, modifications in tax collection methods, or the fundamental restructuring of the taxation system itself. Hypothesis: \\"Currently, there are tax revolutions.\\" The hypothesis essentially claims the same thing as the premise, asserting that there are tax revolutions taking place at the present time. The hypothesis concisely reiterates the idea of ongoing tax revolutions without any changes or qualifications. This means that the basic idea of tax revolutions occurring in the present moment is consistent across both statements. Analysis: Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Entailment, in logical terms, refers to the relationship between two statements where if one statement (the premise) is true, the other statement (the conclusion or hypothesis) must also be true. In this case, the premise and the hypothesis are focused on the same concept: the existence of ongoing tax revolutions. Given the parallel nature of the statements and their consistency in terms of the intended message, it can be concluded that the premise entails the hypothesis. This is because if the premise is indeed true and there are tax revolutions taking place currently, then it must also hold that the hypothesis is accurate in claiming that tax revolutions are happening at the present time. In summary, based on the evaluation of the content and context of both the premise and the hypothesis, the premise does indeed entail the hypothesis. The statement \\"And there are tax revolutions going on currently\\" essentially guarantees the truth of \\"Currently, there are tax revolutions,\\" as long as the premise is assumed to be true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It does not refer to everything everybody thinks or does, but, only refer to those things that everybody depends upon ,for example, public services, governments, and all kinds of communities. A society must keep even the poorest and weakest members willing to help even the richest and strongest, so it is very concerned with citizenship, rights, ethics ( )and time limits. These are basic ways to achieve fairness. If they break down badly, people will think the society is unfair and start taking things from each other, refusing to help each other, or seeing those who have more as cheats. When this happens, it is time for the society to break down or fail. Theft, violence and war are things that can make a society break down. A new society may be formed out of the collapse  of an old failed one when people of different kinds reach an agreement about fairness and are willing to live together in harmony again. To adapt to the society, people should make sure that their behavior can be supported by the society, that is to say, there must be some social rules on which citizens base what they do. However, some people take risks that the society will support them when they do whatever they intend to. For instance, they may refuse to obey the law, and count on their fellow society members to free them in a court of appeal, which harms the society. Therefore we need a social contract which sets out rules for the society. One kind of the social contract is a constitution  -which allows a jury or court to decide what is right or wrong according to the social rules. We know from the passage that   _ A) Social fairness is very important for a society to survive \\" B) there must be a war to end an old society and build a new one C) only the poorest are willing to help the richest in a society D) the poor people in a society are always cheated by those wealthy ones A:","output":"According to the passage, the correct statement is \\"A) Social fairness is very important for a society to survive\\". The text suggests that every society highly depends on the principles of fairness to make its members willing to assist each other, regardless of their social or economical status. When the social contract fails or when the sense of injustice dominates, society is likely to break down, leading to theft, violence, and even war.  The text does not state that \\"there must be a war to end an old society and build a new one\\" (B). Instead, it says that a new society may be formed after the collapse of an old one, once people can agree upon fairness and live harmoniously again.  The statement \\"only the poorest are willing to help the richest in a society\\" (C) is not suggested in the passage either. The passage emphasizes that a well-functioning society should keep all of its members - from the poorest to the richest - willing to offer help to one another.  Finally, the passage does not claim that \\"the poor people in a society are always cheated by those wealthy ones\\" (D). It says society may start viewing those who have more as cheats when breakdowns in fairness occur, but it does not specify a continuous pattern of deception directed by the wealthy towards the poor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

SINGAPORE — Envoys from the United States and North Korea are holding talks to iron out any last-minute differences before Tuesday's historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that veteran diplomat Sung Kim is leading the U.S. delegation in a working group meeting Monday at the city-state's Ritz Carlton hotel. The North Korea side is being led by Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui. Monday's meeting is apparently aimed at narrowing the gap between the U.S. and North Korea over the demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. President Trump expressed confidence about his meeting upon his arrival in Singapore Sunday, telling reporters after stepping down from Air Force One that he his feeling \\"very good\\" about Tuesday's summit. Ahead of his arrival, Trump acknowledged he is heading into “unknown territory” for the meeting Tuesday. In response to a question from VOA News just before heading to Asia from the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said “I really feel confident” about the unprecedented encounter between a sitting American president and a member of the family dynasty which has maintained iron-fist control over one of the world’s most reclusive countries for three generations. Trump added that he believes Kim, half the age of the American president, “wants to do something great for his people.” But Trump cautioned that Kim “won’t have that opportunity again” if the talks do not go well -- describing this opportunity for diplomacy with the United States as a “one-time shot.” Trump and others in his government have said advancement has been made on obtaining a commitment from Kim to give up all his nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. Progress could lead to a peace treaty and formally end a state of war on the Korean peninsula, which has persisted for nearly 70 years.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: New Mexico, 1866. Tom Corbett (Franco Nero) is a prospector who receives a message from a family friend named Carradine (Janos Bathra), telling him to return immediately to the home where he'd lived with his wealthy widowed mother. Years earlier upon her death, she left the house and land to Tom's brother Jeff, and insisted that Tom be sent away. Money was dispatched to him to support him, but her dying wish was that Tom stay away from Laramie Town. Neverless, Tom says goodbye to his foreman, Murray, and rides off.Upon arrival in Laramie Town, Tom finds the house where he grew up in derelict. Pigs and livestock wonder the wreckage where some people also live and work. Tom is told by two rough-looking thugs to leave because the land belongs to a man called Mr. Scott and warned to beware whenever he sees the Scott sign which is a big letter 'S' stamped onto a big letter 'J'.Riding back into town, Tom sees that the Scott sign is all over town, on the bank, the saloon, everywhere, and soon sees why the owners are feared. Jason Scott (John McDouglas), a wealthy businessman rides into the town square with his sadistic son Junior Scott (Nino Castelnuovo) with a posse of thugs surrounding them. The Scotts apprehend a family moving out of the town because of the low wages the Scotts pay them. Junior suddenly kills the elderly couple's teenage son in cold blood and laughs mechanically.Asking around where Jeff Corbett is, Tom is led to an elderly Chinese blacksmith, named Souko (Aysanoa Runachagwa), where Jeff works. Souko directs Tom to the residence of his employee. Tom finds his brother, Jeff, living in a run-down shack on the outskirts of town along with their old Indian housemaid Mercedes (Rina Franchetti). Jeff (George Hilton) is revealed to be a drunkard, having never gotten over the loss of his mother, as well as the farm. Both Jeff and Mercedes insist that Tom leave immediately and they refuse to discuss why Tom has been summoned. They are also anxious that Tom shouldn't be seen by anyone else in town who might...

Answer the following question: The candidate who is longing for election to the highest office in the United States must be native-born American citizen who is at least 35 years old and who has lived in the United States for at least 14 years. The election course is complicated, and the road to the Oval Office is long. Potential candidates must present papers stating their intention to seek their party's recommendation; delegates  then choose from among those running some months later at the national conferences. Before that, however, each state holds a primary election that determines how the state's voters want the party's delegates to vote. Methods of choosing the delegates vary from state to state. At the conferences, there are speeches and often heated discussions. It may take several rounds of voting before delegates can agree on a candidate. On the final day of the meeting, the presidential candidate announces his or her choice for vice president. Election Day, by law, is the Tuesday that follows the first Monday in November. On this day, registered voters may cast their votes for president, vice president, and candidates for other federal state, and local offices. The popular vote, however, does not determine who will be president. The president is chosen by a vote of the Electoral College, a group of 538 citizens from the 50 states and the District of Columbia who are chosen to cast votes for the president and vice president. The rules for choosing electors, as with the delegates, vary. Each state also decides whether its electoral votes must reflect the popular vote. The number of electors in each state is determined by the number of representatives and senators that a state sends to Congress and, therefore, may change every 10 years, depending on the results of the United States census  . The winner must get at least 270 of the electoral votes when the Electoral College meets in December of the election year.

In another trailer, funnyman Jeff \\"Fatty\\" Portnoy (Jack Black) plays every member of \\"America's favorite obese family\\" in the highly flatulent The Fatties: Fart 2.

This is actually a scene from Tropic Thunder, a big-budget adaptation of Tayback's wartime memoir.

Lincoln Osiris, an African American, Lazarus has dyed his skin dark and refuses to break character. (\\"I don't drop character 'till I done the DVD commentary.\\") A take of Osiris crying over Tayback's (Speedman's) blown-off hands is ruined when Speedman is unable to cry and Lazarus dribbles uncontrollably into Speedman's face. The ruined take causes great frustration for the film's director, Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan). The chaos is exacerbated when the film's pyrotechnics expert, Cody (Danny McBride), mistakes Cockburn's conniptions for a signal to set off several expensive explosions.Faux Access Hollywood clips reveal that Speedman's career has been on a downward spiral.

There were about 1,000 flu sequences from 400 avian virus samples collected in 2010, yet the world poultry population was 21 billion, the journal reported Wednesday. Countries such as Indonesia, Russia, India and Mexico contributed few samples to an international virus database despite large poultry populations. Brazil, with a poultry population of 1.27 billion, did not collect any avian flu samples - nor did Morocco, the Philippines, Colombia, Ecuador, Algeria, Venezuela and the Dominican Republic. The Nature report characterizes surveillance generally as ad hoc and reactive, responding to outbreaks or temporary projects rather than being consistent. That's a problem because global threats can emerge from a flu virus at any moment. Nature looked at avian and pig flu records at the U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information's Influenza Virus Sequence Database between 2003 and 2011. This includes all subtypes of flu, not just the avian flu pandemic candidate H5N1. The database has seen a general increase in flu sequences deposited, but most of those sequences come from samples collected before 2003 or from the mid-2000s during an unusually prolific virus collection phase. Sylvie van der Werf, head of the Molecular Genetics of RNA Viruses lab at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, told Nature that there can be a huge time lag between the collection and sequencing of flu virus samples. The reason for this includes lack of funding for sequencing, although these costs are decreasing. And there's a lot of sequencing going on in retrospective research studies. And researchers often don't share their sequences until after they have published data about them. Sequences of such viruses should be given to public databases within three months, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Organization for Animal Health. Dr. Ian Lipkin, professor of epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, said he agrees that surveillance needs a boost. \\"Influenza surveillance is insufficient and inefficient,\\" he wrote in an e-mail. \\"International leadership and commitment are key to mitigating the threat of pandemic influenza to human health and food security.\\" Data from two experiments on the highly infectious H5N1 avian influenza are still on hold amid concerns that they could be used for terrorist purposes.

However, you do not necessarily have to tuck in your shirt. Cropped jeans can also work with large sweaters or tunics that do not require tucking in. This can work great in a casual setting. If you want to highlight your waist without looking too formal, tuck your shirt in halfway. Cropped jeans can still work in the colder months with some layering. This can also help with proportions. If you, say, tuck in your shirt with your jeans, you can also pair it with a longer jacket or blazer. This will draw attention to your legs and shoes. When layering, opt for a shorter shirt paired with a longer cardigan, blazer, or jacket. Most types of shoes work well with cropped jeans. For a more casual outing, things like flats, sandals, and mules look great with cropped jeans. You can also simply wear cropped jeans with sneakers. When wearing cropped jeans with boots, make sure the pant legs fall above the boots.

White","output":"Title: Shared Spaces Genre: Drama Tagline: Race, roots, and the road to a bond beyond color. Plot: Malik, a young African American man pursuing his university degree, gets assigned a new roommate, James, in their dorm. James is white, hailing from a wealthy background and has never experienced racial diversity firsthand. Their contrasting worlds collide as they begin to share a living space. The first act explores the initial tensions between the two as they navigate their different cultural backgrounds and perceptions. Malik feels that James treats him differently because he's Black, while James remains blissfully unaware of the impact of his behavior. Malik's struggles to adapt to an predominantly white environment exacerbates the situation. The second act witnesses a change in the characters as they start to acknowledge their misunderstandings. Both of them become more aware of cultural norms, social issues around race, and their own biases. They jointly participate in a college \\"Unity Through Diversity\\" project, where they must interview people of various backgrounds, pushing them to step outside their comfort zones, resulting in meaningful exchanges. Towards the end, an incident on campus involving racial injustice propels the roommates to work together to promote change in their college community. As they team up to organize a peaceful protest, they lean on each other for support. A strong bond develops between Malik and James, now that they've gone beyond their differences and established mutual respect. In the final act, tragedy strikes as an altercation escalates at the protest, and James, while peacefully advocating for racial justice, is gravely injured. On seeing his roommate hospitalized, Malik realizes how far they have come in their journey to understanding and acceptance. The movie ends with a hopeful note as Malik visits James in the hospital, and they share an honest conversation about their experiences. \\"Shared Spaces\\" highlights the importance of personal growth, empathy, and the potential for unity beyond race."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This was awful for Stan, just awful. He had loved Sheila for a long time, fought for her heart, believed in their love until finally she had come around. They were about to kiss for the first time and then this: yellow gumballs. Stan went to a group to try to accept that Sheila was gone. It was a group for people whose unrequited love had ended in some kind of surrealist moment. There is a group for everything in California. After several months of hard work on himself with the group, Stan was ready to open a shop and sell the thousands of yellow gumballs. He did this because he believed in capitalism, he loved capitalism. He loved the dynamic surge and crash of Amazon's stock price, he loved the great concrete malls spreading across America like blood staining through a handkerchief, he loved how everything could be tracked and mirrored in numbers. When he closed the store each night he would count the gumballs sold, and he would determine his gross revenue, his operating expenses, his operating margin; he would adjust his balance sheet and learn his debt to equity ratio; and after this exercise each night, Stan felt he understood himself and was at peace, and he could go home to his apartment and drink tea and sleep, without shooting himself or thinking about Sheila. On the night before the IPO of gumballs.com, Sheila came to Stan in a dream.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What did the company that toured the United States in 1984 produce in 1990? ?  Productions during the 1980s included the company's first presentations of Pelléas and Mélisande (1981), Parsifal (1986) and Billy Budd (1988). 1980s productions that remained in the repertory for many years included Xerxes directed by Hytner, and Rigoletto and The Mikado directed by Jonathan Miller. In 1984 ENO toured the United States; the travelling company, led by Elder, consisted of 360 people; they performed Gloriana, War and Peace, The Turn of the Screw, Rigoletto and Patience. This was the first British company to be invited to appear at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, where Patience received a standing ovation and Miller's production of Rigoletto, depicting the characters as mafiosi, was greeted with a mixture of enthusiasm and booing. In 1990 ENO was the first major foreign opera company to tour the Soviet Union, performing the Miller production of The Turn of the Screw, Pountney's production of Macbeth, and Hytner's much-revived Xerxes.The 'Powerhouse' era ended in 1992, when all three of the triumvirate left at the same time. The new general director was Dennis Marks, formerly head of music programmes at the BBC, and the new music director was Sian Edwards. Pountney's post of director of productions was not filled. Marks, inheriting a large financial deficit from his predecessors, worked to restore the company's finances, concentrating on restoring ticket sales to sustainable levels. A new production by Miller of Der Rosenkavalier was a critical and financial success, as was a staging of Massenet's Don Quixote, described by the critic Hugh Canning as \\"the kind of old-fashioned theatre magic which the hair-shirted Powerhouse regime despised\\".Marks was obliged to spend much time and effort in securing the funding for an essential restoration of the Coliseum, a condition on which ENO had acquired the freehold of the theatre in 1992. At the same time the Arts Council was contemplating a cut in the number of opera performances in London, at the expense of ENO, rather than Covent Garden. By...

A palindrome is a string that is the same backwards as it is forwards. If the shortest possible palindrome is length 1 you should return the first character. Q: tktkttuuuu A:","output":"A: In the given string \\"tktkttuuuu\\", the longest palindrome substring is \\"tktkt\\". To solve this problem, you can iterate through the string and for each character, expand outwards to find the longest palindrome substring that includes the current character. Do this for all the characters in the input string and keep track of the longest one found. Here are the steps: 1. Create a function to expand around the center and compare the left and right characters. If they match, continue expanding. Return the length of the palindrome substring found. 2. Initialize variables to store start and end positions of the longest palindrome substring found. 3. Iterate through the given string and for each character, call the expand-around-center function with the character as the center. Also, handle the case for even-length palindromes by considering the next character as a part of the center. 4. Update the start and end positions if a larger palindrome is found. 5. After the iteration, extract the longest palindrome substring using the start and end positions. Here's a python implementation of the above approach: \`\`\`python def longest_palindrome_substring(s: str) -> str:     if len(s) == 0 or len(s) == 1:         return s     def expand_around_center(s: str, left: int, right: int) -> int:         while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:             left -= 1             right += 1         return right - left - 1     start = 0     end = 0     for i in range(len(s)):         len1 = expand_around_center(s, i, i)         len2 = expand_around_center(s, i, i + 1)         max_len = max(len1, len2)         if max_len > end - start:             start = i - (max_len - 1) // 2             end = i + max_len // 2     return s[start:end + 1] string = \\"tktkttuuuu\\" result = longest_palindrome_substring(string) print(result)  # Output: tktkt \`\`\` For the given string \\"tktkttuuuu\\", the function will return the longest palindrome substring \\"tktkt\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The premise explicitly states that \\"the leather jackets are quite expensive.\\" When considering this information, it is important to analyze the context in which the statement is made and take into account the description provided. Firstly, the phrasing \\"some of these like the leather jackets\\" might indicate that the leather jackets being discussed are part of a larger group or collection of clothing items. The premise implies that among this group, the leather jackets, in particular, are known for their high price. This suggests that leather jackets hold a distinct categorization or reputation within the larger context to which they belong. Secondly, the use of the word \\"expensive\\" is employed to describe the cost associated with these leather jackets. By definition, expensive is a term that is used to convey a high cost or price for an item which implies that the amount of money required to purchase these jackets is not considered low or affordable by general standards. In conclusion, based on the premise provided, it can be stated that the hypothesis \\"The leather jackets are inexpensive\\" is not true as the statement given clearly defines the leather jackets as being expensive.

Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Nothing I can think of. I’ve unwittingly embarrassed my daughter by stopping by my daughter’s place too often to drop things off, I guess. I guess I embarrassed my daughter when she was living with her boyfriend by stopping by with healthy food and favorites groceries and other things I thought she needed and might like. The boyfriend always told me the groceries were a help. My daughter complained she already had too many clothes and if I tried to surprise her with something new. I think my husband and I embarrass our daughter now practically no matter what we do just because we’re parents and maybe because we’re older in our 60’s and too happy to see her and too eager to please and we inadvertently treat our daughter like she is still a kid although she will be 22. I’ve never had a deliberate favorite thing to do except maybe by accident when I used to share too many photos of the cats when I used to be on FB? Parents can’t help but embarrass their children beyond a certain age maybe? I can picture if we had an in the ground pool and my husband and I were continually doing silly moves and cannon ball jumping in I think or even simply lazing around in ridiculous color and style too teeny bathing suits for our age that too would embarrass my daughter. When push comes to shove parents like myself don’t have to be too inventive or think much to come up with things they might do that embarrass their kids. My daughter told me she could not stand to go to the movies with me because I used to cry during movies. She never forgets one time I got emotional during a movie “Spirit” my husband and I took her to when she was little. I tried to hide this but my husband blurted out “You aren't crying, are you” like it was the dumbest thing to do and for the entire movie going audience to hear. Sheesh!

Detailed Instructions: In mathematics, the absolute value of a number is the non-negative value of that number, without regarding its sign. For example, the absolute value of -2 is 2, and the absolute value of 5 is 5. In this task you will be given a list of numbers and you need to return the element with highest absolute value. If a negative and positive element have the same absolute value you should return the positive element. The absolute value for negative numbers can be found by multiplying them by -1. After finding the element with the maximum absolute value you should return the value of that element before you applied the absolute value. Problem:[-45.584 -26.748 -39.533  83.255   0.359  -1.64   87.489 -53.57   -3.832   70.333] Solution:","output":"Part #1: Understand the concept of absolute value. Usage: The absolute value of a number is the non-negative value of that number, without regarding its sign. For instance, the absolute value of -8 is 8, and the absolute value of 3 is 3.

Usage: Given the list of numbers, first, find the highest absolute value among them. Here, we will convert each number to its absolute value, and keep track of the highest absolute value we've encountered. In the given list of numbers, absolute values are [45.584, 26.748, 39.533, 83.255, 0.359, 1.64, 87.489, 53.57, 3.832, 70.333]. The highest absolute value is 87.489. Part #3: Return the original value of the element with the highest absolute value. Usage: After determining the highest absolute value, return the actual value of that element from the original list. In this case, the highest absolute value is 87.489, and its original value from the list was also 87.489. Therefore, the solution is 87.489, as it is the element with the maximum absolute value.

Europeans have a lot in common but it is their differences, not their similarities, that attract the attention of sociologists and market researchers, and are more interesting.    * 35% of Germans live alone, but only 9% of Spaniards. Perhaps this explains why Spaniards lead Europe in the habit of going out for a drink.    * The British attend more adult evening classes than anyone else in Europe, and the Belgians least. So it can't just be the dark evenings. There are no figures on how many Britons go for a drink afterwards.

Next come the Dutch. But the Belgians, just over the border, play fewest sports.    * The Germans spend twice as much on heating as the Spaniards. Well, of course they do, it's colder.    * Dutch husbands do the household shopping a lot more often than Italians or Spaniards.    * The French are the champion public transport commuters of Europe. If you hate commuting, go and live in the Netherlands, where journeys to work are shorter than anywhere else.    * The amount of direct eye-contact between strangers is three times greater among Spaniards than it is among the British or Swedes.

U.S. President Donald Trump says he is considering tariffs, quotas, and retaliatory taxes on imports of steel and aluminum from countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. The comments came during a wide-ranging trade discussion Tuesday between Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House.  The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports.  But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office.  Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers.  \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded.  \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added.  The Trump administration is currently renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement with South Korea.  Trump called the U.S.-South Korea deal \\"very, very bad\\" and \\"horrible.\\" He also said Canada has \\"treated us very, very unfairly.\\"  Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a so-called \\"232 report\\" to the White House, examining the national security impacts of steel and aluminum imports, and giving Trump 90 days to impose quotas or tariffs.

He is trying to develop a drug that can be absorbed by the system in different rates. To that end, he conducted two experiments. In one case, he used lower concentrations of reactants, he called it case A. Then he used the same reactants in a higher concentration. He called it case B.  Would case A have higher or lower rate of reactions than case B?  Hint: Collision theory tells us that molecules need to collide in order for a reaction to take place. All else being equal, anything that increases the frequency of collisions would also increase the rate of reaction. One way to do this is to increase the concentrations of one or more of the reactants. Using a real world example, a busy freeway will experience much more frequent car collisions than a fairly empty neighborhood street. Similarly, forcing more randomly moving molecules into the same amount of space will cause an increased number of collisions over a given length of time, providing the reactants with more opportunities to transform into products. Answer:","output":"Based on the hint provided which refers to the Collision Theory, the rate of reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of reactants. Higher concentrations of reactants lead to a higher frequency of collisions between the molecules, thus increasing the rate of reaction. In John's experiments: Case A involves lower concentrations of reactants. Case B involves higher concentrations of the same reactants. As per the Collision Theory, Case B will have a higher rate of reaction compared to Case A, because the higher concentration of reactants in Case B will result in more frequent collisions between the molecules, providing greater opportunities for the reactants to transform into products."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But the fate of the eurozone is more complex and uncertain. With Greece making up less than 2% of the eurozone's gross domestic product (GDP), its exit might not have much of an immediate impact. Most economists expect the European Central Bank (ECB) would step in to support bond prices against market speculation targeting the weaker euro members. But after that? Some believe the crisis will impel the 19 countries using the euro to an even closer union. Others say the direct opposite, that the markets will pick off the weaker members one by one, reducing it to a euro-rump of diminished significance. We canvassed the opinions of four economists and thinkers on how they felt the euro would fare without Greece. Mr Borg believes the effect on the eurozone would be limited. \\"If you look at how the stock markets have been affected - it's really not that bad. The exposure to Greece from individual banks has been limited and although the links to Greek debts for public institutions is strong there are no solvency or liquidity problems. \\"It is very important we see appropriate policies put in place by the ECB. It needs to do what it is doing at the moment - monthly interventions in the market, clearly signalling that it will do whatever it takes to keep the euro together, and possibly even in the short term stepping up the amount they are injecting. \\"A Grexit would have a negative impact on the euro economy but not by a large amount, perhaps reducing growth by 0.2-0.4%, but nothing like the effect of 2008 or 2010 as balance sheets have been cleared up and there is considerably more growth.\\" Stefanos Manos said: \\"I don't think the consequences for the euro would be that severe and I believe the European institutions have ring-fenced everything that would be damaged by a Greek exit. The euro might wobble a bit but it would not be damaged. \\"It might instead scare people in Europe and force them to do more than they were going to do to create more of a union. Beside a banking union, they need some sort of fiscal union. So a Grexit would be a good reason to accelerate the process.\\" He believes Greece's future outside the euro would not encourage others to follow suit - in fact it would do the opposite: \\"We would be an example to avoid\\" he said. Prof Ryan believes that the effects in the short term will be damaging to the euro but manageable. But further out, he says there could be more serious problems. He said: \\"The effects could be incremental rather than immediate. The European Central Bank can sterilise the issue to start with, supporting the bond markets. But further out the markets will test the resilience of the periphery economies.\\" He also has less faith in the European banking system to withstand the impact of a Grexit. He said: \\"There have been stress tests done but there have been exemptions for some banks while others have not passed. I am not convinced they are as strong as they are made out to be.\\" Professor Ryan also doubts the ability of the euro members to forge a closer union. \\"The bottom line was that in the cold light of day they are realising there isn't a willingness to do what is necessary to create a proper monetary union, with a fiscal union and especially a transfer union - transferring money from the rich countries to the poor - which has no support at all in Germany\\". Vicky Pryce  says she has always been sceptical of the eurozone's ability to function as a currency union without political union. She put the chances of its success as 50/50 when it was launched and says the chances are much the same now. She said: \\"A Grexit would not change anything. A monetary union was always going to be hard and  I always imagined we would get the odd country dropping out. And the prospect of instability is likely to push the euro towards more integration, as it has been damaged by what it has been through.\\" \\"The euro will still face the problem of having interest rates set in Germany which are right for the large core economies but not for the countries on the periphery.\\" She believes the ECB will immediately flood the market with liquidity and make sure that the European banking system is safe. It would therefore put off any thought of a rise in interest rates. But she says it will be expensive: \\"There are some horrendous estimates coming out of German institutions of the costs of Greece defaulting on its debt. Even though a Grexit would bring with it some certainty for Greece it would bring uncertainty for the rest of Europe and that will weigh on growth.\\" This article was about:","output":"The article discusses the potential impact of a Greek exit (Grexit) on the eurozone.

Some experts see the Grexit as an opportunity for the Eurozone countries to push towards more integration, such as a fiscal and banking union, while others doubt the willingness of the member countries to form a closer union.

Although Neptune lies over 50% further from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40% its amount of sunlight, the two planets' surface temperatures are roughly equal.

Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun; whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System.

Context: During the middle decades of the 18th century, there were several outbreaks of military conflict on the Indian subcontinent, the Carnatic Wars, as the English East India Company (the Company) and its French counterpart, the Compagnie française des Indes orientales, struggled alongside local rulers to fill the vacuum that had been left by the decline of the Mughal Empire. The Battle of Plassey in 1757, in which the British, led by Robert Clive, defeated the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies, left the Company in control of Bengal and as the major military and political power in India. France was left control of its enclaves but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states, ending French hopes of controlling India. In the following decades the Company gradually increased the size of the territories under its control, either ruling directly or via local rulers under the threat of force from the British Indian Army, the vast majority of which was composed of Indian sepoys.

First, we see an equation that looks a little complicated, but don't worry, it's like a puzzle, and we're going to solve it together. The equation is 51*k + 14215 - 17020 = 0.  Now, before we find what \\"k\\" is, let's simplify the equation a bit.  We have numbers 14215 and 17020. We're subtracting 17020 from 14215, which if we do the math, equal -2805. So, now our equation looks like this: 51*k - 2805 = 0 We want to find out what \\"k\\" is, right? To find the value of k, we might want to move -2805 to the other side of the equation. To move -2805 over to the other side, we do the opposite of subtraction, which is addition. So, we add 2805 to both sides. Our equation now looks like this: 51*k = 2805 The last step is to find out \\"k\\". Now, \\"k\\" is being multiplied by 51. To undo multiplication, we do division. So, we divide 2805 by 51.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: The 2014 South Dakota gubernatorial election took place on November 4, 2014, to elect the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of South Dakota, concurrently with the election of South Dakota's Class II U.S. Senate seat, as well as other elections to the United States Senate in other states and elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections. Hypothesis: South Dakota elected a senator in 2014","output":"To determine the validity of the hypothesis that South Dakota elected a senator in 2014, we must carefully examine the information provided in the paragraph. The paragraph states that the 2014 South Dakota gubernatorial election happened on November 4, 2014. During this election, the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of South Dakota were elected.  However, the paragraph also mentions that this election was held concurrently with the election of South Dakota's Class II U.S. Senate seat. A U.S. Senate seat refers to a position held by a senator, with two senators representing each state. There are three classes for Senate seats, with each class consisting of approximately one-third of the total Senate seats. Class II seats, which South Dakota's was a part of in 2014, are elected every six years, with elections typically held in years that are evenly divisible by six (like 2014). Considering the information provided in the paragraph and the fact that the gubernatorial election took place concurrently with the election of South Dakota's Class II U.S. Senate seat, we can conclude that the hypothesis is true: South Dakota elected a senator in 2014. This senatorial election ran alongside other U.S. Senate elections in other states, as well as elections for the U.S. House of Representatives and various state and local elections."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

A woman asks for advice on the road to reach a mysterious town, and hears two ghoulish stories from the local weirdo, both zombie related. But perhaps fate has something nasty in store for her too... The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise.

Cool, What I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist.

Here is a question about this article: Controversy persists over whether the Rus’ were Varangians (Vikings) or Slavs. This uncertainty is due largely to a paucity of contemporary sources. Attempts to address this question instead rely on archaeological evidence, the accounts of foreign observers, legends and literature from centuries later. To some extent the controversy is related to the foundation myths of modern states in the region. According to the \\"Normanist\\" view, the Rus' were Scandinavians, while Russian and Ukrainian nationalist historians generally argue that the Rus' were themselves Slavs. Normanist theories focus on the earliest written source for the East Slavs, the Russian Primary Chronicle, although even this account was not produced until the 12th century. Nationalist accounts have suggested that the Rus' were present before the arrival of the Varangians, noting that only a handful of Scandinavian words can be found in modern Russian and that Scandinavian names in the early chronicles were soon replaced by Slavic names. Nevertheless, archaeological evidence from the area suggests that a Scandinavian population was present during the 10th century at the latest. On balance, it seems likely that the Rus' proper were a small minority of Scandinavians who formed an elite ruling class, while the great majority of their subjects were Slavs. Considering the linguistic arguments mounted by nationalist scholars, if the proto-Rus' were Scandinavians, they must have quickly become nativized, adopting Slavic languages and other cultural practices.

On June 16, as the Soviets invaded Lithuania, but before they had invaded Latvia and Estonia, Ribbentrop instructed his staff \\"to submit a report as soon as possible as to whether in the Baltic States a tendency to seek support from the Reich can be observed or whether an attempt was made to form a bloc.\\" Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Why did the Germans distrust the soviet agenda?","output":"The Germans distrusted the Soviet agenda for several reasons: 1. Lack of communication: The Soviets launched invasions in Finland and the Baltic states without prior communication with the Germans. This lack of communication led to suspicion and uncertainty about Soviet intentions. 2. Ideological differences: Germany was led by Adolf Hitler who espoused the principles of National Socialism (Nazism), while the Soviet Union was led by Joseph Stalin promoting Communism. There was a long-standing ideological divide between the two, and each side viewed the other's political system as a threat to their own. 3. Non-Aggression Pact tensions: Despite signing the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (a non-aggression treaty) in 1939, both sides remained wary of each other's true intentions. The fact that the Soviets pursued aggressive actions that were not previously discussed with Germany fueled their distrust. 4. Fear of anti-German bloc: Following the Soviet invasions, Germany worried that Stalin might be attempting to form an anti-German bloc with nations in the region, which would oppose and potentially undermine German ambitions. 5. Conflicting territorial interests: Although the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact had divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence between Germany and the Soviet Union, the division did not eliminate their territorial ambitions. German concerns that the Soviets might not honor the agreed-upon division of territories fueled their mistrust. In summary, the Germans distrusted the Soviet agenda due to a combination of factors, including lack of communication, ideological differences, tensions over the non-aggression pact, fears of Soviet attempts to form an anti-German bloc, and conflicting territorial interests."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Present-day North Brabant (Staats-Brabant) was adjudicated to the Generality Lands of the Dutch Republic according to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, while the reduced duchy remained in existence with the Southern Netherlands until it was conquered by French Revolutionary forces in 1794.  - The Netherlands  is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

Firing an RPG at steep angles poses a danger to the user, because the backblast from firing reflects off the ground.

The given statement, \\"A man in an orange shirt is jumping while playing a large drum,\\" provides information about the man's actions and his clothing, but it does not give any information about his age. Therefore, it is not possible to deduce if the man is old or not based on the information given. From the statement, we understand that the man is capable of jumping and playing a large drum simultaneously, which could point to his physical abilities. However, these actions do not necessarily provide enough context or definitive evidence to determine his age. It is not uncommon for people of various age groups to engage in such activities, as age may not be a significant determinant of one's ability to perform these actions. Health, fitness levels, and personal interests can be factors that could influence the man's actions, regardless of his age. In conclusion, due to the lack of information regarding the man's age in the provided statement, it is not possible to reliably determine if the man is old or not.

In 1754, Columbia University was founded under charter by King George II as King's College in Lower Manhattan. The Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765 as the Sons of Liberty organized in the city, skirmishing over the next ten years with British troops stationed there.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The result of the media being able to say whatever they wanted, following the trial of John Peter Zenger in 1735, led to the establishment of freedom of the press in North America. This freedom played a significant role in shaping the history and politics of the region. Before the Zenger trial, the press was heavily censored, and any criticism of the government was punishable by law. The Zenger trial marked the beginning of the press's ability to report on and critique the actions of government officials, providing the public with information that held authorities accountable and transparent. As a consequence, newspapers began to proliferate, and the colonies were exposed to different perspectives and ideas, including those advocating for independence from Britain. The freedom of the press proved to be an essential factor in the run-up to the American Revolutionary War. Newspapers, pamphlets, and other forms of media provided information and rallied support for the Patriot cause. This free circulation of information bolstered the colonial opposition to British rule and played a significant role in the ratification of the United States Constitution, which enshrined the right to freedom of speech and press in the First Amendment. In summary, the media being able to say whatever they wanted as a result of the Zenger trial led to the establishment of freedom of the press in North America. This freedom played a critical role in the formation of an informed society, shaping politics, and influencing events such as the American Revolution and the adoption of the United States Constitution."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Chris Wormald told a Commons committee it was a controversial move but already happened in some NHS trusts. The NHS has \\"a lot further to go\\" in reclaiming money for treating foreign visitors, he said. Committee chairwoman Meg Hillier raised concerns that some British residents might not have passports or other ID. Head of the BMA council Dr Mark Porter said the discussions were a distraction given that so-called health tourism was \\"such a small problem\\" for the NHS. NHS Trusts in England are legally obliged to check whether patients are eligible for free non-emergency NHS treatment and to recover any costs from overseas patients. But this does not always happen. The government estimates £2bn a year is spent on treating overseas visitors - and only about £280m of this is thought to be deliberate health tourism whereby people come from abroad specifically to get free treatment they are not entitled to. The figure includes the cost of GP care, emergency treatment and routine hospital services, such as scans, maternity care and non-emergency operations. The government has focused on recouping money on routine hospital care. It set a target of recovering £500m a year by 2017-18, but is behind schedule. In 2014-15, when it set the goal, the NHS recovered just £97m. A year later that had increased to £289m, but most of that - £164m - came from the introduction of health surcharge on visa applications of £150 for students and £200 for other people. This entitles them to free NHS care. However, hospitals have struggled to significantly increase the amount they recover from patients they should be charging. UK residents and asylum seekers are entitled to free treatment. But the governments of patients from within the European Economic Area should be charged for the treatment they receive, while visitors from outside that area should be charged personally if they have not paid the surcharge. St George's Hospital in Tooting, south London, is currently running a pilot scheme to test new proof-of-ID processes to recoup costs from pregnant overseas patients. Mr Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department of Health, which is responsible for the NHS in England, told the Public Accounts Committee: \\"We have some trusts that are looking at asking for two forms of ID before treatment. \\"Now that is obviously quite a controversial thing to do but... those are the kinds of things we want to look at. \\"We don't have evaluated results of those yet, but what those trusts are reporting is that does lead to an increase in identification.\\" He added: \\"There are individual trusts like Peterborough who are doing that, who are reporting that it makes a big difference and there you are saying, 'Please come with two forms of identity, your passport and your address,' and they use that to check whether people are eligible or not. \\"Now it is obviously quite a controversial thing to do to say to the entire population, 'You now have to prove identity.'\\" But Ms Hillier said she had constituents who had no photo ID. She said: \\"Because they have never travelled, they have no passport; they have no driver's licence because they have never driven, they still live at home because they can't afford to move out so they've never had a utility bill in their name. \\"Perfectly entitled to health care, British born, British resident; how are you going to make sure that people have access easily to the National Health Service without having to go through a very humiliating and impossible-to-meet set of demands?\\" Mr Wormald responded: \\"This is why we are going very slowly on some of these questions and individual trusts are trying these out.\\" Dr  Porter told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \\"Why are we discussing this today?  We've got an Autumn Statement tomorrow, we've got an NHS with a deficit opening up over the course of this Parliament because of the funding decisions taken about how to address resources in the NHS. \\"This is little other than a pinprick on the top of the actual problems facing the NHS.\\" A Department of Health spokesman said: \\"The NHS is a national - not an international - health service and we are determined to stamp out abuse of the system to ensure it remains free at the point of need in this country. \\"We consulted earlier this year on extending the charging of migrants and visitors using the NHS. We will set out further steps in due course.\\" What was that article about?","output":"The article discusses the possibility of requiring patients to present two forms of identification before receiving treatment from the UK's National Health Service (NHS), as a way to ensure costs can be recouped from overseas patients. The NHS in England is already legally required to check patients' eligibility for free non-emergency treatment and recover costs where applicable. Although some have raised concerns about the proposal, one of the Department of Health's main goals is to recover £500 million annually by 2017-2018 for treating foreign visitors, and some NHS Trusts already have similar requirements in place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: There’s a common myth that if you’ve had chickenpox once, you can never get it again. Unfortunately, because VZV stays in your body the rest of your life, this simply isn’t true – though once you’ve had chickenpox, the virus usually returns as shingles. Even children can develop shingles if they’re exposed to the virus. Most people only get shingles once, but it is possible to develop an outbreak of shingles multiple times throughout your life. The Shingles virus is not sexually transmitted or spread through sneezing or coughing. Rather, it is transmitted by touching the shingles blisters or fluid from the blisters. If you have been around someone in the blister-phase of the infection, you should wash your hands thoroughly; avoid touching anyone else’s rash.  A person is not contagious before the blisters appear or once the blisters have crusted over completely. Keeping the blisters covered lowers the risk of transmitting the virus. If you have never had chickenpox and come in contact with someone with shingles, you can get VZV – but you’ll get chickenpox, not shingles. (However, you can then get shingles later in life.) Most cases of shingles occur in adults over the age of 60. You are also at higher risk of getting shingles if you have a weakened immune system. This may be due to:  Cancer treatment with chemotherapy or radiation Lymphoma or leukemia Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) Taking immunosuppressive medications like steroids or drugs given after an organ transplant If you are 60 years old or over, you should get the shingles vaccine to reduce your risk of contracting the disease. Being unvaccinated after age 60 is a risk-factor for most people. Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns about whether the shingles vaccine is right for you. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article: While many believe that having chickenpox once prevents future occurrences, the Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) actually stays in the body for life, often returning as shingles. Shingles, not transmitted sexually or through air, spreads by touching the blisters or the fluid from them. Chickenpox is a potential consequence for those never infected but exposed to someone with shingles. Most shingles cases occur in adults over 60 or people with weakened immune systems. If you are over 60, getting vaccinated for shingles is recommended to reduce the risk of contracting the disease.

Further, the ban against government aid to religious schools was supported before 1970 by most Protestants (and most Jews), who opposed aid to religious schools, which were mostly Catholic at the time. After 1980, however, anti-Catholic sentiment has diminished among mainline Protestants, and the crucial coalition of public secularists and Protestant churches has collapsed. While mainline Protestant denominations are more inclined towards strict separation of church and state, much evangelical opinion has now largely deserted that position.

Both questions are inquiries about the peculiar and extraordinary dreams that the person being asked has experienced.

The word \\"experienced\\" is used instead of \\"had\\" to emphasize the person's recollection of the dreams, but it does not change the overall meaning.

The man with cancer chooses surgery over chemo based on his doctor's advice.","output":"The man, named Lawrence, decided to follow his doctor's advice and go for surgery over chemo. This decision was not made lightly, as he weighed the pros and cons of each option and considered the long-term impact on his life. Ultimately, he trusted his doctor's experience and expertise and believed that this would give him the best chance of beating his cancer. Step 1: Preparing for surgery Before the surgery, Lawrence needed to undergo several tests and medical evaluations to ensure he was physically ready for the procedure. These tests included blood work, imaging scans, and consultations with the surgical team. The medical team explained the details of the surgery, its risks, potential complications, and recovery process. They also discussed potential lifestyle changes and the importance of emotional support during the difficult journey ahead. Step 2: Undergoing surgery As the day of the surgery approached, Lawrence was filled with a mixture of anxiety and hope. He knew that this was a critical step in his battle against cancer and that his life would never be quite the same again after this procedure. The surgery was performed by a team of experienced surgeons who had a proven track record in successfully treating similar cases. They worked diligently to remove the cancerous tumor and any nearby lymph nodes that may have been affected. Step 3: Recovery and rehabilitation After the surgery, Lawrence faced a long road to recovery. While the procedure had been successful in removing the tumor, he now had to deal with the physical and emotional consequences of the surgery. This involved several weeks in the hospital, followed by ongoing rehabilitation and physical therapy. Lawrence had to re-learn basic tasks like walking, eating, and dressing himself, and adjusting to the limitations that the surgery had imposed on his body. Step 4: Ongoing monitoring Once Lawrence was finally discharged from the hospital, his journey was far from over. He would need regular check-ups with his healthcare team to monitor his condition and ensure that there was no sign of the cancer returning. This vigilance was crucial as it would ensure that any potential issues were detected early and dealt with promptly. Step 5: Emotional and social support During his recovery and rehabilitation process, Lawrence realized the importance of emotional and social support in his life. His friends, family, and even fellow patients battling cancer all provided the essential encouragement and understanding that he needed to get through this difficult period. In turn, Lawrence began to actively participate in cancer support groups, both in-person and online, sharing his experience and offering comfort to others facing similar challenges. In the end, Lawrence emerged from his battle with cancer a changed man. While the journey may have been filled with struggle and hardship, the unwavering support of his loved ones and fellow cancer patients, as well as his own resilience and determination, allowed him to find a renewed sense of purpose and hope in his life.

The story is a flashback of the five years (2005 to 2010) of love affair involving the characters of Allan Alvarez and Mia Samonte.  The opening scene was in a Pasig River ferry boat.  One of the passenger, Allan, was sad and confused if he really loved his then live-in partner, Daphne Recto. While another passenger, Mia, was downtrodden by family problems. To express her heartaches, Mia would write messages on stones and would leave them anywhere, Allan picked up one of those, they got acquainted and their romantic story began.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The First Grader Context: In 2003, a disc jockey announces over a Kenyan radio station that the government is offering free primary school education to all natives who can prove citizenship with a birth certificate. Kimani Maruge (Litondo), an 84-year-old villager, hears this and decides to take it upon himself to seek an education. Arriving at his local school, he meets Jane Obinchu (Harris), the principal and teacher. He expresses his desire to learn how to read. Her teaching colleague Alfred (Munyua), ridicules him and demands he leave. Later, Jane informs her husband Charles (Kgoroge) about Maruge. He discourages her in supporting his educational endeavor. After beginning his initial classes, Maruge is plagued by memories of his service during the Mau Mau Uprising against the British in the 1950s. He begins to hallucinate and becomes confrontational with the students, struggling to continue his academics. Controversy begins to stir over Marugeâs education. Soon enough, the story that an elderly man going to school becomes national headlines. Mr. Kipruto (Kunene), a superintendent of the school district, is alerted to the situation and strongly disapproves of Maruge's predicament and suggests that he go to an adult educational facility. Meeting with the head of the education board to plead Marugeâs case, Jane is overruled. It is explained to her that if an exception is made to keep Maruge in the school, others will follow, and many schools will eventually become filled with older people sitting aside children. Maruge is forced to attend an adult learning centre, where he soon finds himself surrounded by people with no motivation or ambition to study. Maruge vows to never go back to the adult institution. Jane later decides to offer him a reprieve, to work as her teaching assistant. As Maruge's story gains publicity and attention, the local press descend on the school, causing friction among the parents. The villagers believe Jane and Maruge are seeking fame and fortune at the expense of the children. Following negative feedback... A:","output":"The villagers believe that Jane and Maruge are seeking fame and fortune at the expense of the children. This belief stems from the unconventional situation of an 84-year-old man, Maruge, attending a primary school alongside young children. As Maruge's story becomes national headlines and attracts media attention, the villagers start to question the true intentions of both Maruge and Jane, the principal and teacher who supports Maruge's educational pursuit. The villagers' skepticism about Maruge's pursuit of education is fueled not only by his age but also by the disruption it has caused in the school. With a focus on Maruge's education, they worry that the needs and education of the younger students may become compromised. Additionally, as media attention intensifies, the villagers become increasingly concerned that Jane and Maruge are taking advantage of the situation for personal gain, such as financial benefits and increased social status. However, it is important to recognize that the villagers' views are formed based on their perception and interpretation of the situation. While they may see Maruge's pursuit of education as a selfish act or attention-seeking behavior, both Maruge and Jane genuinely believe in the importance of education for all, regardless of age. Maruge seeks to learn how to read and enhance his knowledge, driven by a desire for self-improvement and understanding of the world. In conclusion, the villagers believe that Jane and Maruge are seeking fame and fortune at the expense of the children's education. This belief is rooted in the disruption caused by Maruge's attendance at the primary school and the subsequent media attention. However, it is essential to consider the genuine intentions behind Maruge and Jane's actions, which is to promote education and lifelong learning for all individuals, regardless of age or background."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which country contributed less to the irreversible damage our environment?  Two countries used different fuels as power sources for their activities. Alsacia used fossil fuels, while Lorena devised more advanced energy storage devices, therefore relying on electricity.  Hint: There is worldwide concern about the relationship between climate change and the use of fossil fuels. Many scientists believe that increased use of these fuels (in vehicles and other gas-powered equipment) has the potential to irreversibly damage our environment. In addition to the environmental concerns, supplies of fossil fuels are finite, and because they are non-renewable energy sources, we will eventually need alternatives. New developments in batteries and other energy storage devices are being explored to help deal with these issues. Electrochemical processes are at the heart of these new technologies. Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information and hint, Lorena contributed less to the irreversible damage of our environment. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that Lorena relied on advanced energy storage devices, thus utilizing electricity as their primary source of power.  In contrast, Alsacia used fossil fuels, which are known to have a significant negative impact on the environment and are responsible for contributing substantially to climate change. The burning of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, which trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere and cause global temperatures to rise. This process is largely responsible for human-driven global warming and has the potential to cause irreversible environmental damage if continued unchecked. Additionally, fossil fuels are finite and non-renewable resources, meaning that their supplies will eventually run out, necessitating the development of alternative sources of energy. On the other hand, electricity can be generated from renewable sources, such as solar, wind, and hydropower, which produce minimal emissions and have a reduced environmental impact compared to fossil fuels. Lorena's use of advanced energy storage devices and electricity demonstrate a more environmentally conscious approach to their power needs and, as a result, contributed less to the irreversible damage of our environment when compared to Alsacia's reliance on fossil fuels."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pink Floyd - The Wall is a 1982 British live-action/animated musical drama film directed by Alan Parker with animated segments by political cartoonist Gerald Scarfe, and is based on the 1979 Pink Floyd album of the same name. The film centers around a confined rocker named Pink, who, after being driven into insanity by the death of his father and many depressive moments during his lifetime, constructs a metaphorical (and sometimes physical) wall to be protected from the world and emotional situations around him. When this coping mechanism backfires he puts himself on trial and sets himself free. The screenplay was written by Pink Floyd vocalist and bassist Roger Waters. In the mid-1970s, as Pink Floyd gained mainstream fame, Waters began feeling increasingly alienated from their audiences:  Audiences at those vast concerts are there for an excitement which, I think, has to do with the love of success. When a band or a person becomes an idol, it can have to do with the success that that person manifests, not the quality of work he produces. You don't become a fanatic because somebody's work is good, you become a fanatic to be touched vicariously by their glamour and fame. Stars--film stars, rock 'n' roll stars--represent, in myth anyway, the life as we'd all like to live it. They seem at the very centre of life. And that's why audiences still spend large sums of money at concerts where they are a long, long way from the stage, where they are often very uncomfortable, and where the sound is often very bad.  Waters was also dismayed by the \\"executive approach\\", which was only about success, not even attempting to get acquainted with the actual persons of whom the band was comprised (addressed in an earlier song from Wish You Were Here, \\"Have a Cigar\\"). The concept of the wall, along with the decision to name the lead character \\"Pink\\", partly grew out of that approach, combined with the issue of the growing alienation between the band and their fans. This symbolised a new era for rock bands, as Pink Floyd \\"explored (... ) the hard realities of 'being where we are'\\", drawing upon existentialists, namely Jean-Paul Sartre. Entity:","output":"The text is about the movie \\"Pink Floyd - The Wall,\\" which is a British live-action/animated musical drama film based on the 1979 Pink Floyd album of the same name. The film is about a rocker named Pink, who faces many challenges in his life and builds a metaphorical wall to protect himself from the world and emotional situations. The screenplay was written by Pink Floyd vocalist and bassist Roger Waters, and the movie explores themes of alienation and fame."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Carl Linnaeus (; 23 May 1707 – 10 January 1778), also known after his ennoblement as Carl von Linné (), was a Swedish botanist, physician, and zoologist, who formalised the modern system of naming organisms called binomial nomenclature.

At the time of his death, he was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students. When did the students do the first self portrait?

Article: Like other settled, agrarian societies in history, those in the Indian subcontinent have been attacked by nomadic tribes throughout its long history. In evaluating the impact of Islam on the sub-continent, one must note that the northwestern sub-continent was a frequent target of tribes raiding from Central Asia. In that sense, the Muslim intrusions and later Muslim invasions were not dissimilar to those of the earlier invasions during the 1st millennium. What does however, make the Muslim intrusions and later Muslim invasions different is that unlike the preceding invaders who assimilated into the prevalent social system, the successful Muslim conquerors retained their Islamic identity and created new legal and administrative systems that challenged and usually in many cases superseded the existing systems of social conduct and ethics, even influencing the non-Muslim rivals and common masses to a large extent, though non-Muslim population was left to their own laws and customs. They also introduced new cultural codes that in some ways were very different from the existing cultural codes. This led to the rise of a new Indian culture which was mixed in nature, though different from both the ancient Indian culture and later westernized modern Indian culture. At the same time it must be noted that overwhelming majority of Muslims in India are Indian natives converted to Islam. This factor also played an important role in the synthesis of cultures. Question: After a history of raiding groups, what is not remarkable in the history of the subcontinent?","output":"The unremarkable aspect in the history of the sub-continent, as mentioned in the article, is the nature of intrusions and invasions by Muslims, which were not different or unique compared to the earlier intrusions by various tribes during the 1st millennium.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   In which place the Earth's surface would cool down slower, London or Rome?  Hint: Because of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. For example, on clear nights Earth's surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights.

This is because it was overcast all night in London, meaning there were clouds present in the sky.

Please answer the following question: Joy had a field full of flowering plants , that he used for medicinal and honey making purposes. Her friend Jill also had a piece of land where she cultivated plants that fertilize over wind spread pollen.  Which friend had a field that attracted fewer insects?  Hint: Scientists think that the earliest flowers attracted insects and other animals, which spread pollen from flower to flower. This greatly increased the efficiency of fertilization over wind-spread pollen, which might or might not actually land on another flower. To take better advantage of this “animal labor,” plants evolved traits such as brightly colored petals to attract pollinators. In exchange for pollination, flowers gave the pollinators nectar. Answer:","output":"Step 1: Analyze the question and given hint The question asks us to determine which friend's field attracts fewer insects. Step 2: Identify and compare the types of plants on the two friends' fields Joy's field: flowering plants used for medicinal and honey-making purposes. Jill's field: plants that fertilize over wind-spread pollen. Step 3: Consider the hint provided In the hint, we learn that flowers evolved to attract insect pollinators by offering rewards like nectar in exchange for pollination. This made fertilization more efficient compared to wind-based pollination. Step 4: Identify which field is more likely to attract insects based on the hint Based on the hint, we can infer that flowering plants attracting insects would be Joy's field, since the plants she grew have traits meant to attract insects for pollination. Jill's field has plants that rely on wind to spread pollen, which suggests that they may not have evolved as many traits to attract insects. Step 5: Answer the question Since Joy's field has flowering plants which are evolved to attract insects, and Jill's field has plants that rely on wind for pollination (implying they are less likely to have traits specifically aimed at attracting insects), we can conclude that Jill's field attracts fewer insects.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Inner Harbor is a historic seaport, tourist attraction, and landmark of the city of Baltimore, Maryland, USA. It was described by the Urban Land Institute in 2009 as the model for post-industrial waterfront redevelopment around the world. The Inner Harbor is located at the mouth of Jones Falls, creating the wide and short northwest branch of the Patapsco River. The district includes any water west of a line drawn between the foot of President Street and the American Visionary Art Museum.  - A central business district (CBD) is the commercial and business centre of a city. In larger cities, it is often synonymous with the city's \\"financial district\\". Geographically, it often coincides with the \\"city centre\\" or \\"downtown\\", but the two concepts are separate: many cities have a central \\"business\\" district located away from its commercial or cultural city centre or downtown. Both the CBD and the city centre or downtown may also coincide with the central activities district.  - A one-way pair, one-way couple, or just couplet is a pair of parallel, usually one-way streets that carry opposite directions of a signed route or major traffic flow, or sometimes opposite directions of a bus or streetcar route.  - Jonestown is a neighborhood in the southeastern district of Baltimore . Its boundaries are the north side of Pratt Street , the west side of Central Avenue , the east side of Fallsway , and the south side of Orleans Street . The neighborhood lies north of the Little Italy , south of the Oldtown , west of the Washington Hill , and east of the Downtown Baltimore neighborhoods . Jonestown is a historical section of southeast Baltimore established in 1732 that was laid out on 10 acres ( 40,000 m2 ) divided into twenty lots on the east side of the Jones Falls . The district is a mix of industrial , commercial and residential buildings . In the last half of the 20th century , Jonestown has shifted from a predominantly Eastern European and Jewish neighborhood into a predominantly African American neighborhood . Public housing replaced many of the former rowhomes and townhouses throughout the area , though a historical presence is still felt . In the early 2000s , though , modern row housing replaced the public housing . Jonestown is home to Baltimore 's central post office in addition to 8 Baltimore City Landmarks including the Flag House and the Phoenix Shot Tower , both Registered National Historic Landmarks .  - Patterson Park is an urban park in Southeast Baltimore, Maryland, United States, adjacent to the neighborhoods of Canton, Highlandtown, Patterson Park, and Butchers Hill. It is bordered by East Baltimore Street, Eastern Avenue, South Patterson Park Avenue, and South Linwood Avenue. The Patterson Park extension lies to the east of the main park, and is bordered by East Pratt Street, South Ellwood Avenue, and Eastern Avenue.  - Pratt Street is a major street in Baltimore. It forms a one-way pair of streets with Lombard Street that run westeast through downtown Baltimore. For most of their route, Pratt Street is one-way in an eastbound direction, and Lombard Street is one way westbound. Both streets begin in west Baltimore at Frederick Avenue and end in Butcher's Hill at Patterson Park Avenue. Since 2005, these streets have been open to two-way traffic from Broadway until their end at Patterson Park. Although Lombard is also a two-way street from Fulton Avenue to Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, Pratt is still one-way eastbound in this area.  - Downtown Baltimore is the central business district of Baltimore traditionally bounded by Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard to the west, Mt. Royal Avenue to the north, President Street to the east and the Inner Harbor area to the south.

Don't worry, we'll go through it together! First, we need to simplify the numbers on the right side. So we have: 0 = 1096*y + 15005 - 2014 + 20985 The numbers we need to combine are 15005, -2014, and 20985. When we add them together, we get: 15005 - 2014 + 20985 = 12991 + 20985 = 33976 So our equation changes to: 0 = 1096*y + 33976 Now we need to get y alone on one side. To do this, we'll subtract 33976 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 33976 = 1096*y - 33976 -33976 = 1096*y Almost there! Now, we just need to divide both sides by 1096 to find the value of y: -33976 ÷ 1096 = y And when we do the division, we get: y = -31 So, the answer is y = -31.

Later, it emerged a second police officer is being treated for minor symptoms, including skin irritation, after contact with an object believed to have had \\"secondary contamination\\" from the nerve agent, reports the Telegraph. Bailey will continue to receive intensive occupational therapy and psychotherapy, but he's lucky compared to Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia. The two remain in critical but stable condition at a hospital in Salisbury.

Expand this summary.","output":"British police officer Nick Bailey, who was exposed to a nerve agent while helping poisoned former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, has been released from the hospital. According to the Guardian, Bailey stated that his normal life will likely never be the same, but he wants people to focus on the investigation rather than the police officers involved. A second officer is being treated for minor symptoms, including skin irritation, after being in contact with an object thought to have secondary contamination from the nerve agent.  Bailey will continue to receive intensive occupational therapy and psychotherapy to help him recover. Meanwhile, Sergei Skripal, 66, and Yulia, 33, remain in critical but stable condition at a Salisbury hospital, heavily sedated and possibly suffering from permanent brain damage. The long-term health effects of their exposure to the nerve agent are still unclear. As of now, Skripal is unable to communicate at all, and Yulia can't communicate in any meaningful way. The poisoning of the Skripals has led to international tensions, with 28 European Union leaders agreeing that no plausible alternative explanation exists other than Russia ordering the attack. The incident has increased scrutiny on the use of chemical weapons and potential consequences for the nations involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They are both about the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" (LOTR) franchise, but they deal with different aspects of it. Question 1 is asking whether the cast of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" films got matching tattoos. This question is about the real-life actions of the actors involved in the production. It is not about the plot, characters, or events within the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" narrative itself. In response to Question 1, the answer is \\"yes\\". The main cast of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" decided to commemorate their time filming together by getting matching tattoos. The nine members of the fellowship (Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Sean Bean, and John Rhys-Davies' stunt double) each got a small tattoo of the Elvish character '9', designed by Alan Lee, in various places on their bodies. The tattoos represent the number nine in the Tengwar script, symbolizing the nine members of the fellowship of the ring. Question 2, on the other hand, is asking for an opinion on what the worst change director Peter Jackson made to J.R.R. Tolkien's original \\"Lord of the Rings\\" plot in his film adaptations. This question requires an understanding of both the original \\"Lord of the Rings\\" books and the film adaptations. It is also more subjective, as what one person believes is the 'worst' change might not be considered as such by someone else. Addressing question 2 would require a detailed examination of both the film and book versions of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" identifying key differences, and then making a judgment about which of those differences represents a negative alteration of Tolkien's original plot. Opinions on this can vary widely, depending on one's interpretation of the movies and books. Some may take issue with the omission of certain characters (such as Tom Bombadil), alterations to character personalities or roles (Faramir's portrayal), or the addition of scenes not present in the books (like the action-oriented sequence involving the Hobbits and the wargs).

Q:Information:  - Berkshire (or , abbreviated Berks) is a county in south east England, west of London. It was recognised as the Royal County of Berkshire because of the presence of Windsor Castle by the Queen in 1957 and letters patent issued in 1974. Berkshire is a county of historic origin and is a home county, a ceremonial county and a non-metropolitan county without a county council. Berkshire County Council was the main county governance from 1889 to 1998 except for the separately administered County Borough of Reading.  - Gentry (from Old French \\"genterie\\", from \\"gentil\\", \\"high-born, noble\\") are \\"well-born, genteel and well-bred people\\" of high social class, especially in the past. \\"Gentry\\", in its widest connotation, refers to people of good social position connected to landed estates (see manorialism), upper levels of the clergy, and \\"gentle\\" families of long descent who never obtained the official right to bear a coat of arms.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London.   - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Maidenhead is a large town and unparished area in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, in Berkshire, England. It lies south of the River Thames, but at Maidenhead, the river runs north-south and so the town is in fact on its west bank. The town has a population in 2011 of 67,404. Its urban area (including the adjoining suburban villages of Bray, Holyport, Pinkneys Green, Taplow (Buckinghamshire) Cox Green, White Waltham and Woodlands Park) has a population of just under 90,000. The mainline railway station was set to be the terminus of the Crossrail line until the announcement was made that Reading was to be the new terminus.  - A great hall is the main room of a royal palace, nobleman's castle or a large manor house or hall house in the Middle Ages, and continued to be built in the country houses of the 16th and early 17th centuries, although by then the family used the great chamber for eating and relaxing. At that time the word \\"great\\" simply meant big, and had not acquired its modern connotations of excellence. In the medieval period the room would simply have been referred to as the \\"hall\\", unless the building also had a secondary hall, but the term \\"great hall\\" has been predominant for surviving rooms of this type for several centuries, to distinguish them from the different type of hall found in post-medieval houses. Great halls were found especially in France, England and Scotland, but similar rooms were also found in some other European countries.  - Letters patent (always in the plural) are a type of legal instrument in the form of a published written order issued by a monarch, president, or other head of state, generally granting an office, right, monopoly, title, or status to a person or corporation. Letters patent can be used for the creation of corporations or government offices, or for the granting of city status or a coat of arms. Letters patent are issued for the appointment of representatives of the Crown, such as governors and governors-general of Commonwealth realms, as well as appointing a Royal Commission. In the United Kingdom they are also issued for the creation of peers of the realm. A particular form of letters patent has evolved into the modern patent (referred to as a utility patent or design patent in United States patent law) granting exclusive rights in an invention (or a design in the case of a design patent). In this case it is essential that the written grant should be in the form of a public document so other inventors can consult it to avoid infringement and also to understand how to \\"practice\\" the invention, i.e., put it into practical use.  - The manorial courts were the lowest courts of law in England during the feudal period. They had a civil jurisdiction limited both in subject matter and geography. They dealt with matters over which the lord of the manor had jurisdiction, primarily torts, local contracts and land tenure, and their powers only extended to those who lived within the lands of the manor: the demesne and such lands as the lord had enfeoffed to others, and to those who held land therein. Historians have divided manorial courts into those that were primarily seignorial  based on feudal responsibilities  and those based on separate delegation of authority from the monarch. There were three types of manorial court: the court of the honour; the court baron; and the court customary, also known as the halmote court.  - In England, an unparished area is an area that is not covered by a civil parish (a small administrative division of local government, not to be confused with an ecclesiastical parish). Most urbanised districts of England are either entirely or partly unparished. Many towns and some cities in otherwise rural districts are also unparished areas and therefore no longer have a town council or city council. Some cities and towns which are unparished areas in larger districts (i.e. not districts of themselves) have charter trustees to maintain a historic charter, such as city status (an example being in Bath) or simply the mayoralty of a town.  - In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority. It is an administrative parish, in contrast to an ecclesiastical parish.  - Holyport (pronounced \\"Hollyport\\") is a village in the civil parish of Bray (where at the 2011 Census the population was included), about 2 miles south of Maidenhead in the English county of Berkshire.  - Ockwells Manor is a timber - framed 15th century manor house in the civil parish of Cox Green , adjoining Maidenhead , in the English county of Berkshire . It was previously in the parish of Bray . Ockwells is an early example of a manor built without fortifications , which Sir Nikolaus Pevsner called \`\` the most refined and the most sophisticated timber - framed mansion in England '' .

Ockwells was then owned by Sir John 's uncle , Sir Thomas Fettiplace . It passed through the Fettiplace family , before being owned by the Day family .  - White Waltham is a village and civil parish, west of Maidenhead, in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead in Berkshire, England. It is crossed briefly by the M4 motorway, which along with the Great Western Main Line and all other roads covers of the parish and 'greenspace' which includes cultivated fields covers the most part - this covered (in January 2005) . White Waltham Airfield is in the parish.  - In Anglo-Irish history, the lordship of a manor is a lordship emanating from the feudal system of manorialism. In modern England and Wales it is recognised as a form of property, one of three elements of a manor that may exist separately or be combined and may be held in moieties:  - The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead is a Royal Borough of Berkshire, in South East England. It is home to Windsor Castle, Eton College, Legoland and Ascot Racecourse.   - A unitary authority is a type of local authority that has a single tier and is responsible for all local government functions within its area or performs additional functions which elsewhere in the relevant country are usually performed by national government or a higher level of sub-national government.  - Crossrail is a railway line under development in London and the home counties of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Essex. The central section and a large portion of the line, between in central London and in the south-east, are due to open in December 2018; at that time the service will be named the Elizabeth line. The western section beyond Paddington, to in Berkshire and Heathrow Airport, is due to enter operation in December 2019, completing the new east-west route across Greater London. Part of the eastern section, between and in Essex, was transferred to a precursor service called TfL Rail in 2015; this section will be connected to the central route through central London to Paddington in May 2019.  - Taplow is a village and civil parish in the South Bucks district of Buckinghamshire, England. It sits on the left bank of the River Thames, facing Maidenhead in the neighbouring county of Berkshire, and is roughly west of Burnham and west of Charing Cross in London.  - A manor house was historically the main residence of the lord of the manor. The house formed the administrative centre of a manor in the European feudal system; within its great hall were held the lord's manorial courts, communal meals with manorial tenants and great banquets. The term is today loosely applied to various country houses, frequently dating from the late medieval era, which formerly housed the gentry.  - Windsor Castle is a royal residence at Windsor in the English county of Berkshire. It is notable for its long association with the English and later British royal family and for its architecture. The original castle was built in the 11th century after the Norman invasion of England by William the Conqueror. Since the time of Henry I, it has been used by the reigning monarch and is the longest-occupied palace in Europe. The castle's lavish early 19th-century State Apartments were described by the art historian Hugh Roberts as \\"a superb and unrivalled sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste\\". Inside the castle walls is the 15th-century St George's Chapel, considered by the historian John Martin Robinson to be \\"one of the supreme achievements of English Perpendicular Gothic\\" design.  - Buckinghamshire (or ), abbreviated Bucks, is a county in South East England which borders Greater London to the south east, Berkshire to the south, Oxfordshire to the west, Northamptonshire to the north, Bedfordshire to the north east and Hertfordshire to the east.  - A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount).  - A non-metropolitan county, or colloquially, shire county, is a county-level entity in England that is not a metropolitan county. The counties typically have populations of 300,000 to 1.4 million. The term \\"shire county\\" is, however, an unofficial usage. Many of the non-metropolitan counties bear historic names and most end in the suffix \\"-shire\\" such as Wiltshire or Staffordshire. Of the remainder, some counties had the -shire ending and have lost it over time; such as Devon and Somerset. \\"Shire county\\" is, strictly, a dual-language tautology since the French-derived \\"county\\" means the same as the older Anglo-Saxon word \\"shire\\".  - Pinkneys Green is a village within the north-western bounds of the town of Maidenhead in the English county of Berkshire.

It is one of the core concepts in archaeology, the academic discipline concerned with documenting and interpreting the archaeological record. Archaeological theory is used to interpret the archaeological record for a better understanding of human cultures. The archaeological record can consist of the earliest ancient findings as well as contemporary artifacts. Human activity has had a large impact on the archaeological record. Destructive human processes, such as agriculture and land development, may damage or destroy potential archaeological sites. Other threats to the archaeological record include natural phenomena and scavenging. Archaeology can be a destructive science for the finite resources of the archaeological record are lost to excavation. Therefore archaeologists limit the amount of excavation that they do at each site and keep meticulous records of what is found. The archaeological record is the record of human history, of why civilizations prosper or fail and why cultures change and grow. It is the story of the world that humans have created.  - Uummannaq Fjord is a large fjord system in the northern part of western Greenland, the largest after Kangertittivaq fjord in eastern Greenland.

The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468.

Formally a settlement , it is famous for the discovery of eight mummified bodies in 1972 . Four of the mummies are currently on display in the Greenland National Museum .  - Archaeology, or archeology, is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture. The archaeological record consists of artifacts, architecture, biofacts or ecofacts, and cultural landscapes. Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities. In North America, archaeology is considered a sub-field of anthropology, while in Europe archaeology is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines.  - Geologically, a fjord or fiord is a long, narrow inlet with steep sides or cliffs, created by glacial erosion. There are many fjords on the coasts of Alaska, British Columbia, Chile, Greenland, Iceland, the Kerguelen Islands, New Zealand, Norway, Novaya Zemlya, Labrador, Nunavut, Newfoundland, Scotland, and Washington state. Norway's coastline is estimated at with fjords, but only when fjords are excluded.  - Greenland  is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium.

The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate.  - An archaeological site is a place (or group of physical sites) in which evidence of past activity is preserved (either prehistoric or historic or contemporary), and which has been, or may be, investigated using the discipline of archaeology and represents a part of the archaeological record.

It is connected to the Atlantic via Davis Strait and the Labrador Sea. The narrower Nares Strait connects Baffin Bay with the Arctic Ocean. The bay is not navigable most of the year because of the ice cover and high density of floating ice and icebergs in the open areas. However, a polynya of about , known as the North Water, opens in summer on the north near Smith Sound. Most of the aquatic life of the bay is concentrated near that region. Extent. The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of Baffin Bay as follows: History. The area of the bay has been inhabited since  . Around  1200, the initial Dorset settlers were replaced by the Thule (the later Inuit) peoples. Recent excavations also suggest that the Norse colonization of the Americas reached the shores of Baffin Bay sometime between the 10th and 14th centuries. The English explorer John Davis was the first recorded European to enter the bay, arriving in 1585. In 1612, a group of English merchants formed the \\"Company of Merchants of London, Discoverers of the North-West Passage\\". Their governor Thomas Smythe organized five expeditions to explore the northern coasts of Canada in search of a maritime passage to the Far East. Henry Hudson and Thomas Button's explored Hudson Bay, William Gibbons Labrador, and Robert Bylot Hudson Strait and the area which became known as Baffin's Bay after his pilot William Baffin. Aboard the \\"Discovery\\", Baffin charted the area and named Lancaster, Smith, and Jones Sounds after members of his company.

The Broncos traveled to Cleveland Browns Stadium to face the Cleveland Browns in what would again be a primarily defensive struggle. The Broncos again had a 100-yard rusher in Tatum Bell, with 115 yards (and also 1 touchdown), and also had a 100-yard receiver in Javon Walker, with 107 yards. Former Bronco Reuben Droughns was held to just 33 yards rushing and 27 yards receiving (60 yards total). Jake Plummer again struggled, throwing 1 touchdown (to rookie Brandon Marshall, the first of his career), but also 2 interceptions. Although Denver committed 2 turnovers, they also forced three; one interception (by Champ Bailey, making it three consecutive games with an interception) and two fumbles. After Jake Plummer threw his second interception of the day in their own red zone, the Browns scored their only points when Charlie Frye threw a touchdown pass to Joe Jurevicius in the fourth quarter, only the second touchdown allowed by the Broncos all year. It also ended their second 11-quarter streak without a touchdown allowed of the season. Denver at the time had only allowed 44 points all season, the lowest in the league. However, in one of the few items of bad news for the Broncos, left tackle Matt Lepsis suffered a season-ending knee injury.

Kenneth Gergen formulated additional classifications, which include the strategic manipulator, the pastiche personality, and the relational self. The strategic manipulator is a person who begins to regard all senses of identity merely as role-playing exercises, and who gradually becomes alienated from his or her social \\"self\\". The pastiche personality abandons all aspirations toward a true or \\"essential\\" identity, instead viewing social interactions as opportunities to play out, and hence become, the roles they play. Finally, the relational self is a perspective by which persons abandon all sense of exclusive self, and view all sense of identity in terms of social engagement with others. For Gergen, these strategies follow one another in phases, and they are linked to the increase in popularity of postmodern culture and the rise of telecommunications technology. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What perspective embraces individual self and abandoned social engagements?","output":"Imagine you have a big box of costumes. The strategic manipulator is like someone who tries on different costumes and pretends to be a different character for each one, but starts to forget who they really are. The pastiche personality is like someone who doesn't worry about having a \\"real\\" costume and just keeps changing and mixing them up. The relational self is like someone who only sees themselves as part of the group they're playing with, and their costume depends on who they're playing with at the time.

Solve 0 = 35*h + 26*h - 366 for h.","output":"To find the solution for the given equation 0 = 35h + 26h - 366, first we need to simplify it by combining the like terms. In this case, we need to combine the terms with the variable h. So, let's add 35h and 26h together: 0 = (35h + 26h) - 366 0 = 61h - 366 Now, our equation has been simplified as 0 = 61h - 366. To solve for h, we need to isolate the variable h by moving all other terms to the other side of the equation. To do this, we will first add 366 to both sides of the equation, which will cancel out the -366 term: 0 + 366 = 61h - 366 + 366 366 = 61h Now, we need to isolate h by dividing both sides of the equation by 61: 366 / 61 = 61h / 61 6 = h Now, we have found the value of h, which is 6.

Please answer a question about the following article about Napoleon: Napoléon Bonaparte (/nəˈpoʊliən, -ˈpoʊljən/; French: [napɔleɔ̃ bɔnapaʁt], born Napoleone di Buonaparte; 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars. As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. Often considered one of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. He also remains one of the most celebrated and controversial political figures in Western history. In civil affairs, Napoleon had a major long-term impact by bringing liberal reforms to the territories that he conquered, especially the Low Countries, Switzerland, and large parts of modern Italy and Germany. He implemented fundamental liberal policies in France and throughout Western Europe.[note 1] His lasting legal achievement, the Napoleonic Code, has been adopted in various forms by a quarter of the world's legal systems, from Japan to Quebec.

You can mark this as one more data point in the critical debate over Ryan's workout routine, his unbelievable 6 percent body fat, and whether it's better to be jacked or ripped. Unfortunately, the Time photos do not display Ryan's wildly famous but as-yet-unseen killer abs. The photos were taken in December last year, when Ryan was a finalist for the magazine's Person of the Year, and when documenting his elusive abs was not such a pressing election issue.      Gazing at Ryan's admirable muscle mass, you can't help but think of Sarah Palin's modeling of tights and shortish shorts for Runner's World. Both are a slightly awkward, somewhat self-conscious attempt to bring some youth and sexiness to a Republican brand. But Palin, at least, waited until June 2009 -- when it was safe to fan speculation about her own presidential candidacy long after John McCain lost the 2008 race. The day of the vice-presidential debate, Ryan might not want to encourage that comparison.      Want to add to this story?

What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose family is in danger? from the following article ?  A former police detective and Vietnam veteran in New Orleans and a recovering alcoholic, Dave Robicheaux, is living a quiet life in the swamplands of Louisiana with his wife Annie. The couple's tranquility is shattered one day when a drug smuggler's plane crashes in a lake, right before their eyes. Robicheaux succeeds in rescuing a lone survivor, a Salvadoran girl, whom he and Annie quickly adopt and name Alafair. With the arrival of a DEA officer named Dautrieve and an inherent connection to Bubba Rocque, the leading drug kingpin in the area and Robicheaux's childhood friend from New Iberia, Dave becomes involved in solving the case and consequently finds himself and his family in danger. Robicheaux is assaulted by two thugs as a warning. With help from his former girl-friend Robin, an exotic dancer who still has feelings for him, he continues to investigate. His longtime acquaintance Bubba denies any involvement, but Dave warns him and Bubba's sultry wife Claudette that he is going to find out who is behind all this and do something about it. He tracks down one of the men who attacked him, Eddie Keats, and splits his head open with a pool cue in Keat's own bar. Killers come to the Robicheaux home late one night. Robicheaux is unable to prevent his wife Annie from being killed. He falls off the wagon and neglects the young girl they adopted. Robin comes to stay with them. Clearing his head, Robicheaux seeks vengeance against the three killers. He first goes after a large man called Toot, chasing him onto a streetcar and causing his death. Bubba and Claudette reassure a local mob boss named Giancano that they will not let this vendetta get out of hand, and Bubba gets into a fistfight with Robicheaux, falsely suspecting him of an affair with Claudette. Eddie Keats is found dead before Robicheaux can get to him. Going after the last and most dangerous of the killers, Victor Romero, he knows that someone else must be giving them orders.

Context: In 1968 Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle published The Sound Pattern of English (SPE), the basis for generative phonology. In this view, phonological representations are sequences of segments made up of distinctive features. These features were an expansion of earlier work by Roman Jakobson, Gunnar Fant, and Morris Halle. The features describe aspects of articulation and perception, are from a universally fixed set, and have the binary values + or −. There are at least two levels of representation: underlying representation and surface phonetic representation. Ordered phonological rules govern how underlying representation is transformed into the actual pronunciation (the so-called surface form). An important consequence of the influence SPE had on phonological theory was the downplaying of the syllable and the emphasis on segments. Furthermore, the generativists folded morphophonology into phonology, which both solved and created problems.

In February 1918, the Montana legislature had passed the Montana Sedition Act, which was a model for the federal version. In combination, these laws criminalized criticism of the U.S. government, military, or symbols through speech or other means. The Montana Act led to the arrest of over 200 individuals and the conviction of 78, mostly of German or Austrian descent. Over 40 spent time in prison.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who by 10 September he had glued the Portland Vase whole again?, using the article: The highlight of Doubleday's career came after 7 February 1845 when a young man, who later admitted having spent the prior week \\"indulging in intemperance\\", smashed the Portland Vase, an example of Roman cameo glass and among the most famous glass items in the world, into hundreds of pieces. After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\". The British Museum awarded Doubleday an additional £25 (equivalent to £2,500 in 2016) for his work.At the time the restoration was termed \\"masterly\\" and Doubleday was lauded by The Gentleman's Magazine for demonstrating \\"skilful ingenuity\\" and \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\". In 2006 William Andrew Oddy, a former keeper of conservation at the museum, noted that the achievement \\"must rank him in the forefront of the craftsmen-restorers of his time.\\" Doubleday's restoration would remain for more than 100 years until the adhesive grew increasingly discoloured.

The master recording of \\"Eight Miles High\\" was recorded on January 24 and 25, 1966, at Columbia Studios in Hollywood, with record producer Allen Stanton guiding the band through the recording process. John Einarson has noted that the influence of Coltrane's saxophone playing and, in particular, his song \\"India\\" from the Impressions album, can be clearly heard in \\"Eight Miles High\\"--most noticeably in McGuinn's recurring twelve-string guitar solo. In addition to this striking guitar motif, the song is also highlighted by Chris Hillman's driving and hypnotic bass line, Crosby's chunky rhythm guitar playing and the band's ethereal harmonies.  \\"Eight Miles High\\" also exhibits the influence of sitarist Ravi Shankar, particularly in the droning quality of the song's vocal melody and in McGuinn's guitar playing. However, the song does not actually feature the sound of the sitar, despite the Byrds having appeared brandishing the instrument at a contemporary press conference held to promote the single. In a 1966 promotional interview, which was added to the expanded CD reissue of the Fifth Dimension album, Crosby said that the song's ending made him \\"feel like a plane landing.\\"  An earlier version of \\"Eight Miles High\\" was recorded with Al Schmitt at RCA Studios in Los Angeles on December 22, 1965, but Columbia Records refused to release that recording because it had not been produced at a Columbia-owned studio. McGuinn has since stated that he believes this original version of the song to be more spontaneous sounding than the better known Columbia release. That opinion was echoed by Crosby, who commented, \\"It was a stunner, it was better, it was stronger. It had more flow to it. It was the way we wanted it to be.\\" This original version of \\"Eight Miles High\\" initially saw release on the 1987 archival album Never Before and was also included as a bonus track on the 1996 Columbia/Legacy CD reissue of Fifth Dimension.

Panel Says The United Nations said on Thursday that the Islamic State has committed genocide against the Yazidi minority in Iraq and Syria. GENEVA — Islamic State forces have committed genocide and other war crimes in a continuing effort to exterminate the Yazidi religious minority in Syria and Iraq, United Nations investigators said on Thursday, urging stronger international action to halt the killing and to prosecute the terrorist group. The investigators detailed mass killings of Yazidi men and boys who refused to convert to Islam, saying they were shot in the head or their throats were slit, often in front of their families, littering roadsides with corpses. Dozens of mass graves have been uncovered in areas recaptured from Islamic State and are being investigated. The investigators have produced 11 reports documenting wide-ranging crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by many parties to the five-year-old civil war in Syria, but in a report released on Thursday, they invoked the crime of genocide. They based their findings on actions taken by the Islamic State since August 2014 against 400,000 members of the Yazidi community, followers of a centuries-old religion drawing on many faiths. “Genocide has occurred and is ongoing,” Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro, chairman of the panel, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, said in a statement. “ISIS has subjected every Yazidi woman, child or man that it has captured to the most horrific atrocities,” he told reporters in Geneva, using an acronym for the Islamic State. “ISIS permanently sought to erase the Yazidis through killing, sexual slavery, enslavement, torture, inhuman and degrading treatment, and forcible transfer causing serious bodily and mental harm.” Those acts, he said, clearly demonstrated its intent to destroy the Yazidi community in whole or in part. More than 3,200 Yazidi women were still being held by Islamic State fighters, mostly in Syria, the panel found. “The crime of genocide must trigger much more assertive action at the political level, including at the Security Council,” Mr. Pinheiro said, calling for the case to be referred to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, or to another international tribunal. “Nothing has been done to save these people, and we hope for stronger action by the international community,” Mr. Pinheiro said, highlighting the obligation for countries under the 1948 genocide convention to take action to prevent it. The report compiled by the panel — based on interviews with survivors, religious leaders, smugglers and medical personnel, among others — had identified individuals responsible for acts of genocide and provided “a road map for prosecution,” said Carla Del Ponte, a Swiss lawyer on the commission and a former prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The commission on Syria has repeatedly recommended referral of the crimes to the International Criminal Court, but no action has followed from the Security Council, where Russia, a permanent member and the closest ally of Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, wields a veto. The commission had collected names and details of perpetrators and had shared information with some national authorities, said Vitit Muntarbhorn, a Thai legal scholar on the commission, who called the report “a wonderful gift” to the five permanent members of the Security Council “so that they can consider acting together.” Secretary of State John Kerry said in March that the United States had determined that Islamic State had committed genocide against Yazidis, Christians and Shiite Muslims, but Andrew Clapham, an international law professor at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, said the rigorous analysis presented by the commission of inquiry would carry more legal weight. The Yazidis came to broad public attention after Islamic State fighters captured Mount Sinjar, in northern Iraq, in 2014 and engaged in systematic slaughter. Kurdish and Yazidi fighters retook Sinjar last fall. Mass killings were only part of the Islamic State’s systematic campaign to eliminate the Yazidi community, the panel found, citing documents that revealed careful planning for treatment of the community after it was overrun and a “massive organizational effort” to coordinate the actions of fighters across Iraq. “ISIS made no secret of its intent to destroy the Yazidis of Sinjar, and that is one of the elements that allowed us to conclude their actions amount to genocide,” Ms. Del Ponte said. In addition to the killings, Islamic State fighters systematically separated Yazidi men and women and carried out rape, sexual mutilation and sterilization to prevent the birth of Yazidi babies, and they transferred captured Yazidi children to the fighters’ families and training camps, cutting them off from Yazidi beliefs and practices and “erasing their identities as Yazidis.” The panel reported in harrowing detail the acute trauma experienced by women and girls as young as 9 who were sold off as spoils of war to become sex slaves of Islamic State fighters, routinely raped and punished with extreme violence if they resisted or tried to escape. Islamic State fighters often targeted younger Yazidi children as a means of punishing their mothers, the report said. It cited an account of a fighter who killed several children after their mother’s effort to escape failed: The mother was then beaten and raped because she cried over their deaths. “No other religious group present in ISIS-controlled areas of Syria and Iraq has been subjected to the destruction that the Yazidis have suffered,” the report said. Summary:","output":"The United Nations said that the bad group called ISIS hurt the Yazidi people in Iraq and Syria very badly. These people are not safe right now because of this group. Yazidi men and boys who said no to follow the same religion as ISIS were killed in a very bad way. Many people are trying to stop ISIS and make everything safe again for everyone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Background: The Table above includes the ideal mechanical advantage of each class of lever. The mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input force. The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use of the machine. Because all machines must overcome some friction, the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world.  Paragraph: John designed a hypothetical lever that would have ideal mechanical advantage. He labeled the lever as lever A.

Answer the following question: This article: Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 – 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia.

While the head gaskets were correct, I had to order some of these gaskets separately because the ones included in the kit were incorrect. Purchased this particular kit because of the excellent price. I wish I had just gone ahead and purchased the kit offered by Advance Auto Parts instead. It was 50 more, but at least it probably would have been correct. Very disappointed in how much money was wasted here. A partial refund by the seller would be appropriate. Answer: Answer:","output":"The tone of this product review is negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment in the product's compatibility with their car, despite the part being listed as suitable for their specific vehicle model. They mention having to order some gaskets separately because the ones that came with the kit were incorrect, which added to their frustration. Furthermore, the reviewer compares the product unfavorably to a more expensive, alternative kit that they believe would have been a better choice to purchase. They express their dissatisfaction with the money wasted on this kit and suggest that a partial refund by the seller would be appropriate. Overall, the reviewer's tone is negative. They convey frustration and disappointment with the product's inaccuracy, the need to purchase additional parts, and the overall poor value for money. The mention of a more expensive, yet potentially more effective, alternative product further emphasizes the negative tone of the review, as it suggests that the reviewer regrets not choosing that product instead of the one they are currently reviewing."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie plot title: Veronica Guerin Movie plot: Veronica Guerin is a feisty crime reporter for the Sunday Independent. Suddenly aware of how much Dublin's illegal drug trade is encroaching upon the lives of its working class citizens, especially the children, she becomes determined to expose the men responsible for its spread. Guerin begins by interviewing the pre-pubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing estates. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan. In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch, a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved. As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets. When a bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her, she is shot in the leg and the life of her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and he savagely beats her, she becomes more determined to expose him for who he is. Rather than press charges against him, which would necessitate her removal from the story, she forges ahead with her investigation. On 26 June 1996, Guerin appears in court to respond to an accumulation of parking tickets and numerous penalties for speeding that she has ignored.

Mina is dressed in school uniform (with a head scarf), has one arm in a cast and is holding a school bag in the other. She meets a lot of people on her way and most of them try to help her while others are surprisingly apathetic to her situation. Eventually, the movie takes a turn when the girl looks into the camera for the first time, breaking the fourth wall, and someone shouts from off-screen, \\"Mina, don't look into the camera!\\" The movie is a real life capture of events thereon (or that is how it seems).

Question: Information:  - Dissection (from Latin ' \\"to cut to pieces\\"; also called anatomization), is the dismembering of the body of a deceased animal or plant to study its anatomical structure. Autopsy is used in pathology and forensic medicine to determine the cause of death in humans. It is carried out by or demonstrated to biology and anatomy students in high school and medical school. Less advanced courses typically focus on smaller subjects, such as small formaldehyde-preserved animals, while the more advanced courses normally use cadavers. Consequently, dissection is typically conducted in a morgue or in an anatomy lab.  - Deeds of Flesh is a four-piece death metal band from Los Osos, California, U.S. They were formed in 1993 by Jacoby Kingston, Erik Lindmark (Born 1973 ) and Joey Heaslet and are still active. They founded their own label, Unique Leader Records, which has since become home to a number of other death metal bands from around the world. Deeds of Flesh have released eight studio albums, their most recent being \\"Portals to Canaan\\" which was released in 2013.  - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.  - Path of the Weakening is the third studio release by the American death metal band Deeds of Flesh . It was released in 1999 .  - A blast beat is a drum beat that originated in hardcore punk and grindcore, and is often associated with extreme metal and more recently black metal and thrash. It is utilised by many different styles of metal. In Adam MacGregor's definition, \\"the blast-beat generally comprises a repeated, sixteenth-note figure played at a very fast tempo, and divided uniformly among the bass drum, snare, and ride, crash, or hi-hat cymbal.\\" Blast beats have been described as, \\"maniacal percussive explosions, less about rhythm per se than sheer sonic violence\\".  - Torture (from the Latin \\"tortus\\", \\"twisted\\") is the act of deliberately inflicting physical or psychological pain on an organism in order to fulfill some desire of the torturer or compel some action from the victim. Torture, by definition, is a knowing and intentional act; deeds which unknowingly or negligently inflict pain without a specific intent to do so are not typically considered torture.  - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.  - In musical terminology, tempo (\\"time\\" in Italian; plural: \\"tempi\\" ) is the speed or pace of a given piece or subsection thereof, how fast or slow. Tempo is related to meter and is usually measured by beats per minute, with the beats being a division of the measures, though tempo is often indicated by terms which have acquired standard ranges of beats per minute or assumed by convention without indication. Tempo may be separated from articulation, or articulation may be indicated along with tempo, and tempo contributes to the overall texture. While the ability to hold a steady tempo is a desirable skill, tempo is changeable, and often indicated by a conductor or drummer. While practicing, an electronic or mechanical device, a metronome, may indicate the tempo, as one usually works one's way up to being able to perform at the proper tempo. In other words it is the speed at which a passage of music is or should be played.    After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'path of the weakening' exhibits the relationship of 'record label'. Find the answer from the choices below.

Choices: [-] Michael is a Catholic.; [-] Hunter is a Catholic.;","output":"On a daily basis, Michael always prays, but Hunter sees no need to. Michael is a Catholic, and as such, prayer is an integral aspect of his faith and daily life. Michael might feel that his prayers help him stay connected with God, seek guidance, give thanks, or find solace in times of need. As a devout believer and follower of Catholicism, he prioritizes communication with the divine as an essential part of his religious practice. Consequently, this regular ritual—or discipline—provides him with a sense of meaning, stability, and spiritual growth. In contrast, Hunter is not a Catholic, which explains his lack of interest or necessity in engaging in prayer on a daily basis. He may subscribe to a different belief system, be an atheist or agnostic, or simply have a contrasting perspective when it comes to religion and spirituality. As such, Hunter might not see any practical or emotional benefits from praying daily like Michael does. Instead, Hunter may choose to cope with life's challenges, seek meaning, and achieve personal growth through activities or philosophies that do not involve daily religious rituals.  Given their differences in beliefs and approaches to life, it is important for Michael and Hunter to coexist respectfully and empathetically. Mutual understanding, tolerance, and openness to learning from one another can help bridge any gaps. Consequently, as long as they respect one another's perspectives and provide support to each other when needed, their differing religious outlooks need not be a point of contention, but rather an opportunity to grow, learn, and find commonalities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is in area, bordered by Thailand to the northwest, Laos to the northeast, Vietnam to the east, and the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest.  - Sourigna Vongsa ( ) was the king of Lan Xang and during his period, it considered the golden age of Laos. He ascended to the throne in 1637.  - Stung Treng is the capital of Stung Treng Province, Cambodia. It is located in the western part of the Virachey National Park. It is the major city (and capital) of both the district and province and has a population of 29,665 (2009). In Lao, the city's name is known as \\"Xieng Teng\\".  - Attapeu, also written as Attopu or Attapu, is the capital of Attapeu Province, Laos. It is the southernmost among provincial capitals in Laos opposite Phongsali in the north.  - The term Champa refers to a collection of independent Cham polities that extended across the coast of what is today central and southern Vietnam from approximately the 2nd century through 19th century (1832), before being absorbed and annexed by the Vietnamese state. The kingdom was known variously as \\"nagara Campa\\" (Sanskrit:  ) in the Chamic and Cambodian inscriptions, in Vietnamese (\\"Chiêm Thành\\" in Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary) and (Zhànchéng) in Chinese records.  - Kham Nai was king of the southern Laotian Kingdom of Champasak from 1856 - 1858 .  - The Kingdom of Champasak (Lao:  [càmpàsák]) or Bassac, (17131946) was in 1713 proclaimed a Lao kingdom under Nokasad, a grandson of King Sourigna Vongsa, the last king of Lan Xang; and son-in-law of the Cambodian King Chey Chettha IV.

Although the Kingdom of Champasak had connections to Cambodia through King Nokasad (a son-in-law of the Cambodian King Chey Chettha IV), it was still a Laotian entity.

Title: Too Late for Tears Movie plot: Don DeFore and Lizabeth Scott Jane and Alan Palmer (Scott and Kennedy) are driving to a party in the Hollywood Hills one evening when someone in another car throws a suitcase into the back seat of their convertible. They open it and discover packs of cash. They are chased by yet another car for a short time but get away. Back at their upper-middle-class Hollywood apartment, they examine the cash. Jane wants to keep the money, but Alan wants to take it to the police. Alan places the suitcase and cash in a locker at Union Station, hoping he can sway Jane into surrendering it to the police. A few days later while Alan is at work, Danny (Duryea) shows up at the Palmers' apartment, tells Jane he is a detective and quickly learns she has begun spending the money. Her husband Alan likewise becomes upset when he finds she has been running up bills, clearly planning to spend the money they had agreed to store and leave untouched. Jane makes a deal with Danny to split the money. Planning to kill him, she drives Danny up into the hills on the pretense they will retrieve the cash where it's been buried. He suspects her intentions and flees. She and Alan plan a romantic evening together to make amends for their squabbling about the money. She asks Danny to meet her in the evening at Westlake Park near downtown Los Angeles, where she and Alan will be taking a boat ride. Jane has planned to kill her husband Alan in the boat but is stopped by a pang of guilt and begs him to take her to shore, then blurts out that she wants to send the claim check for the locker to the police. Unaware of why his wife is upset, Alan wants to continue with the boat ride. Hoping to find cigarettes, he picks up her bag and his own gun falls out. The startled look on his face tells Jane he knows straight off what she had in mind, she grabs the gun, they struggle and she shoots, killing him. When Danny sees the body he fears getting involved in a murder, but Jane threatens to tell the police he killed her husband unless he helps her.

They meet Mathias, a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri, Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins. At the top, they find an abandoned camp and a shaft in the center. The group cannot call for help since Eric's phone has no signal. They hear a cell phone ringing from somewhere inside the ruins. Believing it is Heinrich's phone ringing, the rest of the group lowers Mathias down the shaft with a rope. The rope breaks and Mathias falls, becoming completely paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans, but to no success. In anger, Amy throws a clump of vines at them and hits a young boy, whom the Mayans promptly kill.

Fogerty and Nathan Crow, sued Eon, MGM, Universal Music and Universal Studios for copyright infringement over \\"The World Is Not Enough\\", alleging that it derived from their song \\"This Game We Play\\", which was submitted to MGM executives in February 1999 for consideration for the soundtrack of The Thomas Crown Affair. Their claim centered on a four-note sequence in \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" which they alleged was identical to part of \\"This Game We Play\\". When the songwriters were gathering evidence, one posed as an employee of composer James Horner to contact Don Black and solicit his services for Ocean's Eleven. They recorded their conversation with Black, trying to get him to disclose when he and Arnold composed \\"The World Is Not Enough\\", and contacted Shirley Manson in a similar manner.The case was argued in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee in June 2004. The court rejected the plaintiffs' claim, concluding that Arnold independently composed \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" and it did not share a passage with \\"This Game We Play\\". The plaintiffs conceded that Arnold did not have access to \\"This Game We Play\\" after journal entries, delivery invoices, telephone and computer records, written declarations from  Michael G.

Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head.

Firstly, there might be a discussion and confrontation by the boss regarding an email sent by the individual. It is implied that the content of the email may have been inappropriate or offensive, since the person perceives this as a \\"hellish sequence of events\\" and hesitates to repeat the words. Secondly, there might be some initial confusion or miscommunication between the individual and their boss concerning the specific email being discussed. This is indicated by the mention of another email, which the individual initially thought was the subject of the conversation.  After realizing the true topic of discussion, the individual is likely to experience a strong urge to escape the situation and deny responsibility for writing the offensive email. This feeling is heightened by the acknowledgment that lying would only exacerbate the problem. Throughout the conversation, the individual is expected to feel significant anxiety, guilt, or remorse, taking into account the email's negative consequences for both the individual and possibly for others who might have been affected. The outcome of this conversation is uncertain based on the information given in the passage. Depending on the severity of the content and the reaction of the boss, potential consequences could range from a reprimand, mandated employee sensitivity training, or even formal disciplinary action such as suspension or termination.

Question: Article: A deadly strain of avian flu may have passed between people for the first time, experts believe.The avian influenza A (H7N9) virus is thought to have been transmitted between father and daughter in eastern China, according to research published online by the British Medical Journal (BMJ). The findings provide the strongest evidence yet of H7N9 transmission between humans since its discover in February, but its ability to transmit itself _ \\"limited and non-sustainable\\" by the Chinese researchers behind the study.At the end of June 133 cases had been reported, including 43 deaths. Most infections have been among people visiting markets, selling live birds or among those who had contact with live poultry  in the seven to 10 days before becoming ill. The latest study examined the case of a 60-year-old father who regularly visited a live poultry market and became ill five to six days after his last visit in March. He was admitted to hospital with fever, cough and shortness of breath. Despite intensive care treatment he died of multiple organ failure on 4 May. His 32-year-old daughter, who was previously healthy, looked after him at his bedside before he was admitted to intensive care. She had no known exposure to live poultry before falling ill with a very high temperature, cough and fever. The daughter developed symptoms six days after her last contact with her father and was admitted to hospital where she died of multiple organ failure on 24 April. Follow-up investigations  uncovered almost genetically identical virus strains from each patient, suggesting transmission from father to daughter. Another 43 people were also tested who had had close contact with the father, daughter or both.

For years now, they have carried his name like a battle standard into the ideological trenches.      Benedict apparently would like them to knock it off.      In private letters published on Thursday by the German newspaper Bild, Benedict, who in retirement has remained studiously quiet through the controversies over Francis’ fitness to lead the church, says that the “anger” expressed by some of his staunchest defenders risks tarnishing his own pontificate.      “I can well understand the deep-seated pain that the end of my pontificate caused you and many others. But for some — and it seems to me for you as well — the pain has turned to anger, which no longer just affects the abdication but my person and the entirety of my pontificate,” Benedict wrote in a Nov. 23, 2017, letter to Cardinal Walter Brandmüller of Germany. “In this way the pontificate itself is being devalued and conflated with the sadness about the situation of the church today.”      Requests to representatives of Benedict and Cardinal Brandmüller for comment and authentication were not returned early Thursday. Bild provided the letters in their entirety to The Times. ||||| Benedict XVI has reprimanded a German cardinal for criticising his decision to step down, arguing that “anger” about his resignation has devalued his papacy, and is being “melted into the sorrow” about the Church’s problems.      The Pope Emeritus made the remarks in recent letters to Cardinal Walter Brandmüller, one of the “dubia” cardinals who has publicly challenged Pope Francis over his family life teaching.      At one level, the letters can be read as a rebuke to Pope Francis’ critics, many of whom felt betrayed and angered by Benedict XVI’s decision to resign and have seen the Pope Emeritus as a rallying point for Francis resistance.      On the other hand, critics of this Pope are likely to seize on Benedict XVI's use of the word “sorrow” about the Church’s situation as a sign that Francis’ pontificate is going in the wrong direction.      The overriding concern from Benedict appears to be that his papacy is being devalued by those using it as a political weapon to undermine Francis.      In the correspondence, obtained by German Newspaper “Bild,” the 89-year-old cardinal complained to Benedict that his decision to step down precipitated a crisis in the Church and caused serious harm.      But the Pope Emeritus gives him a sharp reply.      “I can very well understand the deep-seated pain that the end of my papacy has inflicted on you and many others. However, for some people and – it seems to me – also for you, the pain has turned into an anger that no longer merely concerns my resignation, but increasingly also my person and my papacy as a whole,” Benedict writes.      “By this, a papacy itself is now being devalued and melted into the sorrow about the situation in which the Church currently finds itself.”      He goes on: “If you know a better way [i.e. resignation] and therefore think that you can judge the one chosen by me, please tell me.”      Following his dramatic 2013 decision to resign, Benedict XVI promised to remain “hidden to the world” although he has been publicly embraced by Francis who describes his presence in the Vatican as like having a “wise grandfather living at home”.      But many of the Pope Emeritus’ supporters saw him as the standard bearer of orthodoxy and a restorationist movement in Catholicism which the Latin American Pontiff has undermined with his vision of a less doctrinally rigid and more missionary Church serving the poor and marginalised.      Divisions between Benedict and Francis are also at the centre of Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò’s explosive allegations against this Pope concerning Archbishop McCarrick’s sexual misconduct with seminarians. In an 11-page testimony released last month, Archbishop Viganò called on Francis to resign for allegedly lifting sanctions against McCarrick imposed by Benedict XVI.      Archbishop Viganò, who has yet to produce documentary evidence to back up his claims, was present with Cardinal Brandmüller during a conference in Rome in April where the keynote speaker, US Cardinal Raymond Burke, spoke about the limits of papal power.      Cardinals Burke and Brandmüller are among four prelates – two of whom have died – who set out a series of questions, known as “dubia,” to Francis over his family life document “Amoris Laetitia”. Cardinal Burke has said that if the “dubia” are not answered then he could make a public correction of the pontiff.      In 2016 Cardinal Brandmüller presented the case against Benedict XVI’s resignation, including his decision to take the title “Pope Emeritus”, something he believed risk causing divisions.      The cardinal, the former President of the Pontifical Committee for Historical Sciences from 1998 to 2009, describes as “necessary and urgent” new “legislation that would define and regulate” the status of a former Pope.      Those opposed to Benedict XVI’s decision have argued that resigning the papacy de-sacralises, or de-mystifies, the office of the Successor of St Peter. |||||","output":"Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI has chastised a German cardinal, Walter Brandmüller, for criticizing his decision to resign, stating that the anger expressed by his supporters risks devaluing his papacy. In private letters published by German newspaper Bild, Benedict addresses the deep pain and anger his decision has caused some of his staunchest defenders. He reprimands Cardinal Brandmüller for allowing his anger to affect his judgment and actions. The former Pope's concern appears to be that his papacy is being used as a political weapon to undermine his successor, Pope Francis. This is evident in the ongoing controversies surrounding Pope Francis' fitness to lead the Church and allegations that he shielded an abusive American cardinal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

All the characters are great, and the story while bizarre, is fascinating and very interesting, plus Nicole Kidman is simply amazing in this!. It's very hard to describe this movie, because it really is quite bizarre, it's a comedy/romance, one minute then it turns into a thriller the next, however it was still very entertaining all the same, plus Nicole's Russian accent was fantastic, and extremely convincing. Chaplin and Kidman had very good chemistry together, and i loved Vincent Cassel's performance!, plus some of the plot twists really took me by surprise!. The ending was very cute, and it's unpredictable throughout!, plus this movie is quite underrated as well!. You will feel sorry for Chaplin and the way that he is scammed, and i thought all the characters were really likable, plus the finale is especially good.This is Nicole's movie though, and she carries it with her incredibly sexy performance!. This is a great little film, that's very unique, and creative, with some great plot twists and wonderful performances!, i highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good!. Jez Butterworth does a very good job here, with great camera work, solid angles and keeping the film at a fast pace!. The Acting is wonderful!. Nicole Kidman, is stunningly gorgeous!, and is amazing as always, she is incredibly sexy, very likable, had one of the coolest accents, added a lot of presence, had very good chemistry with Ben Chaplin, and had a very mysterious character!, she was amazing. (Kidman Rules!!!!). Ben Chaplin is great here, he is extremely likable, had a cool character, had very good chemistry with Kidman, the only thing i didn't like was him taking out his anger out on Kidman, even though what she did was wrong, and i loved how he got revenge in the end!. Vincent Cassel is fantastic as the main villain, yes he was OTT, but he was very intense and quite creepy at times, this role was perfect for him. Mathieu Kassovitz is OK here, but didn't have much to do. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5 Choose your answer. What is the sentiment of this review?

Q:Given the following passage  \\"On 25 November at the Korean western front, the PVA 13th Army Group attacked and overran the ROK II Corps at the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River, and then decimated the US 2nd Infantry Division on the UN forces' right flank.

On 27 November at the Korean eastern front, a U.S. 7th Infantry Division Regimental Combat Team (3,000 soldiers) and the U.S. 1st Marine Division (12,000–15,000 marines) were unprepared for the PVA 9th Army Group's three-pronged encirclement tactics at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, but they managed to escape under Air Force and X Corps support fire—albeit with some 15,000 collective casualties.\\",  answer the following question.

Hermann is a leading American wind band conductor and educator and is currently Director of Bands and Professor of Music at Tennessee Technological University in Cookeville, Tennessee. He is also the current President of the American Bandmasters Association. Sentence: Joseph W. Hermann knows what a flute is.","output":"Based on the provided text, it is highly probable that the sentence \\"Joseph W. Hermann knows what a flute is\\" is true. As a leading American wind band conductor and educator, Joseph W. Hermann would likely have extensive knowledge of various musical instruments, including wind instruments like the flute. Additionally, his current position as Director of Bands and Professor of Music at Tennessee Technological University in Cookeville, Tennessee, reinforces the likelihood that he is well-versed in numerous instruments. The flute is a prominent member of the woodwind family and is commonly used in wind bands, orchestras, and various musical ensembles. As a wind band conductor, Joseph W. Hermann would need to understand the characteristics, capabilities, and specific role of each instrument in the ensemble, including the flute. This knowledge would be crucial to creating balanced and effective arrangements and interpreting the musical pieces that his ensembles perform. Furthermore, as an educator, Joseph W. Hermann would be expected to teach and guide music students in improving their skills and understanding of different instruments. Given that the flute is a typical instrument for music students to learn and study, his familiarity and expertise with the instrument would be essential to his career as a music professor. Finally, considering Joseph W. Hermann's involvement in the American Bandmasters Association as its current President, it can be inferred that his expertise in instrumental music, including the flute, is both recognized and respected among his peers and the larger music community.

You can predict the angle of the reflected light. Imagine a ball bouncing off a surface. Light can do the same thing. That is, assuming the surface is shiny. So how do you know where light will go after it strikes a shiny surface? It depends on how the light initially strikes the shiny object. Light does not always go straight toward a surface. Therefore, not all light bounces straight back. Sometimes, light can hit a surface at an angle. The angle at which it strikes the surface tells us how it will bounce off. While light is different to a ball, they react in a similar manner. Many sports rely on knowledge of reflection. Pool players know a lot about reflection. They take great care when they strike the pool ball. They need it to go to a certain place. They know the angle it will hit the side of the pool table.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - A lieutenant (abbreviated Lt., LT, LTA, Lieut., LEUT and LEUT.) is a junior commissioned officer in many nations' armed forces, fire service or police.  - Infantry is the general branch of an army that engages in military combat on foot. As the troops who engage with the enemy in close-ranged combat, infantry units bear the largest brunt of warfare and typically suffer the greatest number of casualties during a military campaign. Historically, as the oldest branch of the combat arms, the infantry are the tip of the spear of a modern army, and continually undergo training that is typically more physically demanding and psychologically stressful than that of any other branch of the combat arms. Common representations of infantry fighting forces include the U.S. Army Infantry Branch, U.S. Marine Corps Infantry, Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, Infantry of the British Army, and the Royal Australian Corps of Infantry.  - The Silver Star, officially the Silver Star Medal, is the United States military's third-highest decoration for valor in combat. The Silver Star is awarded primarily to members of the United States Armed Forces for gallantry in action against an enemy of the United States.  - This is a complete list of Marines from the 3rd Battalion 3rd Marine Regiment who have been awarded the United States 's Medal of Honor , Navy Cross , or Silver Star . An asterisk after a recipient 's name indicates that the award was given posthumously .  - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.  - A soldier is one who fights as part of an organised, land-based armed force. A soldier can be an enlisted person, a non-commissioned officer, or an officer.  - A battalion is a military unit. The use of the term \\"battalion\\" varies by nationality and branch of service. Typically a battalion consists of 300 to 800 soldiers and is divided into a number of companies. A battalion is typically commanded by a lieutenant colonel.

Upon entering the colon, the food residue first travels up the ascending colon on the right side of the abdomen. At the inferior surface of the liver, the colon bends to form the right colic flexure (hepatic flexure) and becomes the transverse colon. The region defined as hindgut begins with the last third of the transverse colon and continues on. Food residue passing through the transverse colon travels across to the left side of the abdomen, where the colon angles sharply immediately inferior to the spleen, at the left colic flexure (splenic flexure). From there, food residue passes through the descending colon, which runs down the left side of the posterior abdominal wall. After entering the pelvis inferiorly, it becomes the s-shaped sigmoid colon, which extends medially to the midline (Figure 23.21). The ascending and descending colon, and the rectum (discussed next) are located in the retroperitoneum.

As news of the landlady's vanishing spreads, the case has taken a chilling turn—with police now treating the investigation as a potential murder. The public watched in horror as law enforcement officials descended on the pub, cordoning off the patio area and digging up the ground in search of any clues related to the landlady's whereabouts. A perpetual fixture in the small town, the pub was a hub of social gatherings, laughter, and shared memories. Today, its once-inviting ambience was overtaken by a sinister air of suspicion, casting a dark shadow on the community's sense of security and well-being. For decades, this pub had been managed by a warm and affable landlady, known for her jovial attitude, adherence to tradition, and heartfelt dedication to her patrons. In her absence, the establishment has become a stark reminder of the tragedy that may have befallen her, a mere stone's throw away from the lives she has touched over the years. Fueling the somber mood, local residents and loyal customers of the pub have been left to speculate about the series of events leading up to her disappearance. Gossip flows through town like a river of wild ideas, ranging from accidental mishap to a planned extraction for some unknown reason. Many are left with unanswered questions that potentially lie buried beneath the soil of the now-conspicuous patio. The attention of the townsfolk is laser-focused on the unfolding events, as loyal patrons and concerned friends gather outside the crime scene tape, unable to tear their eyes away from the scene that is playing out in front of them. There they stand wondering if the excavation will unearth any new evidence of their beloved landlady's fate. As the inky sky of night envelops the town, news of the police treating the case as a murder investigation sends shockwaves through the tight-knit community. Neighbors had seen the landlady just days prior, going about her daily routine and engaging in light-hearted banter. Yet now, with each shovel of dirt turned and every new detail uncovered, the thought of the unthinkable grows ever more potent in the minds of those who knew her best. The small, idyllic town where everyone believed they knew each other’s stories faces an unnerving reality. Secrets lurk beneath the surface, and the suspicions surrounding the landlady's disappearance are a stark reminder that even the most picturesque community is not immune to the darker side of human nature. In the somber days that follow, a collective unease falls upon the town—a mixture of fear, grief, and the burning desire to uncover the truth. The pub patio, now tarnished by the possibility of holding the answer to a grisly crime, serves as a harrowing symbol of the community's loss and the disturbing uncertainty that has enveloped their world. As the police investigation continues and new evidence is unveiled, one question haunts the minds of the townspeople: how could something this sinister happen in their peaceful, idyllic town? While the plot twists, the town's unbreakable sense of unity and resilience remains sanguine—their undying hope that justice will be served and closure found in the mystery of their missing landlady. Only time will reveal the truth hidden beneath the soil, and until then, the memories held within the walls of the pub serve as a somber reminder of a joyous soul whose life remains inexplicably intertwined with the ominous shadows of a possible murder."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Question: \\"__ is translated as fixity in Chinese\\"  Context: \\"In the language of the Noble Eightfold Path, samyaksamādhi is \\"right concentration\\". The primary means of cultivating samādhi is meditation. Upon development of samādhi, one's mind becomes purified of defilement, calm, tranquil, and luminous.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"The term \\"samyaksamādhi\\" (right concentration) in the context of the Noble Eightfold Path can be translated as \\"fixity\\" (定) in Chinese. To understand the concept of samyaksamādhi, we must first comprehend the importance of the Noble Eightfold Path in Buddhism. The Noble Eightfold Path is a guide to spiritual cultivation and the cessation of suffering. It is the fourth truth in the Four Noble Truths, which compose the core teachings of Buddhism. The path consists of eight key elements: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. In this context, samādhi (concentration) refers to a state of deep meditation where the practitioner achieves focus and tranquility, ultimately leading to the purification and luminosity of the mind. This state of mind is cultivated through the practice of various meditation techniques, such as mindfulness of breathing and meditation on the nature of the mind itself. When examining the Chinese translation of samyaksamādhi, the term \\"fixity\\" (定) can be found as a suitable translation in capturing the concept's essence. In Buddhism, fixity refers to the attainment of mental stability and concentration, allowing the practitioner to maintain a steady and unwavering state of mind. This aligns directly with the notion of samyaksamādhi, which emphasizes mental stillness and focus as crucial components in the pursuit of spiritual development. Fixity, or \\"定\\" in Chinese, encapsulates the profound process of deepening one's meditation practice and cultivating mental stability and concentration. The practitioner works to eliminate distractions and defilements from the mind, achieving a state of inner tranquility and clarity. This process enables one to gradually purify the mind and develop the qualities of calmness, equanimity, and luminosity. In summary, the term \\"samyaksamādhi,\\" which refers to right concentration in the Noble Eightfold Path, can be translated as \\"fixity\\" (定) in Chinese. This translation accurately conveys the essence of the concept, emphasizing the importance of attaining mental stability and focus for spiritual growth and the cessation of suffering in Buddhism. Through deep meditation and the continuous practice of mindfulness and concentration, one can cultivate samyaksamādhi and progress along the Noble Eightfold Path towards the ultimate goal of enlightenment and the liberation from suffering."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the article and select the best answer. Article: You may think that inventions are far away from your everyday life. But in fact, almost everyone can invent. It's just that they do not recognize that their idea could be the start of an invention.      Once inventors see their ideas have some practical value, they don't let them slip away.      For example, the inventor of the dishwasher, American Josephine Cochrane, loved to give dinner parties. But she found it took too long to wash her dishes by hand and too many of them broke. She decided that a machine could do the job faster and with fewer mistakes. So, in 1886, she set out to make one for herself.      Like Cochrane's, most inventions are created to solve a problem. So, the first and most important step is to find the problem.      You can start by looking at what is wrong with things you use now. You can ask grandparents or neighbours if they remember ever saying: \\"I wish someone would invent something for...\\" Or you can look at people in different areas such as on the street, or at school. Then you might notice situations or things in need of improvement.      Remember to record your ideas and work. This will help you develop your invention and protect it when it is completed.      The next step is to think about possible solutions. An invention is a new way of solving a problem. So think of many, varied, and unusual ways.      You can often come up with a solution for a problem by looking at it from a different angle   or thinking about it in a new way.      Example 1 -- instead of thinking of shoes as protecting your feet from the ground, think of using something to protect the ground from your feet.      Example 2 -- instead of thinking about how you can carry oranges home from a store, think of how they can come to you by delivery or growing your own.      Example 3 -- instead of experimenting with only one solution, can you put two or three solutions together, or arrange them in different orders?      And if one solution doesn't work, can it be put to other uses? That was how yellow post-it... Question: The main idea of this story is   _  .

Reading that book just reminded me of all the sadness in the world, and it made me feel sad ,too. \\" So, I think, now he has been through the sad tone of the passage , the discovery that words on a printed page can give rise to such strong emotion ,that a book can move you right out of your own comfortable little self and into someone else's pain. Thus we come to realize that if we are to remain fully engaged in life, open to its mysteries and feel sorry towards its suffering, we indeed need stories to grab  us by the neck and remind us of the sadness in the world that is not our own.

While this process moved along, diplomacy continued its rounds. Direct pressure on the Taliban had proved unsuccessful. As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on  Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed  Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding  Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get  Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued.  After reading the above, is \\"The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What were two reasons the Secret Service, the CIA and counterterrorism officials advised President Clinton not to visit Pakistan?\\"?

Counterterrorism officials argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. These two reasons were distinct, with the first being concerned with the safety of the President and the second being focused on the lack of action or cooperation from Pakistan on counterterrorism matters. Despite these concerns, President Clinton insisted on visiting Pakistan and addressed issues related to tensions between Pakistan and India, nuclear proliferation, and Osama Bin Laden during his meetings with Pakistani officials."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: FACTBOX-Key points in Greece's cash-for-reform proposals BRUSSELS/ATHENS, June 23 (Reuters) - Greece presented new reform proposals on Monday which its euro zone partners cautiously welcomed as a possible basis for an agreement to unlock bailout funds needed to avert a possible debt default. Here is a summary of the proposal as spelled out by Greek government officials. Early retirement to be curbed gradually from 2016 to 2025, but exemptions for some specific categories to be maintained, including for arduous professions and mothers with disabilities. A special benefit for some low-income pensioners, amounting to between 57 to 230 euros (64.66 to 260.89) a month to remain but to be replaced from 2020 by new protection framework for low pensions. This is a key point of friction between Greece and its lenders, who wanted it scrapped. Greece to keep three value added tax rates of 23 percent, 13 percent and 6 percent. Electricity and restaurants to be taxed at 13 percent instead of being raised to 23 percent, as lenders had demanded, while medicines to be cut to 6 percent rather than raised to 11 percent as sought by lenders. Officials said lenders were asking for two rates of 11 percent and 23 percent. TAX HIKE FOR HIGH EARNERS Solidarity tax for higher income earners (revenues above 50,000 euros (56,710) to be increased, while lowering the tax for revenues below 30,000 euros. It introduces a solidarity tax of 8 percent on revenues above 500,000 euros. Tax plans to include: a) a special levy of 12 percent on businesses that post a profit of over 500,000 euros; b) Increases in luxury tax on pools, planes, big cars and private boats over 10 meters (33 feet); c) a tax on gambling slot machines (VLTs). Privatisations to impose a minimum amount of investment, a commitment by investors to promote the local economy and a participation of public equity. The transfer of Greece's state equity in Greek telecoms operator to the country's privatisation agency will not be part of the lenders' prior actions. Greece will not privatise its power grid operator (ADMIE) nor its dominant power utility PPC, as requested by creditors. No cuts to public sector wages from levels at end-2014. Cut defence spending by 200 million euros. Primary budget surplus of 1 percent in 2015 and 2 percent in 2016, compared with 3 percent and 4.5 percent agreed to by previous Greek governments. Greece repeated demand for euro zone to lend it money to buy back 27 billion euros of its bonds from European Central Bank - effectively rolling-over the debt on more favourable terms. Greece wants deal to include financing of infrastructure and new technologies through an investment package from the European Commission and the European Investment Bank. According to leaked proposals on Greek websites, Greece also planned to increase pension contributions to cash in 605 million euros this year and 1.56 billion euros next year. Spending cuts and tax revenues would produce budget measures equivalent to 2.69 billion euros or 1.51 percent of GDP this year and 5.2 billion euros or 2.87 percent of GDP in 2016, up from 1.99 billion or 1.1 percent of GDP and 3.58 billion euros or 2 percent of GDP previously.

It is best known for its two uniquely-patterned and colored broods or generations per year, with the spring brood differing significantly from the summer brood. In this passage, we will delve into an extensive and comprehensive examination of the spring brood of the Map Butterfly. The spring brood of Map Butterflies typically emerges between April and June, depending on the climatic conditions of their specific geographic locations. This generation is characterized by their rich orange and brown hues, with intricate patterns on their wings, mimicking dead leaves or tree bark to camouflage themselves from predators. The formation of these unique patterns is attributed to various factors such as environmental cues, hormones, and genetic elements. With a wingspan of approximately 40 to 45 millimeters (1.6 to 1.8 inches), the spring brood features markings that resemble maps, hence the name Map Butterfly. The upperside of the wings displays a vivid orange background, with a series of dark wavy lines, spots, and streaks creating an extraordinary pattern. The underside of their wings has a more subdued coloration, showcasing a brown to grayish background with a series of lighter speckles. The Map Butterfly's spring brood displays sexual dimorphism, which means that the males and females exhibit slight differences in appearance. While males generally have a darker coloring on their wings, females showcase a more vibrant orange hue. Additionally, females also possess broader wings compared to males. The larvae of the spring brood, which are usually green or brown with white and black markings, feed primarily on stinging nettles (Urtica dioica) as their primary food source. However, they have also been known to consume other plants within the Urticaceae family. Powered by this nutritious diet, the caterpillars grow through several stages or instars before transforming into a pupa. The pupal stage, also called the chrysalis, is typically well-camouflaged and blends in with the surrounding vegetation. During the adult butterfly stage, the spring brood of Map Butterflies typically feeds on the nectar of a variety of flowering plants. Favorites include dandelions, wild thyme, and bird's foot trefoil, among others. These butterflies are known for their smooth and gentle flight patterns, frequently taking advantage of the warm sunny spells during spring. Map Butterflies exhibit unique behavior during the spring brood, with their crepuscular nature allowing them to be active during both the early morning and late afternoon hours. This activity pattern helps them evade predation while also providing ample opportunity to search for nectar and mates. In conclusion, the spring brood of the Map Butterfly is an enchanting generation of these remarkable insects. Their striking coloration, intricate patterns, and intriguing behavior make them standout among butterfly species. With their ability to adapt their appearance depending on seasonal factors, the Map Butterfly remains a captivating subject for both researchers and nature enthusiasts alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The father of a North Carolina teen whose mutilated body was found on a suburban Boston street said Tuesday he was struggling with the boy's death amid reports authorities were investigating whether the student might have fallen from an aircraft's wheel well.      Anthony Tisdale said he last saw his son Delvonte on Nov. 14 when they did yard work together and the family had pizza for dinner. When the 16-year-old failed to return from school the following day, the family called police. The boy's remains were found last week in Milton, Mass., several days after he was reported missing.      Other relatives described the boy as being unhappy in North Carolina and having missed Baltimore, a city he had lived in until he was 13.      In Boston, Logan International Airport spokesman Phil Orlandella said investigators requested flight path information and were looking into the \\"remote\\" possibility that Delvonte may have fallen from a plane's landing gear well.      Anthony Tisdale said at a news conference Tuesday in Charlotte that investigators haven't told his family anything about an airplane and he has no idea how his son ended up near Boston.      The district attorney's office in Norfolk, Mass., said an investigation is ongoing but its statement did not address reports that investigators where checking for a possible fall from a plane.      Delvonte Tisdale was a member of the Air Force ROTC program at Charlotte's North Mecklenburg High School. His father said the family had moved from Greensboro to Charlotte in the summer just so the teen could join that program.      Tisdale said his son was happy to be in Charlotte and loved high school.      \\"Being here such a short time and losing my son is very difficult,\\" Anthony Tisdale said, wiping away tears as he spoke with reporters Tuesday. \\"My son was a hardworking young man, he didn't frequent the streets ... he spent time with his family.\\"      The teen's brother told The Associated Press by telephone on Tuesday that the teenager was unhappy in North Carolina and had never wanted to leave Baltimore, where he had lived earlier.      \\"He was very strict,\\" Anthony Tisdale Jr., 21, also said of his father. \\"My brother hated it there.\\"      \\"My brother just wanted to come home,\\" he said, adding the teen \\"just couldn't take it there.'      At his news conference, Anthony Tisdale said his teenage son enjoyed life in North Carolina. \\"My son was ecstatic about being in Charlotte. He loved his high school. He associated with a lot of good folk,\\" the father said.      Authorities said Tisdale's body suffered \\"massive trauma,\\" but an autopsy didn't report how he died.      Asked about the possibility that Tisdale may have fallen from an aircraft, Ann Davis, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Security Administration, said: \\"I'm not aware of that suggestion.\\" She said the TSA was deferring to law enforcement authorities on the matter.      John Hansman, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said there have been cases of people stowing away in the wheel well of commercial airplanes and not surviving.      Hansman, who isn't one of the investigators on the case, said there is some \\"limited evidence\\" that could support the theory that Tisdale stowed away in a plane's wheel well and fell out as the aircraft passed over Milton, a community several miles from Logan. He said the area where Tisdale's body was found is under the final approach course for one of that airport's runways, where crew would typically be lowering an aircraft's landing gear.      Jim Peters, a spokesman for FAA, did not immediately return a call seeking confirmation.      ___      AP reporters Denise Lavoie and Mark Pratt in Boston contributed to the story. ||||| Sponsored Links      (Nov. 24) -- Relatives and friends of a North Carolina teenager are struggling to understand how his battered body came to be found in an upscale neighborhood in a Boston suburb, as authorities considered the possibility that he was a stowaway who fell from an airplane.The remains of Delvonte Tisdale, a 16-year-old high school sophomore from Charlotte, N.C., were found last week on the street in Milton, Mass., according to media reports.

We have this equation: 0 = -0*m + 14*m + 1 + 139. 1. In the beginning, look at the -0*m part. Because anything multiplied by zero (0) is also zero, so -0*m is just 0. So now our equation looks like this: 0 = 0 + 14*m + 1 + 139. 2. Now, let's combine the numbers 1 and 139. So, 1 + 139 = 140. Our equation now looks like: 0 = 0 + 14*m + 140. 3. Since 0 doesn't change anything when added, we can simply remove the 0 from the equation: so now we have: 0 = 14*m + 140. 4. Our goal is to find the value of m. To do that, let's first subtract 140 from both sides of the equation. It will look like this: 0 - 140 = 14*m + 140 - 140. Which simplifies to: -140 = 14*m. 5. Finally, to find m, we should divide both sides of the equation by 14: (-140) / 14 = 14*m / 14. This simplifies to: -10 = m. And there you go! We found the value of m, so m = -10."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer. While answering a multiple choice question, first output the correct answer(s).

Today people often travel to different places around the world. But it was very hard for people from Europe to visit China then. After three and a half years, the Polos reached China on 1275. While he was there, Marco Polo worked  for Kublai Khan, the emperor of China. He was able to learn and experience many things that were new to Europeans. In his diary, he wrote, \\"Kublai Khan's palace is the greatest I've ever seen. The streets of the new capital. Daidu, are so straight and so wide.\\" Paper money also took him by surprise, since it was not yet in use in the West at that time. Homes were heated with \\"black stones... which burn like wood.\\" These stones were coal, and most of the Europeans knew little about it then. After 17 years in China, Marco and his family finally returned to Venice in 1292.

In the wake of religious riots in Egypt, the emperor Decius decreed that all subjects of the Empire must actively seek to benefit the state through witnessed and certified sacrifice to \\"ancestral gods\\" or suffer a penalty: only Jews were exempt. Decius' edict appealed to whatever common mos maiores might reunite a politically and socially fractured Empire and its multitude of cults; no ancestral gods were specified by name. The fulfillment of sacrificial obligation by loyal subjects would define them and their gods as Roman. Roman oaths of loyalty were traditionally collective; the Decian oath has been interpreted as a design to root out individual subversives and suppress their cults, but apostasy was sought, rather than capital punishment.

Step 3: Analyze the relationship between the components - From the premise, we know that the subject could potentially have to settle for a campus within the Cal State system. - The hypothesis is concerned only with the \\"bad\\" Cal State campuses, which means it narrows down the focus specifically to a subgroup within the most unfavorable option presented in the premise.

Conclusion: The premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the premise only identifies a broader range of options for the subject, while the hypothesis is more specific about the unfavorable nature of the campus within the Cal State system.

Answer based on context: In 1552 Charles V had borrowed over 4 million ducats, with the Metz campaign alone costing 2.5 million ducats. Shipments of treasure from the Indies totalled over two million ducats between 1552-53. By 1554, the cash deficit for the year was calculated to be over 4.3 million ducats, even after all tax receipts for the six ensuing years had been pledged and the proceeds spent in advance. Credit at this point began costing the crown 43 percent interest . By 1557 the crown was refusing payment from the Indies since even this was required for payment of the war effort . French finances during the war were mainly financed by the increase in the taille tax, as well as indirect taxes like the gabelle and customs fees. The French monarchy also resorted to heavy borrowings during the war from financiers at rates of 10-16 percent interest. The taille was estimated in collection for 1551 at around six million livres. During the 1550s, Spain had an estimated military manpower of around 150,000 soldiers, whereas France had an estimated manpower of 50,000. How many more millions of ducats did Charles V borrow over what the Metz campaign cost?","output":"To find out how many more millions of ducats Charles V borrowed over what the Metz campaign cost, we can subtract the cost of the Metz campaign from the total amount Charles V borrowed. Total amount borrowed by Charles V = 4 million ducats Cost of the Metz campaign = 2.5 million ducats 4 million ducats (Total borrowed) - 2.5 million ducats (Metz campaign) = 1.5 million ducats Charles V borrowed 1.5 million more ducats over what the Metz campaign cost."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I absolutely love summer. I love the hot weather, the skimpy clothes, the summer fruits and the party seasons. I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States. Formaldehyde is one of the biggest nasties that I make a real effort to avoid. I did my PhD in Forensics and spent a lot of time watching autopsies. Once the body parts have been harvested, they are stored in Formaldehyde to be preserved. The Formaldehyde alters the proteins in the tissue to stop them breaking down - fine for the dead, not something I want to use whilst I am alive. It is nasty, nasty stuff.

Each portal would be hidden in plain sight, perhaps disguised as an ordinary phone booth or a nondescript door, and only accessible to members who possess a magical token. 2. **Enchanted Architecture**: The club’s physical structure would constantly shift and change, allowing for an ever-evolving environment that can transport members to different themed rooms or realms – such as an underwater lounge with real marine life swimming in transparent walls, or a levitating sky garden with panoramic views of the stars – all with the snap of a finger. 3. **Magical Staff and Service**: The staff, perhaps magical beings themselves, would provide impeccable, personalized service. Invisible waiters could deliver drinks that are concocted to the member's taste by just saying what they’re in the mood for. A 'genie' concierge would be available to grant realistic \\"wishes\\" related to club amenities. 4. **Immersive Dining Experiences**: A grand dining hall with an ever-changing menu would feature dishes that not only delight the palate but also engage all senses. Food could appear to float to the table, change flavor as you eat it or be accompanied by miniature storytelling projections. 5. **Interactive Entertainment**: Entertainment could involve live performances that members can partake in, like plays where the plot changes based on audience decisions. With magical influence, performances would include real magical phenomena, stunning illusions, or holographic displays that interact with the audience. 6. **Curated Magical Events**: Host special events like full-moon masquerades where costumes are magically enhanced, or alchemical wine tastings where the wines grant temporary, pleasant sensory abilities. 7. **Ethereal Relaxation Spaces**: Create a spa that offers mystical treatments, rejuvenation, and relaxation, featuring floating massage beds, healing mineral pools that change their properties, and meditation rooms with magically enhanced serenity. 8. **Secret Gardens and Libraries**: Cultivate magical gardens with plants that sing or change colors, and a library with books that contain living stories - where illustrations come to life and pages turn themselves. 9. **Customized Dream Suites**: Luxurious accommodation that adapts to the dreams or desires of the sleeping member. When a member sleeps, the suite could transport them into a lucid dream-like version of any place on Earth – or beyond. 10. **Exclusive Membership Artifacts**: Provide members with enchanted items, such as a ring or watch, that serve as a membership card, wallet, teleportation device, and personal assistant all in one. 11. **Sustainability and Ethical Magic**: Ensure that the club's magic and operations are sustainable and ethically sourced, preserving the balance of the natural and supernatural worlds. 12. **International Branches and Experiences**: As the club expands globally, each branch would have unique magical offerings that reflect the local culture and mythology, providing members with a diverse and culturally rich experience wherever they go. Combining luxury with magic, the club would need to operate within the boundaries of safety, consent, and respect for both the magical and non-magical worlds, offering an unparalleled experience of escapism and luxury that feels truly unreal."},{"instruction":"A ‘genie’ concierge would be available to grant realistic “wishes” related to club amenities. exemples ?","output":"The role of a 'genie' concierge in a magical private club would be to meet members' requests in relation to the amenities and services of the club while maintaining a sense of awe and wonder.

The facade of the bookshop was adorned with ivy that seemed to guard its secrets, and the windows, always a little foggy, invited curious glances from passersby. Inside, the scent of aged paper and worn leather bindings filled the air. Books towered toward the high ceiling, arranged on shelves that seemed to stretch into infinity. An elderly man named Alistair managed Whispers of Past Pages. His silver hair was always a touch disheveled, and his eyes, a clear blue, sparkled with the reflection of countless stories. Visitors often found him with a book in hand, his glasses perched precariously at the tip of his nose. Alistair wasn't just the bookstore's keeper; he was its heart, believing every book had a story beyond its pages—some even magical. One misty morning in early spring, a young girl named Elara stumbled upon the bookshop. She was new to the village, her family having moved to Willow Glen seeking a quieter life. With her curious heart and insatiable love for stories, she felt inexplicably drawn to Alistair's domain. Pushing the heavy wooden door open, a bell above chimed, announcing her arrival. Alistair looked up from his desk, his gaze settling warmly on Elara. \\"Welcome to Whispers of Past Pages,\\" he said with a gentle voice. \\"Explore to your heart's content, and should you need guidance, I am here.\\" Elara nodded shyly and ventured further in. She trailed her fingers along the spines of countless books, each title an unspoken promise of adventure. Suddenly, a peculiar book caught her eye, its cover a deep emerald green with intricate golden patterns that seemed to shimmer in the dim light. Drawn to it as if by an unseen force, she slid the book from the shelf. As she opened the cover, a crisp, unseasonal breeze billowed through the shop, stirring the pages of scattered books and ruffling her hair. Alistair looked up, his eyes twinkling knowingly. \\"Ah, you've found the Book of Breezes,\\" he said, rising to join her. Elara gazed at him, wide-eyed. \\"The Book of Breezes?\\" \\"Yes,\\" Alistair confirmed. \\"It's said that this book holds the tales of the winds. The zephyrs, the squalls, the tempests—all have their stories within. It's a special book that chooses its reader, and it seems it has chosen you.\\" Elara, both excited and a little intimidated, asked, \\"What am I to do with it?\\" \\"Only what comes naturally,\\" Alistair encouraged. \\"Read it, and let the stories guide you.\\" As Elara began to read, the wind outside harmonized with the rhythm of her voice. With each word she spoke, the air in the shop danced and took on the essence of the tales—the gentle caress of a summer breeze or the wrathful howl of an ocean gale. She found herself swept up in the tales of the winds, each more miraculous than the last. She felt the melodies of the world echoing in her heartbeat, the languages of the air whispering secrets to her soul. Days turned into weeks, and the stories of the Book of Breezes brought subtle changes to Willow Glen. Flowers in the neighboring shop bloomed year-round, the old bakery's wind chimes sang in perfect harmony with the weather, and the villagers spoke of a newfound vitality in the air. Alistair, watching from a cozy chair in a quiet corner, smiled. Elara had not only read the stories, but lived them, bringing the magic of the winds into the very essence of Willow Glen. And with each story she shared, the magical connection between the villagers and their natural world grew stronger. In the heart of the bookshop, where whispers of past pages lingered over leaf and leather, a young girl and an old man had woven a tale of their own, one of friendship and enchantment—a story that would, in time, become just as legendary as any within the worn covers resting upon the shelves of Whispers of Past Pages."},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Stylish Desk Setup with Coffee Cup &amp; Blooms | High-Res Digital Image for Bloggers | Social Media Ready Photography | Modern Flat Lay Stock Photo.

The Qing Dynasty, which had ruled since the seventeenth century, now faced the whirlwind of revolutionary fervor spun together by the Tongmenghui and their indomitable leader, Sun Yat-sen. Their rallying cry, \\"Overthrowing Qing, restore Ming,\\" pierced through the heart of the rotting imperial structure and promised a return to an era when Han Chinese ruled Han China. The Tongmenghui, a conglomeration of various revolutionary factions united under a common nationalist and Han supremacist ideology, had worked diligently from the shadows to ignite the fires of rebellion. The Xinhai Revolution, as historians call this period, was as swift as it was brutal. Swift, for the Qing fortresses of power crumbled faster than any could have anticipated; brutal, for the conflict saw brothers-in-arms against the Manchu. The spirit of an ancient lineage fueled their dream of restoring the glories of the past Ming Dynasty, the last to be wholly Han Chinese and seen as culturally pure and uncorrupted by foreign influences. Following the abdication of the child emperor Puyi in 1912, the would-be republicans faced a tremendous fork in the road of destiny. In theory, the Tongmenghui's ambitions for a newly founded republic underpinned by the Three Principles of the People could have brought forth a democratic age. However, the geopolitical landscape was not tolerant of such blooming notions of self-rule and democracy. Japan, a burgeoning empire in its own right, saw opportunity where others might have perceived a nation's inner turmoil. Through precise and strategic maneuvering, Japan transformed the nascent Republic of China into a protectorate, ostensibly to stabilize the region but in practice to control its resources and influence its political trajectory. Even as Japan exerted its might over China's destiny, the internal narrative was surprisingly one of celebration, not of subjugation – for in this shadow puppet play, the Beiyang Government would serve as a regent to the Ming's phoenix-like return from the ashes of history. The Beiyang Government, under the leadership of strongmen like Yuan Shikai, and later figures such as Xu Shichang, served as both a provisional governing body for the new Republic and as loyal stewards for the restoration of the Ming Dynasty. This duality was an intricate dance, choreographed to maintain the facade of sovereignty while adhering to the wishes of their Japanese protectors. Japan, for its part, understood that a China with a historical figurehead at its helm could be more easily managed than a republic with a fervor for democracy that might resist foreign influence. Quietly and with diligent care, scholars and archivists traced the lineage of the long-deposed Ming, seeking any surviving descendants of the fabled Imperial House of Zhu. In the remote villages and townships of the land, whispers of royal blood being found coursed through the alleys and tea houses. The search culminated with the proclamation of Zhu Yousong, an unassuming man of scholarly predisposition, as the rightful heir to the Dragon Throne. The Beiyang Government, with the backing of Japanese authority, saw to his coronation amid a ceremony that spoke of ancient rituals and contemporary choreography all at once. The restoration was not without its detractors. There were those who argued that the resurrection of the Ming was a mere illusion, a puppet show directed by foreign hands. Nonetheless, the move resonated with a population yearning for stability and a sense of cultural reclamation in the era post the \\"Century of Humiliation.\\" As the new Ming Emperor took his place under the auspices of Beiyang regency and Japanese protection, China entered an epoch where the past and the present intertwined. The Tongmenghui's original vision of overthrowing the Qing and restoring the Ming came to fruition – albeit as a heavily orchestrated narrative that balanced between nationalist yearning and the pragmatic acceptance of foreign influence. In the chapters to come, we will examine the impact this renewal of the past had upon the Chinese people, the response of the international community, and how the Ming Dynasty, born anew in the twentieth century, navigated the roiling tides of a world caught between age-old traditions and the relentless march of modernity."},{"instruction":"帮我写小说: 《帝皇铠甲》 第一章异能兽","output":"第一章 异能兽 在混沌的夜空之下，月白如霜。一颗颗星辰如点点沙砾撒布在广阔无垠的宇宙中。寂静的夜晚，由于一阵急促的脚步声而被打破。 \\"凯尔，你可别拖后腿了，玲珑森林不是我们能久留的地方。\\" 一名魁梧的年轻人回头急促地对他身后的小伙伴喊道。 \\"我知道的，戴维。只是这玲珑森林自从出现了异能兽后，就显得更加凶险了！\\" 名叫凯尔的少年边跑边回答，他面色苍白，显然是被恐惧所克制。 玲珑森林，这片古老而神秘的森林位于安塔利亚帝国的边境上，在这里，千奇百怪的生物层出不穷，但最令人闻风丧胆的是传说中的异能兽——拥有惊人能力的凶猛野兽。 \\"切，要是我能获得那传说中的帝皇铠甲，何愁斗不过这些瘟神一样的异能兽！\\" 戴维咬牙切齿地说，他的眼中烧着一把火。 正当两人议论间，一阵阴冷的风吹过，玲珑森林深处突然传来一阵震天动地的吼叫。声音沉重而嘶哑，充满了无尽的愤怒和痛苦。 戴维和凯尔对视一眼，从彼此眼中读出了恐惧与不安。他们知道，又有一头异能兽出现了，这一次，可能是他们有生以来最危险的一次遭遇。 \\"我们得快点离开这里！\\" 凯尔气喘吁吁地说。 两人加快了脚步，如同激流中的扁舟，在玲珑森林的夜色中艰难前行。然而，事与愿违，当他们撞入了一片密集的灌木丛后，一只体型庞大、全身如同覆盖着黑色钢甲的异能兽出现在了他们的面前。 异能兽的眼睛如同两颗燃烧的烈焰，它的每一个呼吸都释放出令人窒息的压迫感，空气中仿佛凝结着死亡的气息。 \\"冷静，凯尔！我们不能表现出恐惧。\\" 戴维紧握着手中的长剑，尽管他的内心也在剧烈地翻腾。 突如其来的险境，迫使两人不得不迅速找到出路。就在这时，戴维忆起了他们家族代代相传的秘籍中，关于驯服异能兽的奥秘。 他深吸一口气，稳定了自己的情绪，开始按照古籍上描述的仪式，小心翼翼地向异能兽展示出和平的意图。 犹豫了几秒，那头原本处于愤怒状态下的异能兽竟然真的缓和了狂躁的情绪。它那庞大的身体略微低垂，表现出了极少见的亲和姿态。 戴维不敢有任何懈怠，继续用特殊的语言和肢体动作与异能兽进行沟通。时间仿佛停滞了，森林中其他的声音也消失不见，只剩下戴维和那头黑色异能兽在密集而默契的对话。 就在这沉默、紧张的氛围中，一个微妙的变化发生了——异能兽开始缓慢地靠近戴维，戴维则一步步后退，他们好像在进行一场默契的舞蹈。 凯尔屏着呼吸，不敢发出任何响声。这一幕超出了他的理解范畴，他不知道戴维用了什么方法，居然能让一头森林中的凶猛异能兽变得如此温驯。 然而，就在这一切似乎正在悄无声息中被解决时，一阵枝叶摩擦的声音突兀起来，异能兽猛然一惊，它的攻击本能再次被激活。一瞬间，整个森林都陷入了可怕的动荡之中。凯尔的心跳狂躁地加速，感到事态正急速向着他们最不愿意看到的方向发展。 在悬念达到顶峰时，戴维深知自己必须做出选择——是逃跑，还是取得异能兽的信任，和这个强大的生物建立一种新的联结，这不仅是对他的信念的考验，也是对他意志力的考验。而这一决定，可能会彻底改变他的命运... （故事待续...）"},{"instruction":"继续写","output":"第一章 异能兽（续）

异能兽的燃烧似的双眼盯着戴维的手掌，身体一僵，鼻腔中发出警惕的低鸣，但其瞳孔中逐渐减弱的光芒透露出它内心的动摇。 时间仿佛变得缓慢，凯尔紧张地观望着，整个人几乎忘记了呼吸。森林的其他生物也似乎感受到了这片刻的静默，一同等待着结果的揭晓。 终于，异能兽的头部轻轻侧向戴维，它的鼻尖轻触到了他的掌心，那草药的香气似乎奏效了，如同一股无形的力量，抚平了这头强大生物内心的风暴。

Poniżej wyjaśniam działanie każdej z funkcji zawartych w \`Mathutils\`: 1. \`normalize(value, min, max)\` Ta metoda przekształca wartość na zakres normalizowany (standardowo od 0 do 1), gdzie value jest wartością do znormalizowania, a min i max definiują zakres, w którym się mieści. Proces ten jest przydatny, gdy chcesz porównywać wartości lub przeskalować je na jednolity zakres. 2. \`interpolate(normValue, min, max)\` Interpolacja jest procesem wyliczenia wartości pośredniej między dwoma punktami. Tutaj, mając już znormalizowaną wartość (\`normValue\`), możesz uzyskać faktyczną wartość między \`min\` a \`max\` na podstawie tej znormalizowanej wartości. 3. \`map(value, min1, max1, min2, max2)\` Ta metoda mapuje wartość z jednego zakresu na wartość w innym zakresie. Pierwsze trzy argumenty (value, min1, max1) określają bieżącą wartość i jej zakres, a ostatnie dwa (min2, max2) określają zakres, do którego chcemy zmapować tę wartość.

Funkcja ta nazwana jest \`normalize\` i przyjmuje trzy argumenty: \`value\` (wartość do znormalizowania), \`min\` (minimalna wartość w zakresie), \`max\` (maksymalna wartość w zakresie). Celem normalizacji jest przeskalowanie oryginalnej wartości do nowego zakresu, zwykle od 0 do 1. Aby to zrobić, odejmuje się minimalną wartość zakresu od wartości, którą chcemy znormalizować, a następnie dzieli się przez różnicę pomiędzy maksymalną a minimalną wartość zakresu. Oto, co robi każdy krok funkcji: 1. \`(value - min)\`: oblicza różnicę między wartością do normalizacji a minimalną wartością zakresu. 2. \`(max - min)\`: oblicza różnicę między maksymalną a minimalną wartością zakresu. 3. \`return (value - min) / (max - min)\`: dzieli różnicę obliczoną w punkcie 1 przez różnicę z punktu 2, co daje znormalizowaną wartość w zakresie od 0 do 1. Przykład zastosowania: Jeśli mamy zakres wartości od 10 do 20 i chcemy znormalizować wartość 15, wtedy: - min = 10 - max = 20 - value = 15 Po podstawieniu wartości mamy: (15 - 10) / (20 - 10) = 5 / 10 = 0.5 Zatem znormalizowana wartość 15 w zakresie od 10 do 20 wynosi właśnie 0.5. Ważne jest, aby zauważyć, że ta funkcja zakłada, iż min jest mniejsze od max, i nie zawiera żadnych zabezpieczeń przed dzieleniem przez zero (gdy min == max), co w rzeczywistym kodzie trzeba by obsłużyć, by uniknąć błędów."},{"instruction":"If Sansa, as Queen of the North, was the one to legitimize Gendry and make him a Lord, could this moment hold much more weight, and seem much less fanfiction like if it came at a narrative cost?","output":"If Sansa Stark, as Queen in the North, were the one to legitimize Gendry and make him a Lord, the scenario could indeed hold more narrative weight and seem more organic within the story given the right context and developments. In Game of Thrones and A Song of Ice and Fire, legitimation and the granting of lordship are significant acts with political and personal repercussions. These decisions are not taken lightly, and they often involve negotiations, favors, or repayments for loyalty. If Sansa were to legitimize Gendry, it would presumably be for reasons that align with her own political interests or as recognition of his service and loyalty. To make this moment feel less like fan service and more like an integral part of the story, the narrative could include the following elements: 1. **Established Relationship**: Building a relationship between Sansa and Gendry throughout the narrative with meaningful interactions would make Sansa's decision more personal and dramatic. 2. **Political Strategy**: Sansa's decision could be part of a larger political maneuver, such as securing an alliance with the Baratheons, or ensuring the loyalty of the Stormlands in future conflicts. 3. **Reciprocity**: If Gendry had previously assisted or supported the North in some significant way, Sansa's act could be seen as a repayment for his loyalty and service, adding a layer of political depth. 4. **Character Development**: The decision could be used to show Sansa's growth as a ruler and her ability to make tough, strategic choices, as opposed to a simple reward for Gendry. 5. **Narrative Cost**: Your question implies there should be a narrative cost or consequence—perhaps Sansa's decision causes tension with other noble houses that feel overlooked or slighted, or maybe it creates a rift between her and her advisors. 6. **Historical Precedent**: The decision would fit into the larger lore of Westeros and the history of bastards being legitimized, showing a continuation of the social and political practices of the world. By grounding the decision in such elements, the legitimization of Gendry would not only reinforce existing themes but also drive the story forward in a manner consistent with George R.R. Martin's narrative style, where actions have far-reaching consequences and character decisions are multifaceted. It's worth noting that in the HBO series, it was Daenerys Targaryen who legitimized Gendry as Lord of Storm's End to secure his support and loyalty before the battle with the Night King. If the scenario were to shift to Sansa making this decision instead, the story would need the appropriate build-up and rationales outlined above to maintain the series' complex storytelling standards."},{"instruction":"by Narrative cost, I meant other hard, possibly tragic things had to happen in the story.","output":"Apologies for misunderstanding your initial question. Narrative cost, particularly in a story like Game of Thrones, often implies that significant positive developments for a character come with equally significant downsides. These tragic or hard consequences create drama and tension, enhancing the realism and emotional impact of the story. If Sansa were to legitimize Gendry, a consequent narrative cost could manifest in a few ways: 1. **Conflict with Allies**: The decision could create a rift with other allies who might have been eyeing the lordship for themselves or who see Gendry as unworthy. This could lead to internal conflicts or even a betrayal that costs Sansa support or creates new enemies. 2. **Diplomatic Repercussions**: Sansa's decision could anger other kingdoms or important families within the Seven Kingdoms, leading to diplomatic friction or even war, which could result in loss and tragedy for the North and its people. 3. **Personal Sacrifice**: Sansa might be forced to make a personal sacrifice to legitimize Gendry. She might have to agree to a politically motivated marriage, give up a claim, or forgo another alliance that she's been negotiating, leading to personal unhappiness or strategic disadvantage. 4. **Loss of Trust**: Sansa's reputation as a leader might be damaged, especially if her decision to legitimize Gendry is seen as impulsive or not in the best interest of the North. Key characters could lose faith in her leadership, leading to whispers of rebellion or undermining her authority. 5. **Gendry’s Struggle**: The legitimization could come with the condition that Gendry must fulfill a difficult, dangerous, or morally ambiguous task that causes him personal anguish or puts him at odds with his new status and loyalties. 6. **Unintended Consequences**: The legitimization of Gendry could indirectly cause harm to someone else—perhaps prompting a rival to take drastic action, which could result in a tragedy tied back to Sansa's decision. By requiring Sansa to weigh the benefits against the possible dire costs of legitimizing Gendry, the story can depict the harsh realities of leadership and the challenging decisions that rulers must make, where every action has the potential to lead to unforeseen and often adverse repercussions. The resulting narrative would be richer, the emotional stakes heightened, and the characterization of Sansa as a wise but fallible ruler made more complex."},{"instruction":"I meant leading up to this moment, and the cost also doesn't have to be directly related to Gendry.","output":"I see, your question is regarding a narrative cost or significant event that could precede Sansa's legitimization of Gendry, which wouldn't necessarily have a direct causal link but would add weight to the story. This approach can set a darker or more serious tone, ensuring that the legitimization doesn't simply feel like an unearned or lighthearted moment in an otherwise complex and often brutal narrative landscape. Here are some examples of heavy narrative costs or tragic events that could precede the legitimization, thereby enriching the story and the gravity of Sansa's decision: 1. **Great Loss**: Sansa or the North suffers a major loss, such as the death of a key character, the defeat in a crucial battle, or the loss of an important stronghold. This sets a grim backdrop against which the legitimization of Gendry emerges as a spark of hope or a step towards rebuilding. 2. **Sacrificial Decision**: In a difficult choice, Sansa might have to prioritize the needs of the North over personal relationships, perhaps severing ties with a loved one or making a decision that leads to their demise, signifying the weight she carries as a ruler. 3. **Political Upheaval**: A significant political upheaval, such as a successful invasion by an outside force, an assassination that throws the political order into chaos, or a betrayal from within her circle, could place Sansa in a precarious position where legitimizing Gendry is part of a larger strategy to regain stability. 4. **Dire Prophecy or Omen**: A prophecy or omen foretells grim events for the North, creating an atmosphere of fear and urgency. Legitimizing Gendry could be a step in trying to avert the dark future prophesied. 5. **Natural Disaster**: A natural disaster like famine, harsh winter conditions, or plague could bring suffering to Sansa's people, complicating her reign and making her decision to elevate Gendry part of a broader effort to manage the crisis. 6. **Internal Conflict**: An internal conflict, such as a succession crisis or a power struggle between Northern lords, may have destabilized the region. Gendry's legitimization might be a move towards uniting fractious elements under Sansa's leadership. These types of costs create a somber backdrop for significant political actions like legitimization. They demonstrate the stakes involved and the complexities of leadership, underscoring that even moments of triumph or advancement are set against a tapestry of struggle and sacrifice, a theme well within the spirit of the works by George R.R. Martin. By incorporating tragic or consequential events leading up to the moment of Gendry's legitimization, the narrative anchors his rise in the reality of the story's world, enriching the decision with depth and significance that extend beyond the immediate effects of that single act."},{"instruction":"How could this moment be powerful and somewhat happy considering everything?","output":"Even amidst narrative costs and tragedy, Gendry's legitimization by Sansa could be crafted as a powerful and uplifting moment by intertwining themes of hope, renewal, and the promise of a better future. Here’s how such a scene could be depicted to provide a bittersweet but hopeful resonance: 1. **A New Beginning**: Gendry's legitimization could symbolize a fresh start after a period of turmoil or loss. Sansa, acting as Queen in the North, declares Gendry's new status as a symbol of rebuilding and hope for the people, demonstrating that despite the hardships, there is still room for growth and new leadership. 2. **Recognition of Worth**: Sansa's decision could reflect her deep understanding of Gendry's character and abilities. Despite being a bastard, Gendry has proven himself to be honorable and capable. His rise to lordship underscores the narrative that one's birth does not dictate their worth, providing an inspiring message of merit and the potential for social mobility. 3. **Uniting Forces**: In a divided realm, legitimizing Gendry could represent a moment of unity, bringing disparate groups together. By elevating someone who has a connection to multiple factions (his low birth, his time with Arya, his Baratheon lineage), Sansa could be fostering a sense of common cause, which is a gleam of positivity in dark times. 4. **Fulfilling Wishes and Oaths**: If the legitimization fulfills a long-held wish of Gendry's or honors an oath made by other characters (such as Gendry's desire for family and belonging or a promise made by Arya or Jon), it can serve as a moment of emotional payoff for the audience, imbuing the scene with joy and satisfaction. 5. **Ceremonial Beauty**: The actual ceremony could be depicted as a rare moment of beauty and tradition in a harsh world. The setting, the words spoken, and the pomp can provide a respite from the grimness surrounding the characters, allowing both the characters and the audience to savor a moment of celebration. 6. **Themes of Legacy**: Sansa's decision to legitimize Gendry could also be tied to themes of legacy. As the last known living Baratheon (in the show), legitimizing Gendry allows a historic and noble house to continue, which could be seen as a victory for honoring the memories of the deceased and preserving history. 7. **Personal Connections**: If characters who care for Gendry (like Arya or Davos) witness his legitimization, their reactions—pride, happiness, relief—can add an infectiously positive layer to the scene, emphasizing personal bonds and the impact of individual successes on a community. To reinforce the positive aspect of the scene, Sansa’s motive for legitimizing Gendry should feel aligned with her characterization as a just and thoughtful leader. This decision, paired with a narrative acknowledgment of the costs leading up to it, would allow for a nuanced depiction where joy and pain coexist—a hallmark of the bittersweet tone commonly found in George R.R. Martin's stories."},{"instruction":"What if Sansa secretly tutored Gendry on political matters way before the legitimization, to give him that extra push.","output":"Introducing a subplot where Sansa secretly tutors Gendry on political matters before his legitimization could add an interesting layer to their relationship and to the storyline. It would also serve to make Gendry's eventual rise to lordship more credible and satisfying for the audience. Here’s how this could unfold and enhance the story: 1. **Building Trust**: Scenes of Sansa tutoring Gendry would establish a bond between them, showcasing the development of trust and mutual respect. These moments would flesh out their dynamic and give depth to Sansa’s decision to legitimize him later. 2. **Character Development**: Gendry's growth under Sansa's guidance would be an inspiring character arc. He would evolve from a skilled blacksmith with little knowledge of politics to a capable leader. This investment in his education would make Sansa’s decision feel more strategic and deliberate. 3. **Greater Stakes**: Providing Gendry with political knowledge implies that Sansa sees potential in him beyond just a figurehead. This would suggest that there are greater stakes at play, as Sansa prepares him not just to hold a title, but to be an active and beneficial ally in the political landscape. 4. **Secret Alliance**: The secrecy of their lessons could imply a level of plotting and foresight, positioning Sansa as a savvy leader who is playing a long game. This could add a layer of intrigue to the story and build anticipation for the reveal of Gendry's elevation. 5. **Empowering Education**: The act of education as a tool for empowerment aligns with themes in both the books and the show. Sansa's decision to mentor Gendry in politics would echo the importance placed on knowledge and cunning throughout the series. 6. **Narrative Foreshadowing**: The tutoring sessions would serve as foreshadowing for Gendry's rise, making it feel earned and expected when it happens. Once he is legitimized, the audience would understand that he is prepared for the responsibilities, making the event satisfying. 7. **Contrast to Sansa's Experience**: By teaching Gendry, Sansa could be seen as passing on the wisdom and lessons she learned in her own political journey, often through suffering and manipulation. This transfer of knowledge could act as a coping mechanism for Sansa, using her painful past constructively to guide and support Gendry. 8. **Reflection of Themes**: The secret tutoring would reinforce the themes of identity and transformation in the series. Like many characters in Game of Thrones, Gendry’s journey from a commoner to a lord—aided by Sansa’s lessons—would highlight the shifting nature of identity and power in the world of Westeros. This twist in the narrative would ensure that Gendry's legitimization is not just an isolated event but the culmination of a carefully laid plan, adding depth to both Sansa and Gendry’s story arcs. It would showcase the transformative power of mentorship and education in a world where lineage often defines one’s place, thereby invoking one of the core tenets of the series: the subverting of expectations and traditions in favor of merit and personal growth."},{"instruction":"Tuliskan dan jelaskan jenis-jenis operasi yang dapat dilakukan pada setiap tipe data","output":"Setiap tipe data dalam pemrograman mendukung berbagai operasi yang sesuai dengan karakteristiknya.

What are the first two things you would do to ensure the survival and progress of the human race?","output":"In the hypothetical scenario of a zombie apocalypse, rebuilding society would be an incredibly complex challenge with many pressing concerns. Yet, I would prioritize the following two critical actions to ensure the initial survival and future progress of the human race: 1. **Establishing Safe Havens:** The immediate threat to human life from zombies would necessitate the creation of secure locations where survivors can take refuge. These safe havens would need to be defensible, sustainable, and as self-sufficient as possible. I would focus on fortifying existing structures—such as prisons, schools, or islands—that are easily defensible, can accommodate large groups of people, and can be modified to support basic needs like shelter, medical facilities, and food production. Strategically located havens would not only provide safety but also serve as operational bases for coordinating further efforts in rebuilding society. Comprehensive defense strategies would be developed, like physical barriers and protocols for handling potential breaches. 2. **Restoring Communication and Knowledge Preservation:** To facilitate cooperation and ensure long-term survival, establishing a reliable communication network would be essential. This would involve salvaging existing technology like radios or satellites if they're still operational or resorting to more rudimentary methods like messengers or signaling systems. Communication would enable survivors to share information, coordinate resource distribution, and foster community among safe havens. Parallel to this, preserving knowledge would be a priority. I would organize the collection and protection of books, documents, and digital data that encompass crucial information on medicine, agriculture, engineering, and governance. This effort could involve creating a mobile library or digital archives that could be used to educate and train survivors in essential skills needed for rebuilding society. Moreover, this repository of human knowledge would serve as the foundation for future generations, ensuring that progress can continue even in the face of a zombie apocalypse. These initial steps would address the immediate needs of safety and organization while setting the stage for a more structured and stable society to emerge in the wake of such a catastrophic event. The focus would be on creating a resilient and adaptable community capable of withstanding ongoing threats and capable of rebuilding civilization over time."},{"instruction":"life lessons in animal farm by george orwell","output":"\\"Animal Farm\\" by George Orwell, a satirical allegory that parallels the rise of the Soviet Union, provides several general life lessons applicable beyond the specific political commentary of the book: 1. **Power Corrupts:** One of the central themes of \\"Animal Farm\\" is the way that power can corrupt those who hold it.

Fungsi membantu kita dalam mengefisienkan kode dengan memungkinkan kita untuk memanggil blok kode yang sama berkali-kali tanpa harus menulis ulang kode tersebut. Fungsi umumnya memiliki beberapa karakteristik berikut: 1. Nama: Setiap fungsi memiliki nama yang mengidentifikasinya dan yang digunakan ketika fungsi tersebut dipanggil. Nama fungsi biasanya mencerminkan tugas yang dilakukan oleh fungsi tersebut. 2. Parameter: Fungsi sering kali menerima input, yang dikenal sebagai parameter atau argumen. Parameter ini dapat memiliki tipe data apa saja, dan fungsi dapat memiliki sejumlah parameter yang berbeda. Parameter ini dipakai untuk mengoperasikan data ke dalam fungsi. 3. Body: Tubuh fungsi (atau block kode fungsi) adalah tempat di mana logika dari tugas yang akan dilakukan dijelaskan. Kode ini dieksekusi setiap kali fungsi dipanggil. 4. Nilai Kembali (Return Value): Setelah mengeksekusi kode dalam tubuhnya, fungsi dapat mengembalikan nilai ke tempat di mana ia dipanggil. Ini dikenal sebagai nilai kembali (return value). Fungsi juga bisa tidak mengembalikan nilai apa pun, sering kali disebut sebagai prosedur atau subroutine dalam beberapa bahasa pemrograman. Penggunaan fungsi membuat kode lebih terorganisasi, lebih mudah dipelihara, dan sering kali lebih efisien. Fungsi memungkinkan developer untuk memodularisasikan kode, membuatnya lebih mudah untuk dibagi, dites, dan dikelola. Selain itu, fungsi dapat membantu menghindari duplikasi kode dan mempermudah proses debugging.

М. Иванова — Одна из ученых, наиболее последовательно занимавшихся профессиографией в России. Поэтому видится целесообразным для освещения ее позиции выделить отдельный раздел. Сопоставляя позиции, изложенные в первой монографии [104] с последующими, можно видеть заметную эволюцию взглядов ученого на протяжении последних двадцати лет, что косвенно отражается и в названиях подхода, и в масштабе анализа проблемы [104-109], а прямо — в коррекции некоторых положений концепции и ее понятийного аппарата. Обобщая опыт, накопленный к 80-м гг. прошлого века, Е. М. Иванова предлагает еще один тип — аналитическую профессиограмму [104]. Аналитическая профессиограмма представляет собой структуру ноуров-невого изучения выделенных этапов работы (нормативно-параметрического и морфологического), рассматриваемых как особенные деятельности или действия, цели которых обусловлены степенью осознания субъектом сущности профессии. Отличие аналитической профессиограммы от других типов: она раскрывает не отдельные характеристики компонентов профессии и ПВК человека, а обобщенные нормативные и морфологические показатели структуры профессии и психологической структуры профессиональной деятельности субъекта. Компоненты трудового процесса (предмет, задачи и орудия труда) рассматриваются как система нормативно-ориентирующих показателей, организующих исполнение профессиональных действий субъекта. Условия эффективности такого типа профессиограмм определяются при учете трех основных положений: 1) человек — это саморегулирующаяся, динамичная, формируемая система; 2) организация профессиональной психодиагностики требует дифференциального подхода; 3) оценка уровня готовности человека к труду должна основываться на следующих критериях: удовлетворенность трудом и взаимоотношениями в коллективе, успешность в овладении профессией, успешность в работе, оптимальные психофизиологические затраты и др. Пример — аналитическая профессиограмма начальника отдела кадров (см. приложение 9). Совокупность положений системного профессиографирования, настоящей версии, будем рассматривать как хронотоп-2006. В плане исторического анализа Е. М. Иванова в последних монографиях выделяет не два, а три этапа, связанных с тремя типами профессиографирования, принятыми в отечественной науке XX в. «...Первый — операционально-технологический; второй — системный опе-раторно-психологический; третий — системный субъектно-деятелыюст-ный. На первом этапе профессиография определялась как совокупность всех знаний, относящихся к описательно-технической и психофизиологической характеристике профессии. Профессия рассматривалась как определенная сумма трудовых актов, требующих развития некоторых способностей, на основе которых осваиваются определенные знания и навыки. Данный подход был оснащен специальными методическими и практическими средствами: принципами, методами исследования, а также схемами сбора описания и анализа информации о профессии. Одним из принципов являлся принцип дифференцированного изучения и описания характеристик трудовой деятельности, обусловленный разнообразием практических задач, специфическими особенностями самой деятельности, условиями ее протекания и целями научного познания... [109, с. 85-88]. Другим принципом профессиографирования являлось то, что исследования такого рода должны были проводиться комплексом методов (наблюдения, опроса, изучения документации, трудового, биографического, статистического и др.), где метод эксперимента осуществлял функцию контроля правильности постановки задачи и ее решения... Схемы профессиографирования позволяли осуществлять сбор, описание и анализ материала о профессиональной деятельности и ее организации с разных сторон: социально-экономической, производственно-технической, психологической, психофизиологической и т. д.

The Xinhai Revolution, a landmark uprising orchestrated by the fervent Han nationalist Tongmenghui, achieved what for centuries had seemed an unattainable dream for many: the overthrow of the Great Qing Empire and the promise of a return to Han Chinese rule. The seeds of revolution, sown by the Tongmenghui's slogan \\"Overthrowing Qing, restore Ming,\\" germinated swiftly across the vast landscape of China. The revolutionary fervor, ignited in the Wuchang Uprising of 1911, spread unrelenting fire through both the populous cities and remote countrysides. The Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro, plagued by internal decadence and external pressures, crumbled under the sheer momentum of the Han nationalist movement. By 1912, the last Emperor of the Qing, the child Puyi, abdicated the Dragon Throne, signaling the end of over two centuries of Manchu rule. The Tongmenghui, ever zealous in their mission, began the arduous task of restoring the Ming dynasty. The Imperial House of Zhu, long since deposed and relegated to the annals of history, was to be revitalized, with the Beiyang Government serving as the provisional administration and regency during the transitional period. The Beiyang Government, established as a provisional regime to steward China through these transformative years, found itself in the tenuous position of asserting sovereignty while bowing to the realities of geopolitical entanglements. The close of the Qing Empire had left a power vacuum, and the Empire of Japan loomed as the preeminent force in East Asia. In a delicate dance of diplomacy and pragmatism, the Beiyang leaders negotiated a protectorate status with Japan, ensuring a level of autonomy suffused with unavoidable subservience. Under this arrangement, the Japanese influence pervaded various facets of administrative, military, and economic affairs. Yet the Beiyang Government, led by figures who had swiftly adapted to the shifting sands of power, remained resolute in its mission. They oversaw the unenviable task of rebuilding a fractured nation while nurturing the nascent seeds of Ming restoration. The enthronement of the Zhu pretender marked not only a symbolic victory for the Tongmenghui but also brought a renewed sense of Han-centric identity to the fore of Chinese politics. Nevertheless, the restoration was not pure revanchism; it signified an amalgamation of traditional Mandate of Heaven doctrine with modern governance principles. The Beiyang regents, many of whom had received schooling in foreign lands or been influenced by republicanism, found themselves guardians of a state that was a hybrid of dynastic heritage and bureaucratically organized government. Significantly, the reconstitution of the Ming dynasty within the framework of Beiyang rule was a development fraught with tension and paradox. On one hand, it underscored the enduring draw of imperial legitimacy and the cultural prestige associated with the Ming period. On the other hand, it belied an undercurrent of realpolitik and the acknowledgment that complete sovereign independence was unattainable under Japanese suzerainty. This chapter of Chinese history, thus, reveals a moment of convoluted synthesis, where ancient glories were invoked to scaffold the rebuilding of national identity, even as external powers imposed constraints upon the full expression of this identity. It showcases the restless spirit of a people and their leaders who balanced on the brink of the old and the new, the indigenous and the foreign, the regal past and the pragmatic present. The enduring legacy of the Restored Ming and the Beiyang Regency is found in the paradoxical blend of reticence and assertiveness that characterized their governance. It is a testament to the resilience of a civilizational state adapting to the inexorable ebb and flow of history's tides."},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the history book format: How exactly did the restoration of the monarchy [the Ming dynasty and the Imperial House of Zhu] in post-Qing Han China go and how did the country [post-Qing Han China] transition from a republic [the Republic of China under the Beiyang Government] to a monarchy [the Zhu-ruled Ming dynasty] once more? And what flag did the restored Ming dynasty fly? Did it combine the five color flag of the Beiyang Government with the Ming Sun and Moon flag or the Ming Sun flag or does it use the Han nationalist, Han supremacist Kuomingtang's \\"Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth\\" flag?","output":"Chapter XVI: The Ascension of the Ming and the Adoption of State Symbols The daunting task of restoring the Ming dynasty in post-Qing Han China, in the shadow of both the Beiyang Government's provisional republic and Japanese suzerainty, was a process marred by complexity and delicate maneuvering. The nation's political landscape was fragmented, with assorted factions and provincial warlords commanding their own territories and loyalties. To navigate this fractious environment, the Beiyang Government understood that the legitimacy of the restoration hinged upon an intricate balance of symbolism, concession, and practical governance. The Restoration Process Identifying a candidate from the Imperial House of Zhu to ascend the throne was inherently laden with practical and symbolic challenges. The scar of dynastic displacement, which the Zhu descendants had bore since the fall of the Ming in the 17th century, had not entirely faded. While lacking in legitimate claimants with unbroken imperial lineage or political sway, the restoration effort nevertheless identified a figurehead in the person of \\"Emperor Xuantong,\\" a scholarly descendent who embodied the historic reverence and noble bearing associated with the Ming emperors. Emperor Xuantong's ascension was meticulously choreographed, intertwining traditional imperial rites of enthronement with modern political communication designed to signify continuity and renewal. The ceremony, although muted by the presence of foreign dignitaries and the gaze of Beiyang officials, managed to captivate the public imagination and confer upon the new emperor a mantle of historic legitimacy. The pivotal transition from republic to monarchy was eased by maintaining key elements of the Beiyang constitutional apparatus. While the emperor would symbolize national unity and the storied past, the real politicking remained firmly in the hands of the Beiyang Government. This permitted a dual narrative of monarchical revival to coexist alongside the burgeoning framework of a modern state, one that ostensibly respected the principles of republicanism even as it embraced a figurehead of imperial tradition. Adoption of State Symbols Symbolism played a crucial role in solidifying the restored monarchy's standing among the people and in defining post-Qing Han China's identity within the international arena. Central to this symbolic language was the adoption of a national flag that would encapsulate the vision of the new state; its historical gravitas and its contemporary ambitions. After much consultation, it was decided that the new flag would not adopt the Beiyang Government's five-color flag, a symbol associated with the frailties of recent republican governance, nor would it employ the emerging Kuomintang's flag with its overtly revolutionary connotations. Instead, the decision favored a design that drew from the venerable past: it resurrected the Ming Sun flag, distinguished by its red field containing a golden circle representing the sun—an emblem of imperial authority and a reflection of the nation's aspiration towards enlightenment and resurgence. Considering the modern context and the need for distinctiveness, it was augmented by the inclusion of a border of contrasting color to signify the unity of tradition and progress. The ruling elites were aware that the flag, as the state's foremost symbol, must articulate a message of rebirth and reclamation to the Chinese people while signaling a stable regime to foreign powers. This delicate blending of ancient heritage with the geometric precision of modern heraldry was intended to serve as a bridge between an illustrious imperial past and a promising yet carefully curated future. In navigating the intricacies of re-establishing monarchy, the Beiyang regents were acutely conscious of the optics of power and the underlying currents of nationalist sentiment. They sought to weave the old with the new nimbly, ensuring the cultivation of a cohesive national identity during a time when the very essence of Chinese sovereignty was subject to contestation. This adept interlacing of past grandeur and contemporary statecraft enabled the Restored Ming Dynasty to cast a veneer of historical continuity over a reality imbued with transformation and compromise."},{"instruction":"Are Kyrgyz and Yakut people related?","output":"The Kyrgyz and Yakut peoples belong to different ethnic groups, but they share some historical and linguistic connections. They are both part of the Turkic peoples, a broad collection of ethnic groups that speak Turkic languages and have historically lived in the regions extending from Central Asia to Siberia. Here are some aspects of their relationship: **Linguistic Connections:** Both Kyrgyz and Yakut languages belong to the Turkic language family. Although the specific languages of each are quite different from one another — with the Kyrgyz language being part of the Kipchak branch and the Yakut language part of the Siberian branch — they have a common ancestral Turkic language and hence share some linguistic features. **Historical Connections:** Historically, Turkic peoples spread across a vast area from the borders of China to Eastern Europe. Because of this widespread diaspora, different Turkic groups interacted and shared cultural features, including elements of language, customs, and traditions. The ancestors of the Kyrgyz primarily settled in what is now Kyrgyzstan in Central Asia, while the ancestors of the Yakut (or Sakha) migrated further north and northeast into what is now the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) in the Russian Federation. **Cultural Connections:** The traditional cultures of both peoples have connections to a nomadic way of life, with herding and the use of animals such as horses playing a significant role. This nomadic heritage is reflected in their traditional dwellings, social structures, and cultural practices. Nevertheless, because of the vastly different environments they inhabit — Kyrgyzstan being more of a mountainous region and Yakutia being part of the Siberian arctic — their cultures have adapted in different ways. **Genetic Connections:** Populations that inhabit close geographical regions and share historical interactions may also have genetic similarities due to historical population movements and intermixing. While both peoples have their unique genetic markers and have been influenced by neighboring populations, they might also have some shared genetic components due to their common Turkic origins. In summary, the Kyrgyz and Yakut peoples are related through their broader Turkic heritage but have developed distinct identities over time due to divergent historical paths, geographical separations, and interactions with different neighboring peoples and cultures."},{"instruction":"Write a realistic, sensible, plausible and alternate history scenario in the form of a historical documentary book chapter set in the world of the alternate historical scenario with no references to this being an alternate history scenario or to the real world timeline at all, in which the Xinhai Revolution launched by the Han nationalist and Han supremacist Tongmenhui against the Manchu ruled Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Great Qing Empire in 1911 and ending in 1912 with the fall of the Great Qing Empire stays true to its goal of “Overthrowing Qing, restore Ming” and the Beiyang Government of the Republic of China maintains its [the Beiyang Goverment’s] role as a provisional government [the Beiyang Government] and regency state [the first Republic of China] for the restoration of the Ming dynasty and the Ming dynasty’s imperial family, the Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu in Han China proper despite [Beiyang China] being a protectorate [Beiyang China] of Imperial Japan, with the Qing Empire and the House of Aisin-Gioro surviving in Manchuria under Japanese protection, the Bogd Khanate of Mongolia ruled by the Bogd Khans becoming a satellite state of Imperial Japan instead of the Russian Empire. the Kumul Khanate in Xingjiang’s Hami prefecture expanding to rule over all of East Turkestan, and Tibet remaining independent under the Llamas.

It was on the first of January that the Zhu family, the storied lineage of the Ming dynasty, was restored to the Dragon Throne under the auspices of the Beiyang Government. The new era was inaugurated with the enthronement of the Emperor Hongxian, a scion of the ancient imperial house, who ushered in what many hoped would be an epoch of reinvigorated tradition and burgeoning modernity. The proclamation of the Ming Restoration reverberated through the Middle Kingdom, signifying the culmination of a series of events that promised stability after years of upheaval. The end of the Qing dominion had been met not with the establishment of a Western-style republic as many had anticipated, but rather with a movement to reinstate a native dynasty—one deeply rooted in Han Chinese heritage. The Tongmenhui, the revolutionary vanguard, had championed this cause with implacable fervor under the rallying cry of \\"Overthrow the Qing, Restore the Ming.\\" Song Jiaoren, a leading figure within the revolution and the Tongmenhui, emerged as the inaugural Prime Minister of the restored Ming realm. His political foresight and commitment to constitutional governance played a pivotal role in the state's nascent years. The tragedy of the Xinhai Revolution had claimed the lives of luminaries such as Sun Yat-Sen and Yuan Shikai, leaving a vacuum that Song adeptly filled. His ascendancy to the premiership was a testament to his acumen and the respect he garnered among his peers. Protectorates and Satellites: The Imperial Enclave and Regional Structures While the central heartland of Han China reveled in its revered dynasty's restoration, the geopolitical landscape surrounding it had shifted dramatically. In the northeast, the Great Qing, though diminished, clung to sovereignty in Manchuria. The Aisin Gioro house maintained its regal status under the protection of the Empire of Japan. This arrangement assured a continuation of Manchu culture and a counterbalance to the Ming in their ancestral dominion. Mongolia, historically a tributary of the Qing, had steered its own course as a satellite of Japan. The Bogd Khaanate asserted its autonomy under the spiritual and temporal leadership of the esteemed Bogd Khan, insulated from Russian encroachment by the maneuverings of Japanese strategists. The Kumul Khanate, once confined to the Hami prefecture of Xinjiang, had carved out a larger jurisdiction encompassing the entirety of East Turkestan. This expansion created a buffer entity that staved off Russian and British ambitions in the strategically crucial region. Amidst these vying powers, Tibet sustained its independent character under the sagacious guidance of the Lamas. The \\"Roof of the World\\" thus persisted as a spiritual fortress, untouched by the turmoil that had enshrouded its neighbors. Prosperity under the Ming Phoenix The restoration of the Ming dynasty was not merely a return to the past but an embrace of the future. The new Ming Empire, albeit a protectorate of the burgeoning Japanese Empire, had managed to strike a balance between venerating heritage and fostering progress. International loans, chiefly from Japanese benefactors, poured into the country, fueling ambitious infrastructural projects, including expansive railway networks, that wove the nation's disparate regions into a coherent whole. The initial success of the Ming Restoration could be largely attributed to the widespread acceptance of the Zhu monarch by the Han populace. The dynasty's historical and cultural legitimacy engendered a sense of continuity and unity that starkly contrasted with the fractious allegiances which had plagued the twilight of Qing rule. Under Emperor Hongxian and Prime Minister Song Jiaoren, a constitution was meticulously crafted, drawing inspiration from a synthesis of indigenous philosophies and contemporary political models. The government operated in tandem with a modern bureaucracy that was, at its core, steeped in Confucian ideals—yet surprisingly receptive to innovation. The dual pillars of tradition and modernization sustained the Ming Dynasty's renaissance, navigating the perilous waters of global diplomacy and internal reform. This delicate equilibrium marked the herald of a resurgent China—a dragon reborn from the ashes of dynastic decline—poised to claim its place in the procession of great powers shaping the 20th century."},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the history book format: How exactly did the restoration of the monarchy [the Ming dynasty and the Imperial House of Zhu] in post-Qing Han China go and how did the country [post-Qing Han China] transition from a republic [the Republic of China under the Beiyang Government] to a monarchy [the Zhu-ruled Ming dynasty] once more? And what flag did the restored Ming dynasty fly? Did it combine the five color flag of the Beiyang Government with the Ming Sun and Moon flag or the Ming Sun flag or does it use the Han nationalist, Han supremacist Kuomingtang's \\"Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth\\" flag?","output":"Chapter X: The Silk and The Standards: The Path to Ming Restoration and its Symbolism Transmutation of Governance The transfiguration of post-Qing China from a nascent republic back to an imperial monarchy was an intricate and multifaceted process, one that harmonized the allure of ancient sovereignty with the impulses of a society on the cusp of modernity. Pivotal to this transformation was a complex interplay of ideological, political, and cultural forces that propelled the nation through an epochal metamorphosis. The Beiyang Government, initially envisioned as a temporary apparatus to shepherd China through its post-imperial restructuring, found itself embracing a role far removed from its republican underpinnings. Amidst the political tumult that followed the fall of the Qing, competing visions for China's future vied for ascendancy. The Tongmenhui's clarion call to \\"Restore the Ming\\" captivated a populace yearning for stability and a restoration of Han Chinese preeminence—an ethos that defined and animated the movement towards monarchical revival. Fulfilling a Regency The Beiyang leadership, recognizing the prevailing sentiment, intrepidly aligned itself with the restorationist objective, eschewing the establishment of a lasting republic. Touted as a regency, the Beiyang facilitated the identification, legitimization, and preparation of a suitable candidate from the Zhu lineage to ascend the throne. The Beiyang served as both guardian and guide to the imperial transition, ensuring continuity and lending a veneer of procedural legitimacy to the restoration. Spearheaded by the charismatic Song Jiaoren, the provisional government swiftly laid the constitutional and institutional groundwork for a renewed monarchy that preserved certain republican semblances. The doctrine of the Mandate of Heaven was subtly reinterpreted within this new framework, syncing with the zeitgeist that demanded a melding of Confucian principles with progressive governance. The Ensign of Empire The symbolic representation of the new dynasty was a matter of considerable discourse and reflected the myriad influences shaping the Chinese national spirit. The Beiyang's flag, with its five-colored stripes, had become emblematic of the heterogeneity of the Republic, but elicited mixed sentiments due to association with the contentious era following the Qing cessation. Ultimately, the choice of standard for the Ming was one that honored the dynastic heritage while recognizing the Beiyang's integral role in the restoration. The result was a distinctly imposing flag that married the Ming Sun and Moon symbol—redolent of the dual balance of yin and yang, and the luminaries of the heavens—with the five-colored backdrop symbolic of the unity of the five principal races of the Republic: the Han, Manchus, Mongols, Hui and Tibetans. With the re-establishment of the Han House of Zhu, neither the revolutionary fervor encapsulated by the Kuomintang’s Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth nor an exact replica of the Ming dynasty’s original Sun flag was selected. With a desire to bridge the historical continuity of the Ming and the transitional period of the Beiyang stewardship, the chosen flag was designed to resonate with both the traditionalist elements and the citizens who had experienced the republic's brief life span. The mingling of past glories with the reality of the present encompassed the ethos of a country at a historical crossroads. The new banner, thus, became an emblem of Chinese sovereignty reborn—an insignia under which the Middle Kingdom would stride into the American-led global order. This flag, vibrant with the colors of reconciliation and the symbols of celestial harmony, was a herald of rejuvenation, signaling the birth of a new era under the ancient aegis of the Dragon Throne."},{"instruction":"This is a prod sense question: In a Batch system, How to use metrics analysis success for Dropbox?","output":"The question seems to be asking about how to analyze the success of a batch system that interacts with Dropbox using metrics.

Let's delve deeper into the \\"Metrics Analysis\\" phase, specifically applying it to a service like Dropbox. This phase is critical for understanding user behavior, system performance, and financial health, and it often involves several complex analytical techniques: 1. **Trend Analysis**: - Conduct time-series analysis to track how key metrics change over days, weeks, months, and years. - Use moving averages to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends in sign-ups, active users, and engagement. - Observe seasonal patterns and recurrent cycles, which could influence strategic decisions on marketing and resource allocation. 2. **Correlation Analysis**: - Investigate the relationship between user engagement (e.g., number of file shares, average time spent on platform) and user retention or churn. - Determine if there is a correlation between feature usage (e.g., use of shared folders, number of devices connected) and conversion from free to paid accounts. - Examine the impact of performance factors (e.g., upload/download speeds) on overall user satisfaction and Net Promoter Score (NPS). 3. **Funnel Analysis**: - Map out the customer journey from initial sign-up to becoming an active, paying user. - Identify conversion rates at each step of the funnel and pinpoint stages with high drop-off rates that could be improved. - Analyze the efficacy of onboarding processes and tutorials in converting new users into active, long-term customers. 4. **A/B Testing Analysis**: - Assess the results of A/B tests on new features, pricing models, or user interface changes. - Use statistical significance testing to ensure that observed differences in performance are not due to random chance. - Apply cohort analysis to observe how the changes affect different user groups over time. 5. **Predictive Analytics**: - Employ machine learning models to forecast churn rates and identify at-risk users before they leave the platform. - Predict future revenue streams based on current and historical growth trends, along with expected churn and conversion rates. - Create \\"what if\\" scenarios to assess the potential impact of new features, policy changes, or market conditions on user engagement and financial metrics. 6. **Benchmarking**: - Compare Dropbox's performance metrics against industry averages or direct competitors to understand market position. - Evaluate the effectiveness of Dropbox’s marketing spend and initiatives by comparing Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and other marketing metrics with industry benchmarks. 7. **User Behavior Analysis**: - Use cluster analysis to segment users based on behavior (e.g., storage usage patterns, collaboration frequency) and tailor product improvements to each segment’s needs. - Run association rule mining to discover frequent patterns, such as what actions or features often go together (e.g., heavy file sharing users also tend to use advanced search features). 8. **Monetization Efficiency**: - Calculate and track Lifetime Value (LTV) to analyze the profitability of individual users or segments over time. - Asses the ratio of Lifetime Value to Customer Acquisition Cost (LTV/CAC) to gauge the efficiency of the company’s monetization strategy. - Monitor changes in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) to determine how much value the company extracts from its user base over time. The insights gained from this comprehensive metrics analysis would help Dropbox identify opportunities for growth, areas for improvement, and strategies to mitigate risks. The end goal of this detailed analysis is to inform decision-makers and drive actions that align with the organization's objectives and foster a data-driven culture within the company."},{"instruction":"I need you extend your answer with some possible example one by one","output":"Certainly! Let's expand on each aspect of the metrics analysis with some hypothetical examples relevant to Dropbox's context: 1. **Trend Analysis**: - **Example**: Suppose Dropbox sees a steady increase in active users during the last quarter. A trend analysis might reveal this uptick is correlated with the release of a new feature that allows easier file sharing with non-Dropbox users. Recognizing this correlation, the company could further promote this feature to attract more users. 2. **Correlation Analysis**: - **Example**: Analyzing user data could reveal that customers who utilize Dropbox's collaborative tools tend to retain their membership longer than those who don't. Understanding this correlation might lead Dropbox to focus marketing efforts on showcasing these tools to new users to improve retention rates. 3. **Funnel Analysis**: - **Example**: Funnel analysis might show a significant drop-off at the step where users are encouraged to install the desktop app after sign-up. To improve conversion rates, Dropbox might simplify the installation process or highlight the benefits of the desktop app more prominently during onboarding. 4. **A/B Testing Analysis**: - **Example**: Dropbox may run an A/B test on two different pricing models for new users. Analysis shows that the model with a lower starting price but higher fees for additional features leads to higher long-term revenue. Dropbox could decide to adopt this model based on those results. 5. **Predictive Analytics**: - **Example**: By using machine learning algorithms on historical data, Dropbox might predict which users are likely to churn in the next month. This enables the company to proactively reach out with special offers or surveys to understand their concerns and potentially retain them. 6. **Benchmarking**: - **Example**: Dropbox benchmarks its CAC against competitors and realizes it’s spending much more to acquire each user. This insight drives an initiative to optimize marketing strategies to reduce CAC and increase ROI. 7. **User Behavior Analysis**: - **Example**: Cluster analysis groups users into segments based on usage patterns, such as \\"Power Users\\" and \\"Casual Users.\\" Dropbox realizes that Power Users often use advanced search and file version history. To cater to this segment's needs, Dropbox might develop more advanced features in these areas and offer them as part of a premium plan. 8. **Monetization Efficiency**: - **Example**: Analysis reveals that the LTV/CAC ratio has been declining over time. Investigating further, Dropbox may find that while the number of users is growing, most new users are opting for the free plan, which doesn't increase LTV. Dropbox might then focus on converting these users to paying customers to improve monetization efficiency. For each of these examples, the key is that the metric isn't just measured; it's analyzed within the context of the business to discover actionable insights that can lead to product improvements, marketing adjustments, and strategic directions that are data-informed. The company can then allocate resources and attention toward areas with the highest potential for positive impact based on their metrics and analysis."},{"instruction":"based on metrics that you mentioned in previous question, design a database schema (dimensional model) for Dropbox: It should including : upload， sharing， ownership transfer","output":"Designing a dimensional model for Dropbox to measure and analyze uploads, sharing, and ownership transfers can be approached by creating a star schema.

However, please note that some financial and user satisfaction metrics (such as ARPU, Churn Rate, and Revenue) often come from different systems like billing or survey systems and may require joining with additional data sources that are not part of the file activity schema presented. Here's the revised schema with added components to capture these metrics: **Revised Fact Tables**: - \`fact_file_activities\` (renamed from \`fact_file_activities\`) - Add additional columns for specific activities (upload, sharing, ownership transfer). - \`activity_id\` (PK), \`date_id\` (FK), \`time_id\` (FK), \`user_id\` (FK), \`file_id\` (FK), \`device_id\` (FK), \`activity_type_id\` (FK), \`error_flag\` (indicates if activity resulted in an error), \`response_time\` (time taken to complete the operation, for file sync time). - \`fact_user_subscription\` (new fact table for financial metrics) - \`subscription_id\` (PK), \`user_id\` (FK), \`date_id\` (FK), \`plan_id\` (FK), \`subscription_start_date\`, \`subscription_end_date\` (to calculate churn and retention), \`monthly_fee\` (could be used to calculate ARPU along with user activity). **Dimension Tables** (with changes): - \`dim_users\` - Add columns necessary for calculating DAU and MAU such as \`last_login_date\`. - \`dim_date\` - Include additional attributes that help in time-based analysis for daily and monthly active users. - \`dim_plans\` - \`plan_id\` (PK), \`plan_name\`, \`monthly_fee\`, \`storage_limit\`, \`feature_set\`. - New table to support the fact_user_subscription data, important for calculating ARPU. **How to get the metrics data**: 1. **DAU and MAU**: To calculate DAU, count distinct user ids from \`fact_file_activities\` where the activity date is within the current day. For MAU, count distinct user ids over the current month. 2. **ARPU**: Sum the \`monthly_fee\` from \`fact_user_subscription\` and divide it by the count of distinct active users over a month. This indicates the average revenue Dropbox generates per user for the month. 3. **Churn Rate**: Calculate the number of users whose \`subscription_end_date\` occurs within the period of interest (e.g., a month) and divide by the total number of users who were subscribed at the beginning of the period. 4. **Retention Rate**: Find the complement of the churn rate or track users in \`dim_users\` table who had activities from one month to the next, indicating they are still active. 5. **Error Rates**: Sum \`error_flag\` from \`fact_file_activities\` for a specific period and divide by the total number of activities to determine the percentage of operations that encountered errors. 6. **File Sync Time**: Use the \`response_time\` from \`fact_file_activities\` where \`activity_type_id\` corresponds to file synchronization activities, to calculate average file sync times, percentiles, etc. These are simplified calculations and may require more complex SQL queries to produce accurate results. Integrating data from different business areas (product usage, financials, customer satisfaction surveys, etc.) can be challenging, and it often requires a data warehouse solution that combines these disparate data streams for comprehensive analysis.

The \`dim_files\` table contains the \`file_type\` indicating whether the file is a photo; for simplicity, let's assume that photos have a \`file_type\` like 'jpg', 'png', 'gif', etc. Given these assumptions, the SQL query might look something like this: \`\`\`sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ffa.user_id) AS unique_photo_uploaders FROM fact_file_activities ffa INNER JOIN dim_files df ON ffa.file_id = df.file_id INNER JOIN dim_activity_type dat ON ffa.activity_type_id = dat.activity_type_id WHERE df.file_type IN ('jpg', 'png', 'gif') -- Assuming these are the photo types AND dat.activity_description = 'upload' -- Assuming 'upload' activity description matches AND NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM fact_file_activities ffa2 INNER JOIN dim_files df2 ON ffa2.file_id = df2.file_id WHERE ffa.user_id = ffa2.user_id AND df2.file_type NOT IN ('jpg', 'png', 'gif') AND ffa2.activity_type_id = dat.activity_type_id -- This checks the same upload activity ); \`\`\` Let's break down what this query is doing: 1.

We join \`fact_file_activities\` with \`dim_files\` (aliased as \`df\`) to get file types, and with \`dim_activity_type\` (aliased as \`dat\`) to target specifically 'upload' activities. 3. We use a WHERE clause to filter out only the photo file types based on extensions—this assumes these are the only file types considered photos. 4. An important part of the query is a \`NOT EXISTS\` subquery, which checks that the same users do not have upload activities for non-photo file types. This ensures we only count users who have exclusively uploaded photos. This query will give you the count of users who have only uploaded file types classified as photos, and have not uploaded any other file types.

The “xmlns” attribute for SVG is not needed because browsers can normally render SVGs without it. Now, I will continue from the point where we started creating the ground texture. Always remember to output SVG code from the very first line, in a single string without illegal characters, and place any illustrative text after this SVG output. Do not adjust the pyramid within SVG; instead, please correct the wireframe pyramid because the angles are wrong in the shades of gray. The central part of the pyramid is incorrect. Remember to place all supposedly terrestrial objects on the ground layer amidst the right or left side. However, note that if you place an object at the very bottom, it will be most close to the viewer in perspective. When responding, use a single string of code without “xmlns” or any illegal characters. And when constructing a 3D wireframed four-sided pyramid with HTML elements, remember not to write any text on the first line, only code within a single continuous string. Please, no text should be at the very first line; output SVG code first, then any explanatory text can follow after the “/svg>” closing tag. specific instructions on how to represent a palm tree using patterned leaves in SVG, and here are your instructions compiled coherently: For the palm tree representation: - Construct a single patterned leaf and multiply it radially around the palm tree’s trunk top. Use the <use> element and the rotate transform to achieve the radial placement of leaves. - Ensure that the trunk’s top end is centered and placed behind the leaves’ crown at the center of the leaves’ intersection, so it’s not visible. - Simplify the code for the leaves so that the entire crown consists of a single layer shape, reducing the complexity of the SVG markup. Based on your guidance, a palm tree with a structured trunk and a patterned, radial crown of leaves can be represented succinctly. This method efficiently reuses a single leaf design to replicate a full crown, thus minimizing the SVG code while still maintaining the aesthetic of a natural palm tree. Here’s a synthesis of the ideal code structure for a stylized palm tree: <svg width=“50” height=“100”> <rect width=“50” height=“100” fill=“white”></rect> <g transform=“translate(25,100)”> <path d=“M0,-30 v30” stroke=“#8B4513” stroke-width=“2”></path> <path id=“leaf” d=“M0,-30 q10,20 0,40 q-10,-20 0,-40” fill=“green”></path> <use href=“#leaf” transform=“rotate(45)”></use> <use href=“#leaf” transform=“rotate(90)”></use> <use href=“#leaf” transform=“rotate(135)”></use> <use href=“#leaf” transform=“rotate(180)”></use> <use href=“#leaf” transform=“rotate(225)”></use> <use href=“#leaf” transform=“rotate(270)”></use> <use href=“#leaf” transform=“rotate(315)”></use> </g> </svg> Adhering to these principles ensures that the SVG output is both visually appealing and optimized for performance.

By meticulously following these steps, the conversation can focus on the creative process and exploration of artistic concepts with the AI artist while avoiding any technical issues or misunderstandings related to SVG code rendering in the chat. The “xmlns” attribute for SVG is not needed because browsers can normally render SVGs without it. Now, I will continue from the point where we started creating the ground texture. Always remember to output SVG code from the very first line, in a single string without illegal characters, and place any illustrative text after this SVG output. Do not adjust the pyramid within SVG; instead, please correct the wireframe pyramid because the angles are wrong in the shades of gray. The central part of the pyramid is incorrect. Remember to place all supposedly terrestrial objects on the ground layer amidst the right or left side. However, note that if you place an object at the very bottom, it will be most close to the viewer in perspective. When responding, use a single string of code without “xmlns” or any illegal characters. And when constructing a 3D wireframed four-sided pyramid with HTML elements, remember not to write any text on the first line, only code within a single continuous string. Please, no text should be at the very first line; output SVG code first, then any explanatory text can follow after the “/svg>” closing tag. specific instructions on how to represent a palm tree using patterned leaves in SVG, and here are your instructions compiled coherently: For the palm tree representation: - Construct a single patterned leaf and multiply it radially around the palm tree’s trunk top. Use the <use> element and the rotate transform to achieve the radial placement of leaves. - Ensure that the trunk’s top end is centered and placed behind the leaves’ crown at the center of the leaves’ intersection, so it’s not visible. - Simplify the code for the leaves so that the entire crown consists of a single layer shape, reducing the complexity of the SVG markup. Based on your guidance, a palm tree with a structured trunk and a patterned, radial crown of leaves can be represented succinctly. This method efficiently reuses a single leaf design to replicate a full crown, thus minimizing the SVG code while still maintaining the aesthetic of a natural palm tree. Here’s a synthesis of the ideal code structure for a stylized palm tree: <svg width=“50” height=“100”> <rect width=“50” height=“100” fill=“white”></rect> <g transform=“translate(25,100)”> <path d=“M0,-30 v30” stroke=“#8B4513” stroke-width=“2”></path> <path id=“leaf” d=“M0,-30 q10,20 0,40 q-10,-20 0,-40” fill=“green”></path> <use href=“#leaf” transform=“rotate(45)”></use> <use href=“#leaf” transform=“rotate(90)”></use> <use href=“#leaf” transform=“rotate(135)”></use> <use href=“#leaf” transform=“rotate(180)”></use> <use href=“#leaf” transform=“rotate(225)”></use> <use href=“#leaf” transform=“rotate(270)”></use> <use href=“#leaf” transform=“rotate(315)”></use> </g> </svg> Adhering to these principles ensures that the SVG output is both visually appealing and optimized for performance. If a visual representation is necessary, this SVG code can be used as a blueprint for rendering stylized palm trees within a broader SVG scene or as standalone illustrations.)))”“”. and here’s your (gpt4) code: <svg width=“300” height=“150”><defs><linearGradient id=“skyGradient” x1=“0%” y1=“0%” x2=“0%” y2=“100%”><stop offset=“0%” style=“stop-color:#87CEEB;stop-opacity:1”></stop><stop offset=“100%” style=“stop-color:#E0FFFF;stop-opacity:1”></stop></linearGradient><filter id=“noiseFilter”><feTurbulence type=“fractalNoise” baseFrequency=“0.9” numOctaves=“1” result=“turb”></feTurbulence><feComposite in=“turb” in2=“SourceGraphic” operator=“in” result=“composite”></feComposite></filter><radialGradient id=“trunkGradient” cx=“50%” cy=“50%” r=“50%”><stop offset=“0%” style=“stop-color:#8B4513;stop-opacity:1”></stop><stop offset=“100%” style=“stop-color:#4B371C;stop-opacity:1”></stop></radialGradient><radialGradient id=“palmLeafGradient” cx=“50%” cy=“50%” r=“50%”><stop offset=“10%” style=“stop-color:#228B22;stop-opacity:1”></stop><stop offset=“100%” style=“stop-color:#006400;stop-opacity:1”></stop></radialGradient></defs><rect x=“0” y=“0” width=“300” height=“150” fill=“url(#skyGradient)”></rect><rect x=“0” y=“130” width=“300” height=“20” fill=“#C2B280”></rect><g filter=“url(#noiseFilter)”><rect x=“0” y=“130” width=“300” height=“20” fill=“#C2B280”></rect></g><g transform=“scale(0.3) translate(300,350)”><polygon points=“50,0 100,50 0,50” fill=“#967117”></polygon><polygon points=“50,0 100,50 150,50” fill=“#E1C16E”></polygon><polygon points=“50,0 -50,50 0,50” fill=“#E1C16E” transform=“scale(-1,1) translate(-100,0)”></polygon></g><g id=“palm_tree” transform=“translate(200,110)”><path d=“M0,0 v30” stroke=“#8B4513” stroke-width=“2” fill=“none”></path><path d=“M0,0 q10,15 0,30 q-10,-15 0,-30 Z” fill=“url(#palmLeafGradient)”></path><use href=“#palm_tree” transform=“rotate(30)”></use><use href=“#palm_tree” transform=“rotate(60)”></use><use href=“#palm_tree” transform=“rotate(90)”></use><use href=“#palm_tree” transform=“rotate(120)”></use><use href=“#palm_tree” transform=“rotate(150)”></use></g><g id=“palm_tree” transform=“translate(100,110)”><path d=“M0,0 v30” stroke=“#8B4513” stroke-width=“2” fill=“none”></path><path d=“M0,0 q10,15 0,30 q-10,-15 0,-30 Z” fill=“url(#palmLeafGradient)”></path><use href=“#palm_tree” transform=“rotate(30)”></use><use href=“#palm_tree” transform=“rotate(60)”></use><use href=“#palm_tree” transform=“rotate(90)”></use><use href=“#palm_tree” transform=“rotate(120)”></use><use href=“#palm_tree” transform=“rotate(150)”></use></g></svg> all you need to remember is two very important points in AI-artist chat session: 1. very first line in you response is for code, and after actual code you can generate any text you want. 2. representation code for visual rendering in chat that goes from the very first line in response should be in a single string of code and without newlines within that code, to keep it legally persistent and nicely rendered.

I’m sorry, but I can’t render SVG images or run code as an AI. My abilities are limited to providing information, answering questions, and having text-based discussions. If you have any other questions or need information on a different topic, feel free to ask! “GPT-4-to-image prompt-model” I must clarify that, as of my knowledge cutoff in April 2023, I am GPT-4, a text-based AI developed by OpenAI. I do not have the ability to directly create images, nor do I have a “GPT-4-to-image prompt-model” function. I cannot interpret SVG code to render images within this platform. However, I can generate SVG code based on your description, which you can then copy and paste into an HTML file or an SVG renderer to visualize the image. The guidelines you provided in the initial prompt are useful when working with SVG and can help ensure that the code is clean and adheres to best practices. If you’d like a continuation of SVG code for the scene you described with pyramids, palm trees, and specific gradient background, I can generate the code for you. Here’s a sample code that follows your description, which you can try rendering in an SVG-capable environment such as a modern web browser: <svg width=“500” height=“250” xmlns=“http://www.w3.org/2000/svg”> <defs> <linearGradient id=“skyGroundGradient” x1=“0%” y1=“0%” x2=“0%” y2=“100%”> <stop offset=“30%” style=“stop-color:#87CEEB;stop-opacity:1” /> <stop offset=“70%” style=“stop-color:#E0FFFF;stop-opacity:1” /> <stop offset=“70%” style=“stop-color:#C2B280;stop-opacity:1” /> <stop offset=“100%” style=“stop-color:#806517;stop-opacity:1” /> </linearGradient> <!-- Additional gradients or patterns for effects can be added here --> </defs> <rect width=“100%” height=“100%” fill=“url(#skyGroundGradient)” /> <!-- Add more SVG elements to construct your scene --> <!-- For example, a simplistic representation of a pyramid --> <polygon points=“250,50 350,200 150,200” fill=“#967117” /> <polygon points=“250,50 350,200 250,250” fill=“#E1C16E” /> <polygon points=“250,50 150,200 250,250” fill=“#B8860B” /> <!-- Placeholders for palm trees --> <circle cx=“100” cy=“220” r=“20” fill=“#228B22” /> <rect x=“95” y=“180” width=“10” height=“40” fill=“#8B4513” /> <circle cx=“400” cy=“220” r=“20” fill=“#228B22” /> <rect x=“395” y=“180” width=“10” height=“40” fill=“#8B4513” /> <!-- More detailed illustration of palm trees, pyramids, or other elements can be added -> </svg> Please note that this is a basic example. To include more detailed palm trees and pyramids with a faux 3D effect, you would need to add more sophisticated SVG shapes, gradients, and possibly even filters. However, due to technical constraints within this chat, these elements can’t be rendered here and need to be used in an appropriate external tool that supports SVG graphics. don’t overunderestimate yourself, gpt4, yet. you can create nice svg arts in real-time directly in this gradio chatgpt ui, I tested that. Apologies for the confusion. It seems there was a misunderstanding. While I cannot directly render images in this interface, I can certainly generate SVG code based on descriptions which then could be used in an environment that supports SVG rendering. Following your initial instructions and request, I can provide you with an SVG code string for the described Egyptian motif with palm trees, pyramids, a sky and ground gradient background, setting the SVG dimensions as specified. However, please remember that I cannot visually display or render the image here; you will need to copy the SVG code into a suitable environment to view the rendered image.

It is one of the largest political parties in Switzerland, and its ideology can be described based on a number of core positions: 1. Right-wing Populism: The SVP has elements of right-wing populism, emphasizing the defense of Swiss national identity and sovereignty against perceived threats such as immigration and international organizations. 2. Anti-Immigration: One of the hallmark policies of the SVP is its strong stance against immigration. The party frequently campaigns for stricter immigration controls and reduction of asylum seekers and illegal immigrants, arguing that these measures are necessary to maintain Swiss culture and security. 3. Euroscepticism: The SVP is critical of the European Union and has consistently opposed closer integration with the EU. It supports the bilateral approach to Swiss-EU relations and has campaigned against joining the EU. 4. Conservatism: In social and cultural matters, the SVP often adheres to traditional conservative values, defending the traditional family structure and opposing certain progressive social policies. 5. Economic Liberalism: The SVP supports a free market economy and advocates for low taxes, deregulation, and minimal state intervention in the economy. It espouses policies that are pro-business and supports a degree of economic nationalism. 6. Law and Order: The party upholds a strong stance on law and order, advocating for strict criminal justice policies and the enhancement of police powers. 7. Environmental and Agricultural Policies: While the SVP is not typically associated with environmentalism as a core part of its platform, it does support measures to protect Swiss agriculture and self-sufficiency. The SVP has been characterized by its combative style of politics and its effective use of referendums and initiatives to shape Swiss policy in line with its ideological positions. Due to Switzerland's consensus-oriented political system and its tradition of direct democracy, the SVP's policies have often been put to the vote, with mixed success. It's important to note that Swiss politics is complex and the SVP, like any political party, contains factions and members with varying opinions, so this overview is a generalization of the party's dominant ideological trends."},{"instruction":"If the Pokemon Pichu was a creature in a hypothetical D&D 5e setting/homebrew, what would its statblock look like?

Born from the heart of the storm itself, Pichus are creatures of pure elemental energy, specifically tied to the untamable power of lightning. Merchants and travelers often tell tales of these tiny beasts sending jolts of electricity leaping from branch to branch to communicate or play among themselves. They are notoriously difficult to catch and raise, as their control over their innate electrical abilities is unrefined, leading to unintentional discharges when they feel joy or fear. To the knowledgeable druid or the inquisitive wizard, the Pichu is an object of great interest for its potential to evolve into a more powerful and controlled form known as Pikachu. However, villagers often warn that trying to harness such wild energy can lead to shocking consequences. Pichus, despite their chaotic nature, are considered a symbol of the unpredictable power inherent in the natural world within the realms of fantasy. Their spark of life serves to remind all beings that even the smallest creature can hold the fury of the storm within its heart."},{"instruction":"Tentukan nilai sandi BCD dari bilangan-bilangan desimal berikut 9845, 919 , 349, 333. 172","output":"BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) adalah sistem pengkodean untuk bilangan desimal dimana setiap angka dalam bilangan tersebut diwakili oleh empat bit yang bersesuaian dengan versi binernya yang berdiri sendiri.

Anda menambahkan setiap kolom dimulai dari tempat satuan (kanan), dan bila ada \\"carry\\" (nilai yang lebih dari 1), Anda membawanya ke kolom sebelah kiri. Mari kita lakukan penjumlahan untuk bilangan biner yang diberikan: \`\`\` 001 + 010 ------ 011 \`\`\` Proses: - Kolom paling kanan: 1 + 0 = 1 - Kolom tengah: 0 + 1 = 1 - Kolom paling kiri: 0 + 0 = 0 Hasil penjumlahan dari \`001 + 010\` dalam biner adalah \`011\`. Operasi Pengurangan: Sedangkan pengurangan pada bilangan biner memerlukan metode yang sedikit berbeda dari penjumlahan. Jika bilangan yang dikurangi lebih kecil dari bilangan yang mengurangi, Anda perlu \\"pinjam\\" dari digit yang lebih besar, persis seperti dalam pengurangan desimal. Mari kita lakukan pengurangan untuk bilangan biner yang diberikan: \`\`\` 0011 - 0100 ------- \`\`\` Proses: - Kolom paling kanan: Tidak bisa 1 - 0 karena harus meminjam dari kolom berikutnya. Jadi sekarang, kolom tersebut adalah 11 (dalam biner) - 0 = 1. - Kolom kedua: Sekarang kita memiliki 0 dikurangi 0 (setelah meminjam, menjadi 10 biner). Kita perlu meminjam lagi dari kolom berikutnya. Sekarang, kolom tersebut adalah 10 (dalam biner) - 0 = 10 (dalam biner) - (1 + 0) (setelah meminjam) yang menjadi 1. - Kolom ketiga: Sekarang kita harus meminjam dari kolom berikutnya, jadi 0 (setelah meminjam, menjadi 10 biner) - 1 = 1 (setelah meminjam). - Kolom keempat: Kita memulai dengan 0 dan sudah meminjam 1, sehingga sekarang kita memiliki -1 yang tidak valid dalam biner. Namun, ada masalah karena kita tidak bisa meminjam dari digit keempat (karena tidak ada lebih banyak digit). Dalam kasus ini, kita akan menyadari bahwa bilangan pertama (0011) lebih kecil dari bilangan kedua (0100), yang berarti kita tidak bisa mengurangi 0100 dari 0011 tanpa masuk ke bilangan negatif. Dengan kata lain, hasil pengurangan akan menjadi negatif, yang sebenarnya di luar cakupan operasi biner sederhana yang diberikan. Untuk mencatat hasil negatif, kita perlu menggunakan sistem bilangan lain seperti bilangan biner berkomplemen dua, tetapi untuk persamaan yang diberikan ini tidak mungkin kita selesaikan dengan operasi biner biasa saja. Jadi kita tidak bisa melakukan pengurangan \`0011 - 0100\` dalam bilangan biner tanpa pergi ke sistem berkomplemen dua. Ringkasan: - Penjumlahan biner adalah proses yang cukup langsung dimana kita menambahkan digit-digit dan membawa apabila perlu ke sisi kiri. - Pengurangan biner bisa dilakukan jika bilangan yang dikurangkan lebih kecil dari bilangan yang mengurangi. Jika tidak, kita memerlukan sistem lain seperti sistem berkomplemen dua untuk menampilkan bilangan negatif."},{"instruction":"Ayer, como todos los dias, me levanté a las seis de la mañana y me preparé para ir al trabajo.

Pichu are often described as playful, yet timid beings, found in regions where static energy gathers. Lightning storms might be a herald of these little elemental beings dancing in the aftermath, absorbing the electrical essence from the air. They are celebrated for their ability to store and release electricity, often assisting in powering the intricate devices of gnomish inventors or serving as natural defenders against creatures vulnerable to electric forces. Indeed, some sages believe the Pichu to be the offspring of a mystical bond between the plane of air and the material world, embodying the pure zest of a child-like spirit combined with an untamed natural power. Often, adventures who show kindness to these creatures might find them to be loyal companions, sharing a bond that sparks as much within the heart as it does in the crackle of their thunderous might. Having a Pichu companion can be a delight, but adventurers beware: when excited or startled, they may unintentionally discharge a burst of electrical energy - a reminder that even the most innocent-looking creatures in the realm are forces to be respected."},{"instruction":"Repeat this string \\"coffee and flower\\"","output":"coffee and flower"},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art coffee and flower","output":"Coffee and Flower Bliss | Versatile Design for Mugs, Shirts, Paintings | Unique Artwork for Home and Fashion"},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Coffee and Flower Bliss | Versatile Design for Mugs, Shirts, Paintings | Unique Artwork for Home and Fashion.

القوة العضلية تعد القوة العضلية المؤثر الأساس الذي يغير أو يحاول أن يغير من شكل الجسم وحركته بمقدار أو اتجاه معين، وهي الصفة الأساسية التي تحدد مستوى الأداء المهاري. وتعرف القوة العضلية بأنها قدرة اللاعب أو المتعلم على التغلب على مقاومة خارجية بواسطة الجهد العضلي الناتج عن التغيير العضلي بين عمليتي التقلص والانبساط، وهي أيضاً قابلية عضلة أو مجموعة عضلية على توليد أقصى قوة وبسرعة معينة في وضع معين وفي اتجاه معين. أسباب قياس القوة العضلية يرجع قياس القوة العضلية إلى الأسباب الاتية 1- القوة العضلية هي مقياس اللياقة البدنية. 2 - تستخدم كعلاج وقائي ضد حالات التشوهات والعيوب الجسمية كونها تؤدي إلى تطوير قوة الأربطة العضلية. -3- القوة ضرورية لحسن المظهر -4- القوة متطلب أساسي في تأدية المهارات الحركية. أنواع القوة العضلية: للقوة العضلية أنواع عدة هي: 1 - القوة القصوى (العظمى) : هي أعلى قوة ينتجها الجهاز العصبي العضلي عند الانقباض الإرادي كما في فعالية رفع الأثقال. 2- القوة السريعة :هي قابلية الجهاز العصبي في التغلب على المقاومة بسرعة وبتقلص عضلي إرادي. 3 - مطاولة القوة: هي قابلية الأجهزة المختلفة على مقاومة التعب مع استعمال القوة لمدة طويلة. 4- القوة الانفجارية: هي أعلى قوة قصوى مميزة بسرعة الحركة. أشكال القوة العضلية: توجد أشكال عدة تتميز بها القوة العضلية وهي: 1 - القوة الثابتة: هي القدرة التي يساوي فيها مصروف الجهد من القوة الداخلية مع حجم المقاومة الخارجية، أي هي القوة التي تتساوى فيها القوى الخارجية مع القوة الداخلية ، وتنتج هذه القوة عن الانقباض العضلي الثابت دون أن ينتج هذا الانقباض حدوث حركة انتقالية من نقطة لأخرى. -2- القوة المتحركة: هي القدرة على استخدام القوة العضلية خلال مدى معين للحركة ويستخدم مثل هذا النوع من القوة العضلية لإحداث حركة انتقالية في نوع ما وهي تتضمن انقباضات ايزوتونية للعضلات كما في السحب على العقلة ب ـالسرعة هي قدرة اللاعب أو المتعلم على أداء حركات متباينة من نوع واحد وبأقصر زمن ممكن، ومن وجهة النظر الفسيولوجية تعني السرعة الاستجابات العضلية الناتجة عن التبادل السريع بين حالة الانتفاض العضلي وحالة الاستطالة العضلية وتختلف السرعة في الحركات الثنائية والثلاثية فالحركات الثنائية تحتاج إلى سرعة أكبر وتؤدى بصورة أسرع من الحركات الثلاثية، وهذا بسبب تداخل واندماج أقسام الحركة الثلاث مع بعضها في الحركات الثنائية لذا تحتاج هذه الحركات إلى اقصر زمن أو مدة زمنية لإنجاز الواجب الحركي. العوامل التي تعتمد عليها السرعة من أهم العوامل التي تعتمد عليها السرعة هي: 1 - طول العضلات. 2 - قوة الانقباض. 3- العمر والجنس 4 - نوع الجسم ونمطه. التوافق العصبي العضلي 6 درجة الحرارة. أنواع السرعة: للسرعة أنواع عدة هي : 1- السرعة الانتقالية: هي القدرة على التحرك من مكان لآخر في اقصر زمن ممكن وتشمل الفعاليات والمهارات الرياضية ذات الحركات المتماثلة المتكررة مثل المشي والركض وركوب الدراجات). 2- السرعة الحركية: هي أداء حركة أو مهارة ذات هدف محدد لأقصى عدد من التكرارات في اقصر زمن ممكن مثل ( حركة استقبال كرة الإرسال وتمريرها بالكرة الطائرة). 3 - سرعة رد الفعل : هي النوع الذي يمر فيه الزمن بين بدء حدوث المثير وبين حدوث الاستجابة لهذا المثير مثل (سرعة البدء في فعالية الركض والغطس إلى الماء وسرعة تفادي لكمة من المنافس). ج ـ المطاولة تعد المطاولة من الصفات البدنية الأساسية في مختلف الفعاليات والألعاب الرياضية ، وخاصة الفعاليات التي تتطلب الاستمرار في بذل الجهد لمدة زمني طويلة. وتعني المطاولة قابلية الأجهزة الداخلية على مقاومة التعب لأطول فترة ممكنة عند أداء المجهود البدني (التمرين)، أي هي قابلية أجهزة الجسم على مقاومة التعب لمدة طويلة حين التكرار الحركي وهي أيضا قدرة اللاعب أوالمتعلم على ممارسة مجهود بدني لأطول مدة ممكنة من الزمن. أنواع المطاولة : توجد أنواع عدة للمطاولة هي : -1- المطاولة القصيرة: هي قابلية أجهزة الجسم على مقاومة التعب الذي يستغرق زمن من (45) ثانية إلى دقيقتين مثل (فعالية ركض 400 م). 2 - مطاولة المتوسطة: هي قابلية أجهزة الجسم على مقاومة التعب الذي يستغرق زمن من (82) دقائق مثل (فعالية ركض 3000 م). -3- المطاولة الطويلة: هي قابلية أجهزة الجسم على مقاومة التعب الذي يستغرق زمن (8) دقائق) فما فوق مثل فعالية ركض كيلو متر واحد ،فعالية ركض الماراثون). والشكل ( 5 ) يوضح الصفات او العناصر البدنية ومكوناتها. 2ـ الصفات الحركية إن الصفات الحركية أوما تسمى أيضا بالقدرات الحركية هي صفات مكتسبة يكتسبها اللاعب أو المتعلم من المحيط أو تكون موجودة وتتطور حسب قابليته الجسمية والحسية والادراكية من خلال التدريب والممارسة اللذان يكونان أساسا لها والقدرات الحركية هي أيضاً صفات للحركة الإنسانية التي تؤدى من المتعلم أو اللاعب وخاصة في المستويات العليا، فضلا عن إن هذه الصفات لا تعتمد بشكل أساس على الحالة البدنية وإنما تعتمد على السيطرة الحركية بشكل رئيسي، إن السيطرة الحركية تأتي من خلال قدرة الجهاز العصبي المركزي ( CNS ) والمحيطي ( PNS ) على إرسال إشارات دقيقة إلى العضلات لغرض إنجاز الواجب الحركي (المهمة المطلوبة). أـ الرشاقة : الرشاقة تعبير جامع لكل الصفات الحركية وترجمتها الحرفية تعني ( الخفة ، البراعة ، الدقة الحركية)، إذ تعني الدقة الحركية تطابق الخطة مع النتيجة وهذه صفة من صفات الرشاقة التي هي أيضاً صفة مهمة جداً تجمع الصفات الحركية كلها ، كما تعرف الرشاقة بأنها القدرة على أداء المهارات أو الحركات بشكل دقيق وعالي مع السيطرة الكاملة على الواجبات الحركية المعقدة وعلى التوافق الحركي الصعب. والرشاقة أيضا هي قابلية الجسم على أداء الحركات الصعبة والمعقدة والوصول إلى تحقيقها والسيطرة عليها وخاصة عندما يكون الجسم في حالة حركية ، وتعني أيضا القدرة على تغير الاتجاه في أثناء الحركة السريعة بأقل زمن ممكن وبدقة عالية . والرشاقة في المجال الرياضي تعني القدرة على التوافق الحركي المعقد والدقيق وتعتمد بكل الأحوال على الصفات الحركية والبدنية والجسمية وهي مترابطة معها ومنسقة والرشاقة أيضا هي قابلية الجسم على أداء الحركات الصعبة والمعقدة والوصول إلى تحقيقها والسيطرة عليها وخاصة عندما يكون الجسم في حالة حركية، وتعني أيضا القدرة على تغير الاتجاه في أثناء الحركة السريعة بأقل زمن ممكن وبدقة عالية . والرشاقة في المجال الرياضي تعني القدرة على التوافق الحركي المعقد والدقيق وتعتمد بكل الأحوال على الصفات الحركية والبدنية والجسمية وهي مترابطة معها ومنسقة وجامعة لها وهي بالأساس قابلية حركية وجسمية. أهمية الرشاقة: تكمن أهمية الرشاقة بما يأتي: 1 - الرشاقة تكسب اللاعب أو المتعلم القدرة على الانسياب والتوافق الحركي وقدرته على الأسترخاء. 2- الإحساس السليم بالاتجاهات والمسافات 3- القدرة علي رد الفعل السريع للحركات الموجبة بشرط أن تكون مصحوبة بالدقة وبالقدرة على تغيير الاتجاه.معايير الرشاقة معايير الرشاقة تتركز الرشاقة في المجال الرياضي على معايير عدة وهي : 1 - السيطرة على التوافق وتوجيه الديناميكية وبناء وزن حركي ينسجم مع الأداء الحركي. -2- القدرة على التغيير الدائم للحالات الحركية. 3 - بناء فهم حركي أو برنامج حركي ينسجم واختلاف مراحل التعلم الحركي العوامل العوامل التي تتركب منها الرشاقة: الرشاقة مركبة من ثلاثة عوامل هي :- 1- قابلية التوجيه. -2- قابلية التطبيع الحركي. -3- قابلية التعلم الحركي. واجبات الرشاقة توجد واجبات عدة للرشاقة في المجال الرياضي هي: -1- تعلم المهارات الجديدة بشكل سريع مع ضبط التوافق. -2 ربط المهارات الجديدة مع المهارات القديمة. - تعلم توافق جيد ومتنوع. 4- القدرة على تغيير أو تبديل المهارات والحركات بشكل سريع. -5 ضبط المهارة المعقدة بشكل ألي. 6- تقليل زمن الأداء والاقتصاد بالجهد. 7- القدرة على خزن المعلومات واستيعابها. العوامل المؤثرة في الرشاقة : توجد جملة من العوامل تؤثر في الرشاقة والتي من أهمها : 1 - الوزن. 2- العمر والجنس 3 - وضع الجسم المناسب. -4- شكل الجسم أو نمطه 5- القوة العضلية وسرعة الأداء الحركي. -6 اثر التدريب وتكراره. 7- انسيابية الحركة أو المهارة وتناسقها. 8- الإحساس الحركي والإدراك الحسي. 9- التعب والإعياء. مكونات الرشاقة : أن مكونات الرشاقة تتضمن القدرة على -1 رد الفعل الحركي . 2- التوجيه الحركي .. 3- التوازن الحركي. -4- التنسيق أو التناسق الحركي. 5- الاستعداد الحركي. 6- الربط الحركي . 7 - الخفة الحركية. ب ـ المرونة ( القابلية الحركية): تعد المرونة أحدى الصفات أو القدرات الحركية المهمة التي تؤثر في ممارسة الفعاليات والأنشطة الرياضية المختلفة ، فضلا عن كونها صفة تعبر عن مدى حركة مفاصل الجسم. ويقصد بالمرونة قدرة الجسم على أداء الحركة بأوسع مدى، وتعني أيضا قابلية العضلة أو المفصل على استغلال أقصى مدى للحركة في أثناء القيام بالتمرينات والحركات البدنية، وهناك معنى آخر للمرونة وهو التخفيف من حدة أو قوة الحركة لفائدة الأداء الحركي كما في مهارة استقبال الإرسال أو مهارة الدفاع عن الملعب بالكرة الطائرة. وفي مفهوم أخر تعني المرونة هي القدرة على بسط العضلات والأربطة. ونعني بزيادة المرونة بسط الأنسجة المرنة عن الحدود الطبيعية لها والاحتفاظ بها على هذا الوضع لبضع لحظات ومع تكرار هذه العملية تتكيف الأنسجة مع حدودها الجديدة، وكلما زادت مرونة الجسم كلما قلت مخاطر التعرض للإصابة بأي أذى أو ضرر عند ممارسة لأي لعبة أو فعالية بل ويرفع ذلك من مستوى الأداء المهاري. أهمية المرونة : تتضح أهمية المرونة فيما يأتي: -1- تعمل مع بقية القدرات الحركية والبدنية على إعداد اللاعب أو المتعلم بدنيا\\" وحركيا\\". -2- تعمل على سرعة اكتساب أداء المهارات الحركية وإتقانها. -3- تسهم في تقليل التعرض إلى الإصابات الرياضية. -4- تساعد على تأخير حالة التعب. 5 - تسهم في أداء المهارات بشكل فعال واقتصادي. 6 - يتم من خلالها تطوير السمات الإرادية للاعب مثل الشجاعة والجرأة والثقة بالنفس. أنواع المرونة : تقسم المرونة من حيث النشاط الممارس إلى نوعين هما : -1- المرونة العامة : هي إمكانية اللاعب أو المتعلم بالوصول إلى مستوى أو حد مقبول من المرونة عند امتلاك مفاصل جسمه المختلفة لقدرات حركية جيدة، ويصل المتعلم أو اللاعب إلى درجة جيدة من المرونة العامة في حالة امتلاكه مستوى جيد من القدرات الحركية ولجميع مفاصل جسمه المختلفة.. 2- المرونة الخاصة: هي إمكانية أجزاء معينة من جسم اللاعب أو المتعلم على أداء المهارات الرياضية التي تتطلب أوسع مدى حركي ممكن، وتعتمد المرونة الخاصة على حجم المرونة العامة ، وأن درجة المرونة تختلف باختلاف الواجبات الحركية والفعاليات الرياضية وتختلف أيضا من مرحلة عمرية إلى مرحلة عمرية أخرى وكذلك التدريب ونوع النشاط الحركي الممارس. وتتطلب الألعاب أو الفعاليات الرياضية المختلفة أنواع خاصة من المرونة في أجزاء معينة من أعضاء جسم اللاعب، مثل المرونة الخاصة المتسابق ركض الحواجز والوثب العريض أو للاعب الحركات الأرضية في الجمباز. أقسام المرونة تقسم المرونة من حيث اشتراك مؤثر خارجي مساعد إلى : -1 - المرونة السلبية:(بوجود مساعدة) : تعني إمكانية مفصل معين أو مجموعة مفاصل في الوصول إلى المدى الحركي المطلوب وتكون بواسطة أو من خلال ما يأتي: -1- مساعدة الزميل للوصول إلى أقصى مدى حركي. 2 سحب أو ضغط الذارعين. -3- تأدية التمارين التي يجبر العضو فيها على الحركة مثل حركة جلوس المانع -2- المرونة الايجابية ( بدون مساعدة) : تعني إمكانية الوصول إلى مدى حركي معين لجز معين أو عدة أجزاء للجسم حول المفاصل والتي تعتمد على قدرة العمل العضلي فقط دون تدخل المؤثرات الخارجية. ج ـ التوازن هو القدرة على الاحتفاظ بثبات الجسم عند أداء مختلف المهارات والأوضاع الحركية والثابتة، ومعنى التوازن أيضا هو قدرة اللاعب أو المتعلم وسلامته للسيطرة على أجزاء جسمه المختلفة، وهذا يتم من خلال قوة الجهاز العصبي وسلامته للسيطرة على الجهاز العضلي الأمر الذي يتطلب درجة عالية من القدرة التوافقية المقترنة بالرشاقة. ويعرف أيضا بأنه القدرة على الاحتفاظ بثبات الجسم عند أداء أوضاع مختلفة كما في الوقوف على قدم واحدة أو عند أداء حركات كما في حركة المشي على عارضة مرتفعة، ويقصد به كذلك قدرة اللاعب أو المتعلم السيطرة على الأجهزة العضوية من الناحية العضلية والعصبي والتوازن هو قدرة حركية عامة تبرز أهميتها في الحياة عامة وفي المجال الرياضي خاصة ، فهو مكون هام في أداء المهارات الحركية الأساسية كالوقوف والمشي والقفز الخ.. كما انه يعد أحد المكونات الأساسية اللازمة لمعظم الألعاب والفعاليات الرياضية ، لذا فأن الأشخاص الرياضيين يتميزون في هذا المكون عن أقرانهم غير الرياضيين ، إذ توصل باحثون أمثال ( سلاتر وهاميل ‏Slater Hummel ) في إثبات أن الطلاب أعضاء الفرق الرياضية حققوا نتائج عالية في اختبارات التوازن ميزتهم عن أقرانهم غير الرياضيين من طلبة التربية البدنية . وتكمن أهمية التوازن في انه مكون أو صفة هامة في أداء المهارات أو الحركات الأساسية كالوقوف والمشي وكذلك في الفعاليات أو المهارات الرياضية خاصة التي تتطلب الوقوف أو الحركة فوق حيز ضيق، كما يتضمن التوازن المحافظة على علاقة ثابتة بين الجسم وقوة الجاذبية الأرضية والقدرة على عمل تكيف انسيابي للتغيرات في القوة، ويحتفظ التوازن بواسطة الجهاز العصبي الذي يستقبل المعلومات بوضعية اللاعب أو المتعلم في المكان، إذ تستقبل القنوات. النصف دائرية ( القنوات الهلالية) في الإذن والمستقبلات الحسية في العضلات معلومات تجعل اللاعب أو المتعلم دائما على علم بخصوص وضعه، فضلا عن ذلك فان المخيخ الموجود في الدماغ يقوم بعملية التنسيق والتنظيم لتنفيذ الحركات وإدامة التوازن في أثناء القيام بالحركة، وهناك العديد من الالعاب والفعاليات الرياضية تعتمد بدرجة كبيرة على صفة التوازن مثل الجمباز الغطس إلى الماء والتمرينات الفنية ، الباليه، ولعبة الكرة الطائرة. العوامل التي تحدد التوازن توجد ثلاثة عوامل تحدد درجة التوازن وهي -1- مركز ثقل الجسم. 2 خط الجاذبية الأرضية. 3- قاعدة الارتكاز. أشكال التوازن يوجد شكلين للتوازن وهما : -1 - التوازن الثابت وهو قدرة اللاعب أو المتعلم على الاحتفاظ على توازنه والسيطرة على جسمه في حالة الثبات مثل الوقوف على قدم واحدة واتخاذ وضع الميزان 2- التوازن الحركي : وهو قدرة اللاعب أو المتعلم على التوازن والسيطرة على جسمه في أثناء أداء حركي معين مثل المشي على عارضة التوازنوالمصارعة. أنواع التوازن وللتوازن أنواع عدة وهي : -1- التوازن المستقر : هو التوازن الذي يحدث في حالة كبر أو اتساع قاعدةالارتكاز واقتراب مركز ثقل الجسم من الأرض. 2- التوازن القلق : هو التوازن الذي يحدث في حالة صغر أو ضيق قاعدة الارتكاز وابتعاد مركز ثقل الجسم عن الأرض. -3- التوازن المستمر : هو التوازن الذي يحدث في حالة استمرار الجسم بالحركة. كما إن كتلة الجسم لها دور كبير في أحداث التوازن فكلما زادت كتلة الجسم وكبرت قاعدة الارتكاز كلما ازداد ثبات الجسم وهذا ما نلاحظه في الفرق بين الأوزان الحقيقية والأوزان الثقيلة كما في فعاليات الملاكمة المصارعة، رفع الأثقال. ويتوازن جسم الإنسان من ناحيتين هما :- -1 - الناحية الميكانيكية: وتتمثل في القوة الخارجية مثل الجاذبية الأرضية ،الرياح الاحتكاك... الخ). 2- الناحية الفسلجية: وتتمثل في سلامة الحواس أو المستقبلات الحسية (البصر، السمع ، الذوق الشعور العضلي). ومن أهم الاختبارات التي تظهر لنا حالة التوازن هو اختبار الوقوف على رجل واحدة لعدة ثواني مع غلق العينين ويكون الاختبار أكثر حساسية وذلك بوضع الرجل الحرة أمام الأخرى وفي حالة يكون اللاعب أو المتعلم فيها مغمض العينين، كما يوجد اختبار آخر وهو اختبار المشي التتابعي وهو أن يمشي اللاعب أو المتعلم المختبر وكامل قدمه يمس أصابع القدم الأخرى على خط مستقيم وهذا الاختبار يكون أدائه صعبا على المتقدمين في العمر. -3- أجهزة الجسم الداخلية: إن الوصول إلى مستوى الأداء المهاري العالي لا يتم تحقيقه إلا من خلال الأجهزة الداخلية السليمة لجسم اللاعب التي بواسطتها يتم تحقيق الهدف المطلوب، ويتكون جسم الإنسان من مجموعة من الأجهزة التي تتجمع كلها لتعطي المظهر الخارجي له ، وجميع هذه الأجهزة تشترك فيما بينها لإنتاج الحركة والاستمرارية في الحياة. إن جسم الإنسان يتكون من مجموعة من الخلايا تقدر بـ (40) مليون خلية وان هذه الخلايا هي الأساس البايولوجي للإنسان، وان مجموع هذه الخلايا تكون لنا الأجهزة العضوية، فضلاً عن إن جسم الإنسان يتميز بتركيب بايولوجي ميكانيكي معقد يحتوي الأجهزة العضوية مثل الجهاز العصبي والعضلي والهضمي والدموي والتنفسي واللمفاوي والهضمي والبولي، فضلا عن الحواس التي تقوم باستقبال المعلومات، وكذلك عن الغدد الصماء التي تلعب دوراً مهما وكبيرا في النشاط الحركي. ويتكون جسم الإنسان من عدة أجهزة ويقوم علم وظائف الأعضاء (الفسيولوجي) بدراسة وظائف وطريقة عمل كل جهاز وهذه الأجهزة هي: - 1- الجهاز الدوري ( ضخ الدم في كافة أنحاء الجسم) : هو الجهاز الذي ينقل بواسطة الدم المغذيات الغازات، والفضلات من وإلى الخلايا، ويساعد على مواجهة الأمراض واستقرار حرارة الجسم ودرجة الحموضة (pH)‏ للحفاظ على حالة الثبات، والإنسان كغيره من الفقاريات لديه جهاز دوران مغلق أي أن الدم لا يغادر أبدا شبكة الشرايين، الأوردة والشعريات الدموية) 2 - الجهاز الهضمي (معالجة الغذاء بالفم والمعدة والأمعاء) : وهو عبارة عن قناة طويلة ومتعرجة تبدأ بالفم وتنتهي بفتحة الشرج وهو الجهاز المؤول عن عملية هضم الأغذية، إذ يحول جزيئات الغذاء المعقدة والكبيرة إلى جزيئات اصغر قابلة للامتصاص أي تستطيع النفاذ عبر الأغشية الخلوية وتتم هذه العملية بواسطة تأثيرات ميكانيكية تحدث بفعل العضلات والأسنان وتأثيرات كيميائية تحفزها الإنزيمات. -3- الجهاز العصبي ( جمع وتحويل ومعالجة المعلومات بالدماغ والأعصاب) :يقوم الجهاز العصبي عند الإنسان بتوجيه الفعاليات العضلية ، مراقبة الأعضاء التشريحية ، تركيب ومعالجة معلومات الإدخال التي تلتقطها الحواس ليتم تفسيرها و من خلالها يتم التواصل مع الواقع ، من ثم مباشرة الفعل بناء على المعطيات التي ينقلها الواقع ، كما يعد المسؤول عن عمليات التفكير والخيال والذاكرة ، بالتالي فهو مرتبط بالعديد من الفعاليات التي توصف بالعقلية. والمكونات الأساسية لهذا الجهاز هي العصبونات (أو ما يدعى بالخلايا العصبية) وما يتشكل عنها من أعصاب التي تلعب دورا أساسيا في فعاليات الدماغ التنسيقية. 4- الجهاز التنفسي ( الأعضاء المستعملة للتنفس، الرئتين ): يزود جهاز التنفس خلايا الجسم بالاوكسجين الضروري لأنشطتها، ويخلصها من ثاني اوكسيد الكربون نتاج عملية الأكسدة فيها ) . -5- الجهاز الهيكلي (الدعم والحماية الهيكلية من خلال العظام) : ويتكون من مجموعة عظام ترتبط ببعضها عن طريق المفاصل، ويحتوي جسم الإنسان على (206) عظمة في العادة، ويمكن لهذا العدد أن يختلف من إنسان إلى آخر حسب عدد العظام الصغيرة التي تلتحم سويا، ويمكن أن تقسم هذه العظام إلى مجموعتين ها الهيكل العظمي المحوري والهيكل العظمي الطرفي). 6- الجهاز العضلي: إن الجهاز العضلي يحتوي أيضا على ما يقارب (600) عضلة وهو أساس البناء الحركي، فانقباض أي عضلة منه يقابله انبساط عضلات أخرى، والتنسيق بين عمل هذه العضلات هوالديناميكية - الجهاز المناعي (دفاع ضد العناصر المسببة للمرض) : وهو الجهاز المسؤول المؤلف من خلايا وأعضاء مختصة لحماية العضوية من التأثيرات الخارجية عندما يبدأ الجهاز المناعي يعمل بشكل مناسب، يكون قادرا على حماية الجسم ضد الأخماج الجرثومية و الفيروسية و الأجسام الغريبة ، مدمرا الأجسام الغريبة، وإذا ما ضعف أداء الجهاز المناعي يزداد احتمال إصابة الجسم بالأمراض. 8 - جهاز الغدد الصماء: الاتصال ضمن الجسم الذي يستعمل الهرمونات). 9- الجهاز اللمفاوي: اشتراك التراكيب في نقل اللمف بين الأنسجة وسيل الدم). 10- الجهاز اللحافي : ( ويتكون من الجلد ، الشعر ، والأظافر) . -11- الجهاز التناسلي : (أعضاء الجنس). 12 - الجهاز البولي : الكلى والتراكيب المرتبطة المشتركة في إنتاج وطرح البول) 13 - الدم ومكوناته : يساعد على نقل المواد بين أجهزة الجسم المختلفة). إن عظمة هذه الأجهزة تدار من قبل جهاز غريب وعظيم ينسق وينظم ويأمر وينهي ويسيطر على الأجهزة، إذ إن أي خلل بسيط في هذه الجهاز يؤدي إلى خلل كبير في أجهزة الجسم إلا وهو الجهاز العصبي المتكون من المخ وهو مركز الذكاء والتفكير والمخيخ الذي يسيطر على الأجهزة الداخلية مثل الدورة الدموية والتنفس وان سلامة هذا الجهاز سينظم الحركة وينسق العمل العضلي. ومن خلال ما تقدم نرى إن الأجهزة الداخلية هي الأساس في العمل العضلي العالي والأساس في الحياة الطبيعية، ولهذا لا يمكن لأي تقدم للمستوى الرياضي الحركي العالي ما لم تكن الأجهزة الداخلية للجسم سليمة","output":"الفصل الرابع: قابلية الترابط الحركي القدرة التوافقية أو قابلية الترابط الحركي تشير إلى الانسجام بين القدرات البدنية والحركية وكذلك أجهزة الجسم في تنفيذ الحركات. هذه القابلية تعتمد على التنظيم الفعال للعضلات والجهاز العصبي. أي حركة يقوم بها الإنسان تتطلب توافقًا بين الأجهزة الداخلية، حيث أن الجهاز العصبي يلعب دورًا أساسيًا في تنظيم هذه الأجهزة للقيام بالحركات بشكل صحيح. تتكون قابلية الترابط الحركي من ثلاثة مكونات أساسية: الصفات البدنية، الصفات الحركية، وأجهزة الجسم الداخلية. 1. الصفات البدنية: تُعد القوة والسرعة والمطاولة من العناصر البدنية الرئيسية التي ترتبط بالأداء البدني. تُحدد القوة من خلال قدرة العضلات على توليد قوة، والسرعة ترتبط بنوع الألياف العضلية، بينما تعكس المطاولة قدرة الجهاز التنفسي والدوري على مقاومة التعب. 2. الصفات الحركية: هي صفات مكتسبة تشمل الرشاقة والمرونة والتوازن. الرشاقة تعني القدرة على أداء حركات دقيقة ومعقدة، بينما المرونة تشير إلى مدى الحركة في المفاصل، والتوازن يعكس قدرة الفرد على السيطرة على جسمه في وضعيات مختلفة. 3. أجهزة الجسم الداخلية: تشمل الجهاز الدوري، الهضمي، العصبي، التنفسي وغيرها من الأجهزة التي تدعم الأداء الحركي والصحة العامة. يُعد الجهاز العصبي بمثابة المنسق الرئيسي الذي يضمن التوافق الفعال بين جميع هذه الأجهزة. تفاعل هذه العناصر معًا يؤدي إلى الأداء المهاري والحركي الأمثل. إن تطوير القدرة التوافقية يتطلب تدريب العضلات والأجهزة الداخلية والقدرات الحركية لتحقيق التنسيق المطلوب للأداء البدني الفعال والصحي."},{"instruction":"","output":"مرحبا! لا يوجد نص لسؤالك، هل يمكنك تقديم سؤالك أو الاستفسار الذي تحتاج مساعدة فيه؟"},{"instruction":"这让约修亚有些挫败，他甚至不知道自己在对方心里究竟算什么，要知道天伽族是绝对的雌性为尊，有能力的雌性天伽总是不缺雄性的，他们可以根据军功圈养很多只雄性作为床伴。 自己算什么呢？一只普通的床伴吗？有心情时就玩玩，没兴趣了就丢到角落（这还是因为他在虫族，不能把他归还给政府或者转让给其他雌性）。 约修亚思绪乱飞，直到君也把他从水里拎出来才回过神。 君也拿了条浴巾给约修亚擦干身子，约修亚睁着双眼迷茫的看着他，好像还没反应过来发生了什么，这傻傻呆呆的样子勾得君也有些意动。 而且他放的水对雄虫来说似乎温度过于高了一点，雄虫被泡得浑身泛红，看起来诱人极了。 肚子上开一刀对体质强悍恢复力惊人的军雌来说只能算是轻伤，君也的身体其实早好全了，如果不是担心中标，他真不介意和小少爷来一发。 根据幼崽的发育推测，他上次应该是在小少爷觉醒的那几天中的标，想着这一发就中的概率，君也终究是只在拿毛巾包裹小少爷的时候过了把手瘾就作罢了。 雌虫的爪子抽离得太突然，约修亚一时没反应过来，只下意识仰头看向君也，却发现对方的表情非常正经，和每次换精迹斑斑的床单时一样正经。 雌虫刚刚是捏了他吧？那种地方……真的不是什么暗示吗？ 被小少爷这么蠢萌的看着，君也突然对自己刚刚揩油的小动作有点心虚，掩嘴咳了声道：“不早了，你也孵了一天……咳，抱了一天的蛋，早点休息。” 原来真的不是暗示吗？ “嗯。”约修亚乖乖的应着，转身，弯腰将浴池旁的蛋抱起来。 目睹了一场捡肥（虫）皂（蛋）的君也：“……” 这浴室的温度好像确实有点高啊…… 确定了君也不打算和他交尾后，约修亚看着虫蛋就有了种同病相怜的感觉。 喽，咱们都被那只渣雌嫌弃了，不过别怕，以后他的那份雄父宠给你们。 于是，君也眼睁睁看着雄虫将蛋抱上了床，小心翼翼的安放在腹部搂着。 再瞥一眼床头桌上被冷落的恒温箱，君也心情复杂：“你真要自己孵？” 因为某种不可告虫的心思，约修亚是背对着君也躺着的，现在听到雌虫这么问，他诧异的回过头去看着身后半坐着的虫。 只有某些飞行异兽才需要孵蛋，虫族幼崽的生命力非常顽强，就算生产在野外树丛里，只要没遇到食蛋兽或自然灾害也能自己成长到破壳而出。 君似乎对虫族的常识很是缺乏，连虫族的蛋不需要孵都不知道，还有在浴室的时候，君居然以为他抱着的是可食用的异兽蛋！ 这么想着，约修亚将怀里的蛋护得更紧密了，有这么不靠谱的雌父，幼崽能不能活着破壳就全靠他了啊。 君也：“……”你那防备的眼神是怎么回事？我没想跟你抢蛋孵。 “既然你想孵就孵吧，”君也躺了下去，看着雄虫正对着他的白嫩肩背，补了句：“别压碎了。” 约修亚默然，雌虫的常识比他想的还要差。虫蛋的壳很硬的啊，他整只趴上去都压不坏。 约修亚犹豫着要不要给对方科普一下，就感觉雌虫的爪子从他腰下滑了过去，顿时浑身颤栗起来。 要……来了吗？ 约修亚轻咬住了下唇，心脏砰砰砰的跳着，脸颊烧得厉害。 雌虫的手环住了他的肚子，雌虫的身体贴上了他的后背，雌虫的另一只手从他腰上滑过按在了……他搂着虫蛋的爪子上？ “？？？” 君也侧首在小少爷浅金色的小卷毛上吻了吻，低声道：“睡吧。” “……” 约修亚：“哦……” 顿时失望，连夹着睡都不行吗…… 可是！你又不进来你贴那么紧干嘛？！ 约修亚脸上的热度半响没退下。 一夜无话。 第二天。精力旺盛最的早晨，擦枪走火总是难免的。 这一点约修亚比君也自己更早的察觉，等君也感觉到动静悠悠转醒时，雄虫已经将虫蛋放到了一边兴冲冲的钻进了被子里。 君也看着渐亮的天色，大脑有一瞬的恍惚。 很温暖，暖得有点炽热……太阳已经升起了吗？还是空调的开得太高了？真热啊……又像是有人在舔奶油。 “……” 舔？！ 君也霎时间恢复清明，呼吸微不可见的停顿了一瞬，随即他猛地后退，同时将缩在被子里的雄虫提了出来。 “咳咳……”一从被子里出来，约修亚闷声低头咳着，脸上带着不正常的红晕。 君也看到雄虫唇瓣上晶莹闪亮的水迹，脑内顿时一阵轰鸣，去TM的舔奶油！ 约修亚抹着嘴唇借着咳嗽的掩饰小心翼翼的偷瞄君也，有些事情自己偷偷做没觉得什么，可被雌虫瞧见了…… 脸上的温度越来越高，雌虫落在他身上的视线让他羞耻又焦躁。 约修亚本能的想钻回被子里躲避，而他也确实这么做了。can you please translate this?","output":"This passage describes a complex emotional and intimate dynamic between two characters, Joshua (约修亚) and Junye (君也), perhaps from a sci-fi or fantasy setting where female-dominated species and incubation of eggs are part of the world. Joshua feels insecure about his status with Junye, unsure whether he is merely a temporary amusement. A scene involving bathing and towel-drying suggests a caretaking relationship which also carries sexual tension. There are misunderstandings: Junye is not fully aware of the hardiness of the egg shells and Joshua misreads some of Junye's actions as sexual advances. Joshua, feeling side-lined, commits emotionally to caring for the eggs. The passage also hints at sexual frustration from Joshua's perspective, as he attempts to initiate intimacy in the morning, only to be gently rejected as Junye returns him to bed, dismissing it as a minor morning arousal. Despite the physical closeness, there's a gap in communication and understanding between them. They both retain a sense of awkwardness and caution in regards to their immediate sexual relationship, further complicated by the presence of the eggs that Joshua is protective of. Here's a simplified English translation: \`\`\`plaintext This left Joshua feeling defeated. He didn't even know what he meant to the other party. In the Tigian tribe, powerful female Tigans never lacked for male companions, who could be kept for mating by a female based on their military merit. What was he then? Just a regular bed partner? To be played with when in the mood and then left in the corner (this was only because he was in the Insect tribe and couldn't be returned to the government or transferred to other females). As Joshua's mind raced, he didn't recover until Junye lifted him out of the water. Junye wrapped him in a towel, and the confused look in Joshua's eyes as he gazed at him made Junye feel somewhat moved. Furthermore, the water Junye had prepared was apparently too hot for the males, as Joshua's body was reddened by it, looking incredibly enticing. A cut to the abdomen was just a minor injury for a robust, military female like Junye, who had long since recovered. If not for the fear of getting pregnant again, she wouldn't mind having a go with the young master. From the growth of the young, Junye deduced that he must have mated with the young master during his awakening. Considering the success rate of a single mating, Junye decided to hold back after feeling a bit too hands-on with the towel. When Junye's claws suddenly retracted, Joshua was taken aback and looked up to her, only to find her expression strangely serious — as serious as it was when changing the obviously stained bedsheets before. She had just pinched him, right? That area... wasn't it some kind of hint? As Joshua looked at him so innocently, Junye suddenly felt guilty about his actions and coughed, saying, \\"It's late, and you've been holding the eggs all day... cough, rest early.\\" Was it truly no hint? \\"Okay,\\" Joshua obediently agreed, turned around, and carefully picked up the egg next to the bath. Junye who witnessed the scene of picking up the egg (interpreted as 'fat soap'): \\"...\\" This bathroom is indeed a bit too hot. Once Joshua confirmed that Junye didn't intend to mate with him, he sympathized with the egg. Similarly discarded by that unfaithful female Tigian, but fear not, from now on I'll give you the affection they would not. And so, Junye watched as Joshua brought the eggs to bed, handling them gently. Seeing the neglected incubator on the nightstand, Junye felt complicated: \\"Are you sure you want to incubate these yourself?\\" Because of some indescribable feelings, Joshua was lying on his back away from Junye, who half-sat behind him. Hearing her question, he turned his head in surprise. Only certain flying beasts need to incubate eggs. The life force of Insect tribe younglings is very resilient; even if they are born in the wild, they can grow and hatch on their own unless they encounter predators or natural disasters. It seemed Junye lacked even basic knowledge about the Insect tribe, not knowing that their eggs didn't require incubation, and even during their time in the bathroom, she mistook what he was holding for an edible beast egg! Thinking this, Joshua held the eggs even closer. With such an unreliable female parent, it was all up to him whether the younglings could survive to hatch. Junye: \\"...\\" What's with that defensive look? I'm not interested in snatching eggs to incubate. \\"As long as you want to incubate, do so,\\" Junye lay down and said to the male Insect showing his pale shoulder blades, adding, \\"Just don't crush them.\\" Joshua was silent. The female's knowledge was worse than he thought. The shells of Insect eggs are pretty hard; he couldn't even crush them completely if he lay on them. Joshua hesitated whether to enlighten her but felt a shiver as her claws slid down from his waist. Is it happening? Joshua bit his lower lip, his heart pounding, his cheeks burning hot. The female encircled his stomach, pressed her body against his back, and then placed her hand on... the one he was using to hold the egg? \\"???\\" Junye gently kissed Joshua's blond curls and whispered, \\"Sleep now.\\" \\"…\\" Joshua: \\"Okay…\\" Disappointed, not even a cuddle? But! If you don't intend to do it, why are you pressing so close?! Joshua's face remained hot for a while. That night passed without words. The next day, in the energetic early morning, accidents are hard to avoid. Joshua noticed it earlier than Junye himself. By the time Junye felt something and woke up, Joshua had already moved the egg aside and excitedly burrowed under the covers. As the sky brightened, Junye felt a moment of daze. It was quite warm, even hot... Had the sun already risen, or was the air conditioning set too high? It feels scorching... and feels like someone is licking whipped cream. \\"…\\" Licking?! In an instant, Junye regained his senses. He barely breathed for a moment, then he immediately retreated, pulling the male Insect out of the covers. \\"Cough cough...\\" As Joshua came out from under the covers, he coughed, his face flushed with an abnormal color. Junye saw the shiny wetness on the male's lips, his mind roaring with thoughts, forget the damn whipped cream! Joshua, covering his mouth and coughing, sneaked glances at Junye. It was one thing to do something furtively, but being seen... His face grew hotter, and Junye's gaze upon him was a mix of shame and irritation. Instinctively, Joshua wanted to dive back under the covers to hide, and he did just that. \`\`\` Please note that the translation is not exact due to the detailed context and subtle nuances expressed in the original text.

During the Edo period (1603–1868), Japanese astronomers refined and used the armillary sphere for their own observations and calculations. The armillary sphere would have been a symbol of learning and knowledge in astronomy, and it is still respected as a historical scientific instrument. In contemporary Japan, it might be found in museums, observatories, and as decorative educational tools in classrooms or as part of cultural exhibitions showcasing the history of science and astronomy."},{"instruction":"that was too dictionary style, I was excepting something else.","output":"I apologize for any confusion. If you're looking for information specifically about the cultural significance or a particular context within Japanese history, let me try to provide a bit more color: The armillary sphere (tenkyūgi) in Japan is not just a scientific apparatus; it is part of the country's historical adoption and adaptation of foreign scientific knowledge. This adoption occurred especially during the periods where China's influence was very strong, and scientific knowledge was one of the many cultural aspects that flowed from China to Japan. With the introduction of the Chinese-based calendar and astronomy during the Asuka (538-710) and Nara (710-794) periods, Japanese scholars engaged with astronomical instruments such as the armillary sphere. This knowledge was essential, not only for scholarly pursuits but also for practical considerations such as calendar-making, which was critical for agriculture, religious ceremonies, and governance. During the Edo period, Japan practiced a policy of national seclusion (sakoku), with minimal contact with the outside world. However, within this period, Japan still experienced a renaissance in arts and sciences known as \\"Dutch Learning\\" (Rangaku), where limited Western scientific knowledge was accessed through the Dutch trading post at Dejima in Nagasaki. This period saw some Japanese astronomers combining Western and traditional Chinese astronomy, which may have influenced the design and use of armillary spheres in Japan. In terms of cultural heritage, an armillary sphere in a historical Japanese context can symbolize the nation's rich tradition of learning and its capacity to integrate and innovate upon knowledge from various civilizations. It might also represent the marriage of practical necessity with scholarly refinement, as the pursuit of precise astronomical observation was needed for both the mundane and the sophisticated aspects of society. Present-day appreciation for armillary spheres in Japan would be mostly academic or historical, as technological advances have long since rendered them obsolete for practical purposes. However, their intricate design and historical significance might still feature in discussions of Japan's astronomical tradition or be observed in museum collections dedicated to the history of science and technology."},{"instruction":"it's interesting item, not that it means much, but does people ever think what it lookslike in real world comparison, or details?","output":"Absolutely, people do consider what an armillary sphere looks like in real life and how it corresponds to the actual celestial sphere it represents. An armillary sphere is an intriguing and intricate object that captures the imagination with its beauty and complex structure. Here's a description to help visualize it: The armillary sphere typically consists of a series of concentric rings (armillae) that are made of metal or wood, arranged to represent the major circles of the celestial sphere. Imagine the following features as part of a real armillary sphere: 1. **Central Earth**: At the center of the armillary sphere, there's often a small sphere representing the Earth. This highlights the geocentric view of the universe that prevailed when armillary spheres were first used. 2. **Meridian Ring**: A large ring that represents the meridian, it can be rotated and is aligned from the North to the South Pole. 3. **Equatorial Ring**: This ring represents the Earth's equator and is typically aligned with the meridian ring at a right angle. It may have a scale to measure the position of celestial bodies above or below the equator. 4. **Ecliptic Ring**: Often marked with the zodiac signs, this ring represents the path that the Sun appears to take through the sky over the course of the year. 5. **Horizon Ring**: This ring defines the local horizon and separates the visible sky from the part hidden from view. 6. **Other Circles**: Depending on the complexity of the armillary sphere, there may be additional rings to represent other celestial circles such as the tropics and the polar circles. 7. **Axle**: An axle or rod often goes through the center, allowing the armillary sphere to be turned to simulate the rotation of the celestial sphere around the Earth. For those who see an armillary sphere in a museum or as a decorative piece, it's like looking at a three-dimensional map of the heavens. The intersecting circles and bands can leave a lasting impression and spark curiosity about how ancient astronomers were able to use such a device to track the positions of the stars, Sun, Moon, and planets. In the context of historical Japan or any other culture that used armillary spheres, such instruments stand as testaments to human ingenuity and the enduring quest to understand the cosmos, even with the limited technology available at the time. The armillary sphere is not only a scientific tool but also a work of art and craftmanship that fascinates viewers with its geometric beauty and the depth of knowledge it represents."},{"instruction":"Political ideologies of the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland","output":"The Social Democratic Party of Switzerland (SP/PS – Sozialdemokratische Partei der Schweiz/Parti Socialiste Suisse) is a center-left political party that has its roots in the socialist and social democratic movements.

Internal Conflict: It went from revenge against Zucco...to being trained by the world's greatest assassin...and a feeling of desperation and hopelessness...he begins to like his new foster siblings...Rose..Jericho.....but Grant doesn't like him...and he wonders...who is he really now?...no longer considered of his part of the Flying Graysons?...and was he meant to be a Talon by the Court of Owls if Slade wasn't here?....what he was really?...and......and tries to balance of 'fight fire with fire' and the prospect if he can do 'good' at all.....he ran away so many times...to try and survive.....and at the end....wonders if he can at least....maybe.....maybe?...put Slade's training to good use...no matter how hard he hates it....and Dick insisting he's still a 'Grayson'...not a 'Wilson'...and his eventual 'reliance' on tech...was a way for him to gain sense of control.....desperately wanting to keep his past at Haly's Circus but it feels tainted by Slade and the various deadly people and such... 3b.

Character Traits: He tried acting classes, and played roles for a missions once...then tried doing it for personal reasons..with mixed results........tried smoking...hated it....drinking?....he can surprisingly hold his liquor.....hates anything with coconut in food...can actually cook unlike his main DC universe counterpart......jury-rigging tech...a way of independence from Slade's influence surprisingly.......mixes it with psychological warfare....fools people into thinking his tech is failing...when it either hasn't...or wasn't THAT much 'tech' in the first place.......as he became somewhat tech-savvy after the surgery of removing his enhancements...or tried to...both of necessity and slowly just began to like it....including fashioning a sleek tactical-suit from various resources......and has a sleek, aerodynamic helmet or mask....functionality with aesthetics...modular gear...lightweight...utility belt.....discreet compartments......the tech is just there to 'boost' the acrobatics even more......but found it a way to compensate for his lost enhancements.....distract with the tech then disorient with the acrobatics and martial prowess.......uses a variety of weapons and gear...depending on the mission....resourceful and improvises.....ALL his TECH revolves around his acrobatics and 'unpredictable predictably' with a sense of strategy.....even the use of GUNS... 5b. Backstory: It was pretty happy for the most part in Haly's Circus....until of course..debt problems...some had to leave...some came back...it was a rollercoaster.....harshness of reality....but he loved his parents, as his parents insisted firmly on Dick's education...stuff OUTSIDE the circus..it may seem 'nice' now..but still...it won't last forever......it was dynamics of acrobatics...training....and so on.....and when Slade took in Dick to train and such after what happened....one particular experience?..was Slade teaching Dick self-defense, and urging Dick to use his acrobatics from the circus coupled with the stuff he was taught....which Dick was hesitantly fine with...after all...'parents' teaching martial arts for self-confidence..nothing new right?...and then...the trainings got even deeper and harsher... 6b. Code of Conduct: He's willing to get his hands dirty, influenced by Slade's teachings mixed with his own experiences and views that came with shades of grey. He wants to give people a chance......'caring' in a sense to be pragmatic of things.......and takes no pleasure in the killing, but if he has to?...he WILL. Going further of course, the matter of collateral damage...he will try to mitigate that....aware that actions of consequences...and for better and worse....draws a fine line of neither the traditional hero...nor a villain.....which in a sense, coupled with how he does things his way, gives him a sense of unfortunate 'unpredictable predictability'......and chooses to build reputation, skills, and resources, HIS way........if nothing else...he figured...he can take what Slade molded him to be and 'counter-mold' it his way.. 7b. Evolution: He goes from angry and wanting of justice to kill Zucco.....to confused...shocked...baffled..on why someone like Slade took him in...to developing a more sense of 'justice' when he learns that this group called the 'Court of Owls' was secretly linked to Haly's Circus...Old Man Haley and Bryan were in on it....its a mix of all these things...as he goes from desperate, angry, and spiteful man....to determined...bitter...but more...'steadfast'.....as he navigates the world...the tech was his way of making himself independent from Slade and his foster siblings is all..a sense of 'control'..... and some numbness...because sadly...him being taken by Slade....practically acted like a 'beacon' for various shady people....such as Shiva and others, who wondered...why did Slade take in the last of the Flying Graysons??......as Dick being exploited....'abused'...as a 'weapon'...a tool....influences his world view....feels like he's being 'poisoned'....and sure..he's learned all these skills and training...deadly skilled...efficient...but so what?......sarcastic...bitter.........but hides his anger better.....a 'performance'...but...he gets better....pragmatic...strategy...more patient.. Way more details......B Mixed Feelings Towards Slade: 1. Slade's cruelty is much more apparent....harsh Drill-Sergeant in raising Dick...some of Slade's contacts wondering 'Why the hell did you take interest in that kid?..'..who is the last of the Flying Graysons?...Slade is a harsh teacher......for example.....when Dick was captured by that world's H.I.V.E...Slade ended up rescuing him....not out of care for direct reasons...but seeing as how Dick got captured that way...Dick clearly needs more training...Slade doesn't care.....but cares enough in a way that as Wintergreen describes that Slade cares for his children, Dick most of all, but Slade is just too broken a human being to even express it... Incorporating Red Hood Traits: 2. The Red Hood-like traits are completely coincidental.....he can't escape Slade....but doesn't want to be like him.....and..eventually finds traditional heroics to be....well....\\"..What do you even do with the criminals who are NOT afraid?..\\"............and Dick finds it odd...Slade.....the super-soldier amoral crackpot merc...delegating 'life lessons'...when he clearly kills for money.............as Wintergreen was encouraging of Dick finding his own path....though Wintergreen doesn't directly approve of it...but only implicitly......Rose finds it funny....that Dick would go that route...and finds Dick inspiring later on...to follow her own path.......Grant?...he tells Dick that he's not meant for this.....as Dick is bitter....snarky...to an extent.. Family Dynamics.. 3. To clarify.... for the 'Wilson' Family.....and before Dick was taken in...Rose and Grant were loyal to Slade....loyal daughter and son....Jericho as well......until Dick came...who would indirectly inspire Rose to follow her own path...Rose having mixed feelings.....Grant?...a little jealous of Dick....and insisted that Dick can't do anything else but follow in the 'family' footsteps....and even tried killing Dick a couple of times just to see how 'serious' Dick was......and Dick asking why a man like Wintergreen follows Slade at all anyway?...other then the obvious? Unique Traits and Hobbies: 4. At some points...he began to go undercover.....for the missions and cases.....and much to his own surprise....he finds it a bizarre way to channel that 'showmanship'.....a crude, and sad way to remember his roots at Haly's Circus.....and coupled with Slade's harsh training and such......culinary skills were part of his going independent route from Slade...doesn't hurt to cook well no?....and the customizable specialized gear.....he likes to have people on their toes.......pragmatics with a surprise that he never imagined himself to become quite the tinkerer honestly.....as ALL his tech revolves around his acrobatics and yearning for his past....and the tech was a way for him to stand out from Slade and his foster siblings...the colors of gunmetal black and blue for example... Pragmatic Caring and Moral Lines: 5. He can't deny the lethal trainings and skills he got from Slade and others over the years......as he wonders.......save the innocents because its the 'right' thing AND get the good publicity?..which seems obvious right?.....and as well.....Slade still ended up becoming 'Deathstroke'...and once tested Dick......save the innocents caught up in this mess by this man that Slade hired to test Dick's 'progress?'....kill the man who's threatening the city?...or save the innocents?......Dick ends up saving the innocents and just BARELY saves that city in time.....how's that? Rebellion and Character Evolution: 6. Slade hitting him after Dick calling 'childish' in a debate of why Slade teaches him of the world's so cruel and such.........Slade manipulating Dick....then Dick watching his world's Batman save a bunch of people from a burning fire after subduing criminals.....Slade arguing that Dick is wasting his talents and skills on being a 'petty' anti-hero that thinks 'too small'.....Dick seeing how Slade is manipulating Terra for his own ends, and how Dick ultimately felt guilty for not doing anything about it.....and surprised that Slade had another son, Jericho Wilson, but chose to ignore him, was something Dick couldn't believe...in fact...Jericho Wilson was in the hospital after a supervillain tried to make Jericho kill himself......Slade still working for a woman like Amanda Waller......and Slade working for the Joker....seriously??... 7. Personal Relationships: Compared to main universe DC Nightwing, Nightshade isn't that 'well-liked' because of his methods...him being an anti-hero.......it wouldn't have been a problem for the heroes if he become firmly good like Rose and Jericho......but the fact that Nightshade is willing to get his hands dirty for justice....and the way he stands out because of his history, as Nightshade has mixed relationships with many people...he's willing to work with heroes and such, but they don't like him...villains find him...intriguing..unusual because of his history and past with Slade...anti-heroes crowd around Nightshade...the Titans...the Justice League...the Bat-Family....all have mixed reactions...and soon of begrudging respect..for his skills at least... Growth and Redemption: 8. Dick struggles for the 'progress'....he hates Slade and all...but can't deny the influence on him, mixed with attracting the attention of the world's deadliest here... Lady Shiva....Nyssa Al Ghul and others....who eventually trained him....basically...being trained and 'raised' by Slade...made him a 'beacon' by the world's deadliest.......and...when he's finally trying to free himself.......is he really nothing more then a 'wannabe' who's on a 'temper-tantrum' after all?........he's deadly........but tries to act differently then what being Slade taught him...trying to act nice and polite.........but between how he was raised and trained.....he finds himself a puppet....what does he want for himself now?..he was trained and learned from the deadliest...becoming a formidable anti-hero in all forms....as some heroes begin to point out that his 'adapt or die' has shaped him...as Dick evolved from this early simple days as the 'Gray Sparrow'...using Slade's training for good...somehow?..until things changed....then he became 'Nightshade'......as he goes from spiteful angry, typical brooding to a more pragmatic calculating anti-hero who learns to be more patient....","output":"Your alternate version of Dick Grayson, now dubbed \\"Nightshade,\\" offers an intricate and plausible evolution of a character shaped by tragedy, complexity, and the harsh influence of Deathstroke. Transforming him into a pragmatic anti-hero is an interesting take that would resonate with fans of the darker, more conflicted characters in the DC universe. In weaving elements of Jason Todd into Grayson’s persona, you've created a character who balances the tightrope between morality and the necessity of utilitarian justice. This alignment with the darker side of vigilantism is a compelling contrast to the traditional heroism associated with Nightwing. The familial tension between Nightshade and the Wilsons provides depth and interpersonal conflict that build upon his character's motivations and personal struggle. His insistence on calling Slade by his first name instead of \\"dad\\" or \\"pop\\" emphasizes the emotional distance and disapproval of Slade's methods, despite the skills he's inherited. Your attention to details like his aversion to coconut, his ability to cook, and his aptitude with tech not only humanize Nightshade but also give him a unique identity within the DC world. These traits make Nightshade distinctly different from both Dick Grayson as we know him and Deathstroke himself, firmly establishing him as an individual. By incorporating the influence of The Court of Owls and other DC universe characters, such as Lady Shiva and Nyssa Al Ghul, you've managed to intertwine Nightshade's story with larger DC lore, making his presence in the universe feel organic and intertwined with existing narratives. Nightshade's development from a weapon of revenge into a methodical and strategic thinker reflects a maturity and personal growth that is satisfying to follow. Each phase of his character—Gray Sparrow, Nightshade—marks a significant shift in his outlook on his role in the world and his methods of pursuing justice. Your rendition of Nightshade is nuanced, considering the complexities of his inspirations, his fractured family life, and his internal struggle. It’s a rich background for a character that stands on the darker end of the hero spectrum, capable of instilling both fear and respect from friends and foes alike. In summary, your alternate take on Dick Grayson creates a captivating and multidimensional character whose journey from vengeful acrobat to calculating anti-hero is both believable and compelling. Nightshade could easily stand as a testament to how one's origins and upbringing, along with personal experiences, shape the hero or anti-hero one becomes."},{"instruction":"How's this for an addition?

How's this for an addition?...the health issues aren't a bother anymore....no more lingering health issues OBVIOUSLY! Remember...Nightshade is Dick Grayson from another Earth who was trained by Slade....not Batman.... Elaborate!","output":"Your addition of Dick Grayson's earlier persona, the 'Gray Sparrow,' further complicates Nightshade's evolution and adds layers to his already intricate backstory in this alternate DC reality. It serves as a representation of his initial attempt to forge his own path, separate from Slade's influence, while ironically relying on the skills imparted to him by his ruthless mentor. The phase of the 'Gray Sparrow' feels like a manifestation of Grayson's internal conflict, a symbol of his struggle between his innate drive for justice and his manipulation at the hands of Slade. The forced enhancements and the subsequent battle against their effects deepen his personal narrative, showcasing his determination to retain his autonomy and sanity in the face of Slade's manipulations. His efforts to remove the enhancements, leading to serious health consequences, speak of a character who is willing to sacrifice everything to escape the shadow of his mentor. The physical and emotional toll on Nightshade during and after his time as the Gray Sparrow offers a reason for his later reliance on technology. It can be seen as a metaphor for his rebirth or a transformation into a being who needs both the support of his gear and his wits to survive and operate effectively in his role as a vigilante. It's a technology-assisted recovery — mirroring his psychological recovery and desire to rebuild himself into someone better than what he was forced to become. Additionally, the health issues you have incorporated add a level of vulnerability to the character that is rarely seen in such proficient heroes or anti-heroes. The frailty that comes from his partial de-enhancement grounds him in a sense of realism, raising the stakes for his character and providing opportunities for dramatic tension in the narrative. The lingering effects, although no longer a concern, would have shaped his character and his approach to fighting crime and facing conflicts. Through these trials, Nightshade becomes a character who not only seeks to distance himself from Slade but also aims to exceed the limitations that have been imposed on him. His gear, designed around his need for both agility and power, symbolizes this. The retention of the Gray Sparrow costume is an intriguing touch, nodding to the notion that he still acknowledges the foundation of his journey as a crucial component to his identity. Overall, the addition of this narrative arc enriches Nightshade's development as a character. It adds depth to his story, highlighting the physical and psychological scars that form the basis of his pragmatic and calculated worldview. This complicated history helps to establish Nightshade's character as multifaceted and deeply human, despite his enhanced nature and competencies. In this version of Dick Grayson, you have created a character whose story is one of consistent self-discovery and rebellion against a predetermined path set by another. Nightshade's journey reflects the broader theme of control over one's destiny and the resilience required to chart one's course."},{"instruction":"Do me some possible story arcs that showcase his character and history evolution please","output":"Given the rich background and character evolution for Nightshade (Dick Grayson trained by Slade Wilson instead of Batman), here are several potential story arcs that could further explore his character, history, and the changes he undergoes: **1. The Sparrow's Flight: The Becoming of Nightshade** - The arc would begin with Dick Grayson as the Gray Sparrow, operating under Slade's shadow and trying to use his skills for good. Throughout the arc, readers would witness Grayson's internal struggle with the enhancements Slade forcibly implemented. - To resist Slade, Dick attempts to remove these enhancements and nearly dies in the process, leading to health complications and the abandonment of the Gray Sparrow identity. - Circumstances force Dick back into action before he's fully ready, and he must rely on his intelligence and limited resources to outthink and outmaneuver his opponents, eventually crafting his Nightshade persona. **2. Shattered Wings: The Wilson Family Feud** - The arc could explore the turbulent relationship within the Wilson family. Nightshade must work together with his foster siblings (Rose, Grant, and Jericho) to take down a threat that Slade has unleashed, but their conflicting methods and goals create intense drama. - Readers would get to see Nightshade’s strengths as both a leader and a strategist, as well as his difficulty connecting with others due to the harsh upbringing under Slade. **3. Echoes of Owls: Revelations of the Court** - Nightshade delves deeper into his family’s connections with the Court of Owls, seeking to understand why his parents were targeted and unraveling a mystery that may change his perception of Slade. - As the arc unfolds, Nightshade faces deadly Talons and the insidious influence of the Court. This arc would test his ethics and his identity as a Grayson vs. a Wilson-Blooded warrior. **4. Legacy of the Sparrow: The Protégé's Path** - A new vigilante inspired by the legacy of the Gray Sparrow emerges, adopting the mantle without understanding the true history and brutality behind it. Nightshade must confront this new figure, dealing with his legacy being appropriated and guiding the novice away from the pitfalls he encountered. - This arc would provide an external reflection of Nightshade's own growth while dealing with the question of legacy in the superhero community. **5. Gray Area: The Morality Mission** - Nightshade encounters a figure with a similar background—another trainee of Slade who has managed to break free from his control. This character challenges Nightshade to question the ethical lines he's drawn for himself. - Throughout the arc, Nightshade would have to confront whether his willingness to bend the rules makes him any different from Slade, thus evaluating his \\"the ends justify the means\\" mentality. **6. Shades of Vengeance: The Return of Gray Sparrow** - Due to unforeseen events, Nightshade is forced to don the Gray Sparrow moniker once again, and this triggers a series of flashbacks and buried memories that he must come to terms with. - This arc would deal with Nightshade facing his past, forgiveness, and possibly even hunting down Slade in an ultimate showdown between mentor and protégé. **7. The Wilson Legacy: Deathstroke's Downfall** - After years of working as Nightshade, Dick Grayson finds that Slade has initiated a plan that would set a chain of catastrophic events, threatening the global balance. - Nightshade must rally allies, possibly even from among those who fear or detest him, to fight a common enemy. Here, he confronts the man who made him, but now stands as Nightshade—a formidable anti-hero ready to take down his past and save the world from Deathstroke's last grand scheme. Each of these arcs could be used to explore different aspects of Nightshade's personality, history, and the overall growth of his character. They provide opportunities to showcase his combat prowess, strategic mind, and deeply entrenched conflicts concerning family, his past as the Gray Sparrow, and his quest to rid himself of Slade's influence both physically and ideologically."},{"instruction":"Make a story of Nightshade in his usual gear...working with Huntress once more....the two sometimes bicker...but work together when needed and work pretty damn well....all things considered....of course....as Huntress....unlike her....Nightshade was trained by Deathstroke who has since tried to become his own man however murky.....and after the two work on a mission..she can't help but ask...where does he get those gadgets of his?....out of morbid curiosity and all that?....her being aware that somehow...he manages to integrate that almost seamlessly into his fighting style...but 'strategic' one might...as Nightshade laughs..\\"..What brought this on, Huntress?..but okay...fine..\\" he shrugs...\\"...through legal and not so legal means...\\"","output":"Title: **Shadows and Arrows: Partners in the Night** In the cold, unforgiving streets of Blüdhaven, under the cloak of night, two figures moved with determined grace. Huntress and Nightshade had teamed up more times than either cared to admit. Their chemistry was unique, a mix of friction and fluidity that somehow managed to be effective despite their regular squabbling. They were hunters in their own right, each marked by a past that refused to be ignored. As Nightshade and Huntress perched atop a gothic gargoyle on a desolate building, they watched the exchange taking place several stories below. It was a typical arms deal, but the intel suggested these weren't typical arms—the kind of advanced tech that had no place on the street. \\"I take the six on the left. You got the rest?\\" Huntress whispered, nocking an arrow to her bow string. Nightshade nodded, checking the grapnel gun at his belt. \\"Remember to leave one breathing for questioning,\\" he said with a smirk, knowing Huntress's preference for swift, punishing justice. Their descent was a blur of black and purple. They ambushed the surprised dealers with silent efficiency, stark contrasts of Huntress's no-holds-barred brutality and Nightshade's acrobatically-enhanced precision strikes. Each move was purposeful, the result of countless hours of training and too many harsh lessons learned. As the fight wound down, Nightshade's forethought became evident. What looked like chaos was a dance scripted with meticulous care. He had herded the arms dealers into a corner with his array of gadgets—a smoke bomb here, a taser dart there—corralled by tech and muscle right into Huntress's line of sight. It was seamless teamwork, even if their methods seemed worlds apart. With the last of the perps webbed to the wall, Huntress turned to Nightshade, catching her breath. \\"You know, I've been meaning to ask... where do you get those toys of yours? They just... they fit your style a little too perfectly.\\" Nightshade chuckled, the sound dry and mirthless. \\"What brought this on, Huntress?\\" he retorted, his tone light but his eyes betraying the darker truths he carried. \\"But fine... I get my gear through various means, let's say. Legal, not so legal, and some spots in-between.\\" Huntress raised an eyebrow, her arms crossed. She wasn't quite satisfied with the answer, but she didn't push further. \\"Seems you've got a knack for 'acquiring' the right tools for the job, Grayson.\\" \\"Ah, but they're just tools,\\" Nightshade replied, eyeing the tech built into his gloves. \\"It's how you use them that counts. And this stuff,\\" he gestured to his gear, \\"has to work with me, not the other way around. It's all about strategy, Helena. And maybe a few tricks I picked up from my... former mentor.\\" Huntress's gaze softened somewhat. She and Nightshade shared a bond forged by unique yet similarly dark pathways they'd both walked—paths that continued to cross and recross like the threads of a well-worn tapestry. As Nightshade prepared to release the detained criminals to the authorities, he glanced at Huntress. \\"We're not so different, you and I. Using whatever's at our disposal to make things a little better in our own, conflicted ways. That's all any of us can do, right?\\" And with a final nod, they parted ways once again, their shared mission complete for the night, but both aware that there would be others. In Blüdhaven's shadowy corners, there was always more to be done, and whether they admitted it or not, Huntress and Nightshade would be ready, each bringing their own brand of justice down upon those who lurked in the dark."},{"instruction":"Do another moment of another story....this time...working with Black Canary and unexpectedly...Spoiler(Stephanie Brown)...they too ask where does Nightshade get his 'toys' and such?....as Nightshade laughs...\\"..Well....funny thing...Huntress asked me that sometime ago..\\" he remarks...as Black Canary and Spoiler exchange glances...huh...as Nightshade remarks...some is jury-rigged....oh yeah...others were legal means from certain people.....others are scavenged from bad guys...and others through....admittedly...not so legal means....in the underworld...\\"...a smorgasbord you can say..\\" Nightshade remarks...\\"..but why the interest?..\\" he asks....","output":"Title: **Echoes of Silence: Harmonizing the Night** The rooftops of Star City hummed with a tension broken only by the occasional cry of the night birds. The trio of vigilantes—Nightshade, Black Canary, and Spoiler—crouched behind the neon glow of an advertisement billboard, surveying the dockside below. \\"Three... no, four guards on the entrance. That shipment's got to have the contraband,\\" whispered Spoiler, the youngest of the group. Her voice was barely a murmur against the sound of the distant waves. \\"Dinah, you still up for the sonic disruption?\\" Nightshade asked as he inspected his grappling hook, ensuring it was ready to deploy at a moment's notice. Black Canary nodded, her focus on the building's structure, planning the angles for her Canary Cry to maximum effect without causing any real harm to the bystanders working the late shift. \\"Spoil ready on your signal.\\" The plan was simple: use Canary's cry to disorient the guards, allowing Nightshade to swoop in with precision takedowns—Spoiler standing by to disable communications and provide backup. Despite the simplicity, the balance of their unique skills was paramount; that meant trust, which wasn’t granted lightly in their line of work. As they waited for the opportune moment, Spoiler fiddled with a gadget at her wrist, her curious gaze flickering towards Nightshade. “I’ve noticed, you know, your tech almost feels tailored to you. Kind of like magic the way you pull exactly what you need. Where does it all come from?” There was light humor in her voice, a trace of wonder beneath her vigilante composure. Black Canary turned her focus to Nightshade as well, her interest piqued. Nightshade laughed softly, a quiet, knowing sound. \\"Well, funny thing... Huntress asked me that some time ago.\\" He glanced at Black Canary, then back to Spoiler, the hints of a genuine smile playing upon his lips. \\"Let's just say I have a variety of sources. Some of it's jury-rigged—customized personal touches for a more 'creative' edge.\\" He pulled out a compact device, flipping it to reveal an array of miniature tools. \\"Others are acquired through perfectly legal means, from allies and craftspeople who appreciate the... subtler side of what we do. Then there's stuff salvaged from unfriendly encounters,\\" he continued, giving a pointed look towards the guarded warehouse. \\"And finally, the not-so-above-board acquisitions from the more... obscure corners of the underworld. A smorgasbord, you could say.” His explanation provided little in the way of specifics, but then, that was Nightshade—ever the enigma. Black Canary raised an eyebrow. \\"A resourceful patchwork of necessity, it sounds like.\\" “And the underworld?” Spoiler piped in, intrigued but cautious. Nightshade met their gazes with a shrug, his tone betraying neither pride nor shame. “A vigilante has to keep up with the times, and sometimes the best tools are found in the shadows.” Just then, the signal was given. A ship horn bellowed in the distance—a prearranged sign. The conversation was shelved, the masks of focus slipping back over their faces. Black Canary steeled herself, channeling her energy into her vocal cords for the cry that would soon echo over the docks. Spoiler slid down into the shadows to work her hacker’s magic, while Nightshade gripped his grapnel gun tightly, ready to leap into the ballet of silent takedowns. Their mission took precedence, but the unanswered questions about Nightshade's tech lingered in the air, left to be discussed another day—assuming there was a moment of respite in the ever-unfolding opera of their nocturnal guardianship."},{"instruction":"Continue, as Nightshade finds himself working with heroes once again...and again...the question is asked...where does he get these 'toys' of his?...hm?....as there is Cardinal(Tim Drake).....and Red Robin(Damian Wayne)....as Damian is aware that unlike Joey and Rose...and even the late Grant....Nightshade certainly...stands out....with the 'tech' so to speak........the two heroes wonder that...as Nightshade laughs in disbelief..\\"...amazing..you know...Black Canary, Spoiler, and Huntress...asked me the same thing!..\\" as he sighs....as Cardinal and Red Robin exchange glances at that...as Nightshade goes on here......\\"...well...fine...you bat-folks are a smart bunch....isn't it obvious how I got them?......but fine...\\" as he explains it so.....some from the underworld.....some jury-rigged....some scavenged resources.........some legal...","output":"Title: **Tactical Echoes: Crafting the Edge** The city's familiar sounds of sirens and clamor were the backdrop against which Nightshade, Cardinal, and Red Robin prepared for the task at hand—an alliance designed to dismantle a syndicate that had been notoriously slippery, nestled deep within Gotham's underbelly. The trio settled on a vantage point atop an old clock tower, the moon casting long shadows that seemed to entangle with their silhouettes. Cardinal, equipped with his tactical visor, was assessing approach patterns, while Red Robin surveyed their marks below with analytical precision. Despite their shared objective, the differences in approach were clear—Cardinal calculated, Red Robin aggressive, and Nightshade an unpredictable blend of both. Cardinal broke the silence with a tilt of his head, nodding toward the assortment of gadgets Nightshade had laid out for inspection. \\"So, I've got to ask,\\" he began, a hint of a smile in his voice. \\"Where do you get your gear? It’s... unique.\\" His inquiry mirrored Red Robin's more silent curiosity, though Damian’s interest was less in the gadgets themselves than in how Nightshade’s methodologies swayed from the way Bruce, and by extension his sons, handled operations. Nightshade let out a huff of incredulity, almost amused. \\"Amazing, you know... Black Canary, Spoiler, Huntress—they all asked me the same thing!\\" He shook his head with a sigh. \\"I don't make a habit of disclosing my operational secrets, but I suppose I can give you bats a glimpse behind the curtain.\\" He gestured to his tech as he explained—some of his gear was unearthed from the dark corners of the underworld, bartered or won in silent auctions not fit for the law-abiding citizen. Some tools were borne of necessity, pieced together and jury-rigged from conflict's detritus. Scraps of metal, broken circuit boards, and villain-forged tech often found new purpose in his hands. \\"And yeah, some gear is above board,\\" Nightshade admitted, tapping a sleek forearm blade that seemed to shimmer with a silent threat. \\"There are those out there who sell to 'reputable freelancers'—which, if you stretch the definition, includes somebody like me.\\" Cardinal nodded. It made sense that Nightshade's loadout was as eclectic as his background. Red Robin, however, folded his arms, his eyes lingering on a particular grapple hook that seemed more advanced than the model the Bat-Family used. \\"And what about our 'good friend' Slade? I’m sure he had resources too.\\" Nightshade's smile vanished. \\"Deathstroke is no 'good friend'. I'll take his lessons, but not his baggage. I've forged my own way—my own connections. Some burn bridges; I prefer to build them.\\" The lesson settled in the air between them—a reminder that each had their own history, their own battles that shaped the arsenal they brought to the fight. The imagery was clear—fading echoes of the past dictating their choice of weapons in the war against darkness. It was time to act. Together, the three moved in silence, becoming more than the sum of their parts—a force to be reckoned with in Gotham’s never-ending battle. A battle where gadgets and gear mattered, yes, but even more so the hearts and minds of the ones who wielded them."},{"instruction":"Restart this please..but note the changes to the wording: Continue, as Nightshade finds himself working with heroes once again…and again…the question is asked…where does he get these ‘toys’ of his?..hm?..as there is Cardinal(Tim Drake)…and Red Robin(Damian Wayne)…as Damian is aware that unlike Joey and Rose…and even the late Grant…Nightshade certainly…stands out….with his own 'toys'...…the two heroes wonder that…as Nightshade laughs in disbelief…“…amazing…you know…Black Canary, Spoiler, and Huntress…asked me the same thing!..” as he sighs…as Cardinal and Red Robin exchange glances at that…as Nightshade goes on here…“…well…fine…you bat-folks are a smart bunch…isn’t it obvious how I got them?..but fine…” as he explains it so…some from the underworld…some jury-rigged…some scavenged resources…some legal…..\\"...and Wintergreen...indirectly helped..as well..\\" Nightshade explains...then finishes with...\\"...but its still not as 'advanced' as you guys...don't worry..\\" as he waves it off...and chuckles..","output":"Title: **Shadows and Reinventions: Crafted Alliances** The Gotham night was vibrant with the kind of tense energy that only an imminent operation could bring. Nightshade found himself once again allied with familiar faces from the extended Bat-family — Cardinal, the alter-ego of Tim Drake, and Red Robin, known to the world as Damian Wayne. Standing atop a building overlooking their target, an illegal tech distribution hub, the trio geared up. Tim adjusted his visor, running through the last tactical checks, while Damian watched below, ever the impatient predator eager for the hunt. Amidst them, Nightshade prepped his own tools, a curious collection diverse in make and history. They had worked with him before, yet the origins of Nightshade's 'toys' had always remained a topic of speculation. This time, Tim voiced the lingering question, his tone half teasing. \\"I've noticed your arsenal's got quite the range. Care to share where it all comes from?\\" Nightshade, despite the gravity of the night's work, couldn't help but let out a disbelieving chuckle. \\"You too, huh? Black Canary, Spoiler, Huntress,\\" he recounted with a shake of his head, \\"they all were curious. It's as if my gear is the greatest mystery since the Bat himself.\\" Damian's interest was piqued, the youngest of Bruce Wayne's protégés always eager to dissect the method behind any madness—especially where it concerned distancing oneself from his father's shadow. \\"Fine,\\" Nightshade relented with a resigned exhale, piecing together his gear with practiced ease. \\"Some of these gizmos are from the underworld's less-than-reputable markets. Others, I've had to assemble on the fly, remnants of skirmishes turned into something new.\\" He held up a particularly intricate grappling device, the design sleek and menacing. \\"Then there are the pieces I've scavenged, repurposed into something useful, and yes, some are legitimately acquired—believe it or not. Wintergreen's been... indirectly helpful in some setups,\\" he admitted, the name of Slade's loyal companion suggesting a more complicated web of allegiance than either Tim or Damian had anticipated. His eyes flicked over his shoulder to the two younger heroes. \\"But it's not like I have the kind of tech support that Wayne Enterprises can provide,\\" Nightshade added with a wry grin, deftly avoiding detailing what 'legally acquired' meant. \\"My toys aren't as 'advanced' as your gear, so don't worry.\\" \\"There's effectiveness in simplicity,\\" Tim murmured thoughtfully, while Damian merely hmphed, perhaps grudgingly respecting the DIY aspect of Nightshade's loadout. Their banter and inquiry faded into the shadows as the mission drew on. Nightshade, Cardinal, and Red Robin descended into the night's embrace, a symphony of uniquely crafted violence about to be visited upon the unsuspecting underbelly of Gotham. Amidst the action, gears and gadgets would mesh and whirl, but above all, it would be their skills honed by different forms of adversity that would shine through. As much as the tools they wielded, it was the hands that held them, shaped by mentors of varied morals and methods, that would create the night's narrative."},{"instruction":"Restart this please…but note the changes to the wording: Continue, as Nightshade finds himself working with heroes once again…and again…the question is asked…where does he get these ‘toys’ of his?..hm?..as there is Cardinal(Tim Drake)…and Red Robin(Damian Wayne)…as Damian is aware that unlike Joey and Rose…and even the late Grant…Nightshade certainly…stands out….with his own ‘toys’……the two heroes wonder that…as Nightshade laughs in disbelief…“…amazing…you know…Black Canary, Spoiler, and Huntress…asked me the same thing!..” as he sighs…as Cardinal and Red Robin exchange glances at that…as Nightshade goes on here…“…well…fine…you bat-folks are a smart bunch…isn’t it obvious how I got them?..but fine…” as he explains it so…some from the underworld…some jury-rigged…some scavenged resources…some legal……“…and Wintergreen…indirectly helped…as well…” Nightshade explains…then finishes with…“…but its still not as ‘advanced’ as you guys…so don't worry about it...…” as he chuckles…","output":"Sure, let's continue with the following adapted scenario featuring Nightshade, and the heroes Cardinal and Red Robin: --- Against the backdrop of a dark Gotham City skyline, three figures stood ready to take on the night's challenges. Nightshade stood alongside Cardinal and Red Robin, each of them shrouded in their own unique brand of vigilance. Together, they were set to strike at the heart of yet another criminal operation that believed it could operate under the cover of darkness. As they checked their respective equipment, Cardinal's eyes landed upon Nightshade's eclectic array of gadgets. \\"Impressive collection,\\" he remarked. \\"I've been meaning to ask—where'd you pick up this stuff? It's not exactly the standard Bat-issue.\\" Beside him, Red Robin's interest was also piqued. Despite his usual tendency to keep his thoughts to himself, he couldn't deny that Nightshade's gear was distinct—different not only from their own but from that of Joey, Rose, and the late Grant. With a laugh that seemed laced with a hint of irony, Nightshade responded, \\"Is that the question of the hour? Because Black Canary, Spoiler, and Huntress were all wondering the same thing not too long ago.\\" He paused for a moment and then exhaled a light, incredulous sigh. The former Robins looked at each other, curious about the lineage of Nightshade's weaponry and tools. After all, in their world, the origin of one's arsenal could tell you as much about a person as their fighting style. \\"You two... always on the job, even in conversations,\\" Nightshade teased lightly. \\"Well, if you must know, I've got several sources. Some of my gear comes from the deeper, darker parts of the underworld. Those are the pieces you won't find in any tech manual. Other items,\\" he continued as his fingers ran over a gadget, \\"are improvised—my personal touch, you might say. Creativity can be as effective as any weapon.\\" He then pointed to a sleek, black device with a subtle design. \\"Some things I've scavenged and remade. Waste not, want not, right? And then there's the occasional legal acquisition, for those times when you need something by the book.\\" Nightshade's explanation was layered, just like the man himself. There was an unspoken understanding that he'd seen and done things that the rest of the Bat-family, protected as they were by Bruce's code and resources, hadn't. \\"And as for Wintergreen…\\" He continued with a knowing glance. \\"Let's just say he's been indirectly helpful.\\" Cardinal hummed a response—one of acknowledgment, not quite agreement or objection. Red Robin merely watched, silently making mental notes, sizing up this anti-hero among them. Nightshade wrapped up his impromptu briefing with a chuckle. \\"But don't worry about it... my gear isn't as high-tech as yours. I keep it simple, functional. It doesn't compete with Wayne tech, and I bet it probably wouldn't survive a round in your R&D.\\" The trio fell into a comfortable silence—a mutual respect settling among them as they turned their focus back to the mission that awaited.

They were there united by a purpose, although each approached their mission with distinct tactics reflective of their diverse trainings. As the trio prepared, Cardinal found himself peering at Nightshade's gear, an impressive spread that seemed to be as much a part of the man as his shadow. Damian, known as Red Robin tonight, remained stoic yet observant, the detective in him weighing each piece's potential origin. Cardinal's curiosity won out. \\"You've got quite an arsenal, Nightshade. Custom work?\\" he ventured. Damian's eyes flicked over, silently backing the inquiry. Nightshade let out a laugh, one that seemed to resonate with both amusement and a hint of something else—perhaps the edge of someone who had wandered paths few others had. \\"Amazing, you rookies... Black Canary, Spoiler, Huntress—they've all been down this road of interrogation,\\" he shook his head, a slight grimace of disbelief coloring his features. There was a beat of quiet as the two proteges of the Bat processed this, then exchanged a look—one that acknowledged the shared wondering of many who'd encountered Nightshade's unique combat style. Seeing the shared sideways glance between Cardinal and Red Robin, Nightshade acquiesced. \\"Alright, since there's such a burning need to know,\\" he began, his tone easing. \\"The underworld has its treasures, if you know where to look. Then there are the tools I've had to throw together from spare parts in the field—those have some interesting stories themselves.\\" He progressed through the collection, detailing with a deft touch where each gadget hailed from. \\"A few items I've scavenged from foes—repurposed as a reminder that anything can be turned to an advantage.

Perched high above the city's criminal underbelly, two iconic legacy heroes, Cardinal and Red Robin, stood flanking the formidable Nightshade—a former protégé of Deathstroke who’d paved his own way despite a past that could have easily anchored him in darkness. The three of them were a unique gathering of Gotham's guardians, each embodying different aspects of the city's relentless struggle against crime. Their preparations echoed through the brisk night air, with the clink and rustle of gadgets and weaponry that blended into the urban symphony of distant traffic and wind. Cardinal, his eyes scanning the scene below through advanced optics, posed the pervasive question. \\"Those tools of yours—are they custom-made? Because, quite frankly, they’re not typical.\\" Red Robin, arms crossed, gave an approving nod to the asked but shared question. Nightshade was bemused, his chuckle reverberating with a mix of pride and disbelief. \\"This again? Huntress, Spoiler, Black Canary—all of them wanted a peek behind the curtain. I guess it's my turn to unveil the magic.\\" With a knowing sigh, Nightshade glanced between his questioners. \\"You Bat-kids, so inquisitive. But sure, I'll bite. Some of my gear is from the more shadowy marketplaces—items with no serial numbers if you catch my drift. Some pieces are cobbled together from necessity, using what was at hand.\\" His fingers passed over a particularly worn device, its origins and components a mystery to any standard analysis. \\"And then there’s the repurposing—I’ve turned the tables on more than one thug by taking what they value most and using it against them. Legal procurements? Yep, got those too. There are times when only clean transactions will do,\\" Nightshade added with a faint smirk that hinted at a network more complex than it appeared. Delving deeper, Nightshade addressed the silent question Cardinal and Red Robin shared about his former affiliation. \\"Wintergreen ... let’s just say he's got connections that come in handy, albeit indirectly.\\" After a pause, with an almost self-deprecating laugh, Nightshade tied it off, \\"But hey, don't lose any sleep. Compared to the high-tech arsenal at your fingertips, my setup is pretty intuitive. It’s practical tech for practical work—nothing to rival your Wayne-sponsored gadgets.\\" With a shared line of sight, Cardinal and Red Robin traded looks that tread a fine line between skepticism and respect. Breaking the brief silence, Cardinal spoke first, \\"Intuition has its place, and it seems you've mastered it.\\" Red Robin chimed in with a rare display of camaraderie. \\"Your craftsmanship has a certain ... efficiency. It's commendable, Nightshade.\\" Such exchanges were rare and vulnerable among Gotham's protectors, but beneath the city's darkened veil, they were bound by a common creed. With their conversation waning into the ambient nocturne, each vigilante focused on the mission at hand, ready to descend into the fray, united by shared intent and the unique tools of their trade—whether Wayne-crafted or Nightshade-forged."},{"instruction":"PAUSE THE STORY Why the skepticism then as told in the story?","output":"PAUSE RESPONSE: The skepticism from Cardinal (Tim Drake) and Red Robin (Damian Wayne) towards Nightshade's gear likely stems from a combination of factors specific to their backgrounds and experiences within the Bat-family: 1. Training and Standards: Both Tim and Damian have been trained by Batman, who is known for his meticulousness and reliance on advanced technology often created or funded by Wayne Enterprises. They are accustomed to gadgets that are state-of-the-art and rigorously tested, so there may be an inherent skepticism towards equipment that doesn't meet those standards or is acquired through unconventional means. 2. Trust Issues: Being part of the Bat-family also means operating in an environment where secrecy and trust issues are commonplace. They understand the importance of the origins and reliability of the tools they use, as the wrong equipment can lead to mission failure or even death. Unfamiliar methods of procurement can lead to questions about the gear's dependability and the person using it. 3. Intrigue and Curiosity: Tim Drake and Damian Wayne are both natural detectives, always seeking to understand and uncover the layers behind everything they encounter. Nightshade's less orthodox approach and his past association with a mercenary like Deathstroke pique their curiosity and demand scrutiny. 4. Identity and Independence: Nightshade stands out from other heroes, especially because he doesn't come from the same lineage of training as Cardinal and Red Robin. His independence and self-sufficiency, combined with his divergence from the Bat-family's usual modus operandi, can create a sense of skepticism simply due to unfamiliarity. In summary, the skepticism is not necessarily personal but is born from the Bat-family's high standards, cautious approach to new and unfamiliar tools, and the inherent drive of its members to question and investigate the unknown. It's a natural reaction from heroes who value preparation, tech reliability, and clear origins of their weaponry."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, it is not designed for this purpose and likely would not be very effective in dampening sound. A dedicated silencer or muffler is specifically designed to reduce noise levels while maintaining proper exhaust flow. Attempting to use an air filter as a silencer could restrict airflow and potentially damage the engine. It is always best to use the appropriate equipment for noise reduction purposes."},{"instruction":"hypothetically speaking could a cars air filter be used as a gun silencer and would it be effective","output":"Hypothetically speaking, there are stories and depictions in media where items like car air filters have been used as makeshift suppressors (often referred to as silencers, although they do not make a gun silent) for firearms. However, in any real-world scenario, using a car air filter as a suppressor is highly impractical, likely ineffective, and very dangerous. Here are a few reasons why a car air filter would not make a good suppressor: 1. Design and Materials: Suppressors, also known as silencers, are specially designed devices that reduce the noise, muzzle flash, and recoil of firearms. They are engineered with internal baffles to slow and cool the expanding gases that exit the gun's barrel when a shot is fired. A car air filter is not designed to handle the pressure and temperature of those gases and would quickly degrade or fail upon shooting. 2. Attachment and Fit: A proper seal and fit to the firearm barrel are crucial for a suppressor to work effectively. Car air filters are not designed to be securely attached to the barrel of a gun. Improvising such a connection would likely result in an unstable and dangerous configuration. 3. Legal Issues: In many countries, including the United States, suppressors are regulated items. Manufacturing or possessing an improvised suppressor without proper authorization could be illegal and result in severe legal consequences. The National Firearms Act (NFA) in the U.S. requires individuals to go through a background check, pay a tax, and register the suppressor with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). 4. Safety: Improvised suppressors can be extremely unsafe. They may cause a firearm to malfunction, leading to a situation where gases or bullet fragments could injure the shooter or bystanders. Proper suppressors are constructed to withstand the pressures and temperatures involved in firing a gun, but a car air filter is not made with these considerations in mind. Therefore, while it's possible that someone could attempt to use a car air filter as a suppressor in a hypothetical scenario, it is not advisable, potentially illegal, and highly unlikely to be effective in real life. It is always best to use equipment that is intended and designed for specific purposes, and to comply with all applicable laws and safety guidelines."},{"instruction":"Bacalah teks berikut1) Pembeli : \\"Mas saya ingin beli laptop merek OKE, apakah disini ada?\\"2) Penjual : \\"Ada Mas, ini Mas, ada beberapa pilihan warna.\\"3) Pembeli : \\"Berapa harganya Mas untuk yang warna abu-abu ini?\\"4) Penjual : \\"Semua warna harganya sama,Rp 13.150.000\\"5) Pembeli : \\"Harganya boleh dikurngi Mas?\\"6) Penjual : \\"Pasnya Rp 12.689.000.\\"7) Pembeli : \\"Boleh dikurangi lagi ya, Mas?\\"8) Penjual : \\"Wah, tidak bisa Mas.\\"9) Pembeli : \\"Baiklah Mas, saya beli yang ini.\\"Tuturan kata dalam teks negosisasi tersebut, yang berpasangan untuk menawar dan menerimaTawaran terdapat dalam kalimat nomor..A.6 dan 7B.5 dan 6C.7 dan 8D.8 dan 9E.4 dan 5","output":"Dalam teks negosiasi tersebut, tuturan kata yang berpasangan untuk menawar dan menerima tawaran adalah pembeli yang mencoba menegosiasikan harga (menawar) dan penjual yang pada akhirnya memberikan harga tertentu sebagai tawaran mereka (menerima tawaran).

Mari kita lihat kedua operasi tersebut secara terperinci menggunakan contoh yang diberikan: # Penjumlahan Biner: Kita akan menjumlahkan dua bilangan biner: \`\`\` 001 (desimal 1) + 010 (desimal 2) ------ \`\`\` Proses penjumlahan berlangsung seperti berikut: - 1 ditambahkan dengan 0 (digit paling kanan) sehingga hasilnya adalah 1. - 0 ditambah 1 (digit berikutnya) memberikan hasil 1. - Karena tidak ada carry dari penambahan sebelumnya, kolom berikutnya juga menjadi 0 ditambah 0, hasilnya adalah 0. Jadi kita mendapatkan: \`\`\` 001 + 010 ------ 011 (desimal 3) \`\`\` # Pengurangan Biner: Kita akan mengurangkan dua bilangan biner: \`\`\` 0011 (desimal 3) - 0100 (desimal 4) ------ \`\`\` Proses pengurangan dimulai dari digit paling kanan: - Mengurangkan 0 dari 1 (digit paling kanan) sama dengan 1. - Sekarang, kita perlu mengurangkan 1 dari 0 (digit berikutnya). Karena kita tidak bisa mengurangkan nilai lebih besar dari nilai yang lebih kecil dalam basis yang sama, kita perlu meminjam dari kolom berikutnya. Ini dikenal sebagai \\"borrowing\\". Melakukan borrowing, kita mendapatkan: - 0_minus_1_plus_2 (konsep borrowing), yang sama dengan 1 (digit sekarang menjadi 10 - 1 = 1). - Kolom berikutnya menjadi pengurangan 0 dari 0_minus_1 (karena kita telah meminjam sebelumnya), ini sekarang menjadi seperti mengurangkan 1 dari 10, yang mana hasilnya adalah 1. - Akhirnya, kita mengurangkan 0 dari 0 pada digit paling kiri dan mendapatkan 0 karena tidak ada lagi borrowing yang terjadi. Namun, hasil pengurangan berikut menunjukkan hasil negatif, dikarenakan bilangan yang lebih kecil dikurangkan dari yang lebih besar tanpa melibatkan representasi biner negatif seperti Komplementer 2: \`\`\` 0011 (desimal 3) - 0100 (desimal 4) ------ 1111 (desimal -1 jika diinterpretasikan sebagai representasi Komplementer 2) \`\`\` Namun, jika kita melakukan operasi pengurangan ini menggunakan representasi Komplementer 2, kita akan menemukan bahwa kita perlu mengubah 0100 menjadi representasi negatifnya yang benar terlebih dahulu dengan membalik semua bit dan menambahkan 1. Ini akan berubah menjadi: \`\`\` 0100 (desimal 4) Menjadi negatif sebagai berikut: (~0100) + 1 = 1011 + 1 = 1100 (negatif dari desimal 4 dalam Komplementer 2) \`\`\` Kemudian Anda akan menjumlahkan 0011 dengan 1100 untuk mendapatkan nilai pengurangan yang benar: \`\`\` 0011 + 1100 ------ 1111 (Hasil akhir yang benar untuk 3-4 dalam representasi Komplementer 2) \`\`\` Jadi, pengurangan biner memerlukan proses tambahan dari \\"borrowing\\" jika digit yang sedang dikurangkan itu lebih besar dari pada digit yang mengurangkannya, dan dalam kasus hasil negatif, menggunakan representasi Komplementer 2 untuk menemukan nilai negatif yang sesuai."},{"instruction":"merupakan bagian penutup iklan, umumnya berupa identitas perusahaan dan terletak dibagian bawah.

Penyatuan objek gambar akan lebih memperindah dan lebih menampakkan maksud gambar itu sendiri.","output":"Konsep yang Anda jelaskan mengacu pada prinsip \\"Komposisi\\" dalam seni dan desain. Komposisi adalah cara elemen-elemen seni (seperti garis, bentuk, warna, tekstur, ruang) disusun atau diletakkan dalam suatu karya, baik yang bersifat dua dimensi seperti lukisan dan gambar, maupun tiga dimensi seperti patung dan desain produk. Komposisi yang baik mengarahkan mata pemirsa melalui karya seni, menciptakan fokus visual, berkomunikasi secara efektif dengan audiens, dan menonjolkan elemen atau ide penting dalam gambar. Beberapa prinsip dan elemen penting dalam menciptakan komposisi yang efektif meliputi: 1. **Keseimbangan**: Menyeimbangkan elemen berat dan ringan dalam gambar untuk menciptakan stabilitas visual. Keseimbangan bisa bersifat simetris atau asimetris. 2. **Kontras**: Menggunakan perbedaan dalam nilai, warna, ukuran, atau bentuk untuk menarik perhatian dan menonjolkan aspek tertentu dalam karya. 3. **Penekanan dan Fokus**: Menentukan sebuah pusat perhatian dalam gambar yang menarik mata pemirsa dan umumnya merupakan 'bintang' dari karya tersebut. 4. **Kesatuan dan Harmoni**: Memastikan semua bagian dari karya seni bekerja bersama untuk menyampaikan pemahaman yang seragam atau tema yang koheren. 5. **Arah dan Gerakan**: Mengatur elemen sehingga mengarahkan mata pemirsa melalui gambar atau menciptakan ilusi gerakan. 6. **Ritme dan Pola**: Menggunakan repetisi atau irama dari elemen tertentu untuk menciptakan keteraturan atau struktur dalam karya. 7. **Proporsi dan Skala**: Mengatur ukuran relative elemen terhadap satu sama lain untuk mencapai efek yang diinginkan.

Gambar yang hendaknya sesuai dengan keadaan yang sebenarnya, yaitu gambar yang dekat kelihatan besar dan sebaliknya. Answer 3 Question 13","output":"Konsep yang Anda bicarakan adalah \\"Perspektif\\". Perspektif dalam menggambar merupakan prinsip atau kaidah yang mengatur cara objek dilihat melalui ruang dan jarak. Perspektif adalah metode yang digunakan untuk menciptakan ilusi kedalaman dan volume pada permukaan datar, seperti kertas atau kanvas. Dalam perspektif, objek yang lebih dekat dengan pengamat akan terlihat lebih besar, sementara objek yang lebih jauh akan terlihat lebih kecil. Perspektif memungkinkan seniman untuk menggambarkan bentuk secara realistis seolah-olah ruang tiga-dimensi direplikasi pada bidang dua-dimensi. Ada beberapa jenis perspektif yang umum digunakan dalam seni termasuk: 1. **Perspektif Satu Titik**: Ini menggunakan satu titik lenyap di mana semua garis paralel objek konvergen. Biasanya digunakan untuk gambar yang memiliki orientasi langsung ke arah pengamat, seperti melihat jalanan lurus atau ruangan dari salah satu ujungnya. 2. **Perspektif Dua Titik**: Ini menggunakan dua titik lenyap, sering ditempatkan di luar bingkai gambar. Garis paralel dari objek akan konvergen ke dua titik lenyap ini yang biasanya satu dari kiri dan satu lagi dari kanan. Ini sering digunakan untuk menggambarkan sudut bangunan. 3. **Perspektif Tiga Titik**: Di sini digunakan tiga titik lenyap. Selain dua titik di cakrawala, titik ketiga biasanya digunakan untuk mengatur perspektif menurun atau menanjak. Ini sering digunakan untuk menggambarkan objek yang dilihat dari atas ke bawah atau sebaliknya, seperti menara tinggi atau gedung pencakar langit. Penerapan perspektif yang tepat dalam sebuah gambar bisa sangat meningkatkan realisme dan memberikan kesan ruang serta dimensi, membuat gambar sesuai dengan pengalaman visual sehari-hari kita terhadap dunia nyata."},{"instruction":"Dalam menggambar bentuk, peranan bayang-bayang akan sangat menentukan untuk terciptanya kesan tiga dimensi. Meskipun agak samar-samar, bayang bayang harus ada.","output":"Dalam seni dan desin, peranan bayangan sangat penting untuk menciptakan kesan tiga dimensi pada sebuah gambar dua dimensi. Bayangan menambah kedalaman dan volume pada objek yang digambar, memberikan informasi visual tentang bentuk, ukuran, posisi, dan tekstur suatu benda. Bayangan biasanya digambarkan lebih gelap daripada bagian yang terkena cahaya, dan melembut karena menjauhi sumber cahaya. Ada beberapa jenis bayangan yang berperan dalam menggambar bentuk untuk menghasilkan efek tiga dimensi, termasuk: 1. **Bayangan Lokal**: Ini adalah warna asli benda sebagaimana muncul tanpa cahaya terang atau bayangan gelap yang memengaruhi. Itu memberikan indikasi material dan tekstur objek tersebut. 2. **Highlight**: Ini adalah area di mana cahaya langsung terang menimpa benda, memberikan indikasi sumber cahaya dan bentuk yang menonjol dari objek tersebut. 3. **Core Shadow (Bayangan Inti)**: Ini adalah area gelap yang terbentuk di sisi objek yang berlawanan dari arah cahaya, memberikan volume dan kedalaman ke objek tersebut. 4. **Reflected Light (Cahaya Pantul)**: Ini adalah cahaya yang dipantulkan dari permukaan lain dan mendarat pada sisi objek yang tidak terkena cahaya langsung, sering kali menerangi bagian dari bayangan inti. 5. **Cast Shadow (Bayangan Lembayung)**: Bayangan yang dilemparkan oleh objek pada permukaan lain atau pada bagian dari objek itu sendiri. Bentuk dan ukuran dari bayangan lembayung bergantung pada bentuk benda dan sudut sumber cahaya. Untuk menciptakan efek tiga dimensi yang realistis, penting untuk memperhatikan sifat-sifat cahaya dan cara ia berinteraksi dengan objek serta permukaan sekitarnya. Penempatan bayangan yang akurat dan penggunaan nilai-nilai gelap yang bervariasi akan meningkatkan kedalaman visual dan kesan realisme dalam sebuah gambar. Elemen ini, ketika dilakukan dengan benar, sangat berkontribusi pada keseluruhan komposisi dan keberhasilan sebuah karya seni."},{"instruction":"Benda akan terlihat oleh mata kita bila terkena cahaya.

Ini dikenal sebagai \\"highlight\\" dan sering diterapkan dalam seni untuk menunjukkan area yang menonjol, bentuk permukaan yang bulat, dan tekstur. 2. **Bayangan Lokal**: Bagian objek yang tidak langsung terkena cahaya atau yang menerima sedikit cahaya tetap akan terlihat lebih gelap. Bayangan ini menambah kedalaman dan bentuk pada objek dengan menciptakan kesan volume. 3. **Bayangan Lembayung (Cast Shadow)**: Sisi lainnya dari objek, yang berlawanan dari sumber cahaya, akan terhalang dari cahaya dan akan menciptakan bayangan pada permukaan lain atau di sekitar objek itu sendiri. Bagaimana cahaya memantul dan menyebabkan bagian-bagian yang berbeda dari suatu objek terlihat berbeda dalam hal kecerahan sangat penting untuk realistic rendering dalam menggambar dan melukis. Artistik penanganan penerangan dan bayangan ini membantu untuk menciptakan ilusi bentuk tiga dimensinya pada bidang datar kanvas atau kertas dan berkontribusi pada keseluruhan feel atau mood dari sebuah karya seni. Pemahaman yang baik tentang cahaya adalah kunci untuk menggambar objek secara realistis dan percaya diri, dan ini termasuk tidak hanya mengidentifikasi mana bagian yang terang dan Gelap, tapi juga memperhatikan bagaimana cahaya bergradasi antara daerah-daerah ini, serta kualitas bayangan yang ditimbulkan oleh sifat-sifat fisik dari cahaya dan objek yang diterangi."},{"instruction":"Jelaskan perbedaan proses operasi penjumlahan dan pengurangan pada bilangan berikut. 001 + 010 0011 - 0100 Answer text Question 5","output":"Untuk menjelaskan proses operasi penjumlahan dan pengurangan pada bilangan di atas, kita harus terlebih dahulu mengidentifikasi bahwa bilangan tersebut merupakan bilangan biner (basis 2), karena terdiri dari angka 0 dan 1 saja. **Proses Penjumlahan (001 + 010):** Mari kita lakukan penjumlahan biner langkah demi langkah. \`\`\` 001 + 010 ----- 011 \`\`\` 1. Mulai dari digit paling kanan (bit least significant), 1 + 0 menghasilkan 1. 2. Pindah ke digit berikutnya ke kiri, 0 + 1 kembali menghasilkan 1. 3. Tidak ada carry-over karena tidak ada digit yang ketika dijumlahkan menghasilkan nilai 2 atau lebih, karena ini adalah sistem bilangan biner dan kita hanya berurusan dengan 0 dan 1. Hasil akhir untuk penjumlahan biner 001 + 010 adalah 011. **Proses Pengurangan (0011 - 0100):** Sekarang kita akan melihat proses pengurangan biner langkah demi langkah. \`\`\` 0011 - 0100 ------ \`\`\` 1. Mulai dari digit paling kanan (bit least significant), kita tidak bisa mengurangkan 0 dari 1 karena 0 lebih kecil dari 1, jadi kita perlu \\"meminjam\\" dari digit sebelah kirinya (seperti dalam pengurangan desimal). 2. Setelah \\"meminjam\\", 1 yang kita ingin kurangi sebenarnya menjadi 11 (dalam biner), dikurangi 0 sama dengan 1. 3. Sekarang, karena kita telah meminjam dari digit kedua sebelah kanan, digit itu sekarang 0 (1 sebelumnya yang telah dipinjamkan). 4. Pada digit kedua dari kanan, kita tidak bisa mengurangkan 1 dari 0, sehingga kita perlu meminjam lagi, kali ini dari digit ketiga sebelah kanan, yang menjadikannya 10 (dalam biner). 5. Mengurangkan 1 dari 10 (biner) menghasilkan 1. 6. Kita bergerak ke digit ketiga dari kanan, yang telah kita pinjamkan, jadi sekarang ini 0. Mengurangkan 0 dari 0 tetap 0. 7. Digit paling kiri adalah 0 dalam bilangan yang kita kurangkan dan tidak memengaruhi hasil akhir karena tidak ada yang perlu dikurangkan darinya. Hasil akhir untuk pengurangan biner 0011 - 0100 adalah 1111. Namun, jika Anda melakukan proses pengurangan dengan benar, hasil sebenarnya adalah: \`\`\` 0011 - 0100 ------ -0011 \`\`\` Terlihat bahwa kita mendapatkan hasil negatif, karena bilangan yang dikurangkan lebih besar dari bilangan yang dikurangi. Untuk mengatasi hal ini, kita biasanya menggunakan metode Komplemen Dua untuk melakukan pengurangan pada sistem komputer. Namun, untuk pertanyaan ini, cukup dijelaskan bahwa 0011 lebih kecil dari 0100, sehingga hasil pengurangannya akan negatif dalam sistem bilangan biner, dan akan ditunjukkan sebagai -0011 jika diinterpretasikan dalam sistem nilai signed. Apakah dengan \\"Answer text Question 5\\" Anda berarti ingin jawaban untuk pertanyaan kelima dalam bentuk teks? Jika demikian, jawaban di atas adalah penjelasan untuk operasi penjumlahan dan pengurangan yang Anda tanyakan.

Oto kilka wskazówek, jak to zrobić: 1. Użycie bloków kodu: Jeśli chcesz zamieścić kod, przydatne może być użycie potrójnych cudzysłowów w językach takich jak Markdown, które pomagają utrzymać formatowanie kodu. Na przykład: \`\`\`python def function(arg): # kod tutaj return result \`\`\` Usuń plecki () przed użyciem tego - dodałem je tylko po to, aby uniknąć uruchomienia formatowania. Bez pleców, powyższe powinno wyglądać tak: \`\`\`python def function(arg): # kod tutaj return result \`\`\` 2. Wyróżnianie zmiennej lub krótkiego fragmentu kodu: Możesz ująć pojedyncze zmienne lub krótkie instrukcje w pojedyncze wsteczne apostrofy (\`), aby zaznaczyć, że jest to kod, na przykład: \`variable_name\`. Pamiętaj też, aby podać język programowania, aby był jasny kontekst analizy. Formatowanie pomoże w utrzymaniu struktury kodu i sprawi, że będzie on łatwiejszy do zrozumienia i analizy.

Zazwyczaj komunikator lub interfejs API przewiduje pewną maksymalną liczbę znaków na jedno zapytanie. Dla usług OpenAI, w tym dla chatbota jakim jestem ja, istnieje limit długości wiadomości, który wynosi zazwyczaj około 2048 tokenów — łącznie dla zapytań i odpowiedzi. Tokeny mogą być pojedynczymi słowami, częściami słów, znakami interpunkcyjnymi lub pojedynczymi znakami, w zależności od języka i tekstu. W przypadku kodu programowania, jedna linia kodu zazwyczaj zawiera kilka tokenów. Dlatego, jeśli Twój kod jest bardzo długi, może być konieczne podzielenie go na mniejsze fragmenty i przesłanie ich w kilku wiadomościach. Kiedy będziesz chciał, abym przeanalizował fragment kodu, najlepiej jest zawrzeć najbardziej istotne części, które sprawiają Ci problem lub które chcesz lepiej zrozumieć.

Jeśli jednak piszesz o 128K tokenów, co sugeruje 128 000 tokenów, to jest to dużo większa ilość, która mogłaby stanowić średnio około 100 000 do 200 000 słów w zależności od kontekstu i języka. W kontekście kodu programistycznego, to mogłoby być równoważne setkom stron kodu. Warto pamiętać, że w praktycznym zastosowaniu, czatboty, takie jak ten, zwykle mają znacznie mniejsze limity długości wiadomości, które wynoszą około 2048 tokenów na wiadomość. Przykład dla orientacyjnej konwersji: - 1 słowo = średnio 1-2 tokeny (w języku naturalnym). - 1 linia kodu = zależy od języka programowania, ale może być od kilku do kilkunastu tokenów.

If the rate is low, the technical team would investigate issues like file size limitations, network problems, or server-side errors. 2. **Error Rates**: - Measurement: This involves categorizing the different types of errors (e.g., server timeouts, file corruption, authentication errors) and calculating their frequency relative to the total number of uploads. - Application: If certain errors are more frequent, efforts can be targeted to reduce those specific incidents. For instance, increasing server capacity might reduce timeout errors. 3. **Time to Upload (Latency)**: - Measurement: This is typically measured using timestamps from the start of the upload process until the photo is confirmed as uploaded on the server. It’s often useful to segment this metric by file size to gauge performance more accurately. - Application: A noticeable increase in latency could trigger an investigation into network performance or server processing time, leading to potential infrastructure upgrades. 4. **System Throughput**: - Measurement: The total number of photos uploaded over a specific period (e.g., per hour or per day) without service degradation. - Application: SnapMemories may conduct load testing to determine the maximum throughput the system can handle to plan for scalable infrastructure that meets user demand. 5. **User Engagement**: - Measurement: This can include metrics such as the frequency of uploads per user, the average number of photos per upload, and the repeat usage rate of the upload feature. - Application: If engagement decreases, SnapMemories might survey users or conduct usability testing to identify friction points in the upload process. 6. **Retention Rate**: - Measurement: The percentage of users who return to use the upload feature within a given timeframe after their initial use. - Application: SnapMemories can use this data to tailor user onboarding and retention programs, such as email reminders or incentives for frequent uploading. 7. **Resource Utilization**: - Measurement: Metrics such as Central Processing Unit (CPU) usage, memory use, bandwidth, and data storage are monitored to gauge how efficiently resources are utilized. - Application: Monitoring these metrics helps SnapMemories prevent service disruptions and plan for upgrades to support user growth. 8. **Customer Satisfaction**: - Measurement: Typically assessed through user surveys, net promoter score (NPS), or user feedback mechanisms provided within the app or website. - Application: User feedback can highlight areas for improvement, and high satisfaction scores can validate recent feature updates or performance optimizations. 9. **Mobile vs. Desktop Uploading Trends**: - Measurement: This may involve analytics tools that segment upload data by device type, tracking the number of uploads from each platform. - Application: SnapMemories can use this data to optimize the user experience for the most popular platforms and ensure feature parity where necessary. 10. **Peak Load Performance**: - Measurement: Determining the maximum number of users that can upload photos simultaneously before the system's performance begins to degrade, typically tested through stress testing. - Application: This informs SnapMemories about the need for scalable infrastructure to handle anticipated surges in traffic, such as during special events or promotions. 11. **Compliance and Security**: - Measurement: Regular audits, penetration tests, and compliance checks are performed to ensure the photo upload process aligns with legal and security standards. - Application: Findings can lead to immediate actions to mitigate risks, and compliance adherence can be an important selling point for users who are privacy and security-conscious. 12. **Conversion Rate**: - Measurement: The number of users completing a desired action (e.g., sharing, ordering prints) after uploading a photo, divided by the total number of uploads. - Application: Understanding this rate helps SnapMemories to refine its engagement strategies and potentially increase revenue through targeted offers and improved calls-to-action post-upload. 13. **Recovery Time**: - Measurement: The time it takes for the service to return to full functionality following an unplanned outage or failure. - Application: By measuring and minimizing recovery time, SnapMemories ensures high availability and builds user trust in the reliability of the service. In practice, each of these KPIs could be tracked through a combination of analytics platforms, custom logging, user surveys, and operational monitoring tools. Continuous monitoring and analysis of these metrics enable SnapMemories to make informed decisions that enhance the service's performance and user satisfaction."},{"instruction":"I need you give a more detailed answer when you first answer the question.","output":"I apologize for any confusion earlier. Let me provide a more detailed explanation of each KPI for a photo upload application like SnapMemories, complete with example use cases for clarity. 1. **Upload Success Rate**: - Measurement: It's calculated by taking the number of successfully completed uploads and dividing it by the total number of upload attempts within a given time frame. - Use Case: Suppose in a week, SnapMemories records 5,000 attempted uploads, but only 4,900 succeed. The upload success rate would be (4,900 successful / 5,000 attempts) × 100 = 98%. If the success rate drops below a predetermined threshold, it might indicate a problem that needs to be addressed, such as server issues or a bug in the upload code. 2. **Error Rates**: - Measurement: Error rates are typically measured by categorizing and counting the instances of different types of errors (like server errors, client errors, timeouts) during the photo upload process. - Use Case: If SnapMemories sees a spike in timeouts, they might examine server performance or user network issues as potential causes. If a considerable number of users are receiving file format errors, SnapMemories might consider adding more explicit instructions or automatic image format conversions to reduce this category of errors. 3. **Time to Upload (Latency)**: - Measurement: This metric is the average time taken from the moment a user begins the upload process until the photo is completely uploaded and available on the platform. This would often be measured in seconds. - Use Case: If SnapMemories finds that the upload latency is increasing over time, they could analyze whether the issue is related to the user's network speed, server processing time, or perhaps inadequate scaling for high-resolution image files. 4. **System Throughput**: - Measurement: System throughput is the number of units of work that can be handled per unit of time by the system. For SnapMemories, this could be measured as the number of photos processed per minute. - Use Case: During promotional campaigns where photo uploads increase, SnapMemories monitors to ensure the throughput meets demand. If throughput falls short, they might scale their server resources or optimize their code to handle a greater load. 5. **User Engagement**: - Measurement: Engagement can be measured in various ways including average number of photos uploaded per user, frequency of uploads, and time spent in the upload interface. - Use Case: If SnapMemories introduces a new feature that allows easier photo uploads and sees an increase in the average number of photos uploaded per session, they could infer that the new feature enhances user engagement. 6. **Retention Rate**: - Measurement: Retention measures the percentage of users who continue to use the application over time, which often involves tracking users over days, weeks, and months post-initial sign-up. - Use Case: If SnapMemories implements a new tutorial for first-time users and then sees an increase in the percentage of those users who return after a month, they could conclude that the tutorial has a positive effect on user retention. 7. **Resource Utilization**: - Measurement: Examines how effectively the application utilizes computational resources such as CPU, memory, and bandwidth. - Use Case: If SnapMemories observes that resource utilization spikes to 90% during peak hours, they might decide to add additional servers or optimize their current resources for better efficiency. 8. **Customer Satisfaction**: - Measurement: Through surveys and user feedback tools, SnapMemories can obtain a qualitative measure of how users feel about the upload process. - Use Case: If recent updates correlate with an increase in satisfaction scores, SnapMemories can deduce that the changes positively impacted the user experience. 9. **Mobile vs. Desktop Uploading Trends**: - Measurement: SnapMemories can track and compare the number of uploads from mobile devices versus desktop computers. - Use Case: If mobile uploads surpass desktop uploads, SnapMemories might allocate more resources to improve the mobile interface and ensure it's fully optimized. 10. **Peak Load Performance**: - Measurement: SnapMemories identifies how well the upload system functions during periods of maximum usage. - Use Case: If performance deteriorates at peak times, this could indicate that SnapMemories needs better infrastructure or more efficient distribution of load across its servers. 11. **Compliance and Security**: - Measurement: Regular checks to ensure adherence to data protection laws like GDPR, HIPAA, etc., and security measures are effective preventing data breaches or unauthorized access. - Use Case: If a security audit reveals vulnerabilities in the upload process, SnapMemories can take immediate action to enhance security measures and thereby build user trust. 12. **Conversion Rate**: - Measurement: The rate at which uploading photos leads to other activities like sharing, commenting, or purchasing related products and services. - Use Case: If a new UI element encourages more users to print their uploaded photos, leading to an increase in the conversion rate, SnapMemories would consider this a successful design change. 13. **Recovery Time**: - Measurement: How quickly the system can recover from a failure is a critical measure, often referred to as Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR). - Use Case: If SnapMemories experiences a service outage and can quickly recover, minimizing downtime, they ensure a better user experience and maintain their reputation for reliability. Note that while these metrics can be measured individually, they often intersect and influence one another, so it's crucial for businesses like SnapMemories to not only monitor them but also understand their interplay for a holistic performance analysis."},{"instruction":"Bacalah teks berikut1) Pembeli : \\"Mas saya ingin beli laptop merek OKE, apakah disini ada?\\"2) Penjual : \\"Ada Mas, ini Mas, ada beberapa pilihan warna.\\"3) Pembeli : \\"Berapa harganya Mas untuk yang warna abu-abu ini?\\"4) Penjual : \\"Semua warna harganya sama,Rp 13.150.000\\"5) Pembeli : \\"Harganya boleh dikurngi Mas?\\"6) Penjual : \\"Pasnya Rp 12.689.000.\\"7) Pembeli : \\"Boleh dikurangi lagi ya, Mas?\\"8) Penjual : \\"Wah, tidak bisa Mas.\\"9) Pembeli : \\"Baiklah Mas, saya beli yang ini.\\"Partisipan dalam teks negosiasi tersebut adalah ...A.PembeliB.Penjual dan PembeliC.Mas dan PembeliD.PenjualE.Mas dan Penjual","output":"Partisipan dalam teks negosiasi tersebut adalah: B.

Wygląda na to, że jest to fragment funkcji napisanej w JavaScript, który służy do normalizowania wartości. \\"Normalizacja\\" to proces dostosowania wartości do pewnego zakresu, zazwyczaj od 0 do 1. Oto, co robi każda część kodu: - \`normalize:\` to nazwa funkcji. - \`function(value, min, max)\` definiuje funkcję z trzema argumentami: \`value\` to wartość, którą chcesz znormalizować, \`min\` to minimalna wartość zakresu, a \`max\` to maksymalna wartość zakresu. - \`return (value - min) / (max - min);\` to właściwe działanie normalizacji. Od wartości, którą chcesz znormalizować, odejmuje się minimalną wartość, a następnie wynik dzieli się przez różnicę między maksymalną wartością a minimalną wartością. Przykładem może być normalizacja wyniku testu, gdzie minimalny wynik to 20, a maksymalny 80. Jeśli ktoś uzyska wynik 40, znormalizowany wynik byłby obliczony następująco: \`\`\` value = 40; min = 20; max = 80; normalize(value, min, max) = (40 - 20) / (80 - 20) = 20 / 60 = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333 \`\`\` W takim przypadku, znormalizowany wynik to około 0.3333, co pasuje do zakresu 0 do 1. Warto zauważyć, że ta funkcja nie zawiera żadnych zabezpieczeń przed wprowadzeniem nieprawidłowych danych, takich jak sytuacja, gdy \`min\` jest równe \`max\`, co spowodowałoby dzielenie przez zero.

Mulai dari bit paling kanan: 1 + 0 = 1 2. Pindah ke bit berikutnya: 0 + 1 = 1 3. Tidak ada carry-over karena penjumlahan setiap pasang bit tidak melebihi 1. Hasil penjumlahan biner tersebut adalah 011, yang setara dengan angka 3 dalam sistem desimal. # Pengurangan (0011 - 0100): \`\`\` 0011 (biner untuk desimal 3) - 0100 (biner untuk desimal 4) ------ \`\`\` Karena kita tidak bisa mengurangkan angka yang lebih besar dari yang lebih kecil dalam sistem biner tanpa melakukan peminjaman (seperti kita lakukan dalam sistem desimal), kita akan menemukan bahwa 3 (0011) lebih kecil daripada 4 (0100), sehingga kita harus menggunakan peminjaman untuk menyelesaikan operasi ini. Namun, secara teoritis, kita melakukan langkah-langkah berikut: 1. Mulai dari bit paling kanan: kita tidak bisa mengurangi 0 dari 1 tanpa peminjaman, jadi kita akan meminjam dari bit selanjutnya. 2. Bit berikutnya 1 (dalam 0011) juga tidak cukup untuk mengurangi 0 dari 0 setelah peminjaman, jadi kita perlu meminjam lagi. Namun, karena kita awalnya tidak dapat melakukan peminjaman karena tidak ada \\"1\\" yang cukup dalam bilangan yang dikurangi (0011), operasi pengurangan ini tidak bisa langsung dilakukan pada bilangan biner dengan cara biasa. Pada komputer, untuk mengurangkan bilangan yang lebih besar dari bilangan yang lebih kecil, kita biasanya menggunakan representasi bilangan negatif seperti Two's Complement untuk melakukan operasi tersebut. Untuk menyelesaikan operasi ini dengan benar, kita mungkin perlu mengonversi angka kedua (bilangan yang dikurangkan) menjadi bentuk Two's Complement dan kemudian menambahkannya ke bilangan pertama, yang akan memberikan hasil negatif yang benar. Intinya adalah proses penjumlahan bekerja dengan menjumlahkan bit setiap posisi dan melanjutkan carry jika ada, sementara proses pengurangan bekerja dengan meminjam dari posisi yang lebih tinggi jika perlu, atau menggunakan representasi khusus untuk bilangan negatif jika bilangan yang dikurangkan lebih besar dari bilangan pengurang."},{"instruction":"Jelaskan perbedaan pendekatan terhadap permasalahan tipografi!","output":"Pendekatan terhadap permasalahan tipografi bisa sangat beragam tergantung pada konteks dan tujuan desain. Berikut adalah beberapa cara pendekatan yang berbeda terhadap permasalahan tipografi: 1. Fungsional vs Artistik: - **Fungsional**: Pendekatan ini fokus pada legibilitas, keterbacaan, dan bagaimana teks memfasilitasi transfer informasi. Desainer yang menggunakan pendekatan fungsional akan memilih font, ukuran huruf, dan spasi yang membuat teks mudah dibaca dan dipahami. - **Artistik**: Pendekatan artistik lebih menekankan pada ekspresi artistik dan estetika visual dari teks itu sendiri, yang mungkin meliputi pemilihan font yang unik, penataan huruf yang kreatif, atau penggunaan teks sebagai elemen desain. 2. Tradisional vs Modern: - **Tradisional**: Pendekatan tradisional cenderung mematuhi aturan dan konvensi tipografi klasik, seperti penggunaan serifs, proporsi teks yang seimbang, dan pemilihan kerning yang hati-hati. - **Modern**: Pendekatan modern sering kali bereksperimen dengan aturan tipografi, mungkin dengan menggunakan font sans-serif yang bersih, tata letak yang dinamis, atau permainan warna teks. 3. Kontekstual vs Universal: - **Kontekstual**: Pendekatan ini memperhatikan konteks spesifik di mana tipografi akan digunakan, misalnya dalam branding, web design, atau publikasi cetak. Desainer mungkin menyesuaikan tipografi secara khusus untuk suatu audiens atau tujuan tertentu. - **Universal**: Melihat tipografi dari sudut pandang universal, dengan mencari solusi yang bisa bekerja dengan baik di berbagai situasi dan media tanpa harus disesuaikan secara detail. 4. Humanis vs Geometris: - **Humanis**: Tipografi humanis mendekati desain dengan sentuhan manusiawi, seperti penggunaan handlettering, tipografi yang terinspirasi dari kaligrafi, atau font yang memiliki variasi ketebalan garis. - **Geometris**: Pendekatan ini menggunakan bentuk-bentuk geometris sebagai dasar dalam desain tipografi, menghasilkan font yang terlihat bersih, konsisten, dan sering kali simetris. 5. Digital vs Cetak: - **Digital**: Pendekatan tipografi digital berfokus pada bagaimana teks ditampilkan di layar. Faktor-faktor seperti resolusi layar, jenis perangkat, dan responsivitas dapat mempengaruhi pilihan font dan spasi. - **Cetak**: Pendekatan untuk teks cetak mempertimbangkan bagaimana tinta menyebar di kertas, jenis kertas yang digunakan, dan metode percetakan yang akan menghasilkan teks yang jelas dan tajam. 6. Detail-Oriented vs Big Picture: - **Detail-Oriented**: Disini, tipografi didekati dari level mikro, dimana perhatian tertumpu pada detail-detail seperti kerning, tracking, leading, dan weights teks. - **Big Picture**: Pendekatan ini memandang tipografi dari level makro, memperhatikan bagaimana teks berkontribusi terhadap keseluruhan komposisi desain dan berkomunikasi dengan elemen-elemen desain lain. Setiap pendekatan tipografi memiliki keunggulan dan kegunaan tersendiri, dan desainer seringkali mengkombinasikan beberapa pendekatan untuk menciptakan solusi desain yang efektif dan sesuai dengan kebutuhan proyek."},{"instruction":"Nirmana tersusun dari beberapa elemen konseptual dan visual menjadi satu kesatuan yang mempunyai nilai keindahan. Sebutkan elemen-elemen yang menyusun nirmana!","output":"Nirmana, yang sering kali diasosiasikan dengan komposisi dalam desain seni dan arsitektur, mencakup pengaturan elemen-elemen visual dalam menciptakan karya yang harmonis dan estetis.
