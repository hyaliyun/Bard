Zheng He (Chinese: Zheng He ; 1371-1433 or 1435) was a Chinese mariner, explorer, diplomat, fleet admiral, and court eunuch during China's early Ming dynasty. He was originally born as Ma He in a Muslim family, later adopted the conferred surname Zheng from Emperor Yongle. Zheng commanded expeditionary voyages to Southeast Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, and East Africa from 1405 to 1433. His larger ships stretched 120 meters or more in length. Ma He was captured by the Ming armies at Yunnan in 1381. General Fu Youde saw Ma He on a road and approached him in order to inquire about the location of the Mongol pretender. Ma He responded defiantly by saying that the Mongol pretender had jumped into a lake. Afterwards, the general took him prisoner. He was castrated before being placed in servitude of the Prince of Yan at age 10, although another source indicates the castration occurred in 1385.  Ma was sent to serve in the household of Zhu Di, the Prince of Yan, who later became the Yongle Emperor. Zhu Di was eleven years older than Ma. Since 1380, the prince had been governing Beiping (later Beijing), which was located near the northern frontier where the hostile Mongol tribes were situated. Ma would spend his early life as a soldier on the northern frontier. He often participated in Zhu Di's military campaigns against the Mongols. On 2 March 1390, Ma accompanied the Prince when he commanded his first expedition, which was a great victory as the Mongol commander Naghachu surrendered as soon as he realized he had fallen for a deception.  Eventually, he would gain the confidence and trust of the prince. Ma was also known as \\"san bao\\" during the time of service in the household of the Prince of Yan. This name was a reference to the Three Jewels (San Bao , triratna) in Buddhism. There is also document saying his name could be San Bao  (lit. \\"Three Protections\\", also pronounced san bao). Ma received a proper education while at Beiping, which he would not have had if he had been placed in the imperial capital Nanjing, as the Hongwu Emperor did not trust eunuchs and believed that it was better to keep them illiterate. Meanwhile, the Hongwu Emperor purged and exterminated many of the original Ming leadership and gave his enfeoffed sons more military authority, especially those in the north like the Prince of Yan. Did he have any children?","output":"No, Zheng He did not have any children. He was castrated when he was young, which means he had a surgery that removed certain parts of his body and made him unable to have children. This was done to him before he became a servant and later a trusted advisor in the court of the Yongle Emperor. So, even though Zheng He was an important explorer and admiral, he did not have a family of his own with children."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In this sentence, the spaces have been added to separate the words, making it easier to read and understand. The sentence talks about two distinct events: 1. Charles moving to Oxford: The historical context of this could be referring to the time when King Charles I of England moved his royal court to Oxford during the English Civil War in the 17th century. Oxford then became his primary base, serving as a center of administration, governance, and military planning. 2. Parliament forming a treaty with the Scots: This could be referring to the \\"Solemn League and Covenant,\\" a treaty established in 1643 between the English Parliament and the Scottish Covenanters during the English Civil War. The treaty aimed at securing Scottish military support against King Charles I in exchange for religious and political concessions, including the establishment of Presbyterianism as the official religion of the Church of England. At the time, the English Civil War had been raging since 1642 and was primarily driven by religious and political differences between King Charles I and the English Parliament. The additional Scottish support provided to the Parliamentarians helped tip the balance in their favor against the Royalists, who were loyal to the King. Thus, the complete and edited sentence now reads: \\"Charles had moved to Oxford while the parliament had formed a treaty with the Scots.\\" The sentence conveys two crucial events during the English Civil War, illustrating how Charles sought to counter the growing power of the Parliamentarians and the strategic alliances they formed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN)  -- Judging by the hysterical reaction in some quarters, to President Obama's handshake with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, or his bow to Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, you would think that America's national security rested solely on body language not sound policy. The presidential handshake between Barack Obama and Hugo Chavez spurred many comments. But just for the record, let's not forget that President George W. Bush kissed and held hands with the same Abdullah after 9/11, while also looking deep into the soul of Vladimir Putin. And a generation earlier, egged on by British Prime Minister \\"Iron Lady\\" Margaret Thatcher, President \\"Tear Down That Wall\\" Ronald Reagan, decided that indeed Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was a man he could do business with: the business of ending the Cold War. While Obama has not managed in 100 days to defeat Islamic militants, usher in a Middle East peace treaty or disarm North Korea, on these and other issues he has laid down some important groundwork. Most importantly, the global polls following his first overseas trip show he has begun restoring America's name and reputation, key ingredients to successful policy making. Even before stepping onto foreign soil, Obama began by ordering the infamous Guantanamo Bay detention center closed, thus returning the United States to upholding the very same rule of law it preaches to other nations. He also has  stated over and over again that \\"America does not torture,\\" thus returning the United States to leading on human rights, not cherry-picking them. To those such as former Vice President Dick Cheney who claim this will make America more vulnerable, even some former Bush administration officials now concede that rigorous but patient above-board interrogation has proven to yield better, more reliable intelligence than a rush to the waterboard. Obama has kept a campaign pledge and given a fixed date for ending the unpopular U.S. war in Iraq. \\"Let me say this as plainly as I can: By August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end,\\" he announced. Yet the perils are clear. Hundreds of Iraqi civilians have been killed in Baghdad and other cities in a surge of sectarian violence since January. The Obama administration and U.S. military leaders are playing it down, blaming the suicide bombings on a few militant cells. That brings back memories of Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld blaming a \\"handful of dead-enders\\" as the original insurgency was getting into full swing. Much work still needs to be done to stabilize Iraq militarily and politically. Drawing down in Iraq means surging in Afghanistan, which along with Pakistan is still viewed as the central front on terror. \\"If the Afghanistan government falls to the Taliban or allows al-Qaeda to go unchallenged,\\" Obama said in March, \\"that country will again be a base for terrorists.\\" So he has ordered 21,000 new U.S. troops there by summer. But for all the talk of more boots on the ground, negotiating with moderate Taliban and beefing up Afghan security forces, danger will persist unless the Afghan people see more of a peace dividend. As Obama himself recognizes, \\"There will be no lasting peace unless we expand spheres of opportunity for the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan.\\"  Watch highlights from Obama's first 100 days ». Dire poverty still stalks the land and people desperate to feed their families will lay an IED for cash if they cannot farm or find a decent paying job. Although the Taliban had less than 8 percent support in Afghanistan at the end of 2007, according to an ABC poll, Afghan public opinion is turning against the U.S.-led coalition partly because of the rising number of civilian casualties as the U.S. military hunts down terrorists with airstrikes. The same is happening in Pakistan. When unmanned drones and other airstrikes target militants but cost many civilian lives, it turns people against the United States. One month ago, President Obama unveiled an Afghan-Pakistan strategy for stabilizing the region, and yet things have gotten so much worse in the weeks since that now he, British officials and other world leaders openly fear the Talibanization of nuclear-armed Pakistan. A furious Pakistan government accuses the United States of sowing panic among the people and insists it's in full control of its country and its nuclear arsenal. But it is hard to overdramatize the danger as this U.S. ally concedes land and appeases the Taliban, then watches as it reneges on a so-called \\"peace deal\\" and rolls ever closer to the capital, Islamabad. On May 6 and 7, Obama will be meeting in Washington with the presidents of Pakistan and Afghanistan. In the fight to deny the militants a tipping point momentum, the military tells me 2009 will be crucial. As for Iran, which even two years ago candidate Obama said would be directly engaged by his administration, there is nothing formal yet between the two sides. After 30 years of enmity, President Obama offered Iran \\"the promise of a new beginning\\" in a Persian New Year video message, and since then has clearly signaled the United States was over regime-change. The Iranian government and leadership have responded in kind, saying they are ready to engage with America if the administration is really committed to changing its Iran policy. However, much of this good will has been over the airwaves and direct or back-channel talks have yet to start. Into this vacuum are stepping all the sundry pro- and anti-Iran interest groups, experts, analysts and nations, with their often-conflicting advice and sometimes confused understanding. Yet it is widely acknowledged that a strategic realignment with Iran would benefit U.S. and regional security and stability. The new Israeli government wants to see no such thing, and wants people to believe it will bomb Iran's nuclear facilities, a belief it fosters with background briefings to journalists in the United States and presumably elsewhere. In an ironic twist, Israel's Arab neighbors are bringing their dire warnings about Iran to the White House. Meantime, Obama has named a new Middle East Peace envoy, former Sen. George Mitchell, signaling he wants to take negotiations out of the deep freeze and committing to the two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians. Trouble is new Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not signed on to the two-state solution and is trying to fend off this pressure, even suggesting Israel won't engage with the Palestinians until the United States takes care of Iran. Last week, Obama told Jordan's King Abdullah at the White House, \\"My hope would be that over the next several months you start seeing gestures of good faith on all sides.\\" He added, \\"We can't talk forever; at some point, steps have to be taken so that people can see progress on the ground.\\" The president has invited the leaders of Israel, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority to the White House in coming weeks. iReport.com: Grade Obama's first 100 days. The second hundred days in foreign policy will be filled with mini-summits at the White House and major summits abroad -- Russia in July and China sometime later. With all this activity, Obama is clearly shifting the United States away from the \\"isolate and punish\\" policy of his predecessor. He is signaling that clearheaded meetings to discuss issues of mutual concern are better than hiding your head in the sand and hoping they'll go away. So amid the frothing and fulminating over Fidel, Hugo and Mahmoud, remember Nixon went to China. Write highlights for this article.","output":"This article talks about President Obama's actions during his first 100 days in office and how he made efforts to improve America's reputation around the world.

To provide more context, the Majik Mijits was a collaboration between Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane, both legendary musicians in their own rights. Steve Marriott was best known for his work with the bands Small Faces and Humble Pie, while Ronnie Lane was a member of Small Faces and later the Faces, alongside Rod Stewart and Ron Wood. Their friendship and professional connection had a long history, and the formation of Majik Mijits was a noteworthy event for fans of both artists when they reunited in 1981.

The album itself contains a blend of music styles, ranging from classic rock to soul and reflecting the combined talents and tastes of Marriott and Lane. Despite the initial recordings, the album was not released at the time due to lack of record company interest. However, it was eventually released posthumously after both Marriott's and Lane's deaths, providing fans with a glimpse into their unique collaborations.

Here is a goal: To affix fabric onto wood, you can How would you accomplish this goal? Select from: (i). Use zip ties to permanently hold the fabric in place; (ii). Use staples to permanently hold the fabric in place;","output":"I would choose option (ii). Use staples to permanently hold the fabric in place. Here is the step-by-step process and justifications of how to accomplish this goal: 1. Gather materials: To begin this task, you'll need the following materials:    - Wood piece    - Fabric of your choice    - Staple gun or hammer and staples (appropriate size for the fabric and wood)    Justification: A staple gun or hammer and staples are specifically designed to securely attach materials like fabric to surfaces such as wood. They are efficient and widely available tools. 2. Cut fabric to size: Measure and cut the fabric to the desired size, ensuring that it will cover the wood piece completely and have a little extra on all sides for adjustments if needed.    Justification: By cutting the fabric to the appropriate size, you can ensure proper fit and coverage on the wood, minimizing waste and unnecessary bulk. 3. Position fabric on wood: Lay the fabric smoothly and evenly over the wood, ensuring that it is properly aligned, with an equal amount of overhang on each side.    Justification: Proper positioning and alignment will prevent bunching and ensure a neat, professional-looking result. 4. Secure fabric with staples: Begin stapling the fabric to the wood, starting at one corner and working your way along the edges. Keep the fabric taut and straight as you staple, being careful not to pull too tight or it could warp or tear. Secure the other three corners, leaving space to tuck and fold the fabric at each one.    Justification: Staples are a simple, permanent solution for attaching fabric to wood. They are strong and easily applied with a staple gun or hammer, ensuring that the fabric will remain in place. 5. Fold and tuck corners: At each corner, fold and tuck the excess fabric neatly, resembling a hospital corner in bed-making. Staple these corners down to create a clean, polished finish.    Justification: Properly folding and tucking the corners will provide a neater appearance and prevent the fabric from unraveling or coming loose at the edges. 6. Inspect and tidy up: After stapling, inspect your work to ensure that the fabric is smoothly and securely attached to the wood. Remove any stray staples, trim excess fabric if necessary, and make any adjustments as needed.    Justification: Inspecting and tidying up your work will ensure a professional-looking result and will also confirm the fabric has been securely affixed to the wood. Using staples is a practical and efficient method to permanently hold the fabric in place on wood, providing a secure, neat, and professional-looking result."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Pain & Gain Context: The film opens with Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) running from large numbers of heavily armed policemen, only to be hit by a police cruiser. Then the story goes back in time a few months. Lugo is a schemer and recently released convict, who served time for Medicare fraud. Sun Gym owner John Mese (Rob Corddry) hires him to increase membership and make the gym more fitness based. Lugo triples the gym's membership within three months and befriends trainer Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie). Doorbal, a bodybuilder, uses steroids, which render him impotent. Lugo soon lusts after the earnings and lifestyle achieved by a new gym member he begins to train: Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub), who Lugo believes is a crook. Inspired by motivational speaker Johnny Wu (Ken Jeong), Lugo decides to be a \\"doer\\" and hatches a plan to extort Kershaw for his assets by kidnapping and torturing him.Lugo recruits accomplices Doorbal and Paul Doyle (Dwayne Johnson), a recently released cocaine-addicted convict who has turned to religion. Though Doyle is reluctant to join the team, he soon caves in after a violent altercation with his priest. This \\"Sun Gym gang\\" unsuccessfully attempts to kidnap Kershaw at home, but incapacitate him with a taser outside his deli and take him to a small warehouse he owns (which is stocked with sex toys). The kidnappers disguise their voices, but Kershaw identifies Lugo from his distinctive cologne. The scheme goes as planned otherwise: Kershaw makes calls, under duress, to provide fake explanations for his disappearance, gets his family to move out of state, and signs the documents which transfer his assets to Lugo. Lugo even bribes John Mese to notarize documents in Kershaw's absence, by presenting documents signed by Kershaw and using Kershaw's money to sponsor the Sun Gym.The Sun Gym gang is able to collect Kershaw's money and assets, but they realize releasing him is a bad idea. Therefore, Lugo concocts a plan to kill Kershaw by forcing him to drink liquor and crash his BMW, making it look like a drunken... A:","output":"In the movie Pain & Gain, Adrian Doorbal, played by Anthony Mackie, is rendered impotent primarily due to his use of anabolic steroids. Steroids are synthetic substances that resemble the male hormone testosterone, which is commonly used by athletes and bodybuilders to improve performance and enhance muscle growth. However, the abuse of anabolic steroids can cause a range of side effects, including impotence. Impotence, or erectile dysfunction, refers to the inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse. This condition can be caused by various factors, including physical and psychological problems. In Doorbal's case, the use of anabolic steroids is the main cause of his impotence. Steroids can lead to impotence by disrupting the normal hormonal balance in the body. When a person takes anabolic steroids, their body interprets the increased levels of synthetic hormones as a sign to stop producing testosterone, which is essential for maintaining normal sexual function. The suppression of natural testosterone production can lead to testicular shrinkage, decreased sperm production, and impotence. Furthermore, the use of anabolic steroids has also been associated with additional side effects that may have a negative impact on a person's sexual health, including reduced libido, mood swings, anxiety, and depression. These psychological side effects can further exacerbate the issue of impotence. In summary, Adrian Doorbal's impotence in the movie Pain & Gain can be attributed to his misuse of anabolic steroids. The physical and psychological side effects of steroids combined to contribute to Doorbal's inability to maintain an erection, which plays a significant role in his character's overall storyline and motivations throughout the film."},{"instruction":"Given the question: - imagesize is 200px    - death place is woodland hills , california , u.s.    - caption is from 1948 -rrb- the trailer for '' the search '' -lrb-    - birth name is wendell reid corey    - death date is 8 november 1968    - spouse is alice wiley -lrb- 1939-1968 -rrb- -lrb- his death -rrb-    - office is santa monica city council      - term end is november 8 , 1968    - birth date is 20 march 1914    - term start is 1965      - occupation is actor/politician    - image is wendell corey in the search trailer.jpg    - birth place is dracut , massachusetts , u.s.    - religion is congregationalist    - yearsactive is 1942 -- 68    Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"Yes, both questions are inquiring about the same information. The first question, \\"What is the dark web?\\" is written in correct English, while the second question, \\"Wat is the dark web?\\" seems like a typo. Regardless, both intend to gather information about the dark web. Now, let me provide you with a detailed answer about the dark web. The dark web is a part of the internet that is not indexed by traditional search engines and requires the use of specific software, configurations, or authorization to access. It is a subset of a larger part of the internet called the deep web, which consists of all the web pages, files, and documents that are not indexed by standard search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo. The difference between the dark web and the deep web is that the dark web is intentionally hidden and used for a variety of purposes, both legal and illegal. The dark web is often associated with illegal activities such as the sale of drugs, weapons, fake documents, counterfeit currency, and other illicit goods and services. It is also known to host forums for hacking, cybercrime, and other forms of computer-based illegal activities. The anonymity provided by the dark web attracts people who want to partake in these activities without being traced or monitored. One of the reasons the dark web remains hidden and anonymous is because it operates on specific networks that grant users increased security and privacy. The most well-known of these networks is the Tor network. Tor, or The Onion Router, is a free, open-source software that allows users to browse the internet without revealing their identity or location. It does this by routing data through multiple layers of encryption and a series of volunteer-operated relays, making it difficult to trace the source of the data. Despite its notorious reputation, the dark web is not exclusively used for illegal activities. It also serves as a platform for whistleblowers, journalists, and individuals living under oppressive regimes to communicate and share information without the fear of surveillance or retribution. Legal websites also operate on the dark web, including libraries, forums for discussing privacy concerns, and secure email services. In conclusion, the dark web is a part of the internet that is intentionally hidden from standard search engines, and it requires specific software or configurations to access. While it is known for hosting illegal activities, it also has legitimate uses for privacy-seeking individuals.

Please answer the following question: Two sexually active men are currently at the doctor getting checked for sexually transmitted diseases. Before performing the actual tests, the doctor takes a brief physical examination of the men. The doctor notices that Jake's heart is beating irregularly and his arm appears to have a rash on it. While examining Scully, the doctor takes note of how yellow Scully's eyes are, and Scully also reports to the doctor that he has been throwing up lately. After the physical, the doctor has the men both pee into a cup so that he can run a standard STD test for them.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Does Scully have a higher or lower chance than Jake of contracting liver cancer? Answer:","output":"Based on the limited information provided in the paragraph, it can be inferred that Scully has a higher risk of contracting liver cancer compared to Jake. Liver cancer is typically secondary to a different health condition affecting the liver such as hepatitis or cirrhosis. Verging away from the sexual health context of their visit, there are several indicative signs concerning Scully's overall health that could indicate a possible liver issue, a condition that could potentially increase the risk of developing liver cancer. First, Scully's yellow eyes suggest that he might be suffering from jaundice, a condition characterized by the yellowing of skin and whites of the eyes due to high bilirubin levels in the bloodstream. This condition generally results from liver diseases, particularly cirrhosis and hepatitis, which are also leading causes of liver cancer. Second, Scully reports that he has been vomiting lately. Vomiting can be a symptom of several illnesses, but when coupled with jaundice, can indicate a liver condition. It is specifically a symptom of liver cancer when it occurs with nausea.  However, this information should be treated cautiously as it is based on limited data. Symptoms alone are not definitive proof of liver cancer or any other condition, and these symptoms can be indicative of a number of other health issues that aren't related to liver disease or liver cancer. Moreover, it is impossible to determine the exact risk of contracting liver cancer without taking into account several other factors such as BMI, alcohol consumption, family history of liver diseases or liver cancer, age, race, gender, and exposure to certain carcinogens. As for Jake, his irregular heartbeat and the rash on his arm mentioned in the paragraph are not typically associated with liver cancer, so assuming no other factors, it can be argued that his risk of liver cancer may be less than Scully's based on the provided information. However, all of the above should be thoroughly investigated by their healthcare provider who can provide a comprehensive examination, request further appropriate tests, and provide expert diagnostic conclusion. The above answer should not replace professional medical advice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Which boy hit puberty later than the other, Jeff or Jeremy?  Jeff and Jeremy were neighbors and best friends since kindergarten. They always enjoyed the same hobbies and did everything together. When puberty hit, Jeff was growing much taller than Jeremy. Jeremy's parents were worried about him because he was not growing and was the shortest boy in their class so they took him to the doctor to have his hormones tested. The boys wanted to play a team sport together and had to choose between basketball and soccer.  Hint: Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years.

Judge told court it was a 'cry for help' and suspended sentence because 'you love your son'","output":"Title: A Mother's Cry for Help: Rachael Thompson's Case Sheds Light on the Complex World of Maternal Mental Health In today's fast-paced society, new parents are constantly facing challenges. While many parents strive to provide the best for their children, some may find themselves on the verge of despair – often undiagnosed and untreated. This heart-wrenching tale of a mother who went to the extreme illuminates the pressing need for attention on maternal mental health and support systems. Rachael Thompson, a 40-year-old mother, narrowly escaped jail time after she appeared at Plymouth Crown Court on charges arising from the attempted harm of her four-month-old son. In a bizarre and horrifying turn of events, Thompson had sliced across each heel of her infant using a sharp razor blade – causing deep and painful lacerations. While her actions were incredibly damaging, it was her delay in seeking professional help that raised even more red flags. The hospital staff became increasingly suspicious when it was revealed that Thompson had only sought medical assistance for the baby two days after inflicting the injuries. The desperate mother defended her actions by claiming a razor had accidentally fallen into the baby's bath, causing the injuries to his feet. However, it was evident to the medical experts who examined the child that the wounds had been made deliberately. The case that unfolded in the courtroom tells a story of a mother who was undoubtedly struggling under immense pressure. In delivering the verdict, the presiding judge recognized the calculated nature of the injuries inflicted, but ultimately concluded that Thompson's actions were a \\"cry for help.\\" The judge suspended her sentence, acknowledging that the mother did, in fact, love her son. The case of Rachael Thompson is a stark reminder that maternal mental health issues may often manifest in ways that are difficult to understand. It is essential to identify and provide support to mothers who are in desperate need of help, not only for the physical and emotional well-being of their children but for their own recovery as well. Society must be vigilant in its efforts to prevent incidents like this from happening with an emphasis on early recognition and intervention. As we discuss the importance of maternal mental health, it is crucial to consider the following points: 1. Awareness and education: It is vital to raise awareness about the challenges faced by new parents, specifically emphasizing the need to address mental health concerns. Educating the general public, healthcare professionals, and new parents themselves is essential to ensure the early detection and treatment of these issues. 2. Comprehensive support systems: By developing an extensive support network, mothers experiencing difficulties will have access to the appropriate resources. Family, friends, and healthcare professionals play crucial roles in identifying signs of distress and facilitating the required support. 3. Encouraging open communication: Mothers who feel mentally and emotionally overwhelmed should be encouraged to share their feelings and concerns with trusted individuals. A judgment-free environment will ensure that they can seek help without fear of stigmatization or condemnation. 4. Monitoring healthcare practitioner advice: Healthcare providers must be vigilant in their assessments and recommendations for new parents. Appropriate mental health screenings should be included regularly in postpartum appointments to ensure early detection and intervention. As we continue to raise awareness about the importance of maternal mental health, society must strive to protect children from the devastating effects of untreated mental health issues. Furthermore, we must endeavor to provide the required support to parents like Rachael Thompson, who are caught in this intricate world of overwhelming challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

So, we can rewrite the equation like this, with just one j: 335 * j = 4020 Now we have a simpler equation to solve!  We want to find the value of j, so we need to know how many times we can fit 335 into 4020. To find this out, we can divide 4020 by 335: 4020 ÷ 335 If you do the math, you will find out that j is 12!

The Cod Army are playing in the third tier for the first time in their history after six promotions in nine years and their remarkable ascent shows no sign of slowing with Jamie Proctor and Gareth Evans scoring the goals at Glanford Park. Fleetwood were one of five teams to have won two out of two but the other four clubs - Peterborough, Bristol City, Chesterfield and Crawley - all hit their first stumbling blocks. Posh were defeated 2-1 by Sheffield United, who had lost both of their opening contests.

Article: Nowadays the problem of the generation gap is becoming more and more serious. Poor relationship between parents and their children are very common. Whether we like it or not, our parents are responsible for us at least until we're out of high school. So rather than get upset about that fact, maybe we should focus on some ways to make our relationship better. The best way, in my opinion, is to learn to really communicate with my parents. When I find myself arguing with my mom and dad, I try to stop. If I can manage to stop myself from talking, I usually find that I can calm down quickly. I guess I'm usually acting out of emotion rather than logic . But if I can stop arguing for a minute, it seems that my opinion changes and I start to realize that I'm a bit childish. Emotionally I may still be upset, but logically I understand that yelling  and fighting surely won't make things better. Once I've stopped arguing, I look at my parents in the eye. You'd be amazed at how much easier it is to communicate with your parents when you've actually looking at them. Looking away doesn't do much of anything except for giving them the impression that I'm not listening or that I don't care. It's much easier to see things eye to eye when you're physically seeing them eye to eye. Finally, I listen to what they're saying (or at least I try). Communication can't happen unless both sides hear and listen to each other. There is nothing wrong with my hearing, but that doesn't mean I always listen to the sounds that people are making. When I argue with my parents, I can physically hear what they're saying without mentally listening to it. Whether I admit it or not, my parents' experience can actually help them give me some pretty sound advice at times. I don't always agree with them, but I think it's safe to say that it has truly helped our relationship in the long run. Question: Which of the following advice is NOT mentioned in the passage? Options: A: Looking B: Smiling warmly C: Listening D: Stopping arguing Answer:","output":"B: Smiling warmly"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The game consists of four quarters in which the two teams attempt to score goals by throwing the ball into their opponent's goal. The team with the most goals at the end of the game wins the match. A team consists of 6 field players and one goalkeeper in the water at any one time. Except for the goalkeeper, players participate in both offensive and defensive roles. In addition to this, teams may have substitute field players and substitute goalkeepers who are not in the water. Water polo is typically played in an all-deep pool 7 feet deep and players require stamina and endurance to play the game.  - Claes Arne Borg ( 18 August 1901 -- 7 November 1987 ) was a Swedish swimmer . He is best known for breaking 32 world records and winning five Olympic medals in the 1920s . In 1926 Borg won the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal , shared with Edvin Wide . Next year , at the 1927 European Championships , he set a new world record in the 1500 m at 19:07.2 which stood for nearly 11 years . Besides swimming , Borg also won a European silver medal in water polo in 1926 . His twin brother Åke was also an Olympic medalist in swimming .  - In many team sports which involve scoring goals, the goalkeeper (termed goaltender, netminder, goalie, or keeper in some sports) is a designated player charged with directly preventing the opposing team from scoring by intercepting shots at goal. Such positions exist in hurling, association football, Gaelic football, international rules football, handball, field hockey, ice hockey, water polo, bandy, rink bandy, lacrosse, floorball, and other sports.  - The Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal (but usually simply called Bragdguldet, \\"The Feat Gold\\") is an annual award \\"for the most significant Swedish sports achievement of the year\\". It has been awarded by a jury led by the Swedish morning paper \\"Svenska Dagbladet\\" since 1925. According to its statutes the Medal may be awarded in November or December to either an individual sportsperson or a team. An individual can be awarded the Medal no more than twice, and to receive a second medal, that athlete must be \\"regarded a class of his own\\".  - Svenska Dagbladet (\\"The Swedish Daily News\\"), abbreviated SvD, is a daily newspaper published in Stockholm, Sweden.    What is the relationship between 'arne borg' and 'stockholm'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between 'Arne Borg' and 'Stockholm' is that Arne Borg, a successful Swedish swimmer and water polo player, was originally from Sweden, and Stockholm is the capital city of Sweden. Additionally, Borg was awarded the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal in 1926; this prestigious award is given annually by Svenska Dagbladet, a daily newspaper published in Stockholm.

So, we have a math problem that looks like this: 5973 * b - 450944 = 203 * b - 98974 Now, let's imagine that there are two bags full of building blocks. One bag has 5973 blocks and the other has 203 blocks. We want to see how many blocks (\\"b\\") in total there should be in each bag so that when we compare the difference between the bags, we find the same number of blocks. First, let's move the smaller number of blocks (203 * b) to the left side. We do this by subtracting '203 * b' from both sides like this: 5973 * b - 203 * b - 450944 = -98974 Now, we can combine the two bags of blocks on the left side, like putting all the blocks together in one bag. So, we get: (5973 - 203) * b - 450944 = -98974 This simplifies to: 5770 * b - 450944 = -98974 Now, let's move the extra '-450944' blocks from the left side to the right side so we can see how many blocks must be in each bag. We can do this by adding '450944' to both sides: 5770 * b = 351970 Now, we just need to find out how many blocks (\\"b\\") are in the big bag. To do this, we can divide both sides by the number of blocks on the left side (5770): b = 351970 / 5770 And the final number of blocks (\\"b\\") that we find is: b = 61 So, the solution to this problem is: b = 61"},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Question: how many spanish speaking people are there in the us I found the following answer on Google: Also west of Louisiana Territory was Spanish between 1763 - 1800 (year of the French recovery of territory), after the French and Indian War .

As a well-educated woman, Inez dedicated her life to promoting equality and social justice, becoming a prominent figure during the early 20th century in the United States. In 1913, Inez married Eugene Jan Boissevain, a Dutch businessman and fellow activist. The couple remained married until her untimely death in 1916. Inez Milholland was not only a suffragist and advocate for women's rights, but she was also a skilled orator and a lawyer. Using her background in law, she fought for various social causes like labor rights, world peace, and equality for people of all races and genders. During her short yet impactful life, Inez became a symbol of the women's suffrage movement in America. Her tireless work and spirit inspired many others to join the fight for equal voting rights, earning her a lasting legacy. Unfortunately, Inez passed away at the young age of 30 on November 25, 1916. Her death took place at Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles, California, and was caused by pernicious anemia, a condition where the body cannot properly absorb vitamin B12, leading to severe anemia and various health complications. Inez Milholland's image, captured in a photograph known as \\"Inez Milholland.jpg,\\" serves as a lasting reminder of a woman who dedicated her life to fight for equal rights and social change. Her legacy continues to inspire activists across generations, and she will always be remembered as a trailblazer in the fight for women's rights."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Here's the problem: several of my friends who still live with their parents wish they had places like mine -- so much so that they make mine theirs. It started out with a couple of them spending the weekends with me. But now they seem to take it for granted that they can shou up any time they like. They bring boyfriends over, talk on the phone and stay out forever. I enjoy having my friends here sometimes-- it makes the place feel comfortable and warm-- but this is my home, not a party house. I was old enough to move out on my own, so why can't I seem to ask my friends to respect my privacy ?

The real story behind Princess Diana's early 90s short haircut Many of us are familiar with the—and we hesitate before using this word, but we're going to go ahead with it anyway—iconic 1991 shot of Princess Diana, chin resting on her folded-over hands, wearing a black turtleneck, hair chopped short. And thanks to hairstylist Sam McKnight, who has a new book and exhibition out, we now have some of the backstory about what led to that dramatic stylistic switch. McKnight recounts, to the Daily Mail, that his first time working with the princess was in 1990, when she was brought in to be photographed by Patrick Demarchelier (McKnight had guessed beforehand they'd be photographing Margaret Thatcher when he heard they were \\"shooting someone important for Vogue\\"). For that shoot, he used some hairstyling trickery—\\"using hair grips to tuck her shoulder-length hair under the tiara\\"—to make it look like she had short hair. Related: Remembering Princess Diana's Glamorous Style Diana was evidently quite pleased with the look as, after the shoot, McKnight says that she asked him, \\"What would you do with my hair if I gave you free rein?\\" He responded, \\"I would cut it all off,\\" and, as McKnight puts it, \\"She was convinced immediately.\\" The rest, as they say, was . . . a famous haircut. McKnight explains that it was \\"one of the cuts that women suddenly wanted,\\" as it popped up \\"everywhere—on the High Street, on newsreaders.\\" He hypothesizes that the popularity was related to its contrast to the \\"big 80s hair,\\" representing a \\"sportier, more androgynous look,\\" but one that was \\"still hugely feminine.\\" McKnight went on to work closely with Diana (\\"I saw Diana every week when I was in London\\"). During one meeting with Linda Evangelista and Vogue editor Liz Tilberis, McKnight told them about a shoot he had done earlier in the week with Diana and Demarchelier, and imparted that one picture in particular \\"would make a great Vogue cover.\\" And, yep, you guessed it: it's the black turtleneck shot, which ran as the cover of British Vogue in December 1991. And McKnight shares one final, special detail about the image: \\"She had just stopped biting her nails and was so proud of how they looked.\\" More from Vanity Fair:Kate Middleton's Best Looks of 2016Annie Leibovitz's Intimate Portraits of Queen Elizabeth II and the Royal FamilyPrince Harry's Best Style Moments Photo credit: Julian Parker/UK Press/Getty Images Lady Diana Spencer, later the wife of Prince Charles, on her first birthday at Park House, Sandringham.

Rhinella yunga lives in the Peruvian Andes, specifically in the region known as the Yungas, reports the Guardian. It escapes notice by hanging out on forest floors among dead leaves, and smartly so: The toad not only has the right coloring, it has \\"bony protusions\\" that make it look more leaf-like, reports Nature World News. It turns out that this particular species had been mistakenly lumped in with a cousin toad for years, but Rhinella yunga has something unique going on: It lacks eardrums, reports LiveScience. That doesn't necessarily mean that the toad can't hear or communicate effectively, only that scientists haven't figured out how it does so. For example, this frog also lacks eardrums but manages the nifty trick of hearing through its mouth. Expand this summary.","output":"The recent discovery of a new species of toad, Rhinella Yunga, in the Peruvian Andes has intrigued scientists and sparked interest in the animal's unique features, habitat, and characteristics. The elusive Rhinella Yunga exhibits remarkable camouflage abilities, making it extremely challenging to spot in its natural environment. Its appearance closely resembles a dead leaf, allowing it to blend seamlessly into the forest floor amongst other leaves. This fascinating animal can be found in a specific region of the Peruvian Andes called the Yungas, as reported by the Guardian. The Rhinella Yunga's convincing dead leaf mimicry is achieved through various adaptations. Its distinctive coloring matches that of decaying leaves, and it possesses bony protusions, which give it a more leaf-like texture and appearance. These adaptations have enabled the toad to escape detection by predators and researchers alike. So successful is its camouflage that for many years, Rhinella Yunga was misidentified as a closely related species of toad. Nature World News explains that this misidentification has only been rectified with recent examinations of the toad's unique characteristics. One particularly intriguing feature of the Rhinella Yunga is that it lacks eardrums. This unusual trait raises questions about the toad's ability to hear and communicate. Although the absence of eardrums might initially suggest that the toad is unable to perceive sound or engage in auditory communication, further research is necessary to determine the exact impact of this anatomical peculiarity. LiveScience reports that it is entirely possible that the toad has developed alternative methods for hearing and sound detection which have not yet been identified by scientists. A similar example can be found in a species of frog that has no eardrums but can hear through its mouth. The discovery of Rhinella Yunga highlights the importance of ongoing research and exploration in the natural world. The new species not only adds to our understanding of biodiversity and evolution but also serves as a reminder of the myriad ways in which animals have adapted to their environments to ensure their survival. The Rhinella Yunga's unique appearance, habitat, and characteristics offer valuable opportunities for further study, particularly in the areas of animal camouflage, hearing mechanisms, and communication. This remarkable toad has captured the imagination of the scientific community and the public alike and will likely continue to spark curiosity, admiration, and inquiry for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For now, the acting chair is the Conservative former minister, Tim Loughton (last seen leading Andrea Leadsom's march on Westminster, during the abortive Tory leadership campaign), but under the carve-up which dictates which party has the chairs of which committee, Mr Vaz's long-term replacement must be a Labour MP. Mentioned in dispatches are Chuka Umunna, who has the advantage of having already being a committee member, and of having proved an effective interrogator at evidence sessions. And there is some speculation that the former shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, or possibly another former frontbencher, Caroline Flint, might run - although it is unlikely that they would run against each other. Then there's the small matter of getting elected. Remember that select committee chairs may have to come from a particular party, but they are elected by the whole House of Commons. So if you have three or four candidates from the ranks of Labour MPs, the winner will be the one who appeals most to the Conservatives and, to a lesser extent, the SNP. The same factor weighs heavily in calculations about another plum select committee post in play; the chair of the Brexit Committee, which is expected to be set up to monitor the doings of Brexit Secretary David Davis and his newly-created Department for Exiting the European Union. The assumption is that the Conservatives will not permit Labour to chair such a sensitive committee, but that in turn means that Labour votes could be decisive in choosing which Conservative would then take the chair. And experience suggests they tend to back the candidate they calculate would cause the government the maximum grief. At the moment, the rumour mill suggests former Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt might be a candidate, and two other ex-ministers, Anna Soubry and Nick Herbert are also being mentioned in dispatches. None of them backed \\"Leave\\" in the EU Referendum, although a Brexiteer standard bearer will almost certainly emerge. But if Labour MPs want a Brexit Committee chair who would cause trouble for the government, that line up of candidates provides them with the option. As I write, the details of the Brexit Committee have not been decided (one cunning wheeze would be to allow it to be chaired by the Northern Ireland DUP - guaranteeing a staunch Brexiteer in the chair) and one key issue for the smaller parties is how many members it will have. Most select committees have 11 members, but so important is the subject matter that there is pressure to expand the Brexit Committee to 13, so that the DUP and the Liberal Democrats can be represented on it. Then there's the other new committee, to monitor Liam Fox's new Department for International Trade. The speculation is that this will be chaired by an SNP MP, because Theresa May's abolition of the Department for Energy and Climate Change will, eventually, mean the demise of the DECC Committee, which is one of the two allocated to be chaired by an SNP member. (Incidentally, the DECC Committee is not dead yet; its members are due to depart this weekend on a trip to San Francisco, being sure, no doubt, to wear some flowers in their hair.) There are still some voices murmuring that there's no need to create new committees, perhaps because they could turn some existing committees, particularly Foreign Affairs, into a bit of a backwater. But it does look likely that they will spring into being, with members being elected in late October, or even November. And don't forget that Theresa May created two more vacancies on the Committee corridor, when she promoted Culture Committee Chair Jesse Norman and Science Committee Chair Nicola Blackwood to ministerial office. So an autumnal orgy of electioneering is certain to hit the Commons. This article was about:","output":"The article discusses the potential candidates for chairing select committees in the UK House of Commons, particularly concerning the committees related to Brexit and International Trade.

In week three, Chicago hosted the 2-0 Pittsburgh Steelers, who trailed the all-time series 18-7-1 and had not defeated the Bears since 2005. WBBM-TV writer Jeff Joniak described the Bears as in \\"clean-up mode\\" after a poor performance in Tampa. The battle between the Bears' rushing attack and the Steelers' run defense featured the former averaging just 2.9 yards per carry (27th in the league) taking on a defense that allowed just 74 yards per game and 3.3 yards per carry. Joniak added Chicago's running game should try to make progress on early downs to allow Mike Glennon to succeed against Pittsburgh. Defensively, Joniak wrote the Bears had \\"their hands full\\" as Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was aided by receivers Antonio Brown and Martavis Bryant, running back Le'Veon Bell, and tight end Jesse James. In spite of Pittsburgh's success in contrast with Chicago's struggles, a common belief was that the Steelers would often \\"play down to their competition,\\" one that was spurned in the wake of Glennon's 2014 Buccaneers upsetting the Steelers 27-24. The first two drives of the game ended with punts, but on the Bears' first punt of the game, Steelers returner Eli Rogers muffed the ball and Sherrick McManis recovered. Jordan Howard would score a three-yard touchdown run on the drive. On the Steelers' next drive, Roethlisberger was sacked by Bryce Callahan and fumbled, with Akiem Hicks recovering. The takeaway failed to result in points, however, as Connor Barth missed a 47-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Roethlisberger threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to Brown, which the Bears responded via Glennon's two-yard touchdown pass to Adam Shaheen. On the final play of the first half, Chris Boswell's 35-yard field goal was blocked by McManis into Marcus Cooper's hands. Cooper raced down the field before suddenly slowing down before he reached the end zone, which allowed Pittsburgh's Vance McDonald to knock the ball away at the one-yard line. The ball was then batted out of the end zone, which led to a penalty against the Steelers and an untimed play for the Bears. A false start penalty on Charles Leno Jr. prompted the Bears to instead kick a 24-yard field goal. In the second half, the Bears suffered their first turnover of the game when Howard was stripped by Ryan Shazier; the Steelers took advantage to score on Bell's one-yard touchdown run. A second giveaway occurred when Glennon's pass for Zach Miller was intercepted by J. J. Wilcox, which enabled the Steelers to tie the game on Boswell's 32-yard field goal. The game remained scoreless through the rest of the half, resulting in overtime. After winning the coin toss to start overtime with the ball, the Bears quickly scored on the second play of the series; Tarik Cohen broke through for a 73-yard touchdown run, but was ruled to have stepped out of bounds at the Steelers' 37-yard line. Two plays later, Howard scored the game-winning touchdown on a 19-yard run. In claiming their first victory of the season, the Bears' running backs provided a solid performance, recording a combined 220 yards on the ground - 200 yards more than in week two. The defense also shone, forcing two turnovers after having just one in the first two games. Based on the above article, answer a question.

Context: Eventually, when it was more common for electric recordings to be played back electrically in the 1930s and 1940s, the overall tone was much like listening to a radio of the era. Magnetic pickups became more common and were better designed as time went on, making it possible to improve the damping of spurious resonances. Crystal pickups were also introduced as lower cost alternatives. The dynamic or moving coil microphone was introduced around 1930 and the velocity or ribbon microphone in 1932.

Context: Holometabolism, or complete metamorphosis, is where the insect changes in four stages, an egg or embryo, a larva, a pupa and the adult or imago. In these species, an egg hatches to produce a larva, which is generally worm-like in form. This worm-like form can be one of several varieties: eruciform (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grub-like), campodeiform (elongated, flattened and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) or vermiform (maggot-like). The larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa, a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon. There are three types of pupae: obtect, exarate or coarctate. Obtect pupae are compact, with the legs and other appendages enclosed. Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended. Coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin.:151 Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage, and emerge as adults. Butterflies are a well-known example of insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, although most insects use this life cycle. Some insects have evolved this system to hypermetamorphosis.

Which cousin learned less about primary consumers?  Two cousins were fascinated about food chains in nature. Liam started reading about apex predators, while Fox read about grazers and large herbivores.  Hint: An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or top predator, is a predator at the top of a food chain, with no natural predators.Apex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels. Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). The apex predator concept is applied in wildlife management, conservation and ecotourism.","output":"To answer the question related to the paragraph, let's break down the information provided: - Liam was reading about apex predators. - Apex predators are usually secondary consumers, meaning they eat primary consumers like large herbivores. - Fox read about grazers and large herbivores, which are primary consumers.

Step 2: Compare the main ideas and identify differences. - Differences: Sentence 1 mentions the support in terms of paying bills and hiring bodyguards, while Sentence 2 only mentions paying bills. Additionally, Sentence 1 refers to the person as a \\"preachy idealist\\" and Sentence 2 only as an \\"idealist\\". Step 3: Determine if the main ideas/themes are consistent. - The main theme of both sentences is that someone is able to be an idealist because of support from others in the form of financial assistance (paying bills, hiring bodyguards).  Step 4: Evaluate the relationship between the two sentences. - Given that the main ideas/themes between the two sentences are consistent, we can say that Sentence 2 is a simplified version of Sentence 1 with less specificity (does not mention bodyguards, and does not use \\"preachy\\"). Step 5: Decide if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. - Based on the analysis, the second sentence captures the main theme of the first sentence but is less specific. Therefore, Sentence 2 can be considered entailed by Sentence 1, but it does not capture all the details present in Sentence 1 (specifically about hiring bodyguards and the \\"preachy\\" aspect)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

No. The information provided, \\"The liquor monopoly lasted only from 98 to 81 BC, and the salt and iron monopolies were eventually abolished in early Eastern Han,\\" does not directly address the question, \\"In what year did Huo Guang die?\\" There seems to be no correlation between the two facts presented. Huo Guang was a noteworthy Chinese politician during the Western Han Dynasty. He played a critical role after the death of Emperor Wu, achieving the position of regent to multiple child emperors, and was even granted the title of emperor posthumously by one of them. But his year of death is not connected in any apparent way with the information provided about specific monopolies during certain years. Huo Guang died in the year 68 BC, which we know from historical records. He had an influential political career and historians often credit him for his commitment to maintaining the Western Han dynasty's power and prosperity during times of potential instability. As a regent, Huo Guang was able to manage palace intrigue, navigate complicated political dynamics, and maintain order while serving under several emperors. Huo Guang's influence waned only slightly after his death, as his wife, children, and later his relatives continued to control Han politics until the downfall of the dynasty. But his death in 68 BC marks the end of his personal contribution to this influential period in Chinese history.

First, we have a pretty big number problem. We have 17 times a mystery number (t), and that is supposed to be equal to 46 times the mystery number plus 51 times the mystery number plus 800. So first, we want to add those two \\"times mystery number\\" parts together, the ones on the right side of the equal sign! When you add 46t and 51t together, you get 97t.  Our problem now looks like this: 17 * t = 97 * t + 800 But the \\"t\\" is on both sides of the equal sign. That's a bit pesky! If we want to find out what the mystery number is, we need it to be only on one side. We can do that by subtracting 97t from both sides of our equation. But look, 17 is less than 97, so we will get a negative number on the left side.  When we subtract 97t from 17t, we get -80t. Our equation now looks like this: -80 * t = 800 To solve for \\"t,\\" we need to divide both sides by -80.

As the surfer wearing a wet suit continues to interact with the curious and playful seal, the ocean around them begins to show signs of an approaching set of waves. The two surfers exchange glances, knowing that they cannot miss the opportunity to harness the energy of these beautiful swells. With a brief look of gratitude and appreciation towards their newfound marine friend, the wetsuit-clad surfer decides to seize the moment. Positioning himself perfectly on his surfboard, he starts paddling towards the incoming wave, feeling the adrenaline coursing through his veins. He is determined to make the most of this perfect day in the water. As he begins to match the speed of the wave, he takes one last look over his shoulder at the now seemingly content seal, who seems to understand that his human playmates must return to the game they truly love - riding the waves. With a powerful and practiced motion, the surfer pops up onto his feet, smoothly transitioning onto the face of the wave as it starts to break. The ocean spray engulfs him as he carves his board through the turquoise water, fully immersed in the thrilling experience. The seal, left behind by the surfer's agile movements, watches on with what almost seems to be a knowing smile, appreciating the display of human athletic prowess. While the second surfer waits for the next wave, still awestruck by the amazing encounter with the friendly seal, the moment serves as a humbling reminder of the importance of sharing the wonders of the ocean with all its majestic creatures. Ultimately, this adventure excellently demonstrates the unique relationship we can have with the natural world and the importance of respecting and cherishing these relationships, not just for ourselves but for the mutual benefit of the ecosystems we share. The surfer's farewell to the seal represents the delicate balance between enjoying our time in nature while acknowledging that the environment exists for the coexistence of all its inhabitants."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Shack threatens to kill Cigaret for riding his train for free, who is bragging that he and he alone did it. Shack is distracted when he learns that A-No.1 has posted a notice on the yard water tower, announcing that he will become the first hobo to ride Shack's train all the way to Portland. The other hobos agree that the first who can successfully ride Shack's train will have earned the title \\"Emperor of the North Pole.\\" Railroad workers place bets whether A-No.-1 can do it, spreading the news far and wide over the telegraph, Shack being widely known and disliked. A-No.1 hops the train and does everything he can to steer clear of Shack, pulling a series of pranks with the help of other hobos, such as running Shack's train into a siding and greasing the tracks, almost causing it to crash head on into an oncoming mail train.

Which sample would have lower concentration of hydronium ions, sample A or sample B?  In his chemistry lab David is learning about acids. He took three solutions to identify them correctly, sample A, sample B, and sample C. Sample A is a strong acid; sample B is a weak acid; and sample C is not an acid. David needs to identify the content of each sample by learning about their attributes.  Hint: If a solution has a higher concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, it has a pH lower than 7. A solution with a pH lower than 7 is called an acid . As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases. Therefore, the more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value is. Did you ever taste vinegar? Like other acids, it tastes sour. Stronger acids can be harmful to organisms. For example, stomach acid would eat through the stomach if it were not lined with a layer of mucus. Strong acids can also damage materials, even hard materials such as glass. A:","output":"Sample A would have a lower concentration of hydronium ions compared to sample B. According to the given information, sample A is a strong acid, and sample B is a weak acid.  As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases. Therefore, the more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value is. Strong acids typically have a higher concentration of hydronium ions and thus a lower pH value in comparison to weak acids.

If the soil holding the plant is healthy and biologically diverse, the plant will have a higher chance of surviving stressful conditions.The plant responses to stress are dependent on the tissue or organ affected by the stress. For example, transcriptional responses to stress are tissue or cell specific in roots and are quite different depending on the stress involved.One of the primary responses to abiotic stress such as high salinity is the disruption of the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cell. High concentrations of Na+, for example, can decrease the capacity for the plant to take up water and also alter enzyme and transporter functions. Evolved adaptations to efficiently restore cellular ion homeostasis has led to a wide variety of stress tolerant plants.Facilitation, or the positive interactions between different species of plants, is an intricate web of association in a natural environment. It is how plants work together. In areas of high stress, the level of facilitation is especially high as well. This could possibly be because the plants need a stronger network to survive in a harsher environment, so their interactions between species, such as cross-pollination or mutualistic actions, become more common to cope with the severity of their habitat.Plants also adapt very differently from one another, even from a plant living in the same area. When a group of different plant species was prompted by a variety of different stress signals, such as drought or cold, each plant responded uniquely. Hardly any of the responses were similar, even though the plants had become accustomed to exactly the same home environment.Rice (Oryza sativa) is a classic example. Rice is a staple food throughout the world, especially in China and India. Rice plants experience different types of abiotic stresses, like drought and high salinity. These stress conditions have a negative impact on rice production. Genetic diversity has been studied...  Now, I have a new situation: Two farmers provide a neighboring city with plenty of produce every year. Brick farm has a lot of plant problems, their plants experience abiotic stress. Boulder farm had a good production because their plants presented almost no signs of abiotic stress.  Answer this question please: Which farm has more plants displaying a decreased capacity to take up water?

Portsmouth had been issued with a winding-up petition by HM Revenue and Customs on 3 January, freezing the club's bank accounts. The administrator will be Trevor Birch of PKF, a firm with a track record of dealing with clubs in administration. Portsmouth had asked the court to appoint Andrew Andronikou, who oversaw the club's last administration two years ago, and is currently handling the same process with Pompey's parent company. The administration order enables Portsmouth to access their bank accounts and continue trading while Birch, who was proposed as administrator by HMRC, searches for new owners. In a statement, HMRC said it had been concerned about a possible conflict of interest had Andonikou been appointed. The statement continued: \\"HMRC is pleased that the Court agreed with our view that the creditors of any business have a right to expect that the administrator in these circumstances is completely independent.\\" Mr Birch said he hoped the club's supporters would also be happy to see a new face in charge. \\"The intention is to try and sell the club as a going concern,\\" he said. \\"I'm used to dealing with clubs in crisis. You could say most of the Championship is in crisis, with 30% of clubs paying wages in excess of 100% of their turnover. \\"You have to travel hopefully and confidently. Maybe the new appointment will encourage someone to come out of the woodwork and bid [for the club].\\" During the hearing at the High Court, it was revealed that Portsmouth currently owe around £2m to business creditors, as well as a similar sum to the Inland Revenue in unpaid tax. By going into administration other opportunities will come up for investors, who would have been reluctant to buy the club with a winding-up order hanging over it Among those creditors are fellow football clubs West Bromwich Albion, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Bristol City, as well as the Football League itself. Portsmouth City Council is owed £78,000. It also emerged electricity and gas suppliers have been threatening to cut off power to the club's Fratton Park stadium for non-payment. And, although Pompey are set to be docked 10 points for going into administation, they could lose further points at the discretion of the Football League as a result of it happening for the second time in such a short period of time. Remarkably, this is the third time Portsmouth have gone into administration in recent years. The club also went into administration in December 1998, prior to being taken over by the Serbian businessman Milan Mandaric. Pompey then became the first Premier League side to enter administration in February 2010, following which they were relegated to the Championship. Going into administration for a second time in such a short period was \\"disappointing\\" but the only way the club could go forward, according to Portsmouth North MP Penny Mordaunt. \\"By going into administration other opportunities will come up for investors, who would have been reluctant to buy the club with a winding-up order hanging over it,\\" she said. Earlier this week it emerged Portsmouth had received their parachute payment from the Premier League early, however, chief executive David Lampitt told BBC Radio Solent it would be up to the administrator how money in Pompey's bank account - understood to be around £2.5m -  is spent. Pompey's parent company, Convers Sports Initiatives, entered administration in November, forcing the Championship club to search for new owners. CSI administrator Andronikou then revealed that Pompey had missed two tax payments of £800,000 to HMRC. It later emerged they currently owe HMRC £1.9m in unpaid tax as well as between £4m to £7m from the previous regime. The club announced in January that their players and staff had not been paid their wages for that month, as a result of having their bank account frozen. They later failed to gain a validation order to gain access to their accounts, leaving players and staff at Fratton Park still waiting to be paid. Former owner Balram Chainrai last week said he was flying to the UK to sort out the stricken club's future. The Hong Kong-based businessman, who owned the club with Israeli Levi Kushnir through a company called Portpin, is still owed £17m. BBC South understands that any new purchaser would need to provide £12m as proof of funds, and assurances they could meet another £20m in repayments to former creditors, Chainrai and Alexandre Gaydamak. However, the Portsmouth Supporters' Trust have claimed that Andronikou is asking them to provide £100m in proof of funds before any meeting between them could take place. In a statement issued after the Administration order was confirmed, the PST said it believed the time had come for the club to be owned by the 'city and community'. \\"A new model of ownership should be developed which will make sure the shameful events of the past few years are not repeated. Pompey fans never want to see their club in court in these circumstances again.\\" What was that article about?","output":"The article discusses the financial crisis at Portsmouth Football Club, which has led the club into administration for the third time in recent history, jeopardising its position in the Championship league just above the relegation zone. Portsmouth's bank accounts were frozen after they received a winding-up petition from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) on January 3. The appointed administrator is Trevor Birch from PKF, a firm known for managing clubs in administration. Initially, the club requested the court to appoint Andrew Andronikou, who had overseen a previous administration. However, HMRC was concerned about a potential conflict of interest and suggested Birch for better impartiality. Entering administration allows Portsmouth to access their bank accounts and continue trading while Birch searches for new owners. This move was seen as a way to attract investors who might have been hesitant to buy the club due to the previous winding-up order. Among the creditors, Portsmouth owes around £2 million to businesses and a similar sum to Inland Revenue in unpaid tax. Fellow football clubs like West Bromwich Albion, Wolverhampton Wanderers, and Bristol City are also creditors, along with Portsmouth City Council and even basic service providers like electricity and gas companies. Persistent financial issues led to the club receiving their parachute payment from the Premier League early. However, it was up to the administrator to decide how to spend the money in their bank account, which was approximately £2.5 million. The article also mentions that Portsmouth's parent company, Convers Sports Initiatives, entered administration in November, and the club still owed HMRC £1.9 million in unpaid taxes. Notably, staff and players had not received their wages for the month due to the frozen bank account, creating a tense situation. The article concludes, mentioning that the Portsmouth Supporters' Trust wants a new ownership model to prevent a repeat of the recent financial difficulties. They believe the club should be owned by the city and the community. However, they claimed that Andronikou was asking them to provide £100 million in proof of funds before discussions could commence."},{"instruction":"Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.

In the story, the carpenter John Hill made a dining table for the writer's wife and presented them with a bill that totaled 36.50. The writer then made a clever comment about the price of dining tables increasing by 20 at the end of the month, implying that John had mistakenly charged an extra 20 due to the date mentioned in the bill. To avoid any conflict and potentially losing the payment for his work, John looked at the writer and then accepted the suggestion to \\"forget the date\\" and add up the costs again.

Murray Cook, also \\"a mature-aged student\\", was the guitarist in the pub rock band Bang Shang a Lang before enrolling at Macquarie.  Greg Page, who had been a roadie for and sang with The Cockroaches during their final years, had enrolled in Macquarie to study early childhood education on Field's recommendation.  Field, Cook, and Page were among approximately 10 men in a program with 200 students.In 1991, while still a student, Field became motivated to use concepts in the field of early childhood education to record an album of music for children.  The album was dedicated to Field's niece.  A song he wrote for The Cockroaches, \\"Get Ready to Wiggle\\", inspired the band's name because they thought that wiggling described the way children dance.  Like a university assignment, they produced a folder of essays that explained the educational value of each song on the album.  They needed a keyboardist \\"to bolster the rock'n'roll feel of the project\\", so Field asked his old bandmate Fatt for his assistance in what they thought would be a temporary project.The group received songwriting help from John Field, Anthony's brother and former bandmate, and from Phillip Wilcher, who was working with the early childhood music program at Macquarie.

The ultimate goal is living within your financial means, both short- and long-term. Pay attention to the ways you’re spending money.  Perhaps the most important aspect of preparing yourself to become financially independent is ensuring that you are not spending more than you’re making.  Fortunately, there are several methods to track your spending:  Use a ledger or a spreadsheet.  The manual approach is great way to start, as it makes you keenly aware of every expense.  Whatever you use, the act of entering every expense into a database of your expenses will keep you better informed of your own spending patterns. Use free accounting software. Once you have multiple bank accounts, and different types of income and expenditures, your ability to organize the corresponding information may demand more than your spreadsheet skills can handle.  Online platforms such as Personal Capital and Mint are free and immensely helpful.  For more specific advice, see How to Manage Your Money Wisely. With an eye towards making immediate improvements in your financial behavior, evaluate how you spend most of your money. There are everyday expenses many people often overlook that can hamper your ability to live within your financial means.  Because a handful of expenses consume most of your budget, pursue these first and minimize common types of spending.  Minimize rent or mortgage payments. Choose your home based on the cost of living in the area.  Go for as little home as you’re comfortable in — both when buying or renting. Consider purchasing a duplex and renting out one side or renting out rooms in your home. Reduce your reliance on vehicles.  Vehicles not only diminish the quality of our environment, they are also associated with substantial financial costs.  Walking, biking, and taking the bus will reduce your spending immediately. Clothing, food, and leisure are areas in which many people spend far more than is appropriate, given their income. Remember that even everyday decisions regarding your method of transportation or eating habits can be the difference between overspending and being able to begin saving for financial independence.   Buy what you can used. Thrift stores and craigslist offer high quality items for only a fraction of what they would cost new. Do it yourself. From home repair to vegetable gardening, you can save money (and increase your worldly wisdom) by taking matters into your own hands.  There’s also an undeniable sense of satisfaction fixing something yourself or growing the ingredients to make yourself a salad from your own yard. Understand that debt does not necessarily prevent you from becoming financially independent. Also recognize that you don’t need to pay it off as quickly as possible. Pay off debt steadily, but within your ability to do so while achieving financial stability. Most importantly, do not take on unnecessary debts.  When paying off debt, start with high-interest debt, like credit cards and auto loans, before paying off student loans. Don’t take on new debt.  Your education is a reasonable expense to take out loans for, as it is an investment in yourself.  Even a car loan can be justifiable if it is the only way you can afford to buy a vehicle.  Continually increasingly credit card debt, however, is blatantly irresponsible. Not only is taking on new debt a clear sign that you are not living within your means, continually acquiring debt will ensure that you are unable to achieve financial independence.  Never finance a vacation, new clothes, or even unnecessary food purchases with a credit card. A good rule to follow: only take on debt for investments, not for lifestyle. If you've compiled a large amount of debt and are struggling to improve your financial position, see How to Negotiate Your Personal Debts.

Help as much as you can. Definition: In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3. Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3. Input: Question: How many years did Diederik Samsom serve as Leader and Parliamentary leader in the House of Representatives? Passage 1:In early 2011, the contracts of three young FC Spartak Moscow players (Maksim Grigoryev, Dmitri Malyaka and Yevgeni Filippov) expired, and they decided to switch to FC Rostov. According to Russian football regulations, when a player under 23 years of age who was raised in the club system transfers to a different club after his contract expires, his old club is due compensation from his new club. If the new club plays on the third level (Russian Second Division), the compensation is the player's 5 previous years' salary multiplied by 1, if his new club is in the National League Championship, it's multiplied by 2 and if it's a Russian Premier League club, it's multiplied by 3. The three players signed with a Russian Second Division team FC MITOS Novocherkassk who immediately loaned them to the Russian Premier League team FC Rostov. Spartak lodged a complaint with the Russian Football Union, claiming this was not a fair transfer as the only reason for it was to lower the compensation that FC Rostov was due to pay Spartak. After the protest was declined on 29 March 2011, Grigoryev was registered for FC Rostov and scored a goal on his debut against FC Lokomotiv Moscow on 2 April 2011, the game ended with a score of 1–1. FC Lokomotiv's president, Olga Smorodskaya, filed a complaint with the Russian Football Union and Premier League, claiming Grigoryev was not eligible to be registered and play for FC Rostov. Before the protest was heard, Grigoryev scored a goal in Rostov's 2-1 victory over FC Dynamo Moscow in the 2010–11 Russian Cup quarterfinal. The protest was heard by the RFU's Dispute Resolution Chamber on 21 April 2011. Smorodskaya insisted that FC MITOS did not have the transfer certificate from Spartak in their possession before the transfer deadline and therefore could not have legally registered Grigoryev. The protest was declined as, according to the league, Grigoryev et al. were registered with RFPL before the transfer deadline, even though they were not included on the official rosters on the league's website or in any other sources. The official league website actually still lists the date of their registration as 1 April. In another twist, in January 2012, Lokomotiv signed Grigoryev from FC MITOS. In March 2012, Court of Arbitration for Sport began considering Grigoryev's case. CAS made their decision in May 2012, denying Lokomotiv's appeal.  Passage 2:After the election of 2006 Plasterk was appointed as Minister of Education, Culture and Science in the Cabinet Balkenende IV, taking office on 22 February 2007. The Cabinet Balkenende IV fell on 20 February 2010 after tensions in the coalition over the extension of the Dutch involvement in the Task Force Urozgan of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan and continued to serve in a demissionary capacity until the Labour Party cabinets members resigned on 23 February 2010. Plasterk was elected as a Member of the House of Representatives after the election of 2010, taking office on 17 June 2010 serving as a frontbencher and spokesperson for Finances. After the Leader of the Labour Party and Parliamentary leader of the Labour Party in the House of Representatives Job Cohen announced that he was stepping down as Leader and Parliamentary leader in the House of Representatives following increasing criticism on his leadership, Plasterk announced his candidacy to succeed him. Plasterk lost the leadership election to fellow frontbencher Diederik Samsom on 16 March 2012. After the election of 2012 Plasterk was appointed as Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations in the Cabinet Rutte II, taking office on 5 November 2012. Plasterk took a medical leave of absence from 29 June 2016 until 16 September 2016 during which Minister for Housing and the Central Government Sector Stef Blok served as acting Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. On 10 September 2016 Plasterk announced announced his retirement from national politics and that he wouldn't stand for the election of 2017. The Cabinet Rutte II was replaced by the Cabinet Rutte III following the cabinet formation of 2017 on 26 October 2017.  Passage 3:A military flying school was set up at the site of the present-day RAAF base on 28 August 1916, when the area was known as Ham Common. RAAF Station Richmond was established on 30 June 1925 as the fledgling service's first air base outside Victoria. Its initial flying unit was No. 3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron, operating Airco DH.9 light bombers and Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 fighters, and for the next decade the commanding officer of No. 3 Squadron was also in charge of the base. Among these were Squadron Leaders Frank Lukis (1925–30), Harry Cobby (1930–31), and Bill Bostock (1931–33). Headquarters RAAF Station Richmond was formed as a separate entity on 20 April 1936, under the command of Group Captain Adrian \\"King\\" Cole. Other units, including No. 22 Squadron flying Hawker Demons, and No. 2 Aircraft Depot, had been established in the preceding months. No. 4 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron was formed in May 1937, followed by No. 6 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron in March 1939. Two Fleet Cooperation units were also established, No. 5 Squadron in April 1936 and No. 9 Squadron in January 1939. No. 23 (General Purpose) Squadron formed in February 1939. As well as an Air Force base, in its pre-war days Richmond was used as a supplementary airport for Sydney; various aviation pioneers employed it in the 1930s, including Charles Kingsford Smith and Jean Batten.

Article: Much has been said and written recently about heroes, mainly because many people think we have too few of them. There are many different kinds of heroes, but they all seem to have two things in common. First, heroes, by their actions, show the great possibilities of human nature. Second, heroes can also stand the test of time, and their achievements will not be easily forgotten. Because of these good points, we need to choose our heroes carefully. Olympic sports star Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who is believed to be a hero, warns young people to be careful of making athletes heroes. She hopes that if someone tries to copy her, it will be because she has achieved her goals by working hard. Joyner-Kersee says that a hero should be someone who has an influence on another person's life. Poet Maya Angelou believes that a hero encourages people to treat others well and to be concerned about the greater good. A hero should show politeness, courage, patience, and strength all the time. A hero should encourage others to follow him with actions that improve the world, even if only in small ways. Author Daniel Boorstin suggests that, \\" _ are people who make news, but heroes are people who make history.\\" Thus, if a person is truly worthy to be called a hero, he or she will not be soon forgotten. We all need heroes. We need to be able to respect people who have been there, done that, and succeeded. Many times the greatest heroes are the people we deal with every day -- relatives , friends, and neighbors -- who will keep going when it is easier to give up. The parent who puts her or his family ahead of herself or himself, the teacher who will make more money at another job but chooses to help others -- all these people can be considered as heroes. A hero quietly and continuously sets a good example, an example that inspires others to follow. Question: Joyner-Kersee hopes that young people   _  .

In developing their Far East trade, the Dutch also began to frequent the island.

I didn't go when it first came out because, well, frankly, I was afraid. Afraid of how bad it might be, or how disappointing. While not as bad as Menace, and better than Clones, it wasn't particularly memorable, or satisfying. I was 11 years old when I saw Star Wars. I still remember sitting in the theater. From the opening crawl to the final credits it was a movie experience I'll never forget. A timeless story of the bored farm-boy who just knows he was meant for more, saving the princess and the Galaxy from the evil menace while being mentored by the wise wizard, the rogue pirate and the various comic relief--all in a space-opera setting. And that's not to chastise Lucas for using an old formula. It's an old formula precisely because it works. And to his credit, he gave it new twists that made it very special. Then came Empire and the story became more than just a fairy tale. Darkness entered the picture and we learned one of the great movie twists of all time. The great villain, Vader was Luke's father. Wow, no one saw that coming. Of course, I'm convinced neither did Lucas till it showed up in the screenplay. Go back and watch Star Wars again. Knowing what you know now, particularly in light of the first three episodes, see if it really meshes. Which brings me to the problem I have. Revenge is an entertaining movie--tremendous effects, plenty of action, some good fighting scenes. But a movie still lives or dies on its plot--the story it is telling. Oh, certainly, really good acting can save a weak plot, but a weak plot coupled with bad acting--that's a burden no director can overcome, certainly not one as bad as I'm forced to realize George Lucas is (The man has managed to direct some of the worst performances in their careers from some very fine actors--Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Samuel Jackson). *****SPOILERS AHEAD******** The plot. Oh my. Understand, he's already handicapped by what's happened in the first two films so it's an incredible burden. One too much for him to overcome. First we have the sheer absurdities of the background. We have Anakin being found as a child on Tatooine, the product of a virginal, miracle birth--the \\"chosen one\\". Well, this detail never gets remotely explained. Indeed, the closest explanation is Yoda's observation that maybe they were wrong. Oh, well, okay then. Our mistake. Now, this same wunderkind turns out to be the creator of C3PO. Hey, what a coincidence that is. And he'll come back to Tatooine and never know he was from there? Wow! How about that. Testing the old willing suspension of disbelief there, eh George? Anyway, we have this bratty kid, moody, petulant, whining young adult, who must somehow become one of the greatest villains in Cinematic history--the great tragedy of Darth Vador--the good guy who falls from grace, only to finally achieve redemption in the end. How, pray tell, does this happen? Why, he has a dream that his wife will die in childbirth. Now, sure, he lives in a star-spanning civilization that treats gravity like we treat gasoline, but does it occur to the \\"dark one to be\\" to maybe check with a physician cause maybe, just maybe, this futuristic society might can do something about this problem? Why, no, the only thing he can think to do is go kill some children because the bad guy at the root of all the evil they've been chasing for two films tells him that he's got the secret to immortality. Well, of course he does. Sheesh. How can Lucas expect us to watch such foolishness and be moved by it? How can anyone expect us to care? Hell, why would anyone want this brat to be saved or redeemed in the first place. I wanted Kenobi to kill him not because he was evil, but because he was pathetically stupid. Oh, by the way, Amidala finally dies. In childbirth. Why? Well, they don't know. The doctor, who is a droid and himself indicative of the incredibly high technology to which this society has advanced, offers only the conclusion of \\"she's lost the will to live\\". Well, oh, okay, of course she has. Maybe it finally dawned on her what a dweeb she was sleeping with. But here we are. We have Kenobi present for all this. He knows of the birth of Luke and Leia. Knows who their father is and knows what happens to them. Knows, also, the role of both R2 and C3PO. And yet, in several years, as Luke approaches manhood and shows up with 3PO and R2 (curiously, 3PO's mind is wiped, but not R2's--why????) stating \\"I think these droids belong to you\\", Kenobi, who knows that the protocol droid was constructed by the one he believed to be \\"the chosen one\\" and apprentice to the Emperor himself, and who just happened to be built on this very planet, says \\"strange, I don't recall owning any droids\\". Oh good grief. Lucas simply made this up as he went along. Once he introduced VAder as Luke's father, sadly, the story began spinning out of control because HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE STORY WAS. The plot of Episodes 1-3 is simply incomprehensible. Nothing Palpatine did made any rational sense at all. And none of this ties into the story he originally told in Star Wars. It's an afterthought, and it looks it. I can't give this movie a high rating. It reminds me of Triple X. A fun film to watch, but entirely forgettable. Star Wars will stand in my mind forever.

I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

If you leave the lumps, they may not mix into the dough properly. If you're worried about lumps in your baking soda, sift the baking soda into the cup or bowl before adding water. Immediately spoon the baking soda and water mixture into the melted butter and golden syrup. Use a whisk to completely incorporate the ingredients. Keep stirring until a layer of white foam forms on the surface of the mixture. Turn off the heat. If the mixture begins boiling, reduce the heat. Otherwise, you may burn the butter. Pour the butter mixture directly into the dry ingredients. Use a baking spatula or spoon to scrape the sides of the saucepan clean. Next, use a large spoon to gently mix everything together. Continue to stir until the mixture is uniform. The dough will cling to the spoon and the sides of the bowl but hold its shape.  If your dough is too dry, add a few drops of water. If your dough is too wet, sprinkle in some flour. Many people believe that Anzac biscuits are best when freshly baked. However, if you're preparing a large batch of biscuits ahead of time, you can freeze the dough for up to three months. To do so, lay out a large sheet of plastic wrap. Next, spoon the dough onto the plastic wrap in a long line. Roll the plastic wrap around the dough to create a log of biscuit dough and place it in the freezer  When you're ready to bake the biscuits, simply cut off small disks of frozen biscuit dough from the log with a serrated knife. Let the log thaw for an hour or two before slicing it. Summary:","output":"We are making a yummy treat called Anzac biscuits. First, mix rolled oats, flour, sugar, and coconut in a big bowl. Then, melt butter and golden syrup (or honey) in a small pan on low heat. In another small bowl, mix boiling water and baking soda to make a paste. Add this paste into the melted butter and golden syrup. Mix it well. Pour this butter mix into the big bowl with the dry ingredients. Gently stir until the dough is ready. You can make the dough into biscuits now or freeze it to bake later. When you want to bake them, cut small pieces from the frozen dough and let them thaw before cooking. Enjoy your Anzac biscuits!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: where is the subsolar point on december 21?","output":"On December 21, the subsolar point, which is the location on Earth where the Sun appears to be directly overhead at solar noon, is situated at the Tropic of Capricorn. This phenomenon occurs during the December Solstice, which represents the point where the Earth's axial tilt is farthest away from the Sun within the Southern Hemisphere. The Earth's axial tilt, at approximately 23.5 degrees, causes the variation in the subsolar point's location throughout the year. This tilt results in different regions of the Earth receiving varying amounts of sunlight during the course of a year, leading to the creation of seasons. To be more precise about the location of the subsolar point on December 21, the Tropic of Capricorn is an imaginary line of latitude located at approximately 23.5 degrees south. Its name is derived from the fact that, over 2,000 years ago, the December Solstice occurred when the Sun was in the constellation Capricornus. Due to the precession of the equinoxes, this is no longer the case, but the name Tropic of Capricorn has persisted.  During the December Solstice, the areas lying between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic Circle experience a period when the Sun never sets, referred to as the \\"midnight sun.\\" Meanwhile, regions between the Tropic of Capricorn and the equator experience their summertime, characterized by longer daylight hours and shorter nights. Conversely, the regions between the equator and the Tropic of Cancer experience their wintertime, with reduced daylight hours and longer nights. Areas between the Arctic Circle and the Tropic of Cancer receive the shortest amount of daylight on this day. In conclusion, the subsolar point on December 21 is at the Tropic of Capricorn, approximately at 23.5 degrees south latitude. This event marks the beginning of astronomical summer in the Southern Hemisphere and astronomical winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, the subsolar point travels between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn throughout the year, causing variation in the amount of sunlight received by different regions and the subsequent changes in seasons."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Context: Quinn had waited all summer for it to be warm enough to go to the pool.

Using three separate microphones, Caul and his associates follow the couple around a park. Later, he pieces together a conversation that clearly indicates the two are in a relationship and that they fear being found out by the Director.Caul is a secretive, almost paranoid individual. He alienates his assistant, Stan (John Cazale), because he won't teach him more about audio surveillance, and his girlfriend, Amy (Teri Garr), because he won't share with her details about his career or personal life. He also refuses to hand over the tapes of Ann and Marc to the Director's assistant, Martin (Harrison Ford). The Director had specified that the tapes were to be turned over only to him. Martin protests but Caul keeps the tapes.Caul becomes increasingly concerned that, were he to turn the tapes over to the Director, that some harm would come to Ann and Marc. On the tapes, Marc can be heard to say \\"He'd kill us if he had the chance.\\" When he worked on the East Coast, Caul had participated in a surveillance that led to the deaths of two persons. He worries that this might happen again, and goes to church to confess his sins.After Amy breaks off their relationship, Caul attends a surveillance convention. Martin also attends, and Caul confronts him and orders Martin to stop following him. He learns that Stan has gone to work for Moran (Alan Garfield), a Detroit-based surveillance expert looking to expand to the West Coast. Moran demonstrates to convention goers a new remote audio system that turns any telephone into a live microphone. Although Caul persuades Stan not to work for Moran after the convention is over, Moran is effusive in his praise for Caul. Lonely and enjoying the positive attention, Caul lets his guard down and takes Moran, Stan and several others back to his workroom for a post-convention... A:","output":"Harry Caul, the protagonist in the film \\"The Conversation,\\" is a private surveillance expert based in San Francisco. He is portrayed by Gene Hackman and is known for his secretive and almost paranoid personality. Obsessed with maintaining his privacy, Caul often alienates those close to him, including his assistant Stan and his girlfriend Amy, as he refuses to share details about his career or personal life. Throughout the movie, Caul's unwavering commitment to his assignments drives him to constantly grapple with a conflicted conscience, especially when faced with the prospect of his work causing harm to innocent individuals.

The premise: \\"A young boy jumps in a swimming pool towards a bald man in the water.\\"  The hypothesis: \\"A kid jumps in the pool close to a man.\\"  In this case, we can break down the premise and the hypothesis to evaluate the given information. From the premise, we can extract the following information: 1. There is a young boy involved. 2. The young boy jumps in a swimming pool. 3. The direction of the jump is towards a bald man. 4. The bald man is in the water. From the hypothesis, we can extract the following information: 1. There is a kid involved. 2. The kid jumps in the pool. 3. The jump occurs close to a man. Comparing the two, we see that: 1. The young boy and the kid refer to the same person in this context. Both the premise and hypothesis mention the kid/young boy jumping into the pool. 2. The premise and hypothesis both agree that the jump occurs in the swimming pool. 3. The premise specifies a bald man in the water, while the hypothesis refers more generally to a man. However, as the bald man is still a man, we can reasonably infer that the jump occurs close to a man according to the premise. Considering these points, we can conclude that the information provided by the premise supports the hypothesis as true. The premise tells us that a young boy jumps in the swimming pool towards a bald man in the water, thereby corroborating the hypothesis, which is essentially a simplified version of the events stated in the premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Use evidence from the fact that as the thickness of an object increases , the resistance to damage of that object will increase to answer this question: \\"To protect yourself from blisters you may try\\"","output":"To protect yourself from blisters, it is necessary to utilize the principle where as the thickness of an object increases, the resistance to damage of that object also increases. This concept can be put into practice in several ways. First, wearing thick socks can significantly protect your feet from blisters. The thicker material not only absorbs more shock but also offers more cushioning compared to thin ones, reducing the friction between your skin and the shoe. When there is excessive friction, the outer layers of skin can separate and fill with fluid, forming a blister. Thicker socks can prevent this by reducing direct skin-to-shoe contact. Second, using shoe inserts or insoles can provide an extra layer of protection against blisters. These inserts increase the thickness between your feet and your shoes, effectively distributing pressure more evenly across the foot and minimizing the rubbing that leads to blisters. Some inserts or insoles even have specific padding or gel cushioning meant to alleviate pressure spots that more commonly lead to blisters. Third, consider using patches or tapes in areas prone to blisters. If you're going on a long hike, for instance, and know that your boots often rub a specific part of your foot, preemptively applying a patch or tape to provide an added layer of skin can prevent the creation of a blister. Products such as adhesive bandages, molefoam, or specially designed blister bandaids can be used. Fourth, using products like blister prevention sprays or creams can support on this matter. While they do not increase the thickness of your skin directly, they create a sort of barrier that prevents rubbing and reduces the heat caused by friction - two things vital for the formation of blisters.  Lastly, it is worth mentioning that an effective measure is making sure your shoes fit properly in the first place. Shoes that are too tight or too loose will increase friction, as the shoe material will constantly rub your skin while you're moving. So, through a combination of thicker socks, shoe inserts, preemptive use of patches or tapes, blister sprays or creams, and ensuring a proper shoe fit, one can effectively apply the principle that an increase in thickness equates to an increase in resistance to damage - in this case, to prevent the formation of painful blisters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question. Which word is used to describe any rock or soil material that has remained below zero degrees centigrade continuously for more than two years?","output":"The term used to describe any rock or soil material that has remained below zero degrees centigrade continuously for more than two years is \\"permafrost.\\" Permafrost is derived from two words: \\"permanent\\" and \\"frost,\\" which together convey the meaning of permanently frozen ground. Permafrost can be found in regions with cold climates, such as the polar regions, high mountain areas, and vast territories across the northern parts of North America, Europe, and Asia. Approximately 25% of the Earth's land surface is estimated to be underlain by permafrost. This phenomenon plays a vital role in shaping the ecological and hydrological dynamics of these cold environments. Permafrost can be categorized into two main types: continuous and discontinuous. Continuous permafrost is observed in areas with extremely cold temperatures, where the ground remains frozen all year round without any unfrozen patches. Discontinuous permafrost, on the other hand, refers to areas where the frozen ground is interspersed with unfrozen zones, typically found in regions characterized by milder temperatures. The thickness of permafrost layers can vary greatly, ranging from less than a meter to several hundred meters in depth. Factors such as temperature, snow cover, vegetation, and soil type can influence the development and stability of permafrost. Permafrost has significant environmental implications. As global temperatures increase due to climate change, permafrost has begun to thaw in various parts of the world. The melting of permafrost can lead to the release of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, stored within the frozen ground. This release can further exacerbate global warming and contribute to a feedback loop of climate change effects. Additionally, the thawing of permafrost can destabilize structures and infrastructure built on or near the frozen ground, such as roads, pipelines, and buildings, leading to costly damage and maintenance challenges. Moreover, the alteration of permafrost landscapes can impact local ecosystems by changing the distribution of plant and animal species, as well as modifying the hydrological cycle. In summary, permafrost refers to any rock or soil material that has remained below zero degrees centigrade continuously for over two years. Primarily found in cold climate regions, permafrost greatly influences the environmental, ecological, and human infrastructure aspects of these areas. The ongoing effects of climate change have made permafrost an important topic of study, as the consequences of its thawing pose significant challenges and implications for the global environment and human societies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

TEXT:I hate to sound like an 'old person', but frankly I haven't seen too many movies that I like that were made after 1960... generally, movies just seem to get worse and worse (although I quite enjoyed the Scott Baio vehicle \\"The Bread, My Sweet\\", except for the 'de rigeur' sex scene which added NOTHING of value to THAT movie). This movie makes the mother, a former Las Vegas chorus girl, seem to be incapable of surviving on her own, although she is clearly in her 50s (though hinted at being in her 40s). I didn't buy it. I'm 57 and like all the women I know in their 50s and 40s, more than capable of surviving on my own (as I have been doing since I graduated from high school at 13, got legally emancipated and set off on my own life's journey.)  The daughter is not believable in her job role ... she gets a promotion she doesn't deserve (a great opportunity) and drops that ball too, but when another female employee steps up to the plate and is ready to deliver, the writers shoot her down as an 'opportunist', when she was just doing what any career-oriented person would do -- taking advantage of a wide-open opportunity created by the lack of self-discipline of her coworker, a girl who apparently doesn't understand the concept of honoring her promises (to her boss, in this case). The daughter grudgingly 'allows' her mother to stay with her, on a temporary basis, but then treats her mother (the woman who gave her Life and raised her to 'adulthood') like a pariah. Apparently the 'writers' of tripe like this do not understand that it is NOT 'the common thing' for PARENTS to act like children, and then be treated AS children by THEIR children. That is just more of the societal 'baloney' that Hollywood keeps trying to force down our throats as though we, their public, were stupid for desiring to be entertained by their creative offerings. This is a sad movie with a stupid ending. If the young male restauranteur had been real and not a two-dimensional 'tv character', he'd have stayed with the MOTHER, who was not that much older than him and quite attractive. But in the end he 'falls' for the daughter, a shallow, rather uninteresting girl who has that cuteness of youth, but in an ordinary, bland way. (The 'opportunist' young woman who worked with this nothing girl was far more attractive, physically.) There was no believable reason presented to the audience as to why the restauranteur preferred the daughter (who was an uptight, selfish, self-centered b*tch who treated her mother with unbelievable disrespect) to the mother -- a woman who was kindhearted, sweet-tempered, humorous, and had a joie de vivre the daughter could not even begin to comprehend. Of course the mother had her own flaws... she had reacted to her husband's demise by drinking herself into a stupor for a year or two afterwards which supposedly created the rift between her and her smarmy daughter.

Q: Infectious bronchitis (IB) is one of the major economically important poultry diseases distributed worldwide. It is caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and affects both galliform and nongalliform birds. Its economic impact includes decreased egg production and poor egg quality in layers, stunted growth, poor carcass weight, and mortality in broiler chickens. Although primarily affecting the respiratory tract, IBV demonstrates a wide range of tissues tropism, including the renal and reproductive systems. Thus, disease outcome may be influenced by the organ or tissue involved as well as pathotypes or strain of the infecting virus. Knowledge on the epidemiology of the prevalent IBV strains in a particular region is therefore important to guide control and preventions. Meanwhile previous diagnostic methods such as serology and virus isolations are less sensitive and time consuming, respectively; current methods, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP), and sequencing, offer highly sensitive, rapid, and accurate diagnostic results, thus enabling the genotyping of new viral strains within the shortest possible time.

Question: What are some of the most interesting tourist destinations in the city? Context: Nanjing, one of the nation's most important cities for over a thousand years, is recognized as one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China, and had been the world's largest city aggregately for hundreds of years, enjoyed peace and prosperity and beared wars and disasters. Nanjing served as the capital of Eastern Wu, one of the three major states in the Three Kingdoms period (211-280); the Eastern Jin and each of the Southern Dynasties (Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang and Chen), which successively ruled southern China from 317-589; the Southern Tang, one of the Ten Kingdoms (937-76); the Ming dynasty when, for the first time, all of China was ruled from the city (1368-1421); and the Republic of China (1927–37, 1945–49) prior to its flight to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. The city also served as the seat of the rebel Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (1851–64) and the Japanese puppet regime of Wang Jingwei (1940–45) during the Second Sino-Japanese War, and suffered appalling atrocities in both conflicts, including the Nanjing Massacre. It has been serving as the capital city of Jiangsu province after the China was established, and is still the nominal capital of Republic of China that accommodates many of its important heritage sites, including the Presidential Palace and Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Nanjing is famous for human historical landscapes, mountains and waters such as Fuzimiao, Ming Palace, Chaotian Palace, Porcelain Tower, Drum Tower, Stone City, City Wall, Qinhuai River, Xuanwu Lake and Purple Mountain. Key cultural facilities include Nanjing Library, Nanjing Museum and Art Museum. Answer:","output":"There are numerous interesting tourist destinations in the city of Nanjing, largely due to its historical importance as one of the ancient capitals of China. These sites reflect its rich tapestry of history served by different states and dynasties. Firstly, the city has key heritage sites like the Presidential Palace and the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. The Presidential Palace was the office for the Presidents of the Republic of China before they moved to Taiwan. On the other hand, the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum is the final resting place of the first president and founder of the Republic of China, remarking the modern history of China. Then, there are historical landscapes like Fuzimiao, Ming Palace, Chaotian Palace, Porcelain Tower, and Drum Tower, all of which bear the mark of different periods in Chinese history. The Fuzimiao, also known as the Confucius Temple, for instance, was originally constructed in the year 1034 during the Song Dynasty. Ming Palace was an imperial palace complex, built as the royal palace of the Hongwu Emperor, the founder of the Ming Dynasty. Chaotian Palace is a complex of palace buildings, and it's the largest preserved traditional Chinese architectural complex in Jiangsu province. Two notable structures are the Porcelain Tower, considered one of the wonders of the world, and the Drum Tower, which dates back to the Ming dynasty.  The city also has natural attractions like the Qinhuai River, the Xuanwu Lake, and Purple Mountain. The Qinhuai River is the birthplace of the age-old Nanjing culture. As for the Xuanwu Lake and the Purple Mountain, both offer serene environments away from the bustling city life. Finally, yet importantly, Nanjing is also home to key cultural facilities. For instance, the Nanjing Library is the third largest library in China and the Nanjing Museum and Art Museum also offer rich collections showcasing the depth and breadth of Chinese history and culture. In conclusion, Nanjing is a city that is steeped in Chinese history, culture, and natural beauty, with a wide range of tourist sites to visit."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","output":"Answer: (D). chromatography Chromatography is a versatile and widely used separation technique, which involves the separation of a mixture of compounds, also known as solutes, based on their distribution between a mobile phase (a solvent or a mixture of solvents) and a stationary phase (a solid medium). The process aims to separate these compounds based on their differential affinity towards these two phases. The mobile phase moves through the stationary phase, and the individual components of the solute mixture are selectively retained by the stationary phase to different extents, resulting in their relative separation. In the given context, chromatography is the process that involves solvent separation on a solid medium. The other options provided do not fit the description of the process: (A). Substration: This term could be a misinterpretation of \\"substrate,\\" which refers to a substance or surface upon which an enzyme or another catalyst acts.

Resonance: Resonance is a concept in chemistry and physics in which two or more atomic or molecular structures act compositely through electron delocalization. This term is not related to the process dealing with solvent separation on a solid medium. (C). Affinity: Affinity generally refers to the attraction or repulsion between two bodies or entities. While the selective retention of solutes in chromatography is based on their affinity towards the stationary phase, affinity itself is not a process that separates solvents on a solid medium.

The premise suggests that it is beneficial for young boys to have a relationship with their fathers, but it does not specifically clarify the term \\"relationship,\\" so it can be interpreted differently based on an individual's perspective. The hypothesis, on the other hand, posits that boys with their fathers in their lives tend to be more well-rounded individuals. If we break down the premise and hypothesis, there are some common threads. Both statements emphasize the importance of a father figure in the lives of young males. The premise specifies that it is a \\"wonderful advantage,\\" which implies that boys who have relationships with their fathers may have some benefits that other boys who lack such relationships do not have. The hypothesis, on the other hand, focuses on the idea of \\"roundedness.\\" This term can be interpreted in various ways, such as emotional stability, social skills, or general personal development. The term \\"roundedness\\" could very well relate to the \\"wonderful advantage\\" mentioned in the premise. In this case, having a father figure may contribute to a boy's well-rounded development. However, there are also several unknowns that prevent us from definitively asserting the relationship. The premise does not elaborate on why or how a relationship with a father is advantageous. Furthermore, there may be other factors at play, such as the quality or type of relationship a boy has with his father. Moreover, since the premise does not explicitly discuss how this advantage leads to well-rounded development, we cannot make a concrete conclusion based on this information alone. In summary, the premise and hypothesis, while sharing some common ground, do not provide enough explicit evidence to confirm that boys grow up to be more well-rounded individuals when their fathers are in their lives. It is essential to consider other factors, such as the nature of the father-child relationship and the specific ways in which fathers contribute to the lives of their sons. With more information, it might be possible to determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not, but based on the given statements alone, it is not possible to tell."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose water is not contained by a dam happens, how will it affect DEGRADED safety from flooding.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"A: more If water is not contained by a dam during a flooding event, it will likely lead to more significant safety concerns and increased flood damage. Dams are designed to regulate and control the flow of water, helping to prevent downstream flooding. Without a dam to hold back the excess water and release it gradually into the river system, the risk of flooding would be much higher, leading to more significant safety concerns and potential harm to people and property in the affected areas."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After being forced to punt on their first offensive drive, the Colts' defense forced a fumble that was recovered by Ricky Jean-Francois and set up the Colts inside Titan territory. After a 37-yard pass from quarterback Andrew Luck to T. Y. Hilton set the Colts up at the one yard line, Trent Richardson scored on the next play, putting the Colts up 7-0. An onside kick gave the ball back to the Colts, which led to an eleven play, 44-yard drive that ended in a touchdown pass from Luck to Dwayne Allen. The Colts' defense again forced a turnover on the Titans' next possession, with Charlie Whitehurst throwing an interception to Mike Adams. Luck and the Colts' offense again drove down the field, though this time having to settle for a field goal, extending the lead to 17-0. Tennessee scored their first points midway through the second quarter on a Ryan Succop. The Colts responded on their next possession with a 30-yard field goal from Adam Vinatieri. A Luck interception late in the half, set up the Titans in Colts' territory and allowed them to score on a pass from Whitehurst to Delanie Walker, cutting the Colts' lead to 20-10 at halftime. The Colts' scored on their first offensive possession of the second half, on a 28-yard touchdown pass from Luck to Reggie Wayne and then later in the quarter on a pass from Luck to Coby Fleener, extending the Colts' lead to 34-10. Tennessee responded with an eight play, 80-yard drive that ended with a touchdown run from Bishop Sankey. Luck completed his fourth touchdown pass of the game early in the fourth quarter, this time on a 15-yard pass to Ahmad Bradshaw, giving the Colts a 41-17 lead. Late in the game, Adams again forced another turnover, with Zach Mettenberger throwing the interception. During the game, Reggie Wayne caught seven passes for 119 yards and one touchdown, which was enough to move him to seventh on the NFL all-time receptions list and tenth on the most receiving yards list. With the win, the Colts improved to 2-2. How many times did the titans score in the first half?","output":"In the first half, the Tennessee Titans scored twice. Their first score came midway through the second quarter on a field goal by Ryan Succop. Later in the half, after a Luck interception, the Titans scored on a pass from Charlie Whitehurst to Delanie Walker.

Article: The sun line, also known as the Apollo line, is a vertical line that's usually located near the bottom of your palm underneath your ring finger. If you have a deep sun line, you may be very successful and possibly gain fame. A shallow line means you're still developing your skills and you'll work hard toward success. If the sun line is broken, you may gain success after overcoming past obstacles. The relationship line, also called the marriage line, is a small horizontal line that wraps around the side of your palm underneath your pinkie. Relationship lines that are long or deep might mean you prefer long-term commitments, while short or shallow lines mean you may experience multiple relationships or revisit old commitments. You may have multiple relationship lines on your palm, which may mean you are passionate in your romantic relationships. Your intuition line is a curved line that starts near the bottom of your pinkie and goes down toward your wrist. If your intuition line is pronounced, you may be able to pick up on how others are feeling quickly and sense if they're positive or negative. When you have breaks in your intuition line, it could mean you're empathetic for others, but you should focus on your own mood and emotions. You may not have an intuition line on your palm, but you can still be empathetic and sense others' feelings. The health line is a diagonal or curved line that starts from the edge of your palm by your pinkie and extends down to the center of your wrist. Having a long, deep health line can mean that you're a supportive individual and that you take care of others. Not everyone will have a health line, but it does not mean that you don't care for other people. Breaks in your health line may represent illnesses you or a loved one may have had in the past. The money line is a short diagonal line that extends down from the base of your pinkie. Deep, straight money lines may mean you are smart with your investments and you may get wealth later on in life.

Article: April 2009, in the state of Georgia, USA, twenty thousand people watched high school students from twenty- eight countries compete with robots they had built. More than ten thousand students and more than five hundred robots took part in the competition. Almost 1,700 high school teams took part  in the competition called LUNACY.      In January, the organization sent the same robots to each team. The teams had six weeks to build robots that could compete in the LUNACY game. The playing area consisted of six robots, three on each team. Each robot had a trailer   connected to it. The robots had to pick up large balls and throw them into the trailers of opposing   robots. The robots were moving on a platform where they could move smoothly. A team from the USA won the LUNACY competition.       American inventor Dean Kamen started the competition in 1989 to increase young people's interest in science and technology. The organization holds robotic competitions around the world. It offers programs that help young people learn about science, technology, engineering and maths, and at the same time build life skills. Many companies provide support for the organization.       Mr. Kamen says the goal is more than building robots. He says the student competitors showed they could solve difficult technological problems and, he says that it is good news because the world needs creative thinkers to solve the increasingly difficult problems of the future.

Article:Lallana's former Southampton team-mate scored a trademark free-kick in Wales' 2-1 win against Slovakia and has dominated the pre-match build-up. Asked whether the aura around Bale, 26, would affect England, Lallana said: \\"I know that won't affect me or our team. \\"We've got plenty of players with that aura and special talent.\\" Lallana, 28, who came through the youth system at Saints with Bale, added: \\"I don't believe that will come into play at all.\\" Bale has been outspoken in the run-up to a game that carries huge significance after England only drew 1-1 in their opening game against Russia, claiming Wales had more \\"passion\\" than Roy Hodgson's side. \\"I'm sure he didn't mean it in too serious a manner, knowing Gareth,\\" said Lallana. \\"It's part and parcel of the build-up. We know that we will do our talking on the pitch like I believe they will want to do. The match can't come soon enough for me. \\"Maybe they want to spice things up before a big game but we're all used to that. It is about not getting lured into it.\\" And rather than being intimidated by Bale, Lallana believes England possess the attacking threat to strike fear into the Welsh. England had Leicester City's title-winning inspiration Jamie Vardy, who scored 24 goals in their Premier League triumph on the bench in the draw against Russia, along with Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge and 18-year-old Marcus Rashford, who made such a big impression in his first season in the first team at Manchester United. Harry Kane, the Premier League's top scorer with 25 goals for Tottenham last season, played against the Russians with England captain Wayne Rooney moved to a deeper role to accommodate Hodgson's range of attacking options. Lallana said: \\"I think they'll definitely be thinking about that. Anyone would who is playing against us and looking at our team - not just our team but our squad. There are attacking players on the bench we can use and there are great options there.\\" \\"It's definitely one of the best England squads I've been involved in, so if someone is having a bad day, or there are injuries or suspensions, we've got options in abundance to come in and keep the standards high.\\" So should Wales be worried about England? \\"I think they will be and will be doing their preparation to try and stop us,\\" said Lallana. Wales are two points ahead of England after the first round of games, Chris Coleman's side opening with victory against Slovakia while Hodgson's side conceded a last-minute equaliser against Russia in Marseille. And Lallana admits these results mean England go into the game as the team under greater pressure. \\"Yes that's the case but we thrive on pressure week in and week out,\\" he said. \\"It brings out the best in us. That's what we have to deal with.

Answer the following question: Information:  - David Harbater (born December 19, 1952) is an American mathematician at the University of Pennsylvania, well known for his work in Galois theory, algebraic geometry and arithmetic geometry.  - \\"Not to be confused with his wife Michèle Raynaud, who is also a French mathematician working in algebraic geometry.\\"   - The term proposition has a broad use in contemporary philosophy. It is used to refer to some or all of the following: the primary bearers of truth-value, the objects of belief and other \\"propositional attitudes\\" (i.e., what is believed, doubted, etc.), the referents of that-clauses, and the meanings of declarative sentences. Propositions are the sharable objects of attitudes and the primary bearers of truth and falsity. This stipulation rules out certain candidates for propositions, including thought- and utterance-tokens which are not sharable, and concrete events or facts, which cannot be false.  - In abstract algebra , Abhyankar 's conjecture is a 1957 conjecture of Shreeram Abhyankar , on the Galois groups of algebraic function fields of characteristic p. The soluble case was solved by Serre in 1990 and the full conjecture was proved in 1994 by work of Michel Raynaud and David Harbater . The problem involves a finite group G , a prime number p , and the function field of nonsingular integral algebraic curve C defined over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic p. The question addresses the existence of Galois extensions L of K ( C ) , with G as Galois group , and with restricted ramification . From a geometric point of view L corresponds to another curve C  , and a morphism  : C   C. Ramification geometrically , and by analogy with the case of Riemann surfaces , consists of a finite set S of points x on C , such that  restricted to the complement of S in C is an étale morphism . In Abhyankar 's conjecture , S is fixed , and the question is what G can be . This is therefore a special type of inverse Galois problem . The subgroup p ( G ) is defined to be the subgroup generated by all the Sylow subgroups of G for the prime number p. This is a normal subgroup , and the parameter n is defined as the minimum number of generators of G / p ( G ) . Then for the case of C the projective line over K , the conjecture states that G can be realised as a Galois group of L , unramified outside S containing s + 1 points , if and only if n  s. This was proved by Raynaud . For the general case , proved by Harbater , let g be the genus of C. Then G can be realised if and only if n  s + 2 g.  - Algebra (from Arabic \\"\\"al-jabr\\"\\" meaning \\"reunion of broken parts\\") is one of the broad parts of mathematics, together with number theory, geometry and analysis. In its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols; it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics. As such, it includes everything from elementary equation solving to the study of abstractions such as groups, rings, and fields. The more basic parts of algebra are called elementary algebra, the more abstract parts are called abstract algebra or modern algebra. Elementary algebra is generally considered to be essential for any study of mathematics, science, or engineering, as well as such applications as medicine and economics. Abstract algebra is a major area in advanced mathematics, studied primarily by professional mathematicians.  - In mathematics, and more specifically in abstract algebra, an algebraic structure is a set (called carrier set or underlying set) with one or more finitary operations defined on it that satisfies a list of axioms.  - In mathematics, a polynomial is an expression consisting of variables (or indeterminates) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents. An example of a polynomial of a single indeterminate is . An example in three variables is .  - In number theory, Fermat's Last Theorem (sometimes called Fermat's conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no three positive integers , , and satisfy the equation for any integer value of greater than 2. The cases and have been known to have infinitely many solutions since antiquity.  - In abstract algebra, field extensions are the main object of study in field theory. The general idea is to start with a base field and construct in some manner a larger field that contains the base field and satisfies additional properties. For instance, the set Q(2) = {\\"a\\" + \\"b\\"2 | \\"a\\", \\"b\\"  Q} is the smallest extension of Q that includes every real solution to the equation \\"x\\" = 2.  - In mathematics, more specifically in the area of modern algebra known as Galois theory, the Galois group of a certain type of field extension is a specific group associated with the field extension. The study of field extensions and their relationship to the polynomials that give rise to them via Galois groups is called Galois theory, so named in honor of Évariste Galois who first discovered them.  - A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems.  - In mathematics, more specifically in abstract algebra, Galois theory, named after Évariste Galois, provides a connection between field theory and group theory. Using Galois theory, certain problems in field theory can be reduced to group theory, which is, in some sense, simpler and better understood.  - The University of Pennsylvania (commonly known as Penn or UPenn) is a private, Ivy League university located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Incorporated as \\"The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania\\", Penn is one of 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities and one of the nine original colonial colleges.  - Évariste Galois (25 October 1811  31 May 1832) was a French mathematician born in Bourg-la-Reine. While still in his teens, he was able to determine a necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial to be solvable by radicals, thereby solving a problem standing for 350 years. His work laid the foundations for Galois theory and group theory, two major branches of abstract algebra, and the subfield of Galois connections. He died at age 20 from wounds suffered in a duel.  - Mathematics (from Greek  \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.  - A hypothesis (plural hypotheses) is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it. Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. Even though the words \\"hypothesis\\" and \\"theory\\" are often used synonymously, a scientific hypothesis is not the same as a scientific theory. A working hypothesis is a provisionally accepted hypothesis proposed for further research.  - In algebra, which is a broad division of mathematics, abstract algebra (occasionally called modern algebra) is the study of algebraic structures. Algebraic structures include groups, rings, fields, modules, vector spaces, lattices, and algebras. The term \\"abstract algebra\\" was coined in the early 20th century to distinguish this area of study from the other parts of algebra.  - In mathematics, a conjecture is a conclusion or proposition based on incomplete information, for which no proof has been found. Conjectures such as the Riemann hypothesis (still a conjecture) or Fermat's Last Theorem (which was a conjecture until proven in 1995) have shaped much of mathematical history as new areas of mathematics are developed in order to prove them.  - Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics, classically studying zeros of multivariate polynomials. Modern algebraic geometry is based on the use of abstract algebraic techniques, mainly from commutative algebra, for solving geometrical problems about these sets of zeros.  - In mathematics, the Riemann hypothesis is a conjecture that the Riemann zeta function has its zeros only at the negative even integers and complex numbers with real part . It was proposed by , after whom it is named. The name is also used for some closely related analogues, such as the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields.

In 1918, the central government bodies moved to Moscow.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Moscow (or ) is the capital and most populous city of Russia, with 12.2 million residents within the city limits and 16.8 million within the urban area. Moscow has the status of a Russian federal city.  - Europa Plus is Russia 's first and the most popular commercial radio station , owned by the European Media Group .

Upon inquiring as to who the captain is, another of the men is told the captain is William Bligh (Charles Laughton), and attempts to escape, as Bligh is a brutal tyrant who routinely administers harsh punishment to officers and crew alike who lack discipline, cause any infraction on board the ship, or in any manner defy his authority. The Bounty leaves England several days later on a two-year voyage over the Pacific Ocean. Fletcher Christian (Clark Gable), the ship's lieutenant, is a formidable yet compassionate man who disapproves of Bligh's treatment of the crew. Roger Byam (Franchot Tone) is an idealistic midshipman who is divided between his loyalty to Bligh, owing to his family's naval tradition, and his friendship with Christian. During the voyage, the enmity between Christian and Bligh grows after Christian openly challenges Bligh's unjust practices aboard the ship. When the ship arrives at the island of Tahiti, where the crew acquires breadfruit plants to take home, Bligh punishes Christian by refusing to let him leave the ship during their stay. Byam, meanwhile, sets up residency on the island, living with the island chief, Hitihiti (William Bambridge), and his daughter, Tehani (Movita Castaneda), and compiling an English dictionary of the Tahitian language. Hitihiti persuades Bligh to allow Christian a day pass on the island. Bligh agrees but quickly repeals the pass out of spite. Christian disregards the order and spends his one-day off the ship romancing a Tahitian girl, Maimiti (Mamo Clark). Christian promises her he will be back someday. After leaving Tahiti the crew begins to talk of mutiny after Bligh's harsh discipline leads to the death of the ship's beloved surgeon, Mr.Â Bacchus (Dudley Digges), and Bligh cuts water rationing...

The two questions you have presented are different from each other, both in terms of their subject matter and their specific inquiries. The first question, \\"How can someone deposit old notes in a no-frill account and how?\\" pertains to the financial domain, specifically banking. It is asking about the process of depositing old banknotes into a no-frill account. No-frill accounts, or no-frills accounts, are basic banking accounts that offer essential services without any additional fees or features. They are intended to provide affordable banking services to individuals who may not have access to traditional bank accounts. The question specifically addresses old banknotes, which may be out of circulation or no longer considered legal tender. The process of depositing these old notes may vary depending on the country and its currency laws. The second question, \\"How do I study all Java packages in months?\\" relates to the field of computer programming. Java is a popular programming language, and packages in Java refer to organized collections of related classes and interfaces (a set of methods and properties). Studying Java packages means acquiring knowledge about these different sets of classes and interfaces for practical use in programming. The question asks for guidance in learning all Java packages within a specific time frame—months in this case. This might involve coursework, tutorials, online resources, and self-guided projects. In conclusion, the two questions focus on entirely separate subjects and have different purposes—one is about banking procedures for depositing old notes, and the other is about learning Java programming packages within a limited time period.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Why are people interested in eating raw foods or whole foods   ? One reason is that eating these types of food reduces the risk of acid   accumulation in your body. Raw and whole foods are usually digested more efficiently than cooked foods. When we cook foods, we destroy the natural enzymes   that are part of the food in its raw form. These enzymes were intended by nature to help us digest the food. When we consume food without these natural enzymes, our bodies either digest the food improperly or allow too many nutrients to be absorbed into the bloodstream. In both instances, the result is overweight. When too many nutrients are absorbed at once, the body grows fat. Improperly digested food moves slowly through the digestive system, where it becomes increasingly acidic. To protect its vital organs from this acidic waste, the body changes the acid into fat and stores it safely away from the organs. Processed foods   contain chemical elements, which might confuse the appetite mechanism that tells us when we've had enough to eat; as a result, people often overeat. Processed foods also upset the digestive cycle. The body will either identify these foods as allergens and then store them safely away from the organs as fat, or the remains of undigested food will become acidic and enter the bloodstream as acid waste, which will stick to the blood vessel walls and block the passage of vital oxygen and nutrients heading for the body's cells. The body's metabolism   becomes inactive, and the result is weight gain and obesity. The accumulation of acid in the digestive system makes digestion increasingly inefficient. When that happens, even healthy foods can become acidic and the food allergies will become more common. To stop this vicious circle in its tracks, people need to consume food and supplements that will neutralize the acid already accumulated in body. Eating the right types of raw and whole foods can help. It's also important to restore your enzyme balance. You need to identify and avoid the foods that cause...

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which fruit retained their quality longer apples or pears?  Mary and Ann got some fruit as a gift from a friend. Mary decided to candy the fruit, while Ann decided to eat them fresh, Mary received plums, peaches, apples and oranges. Ann got pears, quince, cherries and blackberries.  Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] The answer to this question is:","output":"Apples retained their quality longer. Step-by-step justification: 1. Mary received apples, among other fruits, and decided to candy them. 2. The candying process involves placing fruit in heated sugar syrup, which preserves it. 3. This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year. 4. Ann received pears and decided to eat them fresh. 5. Fresh pears typically have a shorter shelf life compared to candied fruit. 6.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows? ?  Strapping Young Lad was known for its energetic live performances, mostly owing to the eccentric appearance and persona of Devin Townsend. Adrian Begrand of PopMatters wrote \\"Nobody in metal today has the same kind of commanding stage presence as the self-professed Bald Bastard, Devin Townsend\\", and called Strapping Young Lad \\"one of the best live bands around\\". Townsend was famous for his on-stage antics; he integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows and interacted heavily with the audience. He would deliver comical, and often insulting remarks to them, organize circle pits, and parody heavy metal clichés as well as the genre itself.The band's humorous approach was also evidenced by a song frequently performed live from 1997, entitled \\"Far Beyond Metal\\", a parody of classic heavy metal. It became a live staple and a fan favorite, with lyrics changing practically every performance. Although it was recorded live on No Sleep 'till Bedtime, and on the For Those Aboot to Rock DVD, a studio version was not recorded until 2006 during The New Black sessions. The band was also sarcastic about their own Canadian heritage, they used \\"Blame Canada\\", a comedic anti-Canada song from South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut as intro music at many concerts in 2003 and 2004.For a period of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo material live. In 1998, after the release of Infinity, they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Q: Chemical reactions follow which laws?   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Chemical reactions follow the laws of thermodynamics. The First Law of Thermodynamics states that energy can be changed from one form to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed. This law is also known as the Law of Conservation of Energy. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states the energy available after a chemical reaction is always less than that at the beginning of a reaction. This is also commonly referred to as entropy. Entropy can be described as the degree of disorder in a system . That is, as energy is transferred from one form to another, some of the energy is lost as heat, and the amount of available energy decreases. As the energy decreases, the disorder in the system increases, and, by definition, the entropy increases. Ice melting provides an example in which entropy increases. Entropy essentially is a measure of the tendency of a process, such as a chemical reaction, to proceed in a particular direction.

She and her chaperone, Miss Wiggin, visit the publishing house of Harold and Fruing Warne, who decide to publish her book. Beatrix is thrilled and returns home, taking a drive through the parks to celebrate first. However, it is revealed the Warne brothers think her book is ridiculous and will no doubt be a failure.

Experiencing such an ailment would undoubtedly make participating in any sort of physical activity rather unenjoyable, so Maria could comprehend why Jessica had to prioritize healing over skiing. Additionally, Maria was concerned about the impact that skiing in cold temperatures might have on Jessica’s ear infection. She had read that exposing oneself to the chilly air and high altitudes while skiing could potentially worsen an ear infection, prolonging the healing process and exacerbating the pain.

In Malaysia, Powell met with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has led the country since 1981. The Malaysian foreign minister, Syed Hamid Albar, later told local reporters that Powell had proposed that American and Malaysian officials review the idea of forming a regional training center in Malaysia to coordinate antiterrorism activities. His brief stop in Malaysia also highlighted the moral ambiguities of the effort to prevent terrorism and its emphasis on cooperation with governments that the United States has often criticized. The United States once distanced itself from Mahathir for strong-arm tactics with political rivals, and human rights groups criticize him for arresting and jailing scores of suspected militants, including some who may be linked to al-Qaida, without trial.

Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","output":"Yes, these two sentences essentially convey the same meaning but are phrased differently: 1. \\"The .eu domain is also shared, as it is used with other European Union member states.\\" 2. \\"The .eu domain is also used as it is shared with other EU Member States.\\" Both sentences emphasize that the .eu domain is not exclusive to one specific country, but is shared among various countries within the European Union. They both imply that the domain's shared nature is because it is allocated for use by all EU Member States. The key differences between the two sentences lie within their structure and choice of words. In the first sentence, the main idea revolves around the shared nature of the .eu domain. It follows \\"as it is used with other European Union member states\\" to provide clarification on why the domain is shared. In the second sentence, the focus is on the usage of the .eu domain and the reason it is utilized - \\"as it is shared with other EU Member States.\\"  In summary, despite subtle differences in phrasing and structure, both sentences convey the same message: the .eu domain is shared among and utilized by European Union Member States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bolten watched the exchanges and, after what he called \\"a quiet moment,\\"suggested that the Vice President get in touch with the President and confirm the engage order. Bolten told us he wanted to make sure the President was told that the Vice President had executed the order. He said he had not heard any prior discussion on the subject with the President. The Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation. On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary. Minutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania. Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization. At approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles out. Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to \\"engage or \\"take out\\" the aircraft. At 10:33, Hadley told the air threat conference call: \\"I need to get word to Dick Myers that our reports are there's an inbound aircraft flying low 5 miles out. The Vice President's guidance was we need to take them out.\\" Once again, there was no immediate information about the fate of the inbound aircraft. In the apt description of one witness, \\"It drops below the radar screen and it's just continually hovering in your imagination; you don't know where it is or what happens to it.\\" Eventually, the shelter received word that the alleged hijacker 5 miles away had been a medevac helicopter.

The rundown of recommended stories on some popular Chinese social media sites showed nothing extraordinary this week until users looked a little more closely. On the Sohu Weibo platform for example, the characters on the homepage had been arranged to read \\"Hang in there, Southern Weekly,\\" but only if read vertically, from top down. Another site, 163.com, structured its homepage in a way that the first character of the top six rows of news combined to read \\"Go Southern Weekly Go!\\" They were referring to the wave of anger this week against alleged government censorship at the Southern Weekly, a newspaper based in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou. For two days, journalists at the paper and hundreds of their supporters have gathered in front of the Southern Weekly offices holding posters calling for free speech and condemning press censorship. \\"This is an attack and suppression of press freedom and the people's right to know the truth. It is not right,\\" said one unnamed protester. \\"I came over here to say the Southern Weekly is not alone,\\" explained another. Some of the mostly young protesters carried flowers as a symbol of grief, while one woman came with a face mask plastered with Chinese characters explaining it was a \\"biyantao,\\" or a condom to prevent speech. They demanded the resignation of Tuo Zhen, the Communist Party propaganda chief in the southern province of Guangdong, amid claims that an editorial calling for political reform was re-written as a tribute to Communist Party rule. This rare protest poses a test for Xi Jinping, the newly installed Communist Party chief, who is just beginning to define his agenda as the paramount leader governing a massive country in a state of flux. It also represents a serious dilemma for the Communist Party in an era of social media and micro-blogging. It started with a posting on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media site, complaining that the Propaganda Department in southern Guangdong province had rewritten the paper's annual New Year's editorial without the knowledge of the editors. It was originally titled \\"China's Dream of Constitutionalism,\\" but when it was printed it was revised to read \\"Chasing the Dream,\\" which echoed the official Communist Party line. The censors also added text that contained factual errors. Soon enough China's social media witnessed a torrent of postings condemning Party censorship and supporting the Southern Weekly. The controversy brings to light the role of propaganda czars who supervise the flow of information in China. To be sure, Chinese media has become more diverse in the past three decades, thanks to China's gradual reforms and opening up. Over the years, the local press has been given a bit more room to report about different topics and to do so differently, especially on non-political issues. But government censorship has never stopped and most media groups are still owned and run by the state. The Propaganda Department regularly issues written or oral directives about what news should or should not be reported and how this should be done. So one can only imagine the frustrations editors and journalists endure when faced with censorship. The Southern Weekly is not new to censorship-related controversy. Over the years, it has shown a liberal leaning. Within the allowed space, it produces stories that are relatively fresh, probing and even daring. \\"Some of our essays, exposes and muck-raking stories have tried to push the margin,\\" said a former reporter, who requested anonymity. \\"We call them 'edge-ball' stories, just like playing table tennis, when you make points not with hard smashes but with slight, subtle hits.\\" For that, some of its editors and reporters have gotten into trouble with the propaganda czars. For that, too, it has earned respect and attracted a loyal following, especially among the youth, urbanites, and intellectuals. On Friday, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying insisted there was no press censorship in China and the government protects press freedom according to the law. But there are apparent attempts to rein in the media, especially popular micro-blogging services, which are used to expose problems and abuses that may embarrass the government. Meanwhile, search terms related to Southern Weekly are being blocked. Just how big a threat the demonstrations pose to Xi's new regime remains unclear. It is also unclear where Xi stands on the issue of press censorship and free speech. Some analysts wonder whether Xi or the central government supported the actions of Guangdong officials. Some blame the row squarely on Tuo Zhen, the newly appointed provincial propaganda chief. One observer in Guangdong blamed his \\"behavior and work style\\" for causing the row. But others see the controversy as bigger than just the Guangdong Propaganda Department versus the Southern Weekly. \\"It is a publicity crisis for Xi Jinping's new administration,\\" said Xiao Qiang, a founder and editor-in-chief of China Digital Times, a U.S.-based site monitoring China's Internet and media issues. \\"Its political credibility and ability to lead is now being tested. \\"When the top leadership seems not resolute and clear, a smaller event moves into the national public sphere, and the state even just slightly loses control of the message in the media and Internet space.\\" For the Global Times, however, the message is clear. \\"No matter how the Chinese media is regulated, they will never become the same as their Western counterparts,\\" the government-backed media group said in an editorial. \\"This should be the basic judgment of Chinese media professionals. \\"China's political system differs from the West's, and the media cannot separate itself from a country's political reality. The only way that fits the development of Chinese media is one that can suit the country's development path.\\" According to the China Digital Times, the Central Propaganda Department has issued an urgent directive telling media groups at all levels that:. -- State-run media is an unswerving basic principle. -- The \\"mishap\\" at Southern Weekly has nothing to do with Guangdong propaganda chief Tuo Zhen. -- The incident's development is due to the \\"meddling by hostile forces\\" The directive told all editors, reporters and staff to discontinue voicing their support for the Southern Weekly and ordered all media sites to prominently republish the Global Times editorial. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"The article highlights a wave of anger against alleged government censorship at the Southern Weekly, a newspaper based in Guangzhou, China.

Answer choices: - our nearest star  - varied temperatures  - tides  - humidity  - global warming  - flow of electrons  - gravity  - Physical weathering","output":"A planet rotating causes varied temperatures on that planet. It is important to understand the various factors and processes involved in creating different temperatures on a planet, along with other related phenomena. A planet, which rotates on its axis, experiences temperature variations throughout its surface due to the distribution of sunlight received. The light emitted by the nearby star, which acts as the primary source of energy, delivers varying amounts of heat to different regions, based on their position relative to the star and the rotational axis. As a result, the answer choice related to the initial statement is: varied temperatures. However, it is worth discussing how a rotating planet may correlate to other answer choices mentioned, even if they are not directly caused by the planet's rotation. 1. Our nearest star: While a rotating planet may have its nearest star, it does not cause that star. Stars and planets are formed within stellar nurseries, and their relative distances from each other are the result of complex spatial dynamics and gravitational interactions. 2. Tides: Although the rotation of a planet indirectly affects tides, tides are primarily caused by the gravitational interaction between a planet and its celestial neighbors, such as moons or other nearby celestial bodies. 3. Humidity: Humidity is influenced by a combination of factors, including temperature and the presence of water on a planet's surface. Although the rotation-driven temperature variation plays a role in humidity, it does not solely cause it. 4. Global warming: Global warming is primarily driven by the accumulation of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, in a planet's atmosphere. While the rotation of a planet can create conditions that influence the rate of global warming, the rotating action itself does not cause it. 5. Flow of electrons: The flow of electrons in an electrical current is not related to the rotation of a planet. This flow occurs based on differences in charge or in response to an electromagnetic field, which are not inherently connected to planetary rotation. 6. Gravity: A planet's gravity is generated by its mass, not its rotation. However, a planet's rotation may result in the variation of the experienced gravitational force due to the centrifugal effect, creating a difference in the strength of gravity at the equator versus the poles. 7. Physical weathering: While the process of physical weathering can be influenced by temperature fluctuations resulting from the rotation of a planet, the actual cause of physical weathering is attributed to the forces exerted by natural elements, such as water, ice, and wind. In summary, a rotating planet causes varied temperatures on its surface due to the uneven distribution of sunlight. Although some of the other answer choices have connections to planetary rotation, such as altering tides or affecting physical weathering, they are not directly caused by the rotation itself."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data.  - Novosibirsk is the third-most populous city in Russia after Moscow and St. Petersburg.

The term derives from the ancient Roman \\"provincia\\", which was the major territorial and administrative unit of the Roman Empire's territorial possessions outside Italy. The term province has since been adopted by many countries, and in those with no actual provinces, it has come to mean \\"outside the capital city\\". While some provinces were produced artificially by colonial powers, others were formed around local groups with their own ethnic identities. Many have their own powers independent of federal authority, especially in Canada. In other countries, like China, provinces are the creation of central government, with very little autonomy.  - The Dvina Bay is located in Arkhangelsk Oblast in Northwestern Russia.

Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: HOw long was Iraq a British mandate Context: In 1922, Egypt, which had been declared a British protectorate at the outbreak of the First World War, was granted formal independence, though it continued to be a British client state until 1954. British troops remained stationed in Egypt until the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty in 1936, under which it was agreed that the troops would withdraw but continue to occupy and defend the Suez Canal zone. In return, Egypt was assisted to join the League of Nations. Iraq, a British mandate since 1920, also gained membership of the League in its own right after achieving independence from Britain in 1932. In Palestine, Britain was presented with the problem of mediating between the Arab and Jewish communities. The 1917 Balfour Declaration, which had been incorporated into the terms of the mandate, stated that a national home for the Jewish people would be established in Palestine, and Jewish immigration allowed up to a limit that would be determined by the mandatory power. This led to increasing conflict with the Arab population, who openly revolted in 1936. As the threat of war with Germany increased during the 1930s, Britain judged the support of the Arab population in the Middle East as more important than the establishment of a Jewish homeland, and shifted to a pro-Arab stance, limiting Jewish immigration and in turn triggering a Jewish insurgency. Answer:","output":"The context states that Iraq was a British mandate since 1920 and it gained independence from Britain in 1932. Therefore, Iraq was a British mandate for 12 years.  Step 1: Read the question and understand what information is needed. Step 2: Read through the context carefully, looking for the relevant information related to the question - in this case, the duration of Iraq being under British mandate. Step 3: Found the line \\"Iraq, a British mandate since 1920, also gained membership of the League in its own right after achieving independence from Britain in 1932.\\" This line gives us the start (1920) and end year (1932) of the mandate.

Aspiring to join the New Jersey State Police, he trains at the police academy, but his hypoglycemic medical condition causes him to collapse, therefore failing the exam. To shape things up for his career, Blart works as a security guard at the West Orange Pavillion Mall. Blart patrols the mall on a Segway to assure things are safe and clean. He goes to the surveillance room and trains Veck Simms (Keir O'Donnell), who is new but uninterested on the job. Meanwhile, Blart eventually becomes acquainted with Amy Anderson (Jayma Mays), the vendor of a new kiosk. He meets her one evening at a restaurant with other mall employees. Things initially go well, but Blart is sidetracked when he decides to participate in a nacho-eating contest with his friend Leon (Jamal Mixon). The hot sauce is more than Blart can handle, and he begins chugging down several alcoholic beverages causing him to become excessively drunk and incoherent. He crashes the party and makes a wild exit by falling through a window. Two days later, on the night of Black Friday, an organized gang of thugs disguised as Santa's Village employees begin what appears to be a bank heist inside the mall. They take Amy and other customers in the bank hostage. Simms is revealed as the gang's leader â his mall security job was a ploy to gather intelligence.

Paragraph: Enterotropic strains of routine coronaviruses (MHV-Y and MHV-RI) differ extensively in their pathogenesis from the prototypic respiratory strains of murine coronaviruses. In an effort to determine which viral proteins might be determinants of enterotropism, immunoblots of MHV-Y and MHV-RI virions using anti-S, -N and -M protein-specific antisera were performed. The uncleaved MHV-Y and MHV-RI S proteins migrated slightly faster than the MHV-A59 S protein. The MHV-Y S protein was inefficiently cleaved. The MHV-Y, MHV-RI and MHV-A59 N and M proteins showed only minor differences in their migration. The S genes of MHV-Y and MHV-RI were cloned, sequenced and found to encode 1361 and 1376 amino acid long proteins, respectively. The presence of several amino acids changes upstream from the predicted cleavage site of the MHV-Y S protein may contribute its inefficient cleavage. A high degree of homology was found between the MHV-RI and MHV-4 S proteins, whereas the homology between the MHV-Y S protein and the S proteins of other MHV strains was much lower. These results indicate that the enterotropism of MHV-RI and MHV-Y may be determined by different amino acid changes in the S protein and/or by changes in other viral proteins.

Article: BEIJING, Sept. 29 (Xinhua) -- Commander-in-chief of China's manned space program Chang Wanquan announced Thursday night that the launch of Tiangong-1 space lab module is successful. China's first space lab module Tiangong-1 blasted off at 9:16 p.m. Beijing Time (1316 GMT) Thursday from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest desert area. The unmanned module, carried by Long March-2FT1 rocket, will test space docking with a spacecraft later this year, _ the way for China to become the third country in the world to operate a permanent space station around 2020. The Tiangong-1 will orbit the Earth for about one month to await Shenzhou-8 unmanned spacecraft. Once the two vehicles successfully rendezvous , they will conduct the first space docking at a height of 340 kilometers above Earth surface. After two docking tests, Tiangong-1 will await Shenzhou-9 and Shenzhou-10 in the next two years, according to a plan of China's manned space program. The 8.5-tonne Tiangong-1, with a length of 10.4 meters and maximum diameter of 3.35 meters, provides a room of 15 cubic meters for two to three astronauts to live and work. Zhang Shancong, deputy chief designer of the Tiangong-1, told Xinhua that the module carries special cameras which will take hyperspectral  images of China's vast farmlands to detect heavy metal pollution and pesticide residue as well as plant disease. Moreover, scientists on the ground will also conduct experiments on photonic crystal , a new material expected to revolutionize information technology, in the low-gravity environment inside the Tiangong-1 as these experiments would be extremely difficult to conduct on Earth's surface. \\"China is clearly becoming a global power and its investments in areas like technology and space exploration reflect this,\\" said Peter Singer, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution. \\"It is a natural result of the growth in political and economic power and is to be expected,\\" said Zhou Jianping, chief designer of China's manned space program,...

B: detect pollution and pesticide residue and disease. C: provides a room for astronauts to live and work. D: operate a permanent space station. The answer is:","output":"D: Operate a permanent space station.  Although it was mentioned in the article that China has the ambition to operate a permanent space station around 2020, there was no explicit mention of Tiangong-1 being the vessel to fulfill this role.  Option A: This statement is verified in the article as it indicates that the Tiangong-1 \\"will test space docking with a spacecraft later this year\\", setting China on the path to join other world powers in advanced space operations. Option B: This is confirmed by the reference to the special cameras on Tiangong-1 that will be used to detect heavy metal pollution, pesticide residue and plant diseases. This scientific and environmental surveillance task is one of the intended functions of the Tiangong-1 module. Option C: The article affirms that Tiangong-1 provides a room of 15 cubic meters for two to three astronauts to live and work, enabling human occupancy and activities in space.

Hint: When you go to the dentist to get a tooth pulled, you really don’t want to feel any pain. The dentist injects an anesthetic into your gum and it eventually becomes numb. One theory as to why anesthetics work deals with the movement of ions across the cell membrane. The anesthetic gets into the membrane structure and causes shifts in how ions move across the membrane. If ion movement is disrupted, nerve impulses will not be transmitted and you will not sense pain – at least not until the anesthetic wears off. Answer:","output":"Jordan will not experience a disruption of ion movement in his cell membranes during the tooth extraction procedure. This is because he receives an anesthetic injection, which interferes with the movement of ions across the cell membrane. By disrupting the ion movement, nerve impulses are not transmitted, and as a result, Jordan will not sense pain during the procedure. On the other hand, Jake, who is allergic to the anesthetic, will not have any interruption in the ion movement in his cell membranes, and he is likely to experience pain during the tooth extraction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They are not as exciting as the presidential campaigns, and most Americans are just not interested in the ups and downs of individual members of Congress. But the last midterm that a president faces matter very much. President Obama knows more than anyone that he has much at stake in the midterm elections. If Republicans are able to regain control of the Senate while retaining their majority in the House in November, they will have two years to inflict significant damage on the administration's agenda and set the terms of debate for the 2016 election. In the 1998 midterm elections, OPTIONS: - Americans defied historical trends and suffered losses in the House. - CNN defied historical trends and suffered losses in the House. - Congress defied historical trends and suffered losses in the House. - Democrats defied historical trends and suffered losses in the House. - GOP defied historical trends and suffered losses in the House. - House defied historical trends and suffered losses in the House. - Julian Zelizer defied historical trends and suffered losses in the House. - Obama defied historical trends and suffered losses in the House. - Republicans defied historical trends and suffered losses in the House. - Senate defied historical trends and suffered losses in the House. - Zelizer defied historical trends and suffered losses in the House.","output":"In the 1998 midterm elections, Republicans defied historical trends and suffered losses in the House. This rare occurrence served as a reminder that not all midterm elections follow the conventional wisdom. In 1998, several external factors had contributed to these surprising results, including a strong economy and popular backlash against the impeachment process of then-President Bill Clinton. Additionally, Democratic campaigns successfully focused on key issues such as education, healthcare, and social security, which resonated with voters at the time. The 1998 midterm elections also illustrated that no party should take their voters for granted or assume that historical trends will guarantee success. Candidates must continuously demonstrate their commitment to addressing the needs and concerns of their constituents in order to secure their support. More broadly, these elections underscored the importance of staying attuned to the political landscape and being responsive to the issues that matter most to the general public. As we fast-forward to the present-day, President Obama's administration faced the realities of the 2014 midterm elections, where Republicans indeed regained control of the Senate while retaining their majority in the House. This shift in power had several significant implications for the president's second term agenda. Legislative initiatives, such as criminal justice reform, climate change measures, and proposals related to taxes and spending, faced increased opposition from a Congress dominated by Republicans. These obstacles made it more challenging for the administration to advance various policy priorities and left a lasting impact on Obama's presidential legacy. Moreover, the 2014 midterms set the stage for the 2016 presidential election, with Republicans framing the political debate. Issues such as immigration, healthcare reform, and national security became major points of contention, forcing Democratic candidates to respond accordingly. Ultimately, the lessons learned from past midterm elections dictated the importance of voter engagement, staying focused on key issues, and never underestimating the potential for surprises in the ever-changing political landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer a question about this article: In the early 1980s, Downtown Manhattan's no wave scene transitioned from its abrasive origins into a more dance-oriented sound, with compilations such as ZE's Mutant Disco (1981) highlighting a newly playful sensibility borne out of the city's clash of hip hop, disco and punk styles, as well as dub reggae and world music influences. Artists such as Liquid Liquid, the B-52s, Cristina, Arthur Russell, James White and the Blacks and Lizzy Mercier Descloux pursued a formula described by Luc Sante as \\"anything at all + disco bottom\\". The decadent parties and art installations of venues such as Club 57 and the Mudd Club became cultural hubs for musicians and visual artists alike, with figures such as Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring and Michael Holman frequenting the scene. Other no wave-indebted groups such as Swans, Glenn Branca, the Lounge Lizards, Bush Tetras and Sonic Youth instead continued exploring the early scene's forays into noise and more abrasive territory. What did Downtown Manhattan's no wave scene transition into?","output":"Downtown Manhattan's no wave scene in the early 1980s transitioned from its abrasive beginnings into a more dance-oriented sound that melded various musical styles and influences. This new direction was characterized by a playful sensibility, resulting from the fusion of hip hop, disco, punk, dub reggae, and world music influences. Compilations such as ZE's Mutant Disco (1981) showcased this emerging sound and approach. Several artists from this period pursued a formula described by Luc Sante as \\"anything at all + disco bottom,\\" which entailed combining unconventional or experimental elements with a disco-inspired rhythmic foundation. Key figures in this transitional phase included Liquid Liquid, the B-52s, Cristina, Arthur Russell, James White and the Blacks, and Lizzy Mercier Descloux. This period witnessed a flourishing of creativity not just in music but also in the arts and social scene. Venues such as Club 57 and the Mudd Club became cultural hubs where musicians and visual artists mingled, collaborated, and exchanged ideas. Influential artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, and Michael Holman were regulars in these spaces, contributing to the vibrant creative atmosphere. At the same time, some groups continued to explore the no wave scene's initial focus on noise and more abrasive soundscapes. Artists like Swans, Glenn Branca, the Lounge Lizards, Bush Tetras, and Sonic Youth drew inspiration from no wave's roots, pushing boundaries and experimenting further with atonal and dissonant musical elements. Thus, the Downtown Manhattan no wave scene evolved into a multifaceted, genre-blending movement that left a lasting impact on the subsequent generations of artists and musicians."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize this article: Animal rights activists circulated photos of the husband and wife team behind Cafe Gratitude and Gracias Madre eating a burger and keeping freezer full of beef      The California-based husband and wife founders of celebrity-endorsed vegan restaurant group Cafe Gratitude say they have received death threats after it was revealed last week that they are raising, slaughtering and eating animals on their farm north of San Francisco.      Matthew and Terces Engelhart, both in their sixties, who opened the first Cafe Gratitude in 2004 and whose celebrity followers have included Gwyneth Paltrow, Beyoncé and Sacha Baron Cohen, countered the firestorm of criticism with a defense of the “regenerative agriculture” methods they now use on their Be Love Farm in Vacaville, calling it a personal choice made in the privacy of their home.      You can't be 'a little bit vegan' Read more      “We started to observe nature and what we saw is that nature doesn’t exist without animals,” Matthew Engelhart told the Hollywood Reporter last week after animal rights activists dug up and circulated blog entries from spring 2015 from the farm’s website, including photos of a freezer full of pastured beef, jars of gravy and Matthew enjoying a hamburger, with posts on their “transition” into meat products after nearly 40 years of vegetarianism.      “People have taken up the mob mentality,” he opined, after protesters gathered outside their restaurants holding signs such as “no animal is grateful to die”, started a Facebook boycott page and frantically posted one-star Yelp reviews.      “Cows make an extreme sacrifice for humanity but that is their position in God’s plan as food for the predators,” Matthew Engelhart added in a statement about their decision. “We can be part of that sacrament.”      Terces Engelhart tends to the animals at Be Love Farm in this photograph from April 2011. The farm supplies produce to the Engelharts’ restaurants. Photograph: Adithya Sambamurthy for the Guardian      But purist vegans who patronized the several southern California branches of the cafe, despite or perhaps because of its irritatingly named “affirmation” dishes such the “accepting” sushi bowl and the “grateful” kale salad, will not be assuaged so easily. “Fxxxing HYPOCRITES!!!! Hope they will be FLAME BURNED and eaten by Meat Eaters,” screams one post on the Facebook boycott page. “They are duping vegans to support their animal killings,” says another.      The Engelharts spawned an entire industry with a carefully marketed message of peace, love and sharing, which includes a sister vegan Mexican restaurant, Gracias Madre, in San Francisco and Los Angeles.      The couple have written several books, including Sacred Commerce: Business as a Path of Awakening and Kindred Spirit: Fulfilling Love’s Promise. Their personal website is named Eternal Presence and references the board game they created in 2004, called The Abounding River Board Game, which was on every table in their San Francisco flagship; and which they said would train players to embrace “an unfamiliar view of Being Abundant” and develop a “spiritual foundation” for looking at money.      A Be Love Farm blogpost from February last year highlights the “big week” when they transitioned into meat products.      “That transition is happening deep within our beings, we know it is a necessary and important part of our growth as well as the sustainability of our farm ... as we open our hearts further to the presence of love ... ” The page features photos of their new beef products alongside a bucolic shot of their cows “sitting down chewing their cud in the warm Spring breeze”.            The couple are no strangers to controversy.      Eating too much red meat ‘can age the body’, researchers claim Read more      In 2011, they cited a series of “aggressive lawsuits” by disgruntled employees as the reason for having to close or sell their eight Cafe Gratitude restaurants in the Bay Area. The lawsuits challenged the restaurants’ tip-pooling practices and alleged unpaid overtime wages. At the time they wrote on their Facebook page that it would cost too much to defend themselves in court.      Another lawsuit was filed by an employee, alleging he was fired after refusing to attend the controversial San Francisco-based Landmark Forum self-improvement course and an offshoot of Werner Erhard’s self-realization program.      In the end, the Engelhart’s settled, selling or giving some of the restaurants to family members, including Terces’ son by a previous marriage, Matthew, who works at the LA restaurant. The couple reportedly met at a Landmark Forum seminar after Terces (which is “secret” spelled backwards) had fled a conventional life in Santa Cruz with her IBM manager husband and children, selling all their belongings and loading up an RV and hitting the road, reportedly heading for Durango, Colorado.      That was in 1992. Her daughter Mollie from that marriage now runs a vegan beer garden in LA, with business partner and actor Woody Harrelson, as well as KindKreme, a vegan ice cream parlour.      LA-based activist Mary Cummins, founder of Animal Advocates, claims that the Engelharts have been influenced by the controversial views of Allan Savory, the Zimbabwean ecologist and author of Holistic Management, which advocates using livestock on grasslands as the only way to reverse climate change and avoid widespread destruction of these lands. (The idea has its detractors – George Monbiot in the Guardian – and supporters – Hunter Lovins also in the Guardian.)      Meantime, none of this seems likely to mollify the outraged vegans and it is unclear how this will affect the Engelhart empire, which serves 28,000 meals a day and offers an array of events and packages for families and corporations alike on their Be Love farm. Whether parents will still want their kids to pet Carmella and Cinnamon, two of their cows, after learning about the freezer full of meat is unclear.       ||||| What a wonderful week it was on the farm. Our great friends who own Ca Momi in Napa gifted us with some of their truly delicious pizzas and profiteroles to make my recovery from a surgical procedure easier on me. I was so grateful for the added rest and kindness. I then got inspired to make my own profiteroles since we have this amazing farm cream and voila, see them in the picture above. Here I am piping them onto the parchment paper getting ready to bake them.      Matthew continued his pruning of all the trees while the boys, Jaxon and Jack put mulch around the base of the trees. You can see that the almonds are in full bloom and the nectarine blossoms are coming on in their beautiful pinks!      It was a big week as we begin to make the transition into our own meat products after nearly 40 years of vegetarianism. While I would clearly say we are in transition and that transition is happening deep within our beings, we know it is a necessary and important part of our own growth as well as the sustainability of our farm. Certainly a part of us wants to either deny the inevitability of death or simply not let ourselves get present to the reality of it, for our animals as well as ourselves. But we know that while we die a little bit each day as we open our hearts further to the presence of love, and as we are the caretakers of our farm animals the responsibility for their health and well being lies with us. This is clearly a longer discussion and we invite you to one of our upcoming farm dinners over the next 9 months, where we share more about this process.

Matthew and Terces Engelhart, owners of the famous celebrity-patroned Cafe Gratitude and Gracias Madre restaurants, have been receving death threats from activists after they started circulating blog posts from the couple’s Be Love Farm in northern California that show the couple raising cattle, according to what they told the Hollywood Reporter.      “They are duping vegans to support their animal killings,” activist Chase Avior, who organized protests at the southern California restaurants, told the Hollywood Reporter.      The Engleharts started the first Cafe Gratitude in San Francisco in 2004 before opening more vegan restaurants in southern California around 2011, riding the wave of consumer demand for healthy, sustainable food.      The restaurants are known for being celebrity hotspots — Emma Stone, Andrew Garfield, Kerry Washington, Jay Z, and Beyonce have all been spotted enjoying their vegan dishes.      Cafe Gratitude owners Matthew and Terces Engelhart are under fire after the California based vegan restaurateurs were found to have returned to eating meat. (Ashley Dentino/via YouTube)      The firestorm over the owners’ carnivorism started when vigilant vegans got a hold of a 14-month old blog post stating the couple’s decision to end their 40 years of vegetarianism and begin what they call “regenerative agriculture.”      The post included photos showing freezers full of beef at their farm, jars of beef stock and of Matthew Engelhart enjoying a hamburger.      “We started to observe nature and what we saw is that nature doesn’t exist without animals,” Matthew Engelhart told the Hollywood Reporter last week, as an explanation for their transition.      Outraged animal rights activists weren’t so forgiving of their change in diet calling it “regenerative bulls--t!” on a Facebook page dedicated to boycotting the restaurant and organizing protests.      Cafe Gratitude in Venice, Calif. is a known celebrity hotspot. (Rick Loomis/LA Times via Getty Images)      Protesters also left a slew of one-star Yelp reviews on the popular eatery’s site.      “I’m GRATEFUL that I know they’re s--theads!” wrote one commenter. \\"Here's a new dish for Cafe Gratitude - I Am MURDERER!!!\\" another person wrote.      Numerous protests have taken place outside their restaurants — with demonstrators carrying signs that called the restaurateurs “hypocrites” as leaders in the vegan community and others that said “no animal is grateful to die,” as a play on the restaurant's name.      “People have taken up the mob mentality,” Matthew Engelhart bemoaned.      Sign up for BREAKING NEWS Emails privacy policy Thanks for subscribing! ||||| The owners of the most prominent vegan restaurant chain in Los Angeles were found to be raising and \\"harvesting\\" animals at their Northern California farm. Now Hollywood's vegan community is angry, and death threats have been made. \\"People have taken up the mob mentality,\\" says Cafe Gratitude owner Matthew Engelhart.      L.A.'s vegan vortex has angrily turned on the most prominent vegan restaurant group in town this week as word has spread that its owners are not just eating meat but raising and slaughtering animals at the working farm where they live in Northern California.      Matthew and Terces Engelhart, the husband-and-wife proprietors of favored entertainment industry haunt Cafe Gratitude, tell The Hollywood Reporter they've been receiving death threats as part of a quickly growing, internet-bred campaign against them. It has also spawned a deluge of one-star reviews on their local outposts' respective Yelp pages, a boycott group on Facebook that tallies 571 members at press time and plans now underway for a protest at the Larchmont Village location on Friday at 7 p.m.      \\"People have taken up the mob mentality,\\" says Matthew. \\"It saddens me that the choices we made in the privacy of our home would lead people to feel so betrayed that it's elevated to threats on our lives. I'm very discouraged.\\"      The trouble began last week when animal rights activists discovered and then widely circulated a 14-month-old blog post written by Terces on the Engelharts' Be Love Farm website, which mixed an announcement of their transition back into a meat diet again after nearly 40 years of vegetarianism (they had been vegan since 2003) with posted pictures of strained beef broth and a freezer full of pastured beef from their own dairy cows. Matthew tells THR they have kept chickens on the farm for seven years \\"for eggs only,\\" along with the cows for five years for milk, cheese and butter that's for sale. (He claims they've \\"harvested,\\" or slaughtered, several cows in total and never sold the meat, only shared it with \\"our friends, neighbors and community.\\")      The news has come as a shock to many vegans, who have been regular customers of the restaurants and claim the Engelharts have built their brand on not just serving vegan food but clearly wrapping themselves in the righteousness of the vegan cause — which they argue has now been undermined. \\"The reason we're so upset is that veganism is a belief system,\\" says Carrie Christianson, who started the Facebook boycott group. \\"You are patronizing a restaurant that you think has that philosophy, and it turns out it doesn't. Vegans should know that this restaurant has a farm that slaughters animals.\\"      The Engelharts launched the first Cafe Gratitude in San Francisco in 2004. The mini-chain began colonizing Southern California in 2011 with the on-the-ground help of their manager sons from different marriages, Ryland Engelhart and Cary Mosier, beginning with a location in Larchmont Village, followed by outposts in Venice and downtown L.A.'s Arts District (as well as locations in San Diego and Newport Beach). Investors such as musician Jason Mraz have backed them. (A newer sister concept, Gracias Madre, which serves \\"meatless Mexican\\" fare, opened in 2014 in West Hollywood; their daughter, Mollie, co-owns Culver City's separate Sage Organic Vegan Bistro — which also purchases from Be Love Farm — with Woody Harrelson.)      Cafe Gratitude is known for giving dishes names that are self-affirmations. The most popular include the \\"I Am Whole\\" macrobiotic sea-vegetable rice and a curried lentil assemblage called \\"I Am Humble.\\" The locations have become a solid entertainment industry draw for business lunches, as well as a reliable celebrity nexus. Customers range from Beyonce Knowles and Sacha Baron Cohen to Ariana Grande and Jake Gyllenhaal.      The Engelharts frame their return to \\"sustainable, regenerative\\" animal consumption as the mindful culmination of years spent laboring on their upstate farm. \\"We started to observe nature, and what we saw is that nature doesn't exist without animals,\\" says Matthew. \\"Neither does natural farming. You know, you can't buy organic vegetables that aren't fertilized with animal residue. So that was our discovery. We aren't on a soapbox.\\"      Yet while the Engelharts are at pains to paint their decision as a private and personal rural journey separate from their public work at their urban restaurants, their critics find the reasoning specious, believing the enterprises, the figureheads and their choices are inextricably bound. \\"This is a vegan restaurant company that's been a leader in the vegan community,\\" says Chase Avior, a screenwriter and director who is organizing the Friday protest. \\"If they're going to go around and say it's not about animal rights, it's not about speaking about the animals horrifically abused, it's just about better nurturing a plant-based lifestyle, that's something different. A lot of vegans have a right to feel betrayed by this.\\"      Still, the couple's vegan supporters think the fury is misplaced. \\"Boycott factory farming — something that will make a real difference to the cause,\\" says Rainbeau Mars, author of The 21-Day SuperStar Cleanse and, along with Ryland Engelhart, a board member at Venice-based healthy-soil nonprofit Kiss the Ground. \\"And as for their own personal diets, would we stop supporting the Dalai Lama because he eats meat? Or stop supporting the organic farmer who grows your tomatoes because she eats meat?\\"      After that interview, Mars wrote a long follow-up email to THR to clarify her position (\\"despite needing to go teach a yoga class on the helicopter pad of the Four Seasons this morning and head out of town this evening\\"). In it, Mars explains how she has worked in \\"service to greater humanity\\" and preaches a sort of compassion. \\"I feel we should support the leaders in our community that are sharing charity and compassion, health and community activism such as the founders of Cafe Gratitude and Gracias Madre,\\" she says. \\"I invite us all to not point the finger at others but look at ourselves.\\"      Such thinking doesn't sit well with others who have spoken out about the Engelharts' choices at Be Love Farm, which according to the couple these days supplies only a limited amount of fruits and vegetables to the restaurants. One of them is the musician Moby, who opened his own vegan restaurant five months ago in Silver Lake called Little Pine. \\"I sincerely hope that they discontinue their practice of raising and killing animals for food,\\" he wrote on Facebook.      Meanwhile, Cooking Channel personality and raw food chef Jason Wrobel (his clients include Robin Wright and Jeremy Piven) penned a long open letter on his website, echoing many online sentiments: \\"People feel misled, deliberately lied to and that a business they've so lovingly supported for many years has lost its way. I feel that my hard-earned money has been used for purposes that are unethical, cruel and out-of-alignment with my values. And I strongly feel that a more public announcement from the company should have been made about the practices at the farm, not tucked away in some obscure blog post.\\"      For their part, the Engelharts profess to be perplexed by the dissent. \\"I don't think there's any organization on the planet that's done more to promote a plant-based diet than us,\\" says Matthew. \\"We've moved it from a dogma to a genre. We serve 28,000 meals a week in all of our enterprises. We've done nothing but a plant-based diet at our restaurants and we're being attacked. It doesn't make sense to me.\\"      Their critics aren't satisfied, despite their record. \\"I eat at non-vegan restaurants all the time,\\" says Elana Lavine, who runs the L.A. healthy lifestyle blog Klean Slate. \\"Just don't claim to be something you're not. They're slaughtering animals! And there's been a lack of total transparency about it on the restaurant side. It looks kind of shady, like they are hiding things. And there was always that cloud around them when it came to the cult thing.\\"      The \\"cult thing\\" has left customers leery in the past. The couple, who like to say they practice \\"sacred commerce,\\" had to close their Northern California locations in 2010 in the midst of lawsuit battles, one related to a policy encouraging allegedly illegal tip-pooling and another stemming from a mandate that their employee get involved with the controversial personal-betterment organization Landmark Forum, a successor to Werner Erhard's 1970s self-help program EST, which centered on a unique style of session therapy that was recently dramatized on FX's period spy show The Americans. Both iterations have been criticized for their aggressive recruitment tactics.      The Engelharts, who met while attending Landmark Forum, believe they're being held up to a dogmatic purity standard — one that, in the scheme of their contributions to veganism, is entirely unfair. \\"Somehow we got made mom and dad of some vegan movement,\\" says Matthew. \\"We never signed up for that. It's crazy. Do [the protestors] check in on the diets of every other vegan restaurant owner? Do they check in on the diets of the owners of Whole Foods? We are baffled. And believe me there are lots of vegan enterprises where the principals are not vegan, or they have other enterprises that are not vegan.\\" He goes on, \\"I am allowed to change my mind. And by the way, I never even told them what my mind was. All I told them was it's a vegan restaurant. And it still is! And it always will be!\\" ||||| Chandra Gilbert      EXECUTIVE CHEF      With the arrival of Gracias Madre in Los Angeles, Chef Chandra Gilbert finds themself once again featuring bold flavors and seasonally-conscious ingredients. The veteran chef, who has 33 years of experience working in the restaurant industry; including stints at Alice Waters' Café Fanny in Berkeley, Cowgirl Creamery and Greens Restaurant in San Francisco; has been with the Café Gratitude family since 2004 when they began working as Director of Operations for the esteemed family of vegan restaurants in the Bay Area. It was during that time that the idea for Gracias Madre began entering into the conversation with Café Gratitude Founders Matthew and Terces Engelhart. Together, they co-designed the restaurant's aesthetic and co-created the menu featuring produce from the Engelhart's Be Love Farm in Vacaville, bringing Gilbert's dream to fruition with Gracias Madre's San Francisco opening in 2009. The restaurant, located in San Francisco's Mission District, quickly garnered critical acclaim for its vibrant interpretation of Mexican cuisine. With the opening of Gracias Madre in West Hollywood in January 2014, Gilbert brings that passion to Los Angeles with a menu that blends produce from Be Love Farm with ingredients sourced from local farmers markets. ||||| Crawl of outlinks from wikipedia.org started March, 2016.

It started off with a trip to Los Angeles for the training of 112 new employees for the upcoming opening of the new Cafe Gratitude in the Arts District of downtown LA. Whenever we think, “really more employees, more food, more….. we stop and put our attention on the employees of the past who have become such amazing, inspiring, leaders in the world, and that always has us sign up for the next Cafe. Thank you to all those who keep our attention on what matters most, the opening of hearts, the expansion of love, the right livelihood of our work place… you make all the difference.            On our lunch break at the new employee training, look what showed up to entertain us all!      Fortunately my trips to LA include a snuggle with my two newest grandsons, Valentine (6 months) and Rio (2 months).            pretty precious. Being a grandmother is the BEST EVER!      This week on the farm we harvested some GIANT lettuce… see the first picture of my sweet husband holding one of the giant heads! We also cooked our first hamburgers, see Matthew eating his first in over 40 years! I promise this transition has been challenging and insightful and we are ever so thankful for the sacrifice that our cows made.            Here is Matthew’s response to someone’s questioning our adding meat to our diet, a great question.      Perhaps I’ve e failed to explain adequately why I would pursue the path of eating flesh after 40 years of vegetarianism. The answer is non-violence but non-violence to the whole system, all species. Agriculture is most violent destructive force on the planet. It has caused the extinction of more species then any other activity. Earth balance margarine is made from Canadian canola. Organic or not this product required a plow to destroy Canadian prairie an act of violence against burrowing owls, ferrets, prairie dogs, dozens of insect and bird species. If that prairie had been maintained in grassland with well managed cows or buffalo those species would not be killed or displaced.      30% of the world’s surface is grasslands, Grasslands need herds of ruminants to thrive, when they are removed, the grasslands degenerate into desert. Desertification is violence against all species including humans. The conflict in Syria and Iraq can be easily tied to desertification, mismanaged soil. Herding ruminants are our best tool to restore fertility to the earth, keep the earth covered, and reverse desertification and climate change. If I knew of a better or even another solution, I would choose it. We need cows to keep the earth alive, cows make an extreme sacrifice for humanity but that is their position in God’s plan as food for the predators. Cows maintain the grass, predators maintain the herd by culling the weak and sick. We can be part of that sacrament. Sacrifice is part of life. As in the passion of Christ, we all have to spill our blood for humanity to know the Father. The cow’s sacrifice was been ordained, ours we must choose.      Wendell Berry quote:      “To live we must daily break the body and shed the blood of Creation. When we do it knowingly, lovingly, skillfully, reverently, it is a sacrament. When we do it ignorantly, greedily, clumsily, destructively it is a desecration.”      We attended a Allan Savory workshop on a neighboring farm this week and I had the privileged of sitting next to him at dinner. We had an inspiring conversation about “biltong” a South African style of dried beef and he taught me how to make it the real way. Here it is drying.            Legend has it that Biltong is the food that gets credit for the strength of the men in South Africa, it is a peppery salted cured meat, made from the muscle cuts.      Again I remind you all that we feel like vegan ism is a great response the the abuse of animals in the industrial food system, AND that animals raised in a healthy and humane way are a great source of nutrition for humans. It is so important that we bridge the gap of “knowing our food” and don’t sell out for distancing ourselves from the full cycle of life and death.      This week I am reminded of the power of God’s grace and the importance of letting it in.      Breathe.      Love. Terces      P.S. Flashback… look at these photos of cold brewed coffee and almond milk, now sold in grocery stores… 11 years ago this month when we opened our first Cafe Gratitude in the Mission District of San Francisco, people would ask us daily, “How do you get milk out of an almond?” and “What is cold brewed coffee?” We’ve come a long way baby!       |||||","output":"The founders of celebrity-endorsed vegan restaurant chain, Cafe Gratitude, claim to have received death threats from animal rights activists after admitting that they raise, slaughter and eat animals on their farm in Vacaville, California.

We have the equation:  6 * s = 30 * s + 25 * s - 147 First, we need to add the terms with s on the right side of the equation. 30 * s + 25 * s = (30 + 25) * s = 55 * s  Now, our equation looks like this: 6 * s = 55 * s - 147 Next, we want to get all the s terms on one side of the equation. So, we will subtract 6 * s from both sides: 55 * s - 6 * s = 147  This simplifies to: 49 * s = 147 Now, we need to solve for s. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 49: s = 147 / 49 Finally, we find out that: s = 3 So, the solution to the math problem is s = 3."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the names of the two houses of the Indian Parliament?, using the article: Karnataka has a parliamentary system of government with two democratically elected houses, the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council.

Since 2013, the group members are Anthony Field, Lachlan Gillespie, Simon Pryce, and Emma Watkins.  The original members were Field, Phillip Wilcher, Murray Cook, Greg Page, and Jeff Fatt. Wilcher left the group after their first album. Page retired in 2006 due to ill health and was replaced by understudy Sam Moran, but returned in 2012, replacing Moran. At the end of 2012, Page, Cook, and Fatt retired, and were replaced by Gillespie, Pryce, and Watkins. Cook and Fatt retained their shareholding in the group and all three continued to have input into its creative and production aspects. Field and Fatt were members of the Australian pop band The Cockroaches in the 1980s, and Cook was a member of several bands before meeting Field and Page at Macquarie University, where they were studying to become pre-school teachers. In 1991, Field was inspired to create an album of children's music based upon concepts of early childhood education, and enlisted Cook, Page, and Fatt to assist him. They began touring to promote the album, and became so successful, they quit their teaching jobs to perform full-time.  The group augmented their act with animal characters Dorothy the Dinosaur, Henry the Octopus, and Wags the Dog, as well as the character Captain Feathersword, played by Paul Paddick since 1993.  They travelled with a small group of dancers, which later grew into a larger troupe. The group's DVDs, CDs, and television programs have been produced independently since their inception.  Their high point came in the early 2000s, after they broke into the American market. The group was formally consolidated in 2005.

Context: There is disagreement about the origin of the term, but general consensus that \\"cardinalis\\" from the word cardo (meaning 'pivot' or 'hinge') was first used in late antiquity to designate a bishop or priest who was incorporated into a church for which he had not originally been ordained. In Rome the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century, when the word began to mean “principal,” “eminent,” or \\"superior.\\" The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the \\"title\\" churches (the parish churches) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city. By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy. They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy. By decree of a synod of 769, only a cardinal was eligible to become pope. In 1059, during the pontificate of Nicholas II, cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under the Papal Bull In nomine Domini. For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops, but the Third Lateran Council in 1179 gave back the right to the whole body of cardinals. Cardinals were granted the privilege of wearing the red hat by Pope Innocent IV in 1244.","output":"The previous occupations of first generation cardinals were bishops, priests, and deacons of the seven regions of the city of Rome."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself. In this article, I’m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older...

Write an article that answers the following question: Where there more Native Americans or African Americans in the city?","output":"Title: African Americans and Native Americans in the City: A Comparative Analysis Introduction Cities across the United States showcase a diverse range of residents that reflect the nation's rich cultural, ethnic, and historical heritage. Among these populations are Native Americans and African Americans, who have played significant roles in shaping the country's history and identity. In this article, we will explore the demographic composition of these two groups in urban areas, examining whether there are more Native Americans or African Americans in cities across the United States. Step 1: Data Collection To answer the question of whether there are more Native Americans or African Americans in the city, it is essential to gather reliable and up-to-date demographic data. The primary source for such information is the United States Census Bureau, which conducts a decennial census and provides ongoing data updates on various demographic indicators. Additionally, city-specific demographic studies, published by official government agencies or reputable research institutions, can serve as valuable supplementary sources to provide localized insights. Step 2: Data Analysis Once the necessary demographic data has been collected, the next step would be to analyze the information and draw meaningful comparisons between the populations of Native Americans and African Americans in urban areas across the United States. This could involve looking at absolute numbers, as well as calculating the percentage of each group within the overall urban population. Step 3: Interpretation and Contextualization After analyzing the data, the relative sizes of the African American and Native American urban populations can be determined. However, to better understand the significance of these findings, it is crucial to place them within the broader historical and social context. This may involve exploring the factors that have contributed to the present demographic composition, such as historical migration trends, urbanization patterns, and the impact of various socioeconomic and political events. Step 4: Addressing the Question With the data analysis and contextual understanding complete, we can now address the original question: Are there more Native Americans or African Americans in cities across the United States? Based on the most recent available data from the United States Census Bureau, African Americans outnumber Native Americans in the majority of cities across the country. As of 2019, African Americans accounted for approximately 12.3% of the U.S. population, while Native Americans constituted around 1.3%. Furthermore, African Americans are more likely to be concentrated in urban areas, compared to Native Americans, who often have higher proportions of their population residing in rural regions or on reservations. The historical reasons for these differences are multifaceted. African Americans have been disproportionately impacted by the legacies of slavery and segregation, which have contributed to their urbanization and concentration in cities throughout the United States. Meanwhile, the forced relocation of Native Americans through various policies, including the Indian Removal Act of 1830, has led to the establishment of reservations and confinement of their populations away from cities. Conclusion While both African Americans and Native Americans have contributed to the rich tapestry of urban life, it is clear that African Americans significantly outnumber Native Americans in cities across the United States. Nevertheless, understanding the history and complexities behind this demographic distribution can help to create more inclusive and equitable policies for both groups. By fostering an environment that celebrates diversity and encourages the empowerment of different multicultural voices, our cities can continue to evolve as vibrant and dynamic spaces for all who inhabit them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Some days, don't you think, \\"Wouldn't it be nice if the laundry would just do itself?\\" Self-cleaning clothes may sound crazy. But Australian researchers have found a way to make something like this possible! A team at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, found a way to put special nanostructures   into clothing, which can then clean the clothes. When sunlight hits the nanostructures, they break down the dirt and stains   that don't belong on your clothes. The nanostructures don't break down the actual clothing because cotton and the other clothing materials are too strong to be broken down. According to CNN, the researchers cover the clothing in a solution made of silver and copper   nanostructures. All it takes is 40 minutes of sunlight and your clothes will look as good as new. So if you spill on yourself during lunch, you can step outside for a walk, and it will be clean by the time you go inside. It not only makes your life easier, but it can also be good for the environment. According to the US Department of Energy, the average load of laundry uses about 25 gallons (about 94 liters) of water. Water is a very important resource, so using less of it to wash clothes is better for the environment. But one of the scientists at RMIT University knows more needs to be done. \\"There's more work to do before we can start throwing out our washing machines,\\" said Dr Rajesh Ramanathan, \\"but this is a strong foundation  .\\" So what's the next step? Ramanathan wants to either start selling the solution by itself or convincing   clothing makers to treat the clothing with the solution while clothes are being made.

Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget.  It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. According to the above context, answer the following question. When does the author advise that adding super foods should occur after beginning clean eating? Answer:","output":"The author does not specify an exact time when you should start adding superfoods to your clean eating diet. Instead, they emphasize that while superfoods are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet, you don't have to incorporate them immediately when starting clean eating. The focus should be on buying and consuming clean foods that you can afford. Once your budget allows or you find affordable sources of superfoods, you can then consider adding them to your diet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass. The main thing I learnt from the filming process was that you can plan out exactly what you want to do, and how your going to do it, but once you get into the location with the actors this plan often changes – however, you are still much better of having the plan than none at all! As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked. Of course no one else was interested in spending an entire night shooting the film – but with them as stands in – just so I could complete my psychotic endeavour of...

McCallum, 45, said he was feeling mixed emotions because his fellow convict, Willie Stuckey, had passed away behind bars in 2001 before he could see their names cleared. It's 'a bittersweet moment, because I'm walking out alone,' he told reporters outside the court. Overwhelmed: David McCallum is comforted by Rosia Nealy, the mother of  fellow convict Willie Stuckey, after their convictions were thrown out in Brooklyn  on Wednesday. McCallum has been in prison for 29 years Back up:","output":"David McCallum, a New Yorker who spent 29 years in prison after being wrongfully convicted of murder, was finally set free after his conviction was overturned by Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Matthew D'Emic on Wednesday. McCallum, 45, has spent nearly two-thirds of his life behind bars for a crime he did not commit, and understandably, he was emotional when the decision was announced. Upon hearing the news, McCallum sobbed into his hands, overwhelmed by the realization that he would finally be allowed to walk free after so many years spent in prison. He admitted to feeling mixed emotions about the situation, as his fellow convict and friend, Willie Stuckey, was not alive to see their names cleared and share the moment. Stuckey had passed away behind bars in 2001, and McCallum described the experience as \\"a bittersweet moment, because I'm walking out alone.\\" After his release, McCallum was comforted by Rosia Nealy, the mother of Willie Stuckey. The two shared a moment of shared grief and relief, knowing that justice had finally been served, albeit too late for Stuckey. McCallum's wrongful conviction serves as a stark reminder of the flaws in the criminal justice system, and how it can sometimes fail those who are innocent. Throughout his time in prison, McCallum maintained his innocence and tried to appeal the decision, but faced numerous obstacles and setbacks. It was not until his case was picked up by a team of dedicated attorneys, including high-profile lawyer and exoneration advocate, that he finally found hope for his release. Several factors contributed to McCallum's wrongful conviction, including coerced confessions, potential misconduct by the officers and detectives involved in the case, and a lack of solid corroborating evidence. His and Stuckey's convictions greatly relied on their confessions, which they claimed were extracted under duress. The legal team working to exonerate McCallum was able to present new evidence that cast significant doubt on the legitimacy of the case against him, eventually leading to his conviction being vacated. David McCallum's story is both a heart-wrenching illustration of the human cost of wrongful convictions and a powerful reminder of the importance of pursuing justice even when the odds may seem insurmountable. His release after 29 years in prison is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the tireless dedication of those who work to ensure that innocent individuals are not left to languish behind bars. As McCallum begins the process of rebuilding his life, support is expected to come from various quarters, including the legal team who fought for his release, as well as his friends and family who never gave up hope. His journey of healing and reintegration into society serves as a beacon of hope for others who may find themselves in a similar situation, encouraging them to keep fighting for their right to freedom and justice. In conclusion, David McCallum's release is a bittersweet moment for him and for the family of his fellow convict, Willie Stuckey. It demonstrates the shortcomings in the criminal justice system but also shows the power of perseverance, the importance of seeking truth and justice, and the significance of offering support to individuals who have been wrongfully imprisoned. McCallum's long-awaited exoneration serves as a cautionary tale for law enforcement, prosecutors, and the public and is a rallying cry for the need to improve the criminal justice system to minimize such miscarriages of justice in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Vehicles being developed that can automatically steer, brake, accelerate, and change lanes. Google, Daimler and Nissan are a few of the firms testing this technology. Driverless trucks could aid businesses by running around the clock. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: The Future of Automotive Technology: The Rise of Driverless Vehicles Introduction:  Technology has rapidly evolved in recent years, with tremendous advancements in various fields of life. One of the areas where we see remarkable advances is the automotive industry. Companies like Google, Daimler, and Nissan are pushing the boundaries of technology by testing driverless vehicles that can autonomously steer, brake, accelerate, and even change lanes. This article will explore the development of these groundbreaking vehicles and discuss how they could revolutionize businesses by providing round-the-clock services. Step 1: Unveiling the Technology To write about the technology involved in the development of driverless vehicles, we must first touch on the advancements made by Google, Daimler, and Nissan. These companies have been testing their autonomous vehicle systems, which rely on a combination of sensors, cameras, and advanced software to interpret the real-time traffic and road conditions. The sophisticated algorithms allow the vehicle to make split-second decisions, navigating the roads safely without any human intervention. Step 2: Highlighting the Benefits of Autonomous Vehicles  Autonomous and driverless vehicles come with numerous advantages such as increased safety, fuel efficiency, and reduced emissions resulting from the precise control of acceleration and braking. In addition, driverless trucks have the potential to reshape the transportation industry by enabling businesses to operate around the clock. This could lead to improved efficiency and higher revenue for companies.

This is not how it was meant to be for a boy raised in New York City, nourished on the American dream that hard work and a good education would bring rewards and riches. So what did he do? He left. After researching job vacancies abroad, an opportunity in reclusive North Korea grabbed his attention. Deciding his ambitions didn't stretch that far, Levine settled on a teaching job at Beijing's Tsinghua University instead. \\"In the (United) States everyone is so mopey -- it is the end of the world, no jobs, and income inequality is through the roof. We're back to the gilded age in the U.S,\\" he said.

There's no information in the passage about specific individuals, other places, or companies that would suggest they should be the subject of the sentence. It would not make sense for a place like Beijing or an entity like CNN or the American dream to have a company that could invest in outsourcing. Also, it wouldn't be the \\"end of the world's company\\" or \\"United's company\\" because those are phrases or words used in the passage but are not people who can own companies. Other individuals mentioned like the Governor or Obama or Romney could theoretically have companies but there's no hint in the passage that they'd be relevant to the story.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -49*r - 91*r + 140 = 0 for r.","output":"To solve the given equation -49*r - 91*r + 140 = 0 for r, we will first combine the like terms and then isolate the variable r. Here's the step-by-step solution to the problem: Given Equation: -49*r - 91*r + 140 = 0 Step 1: Combine the like terms (terms with the same variable r). -49*r and -91*r are the like terms, and by adding them, we get: -49*r + (-91*r) = -140*r Now, our equation becomes: -140*r + 140 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable (r) by adding 140*r to both sides of the equation. -140*r + 140*r + 140 = 0 + 140*r 140 = 140*r Step 3: Divide by the coefficient of the variable (in this case, 140) to determine the value of r. 140 = 140*r 140/140 = r Step 4: Simplify the equation. 1 = r So, the solution for the given equation -49*r - 91*r + 140 = 0 is r = 1."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jerusalem (CNN) -- As the United Nations was preparing Friday to debate a resolution branding Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank as illegal, Palestinian officials called Obama administration efforts to head off the vote as evidence that American policy is \\"biased\\" and \\"seriously wrong.\\" \\"This is a moment of truth because very clearly the Americans so far have placed their strategic alliance with Israel and the legal cover for Israeli violations above their own interests,\\" said veteran Palestinian legislator and PLO executive committee member Hanan Ashrawi. \\"The Americans have very clearly demonstrated to Palestinians, to Arab public opinion, and to world public opinion that they are biased to the point of destruction,\\" Ashrawi told CNN, echoing an argument made by many Palestinian officials. Among the options that have been floated,","output":"though not confirmed, are the possibility of the United States abstaining from the vote or using its veto power to block the resolution. This has heightened the tension between Israel and its long-time ally, as well as among Palestinians who view it as another instance of the U.S. siding with Israel over their own interests. The proposed resolution, if passed, would have significant implications for the peace process between Israel and Palestine, as well as for the wider geopolitical situation in the region. It would not only declare the Israeli settlements in the West Bank as illegal, but would also demand that Israel cease all settlement activities immediately. Previous resolutions regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have been passed in the United Nations, but the current one carries more weight due to the heightened tensions and ongoing challenges in negotiating a peace deal. The Israeli settlements in the West Bank have been a major point of contention between Israel and Palestine for decades, as Palestinians view them as an impediment to the creation of their own, continuous and independent state. For Israel, the settlements are seen as a part of their national security strategy and an extension of their sovereignty. The United Nations, as well as the international community at large, have long held that the settlements are illegal under international law, as they involve the construction of Israeli civilian infrastructure on Palestinian land. The Obama administration's efforts to block or at least delay the vote have garnered mixed reactions. Some see these efforts as a move to maintain the strong, longstanding alliance between the United States and Israel, while others argue that it confirms the notion that the U.S. government is biased toward Israel and disregards Palestinian interests. Critics of the Obama administration's stance argue that it could hinder, rather than promote, the potential resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as the perceived bias could exacerbate tensions between the two parties and reduce the likelihood of meaningful negotiations. Moreover, the U.S. government's involvement in the potential vote has implications for the domestic political scene. The subsequent administration, under President Donald Trump, may face the repercussions of the Obama administration's stance on the issue, particularly if it continues to be perceived as biased in favor of Israel. This could complicate attempts to broker peace in the region and further strain the relationship between the U.S. and the international community. In conclusion, the debate over the United Nations resolution on Israeli settlements is a complex and multifaceted issue, with implications not only for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process but also for the wider geopolitical situation in the region. The Obama administration's efforts to impede or postpone the vote have further complicated matters, raising questions about U.S. policy and their commitment to Palestinian interests. As the situation unfolds, it remains to be seen what the long-term effects of the U.S. stance on this issue will be and how it will impact the prospects for peace between Israel and Palestine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this and answer the question In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting his players to be more distinctly dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter pillar box red. Two possibilities have been suggested for the origin of the white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom Chapman played golf. Regardless of which story is true, the red and white shirts have come to define Arsenal and the team have worn the combination ever since, aside from two seasons. The first was 1966–67, when Arsenal wore all-red shirts; this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season. The second was 2005–06, the last season that Arsenal played at Highbury, when the team wore commemorative redcurrant shirts similar to those worn in 1913, their first season in the stadium; the club reverted to their normal colours at the start of the next season. In the 2008–09 season, Arsenal replaced the traditional all-white sleeves with red sleeves with a broad white stripe.

This iconic design was introduced back in 1933 by then-manager Herbert Chapman, who wanted his players to be more distinctly dressed.

The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat.

The document also calls for the two countries to jointly work on efforts to build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, to establish new U.S.-North Korea relations and to recover the remains of prisoners of war and military members missing in action. The two sides also promised to hold follow-up negotiations. “We’re going to denuke North Korea,” Trump told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren. He also said neither side issued ultimatums and that the agreement Tuesday was the result of months of negotiations. “You know that could have ended in a war, that could have ended with many millions of people — you know North Korea very well, Seoul has 28 million people, that could have ended with millions of people dead but we ended with a deal,” he said. Trump also told VOA that U.S. troops stationed in South Korea will remain in place, but announced one concession long-sought by North Korea. \\"We are going to get out of the war games that cost so much money,\\" he said. Trump said at later news conference that existing U.S. sanctions will remain in place until North Korean nuclear weapons \\"are no longer a factor.\\" As for verification, Trump said he and Kim discussed the issue and that monitoring denuclearization efforts would be achieved “by having a lot of people there.” He also predicted Kim would begin work right away to “live up to” the agreement.

As the clock strikes twelve, he rises from his desk, the sharp clicking sound of his keyboard subsiding like a symphony fading out, replaced by the soft sigh of relief his chair generates as he lifts off. Comfortably dressed in his usual work attire, he walks to the company cafeteria, a sea of chatter and culinary aromas greeting him affectionately. He scans the room, noting the friendly faces of his co-workers socializing, their talk a mix of business and leisure, and the diligent cafeteria staff managing an array of duties - from keeping the serving area clean to ensuring everyone gets their lunch in a timely manner. After standing in the queue for a moment, it's John's turn to place his order. He smiles at the cafeteria staff, the lady whose name tag reads 'Anna' and with a friendly nod exchanges pleasantries. They have this chat almost every day, a small bond forged over many lunches and reoccurring taste preferences. Anna is jovial and warm, her dedication to her work clear in the way she interacts with everyone, making people feel seen and valued even in their short beverage or food exchanges. When Anna asks John what he'll have today, there's no pause or indecisiveness. He doesn't need to scan the chalkboard menu hanging above her head, where all the daily offers are beautifully scribbled; he knows what he wants. And so, without missing a beat, he places his order: \\"The usual please — a turkey and Swiss sandwich with a hint of honey mustard, and a side of those delightful Kettle chips you recommended last week.\\" Anna nods, already reaching for the fresh ingredients. Weaving between the loaves of bread and strips of meat with practiced ease, she sets about crafting the sandwich, tailoring the taste according to his preferences. As she adds the finishing touch, she drops a handful of the golden, crispy Kettle chips on the side of his plate, creating a delightful combination of flavours — the salty, crunchiness of the chips complementing the softness of the sandwich perfectly. Thus, our four words — chip, lunch, order, and sandwich, have been strung together into a detailed narrative, creating an evocative and visually attractive scene of a regular lunch at an office cafeteria."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Poet Dean Young has dealt with impermanence( )a lot in his career, but it's a particularly strong theme in Young's latest collection, Fall Higher.The new collection was published in April, just days after the poet received a life-saving heart transplant   after about a decade of living with a weakening heart condition. Young, whose work is often frank and rich with twisted humor, tells NPR's Renee Montaigne that as he recovers from operation, he's also slowly returning to his everyday writing habits. \\"I'm getting back to it,\\" Young says.\\"Not with the sort of concentration and sort of flame that I look forward to in the future, but I am blackening some pages.\\" And on those blackened pages you'll find poems like \\" How Grasp Green,\\" which carries themes of springtime and rebirth.It's one of the first poems Young has written since his transplant. It's easy to spot clues   to Young's awful health situation in the lines of his poetry. Fall Higher's \\"Vintage\\" opens with, \\"Because I will die soon, I fall asleep, during the lecture on the ongoing emergency.\\" And the poem \\"-The Rhythms Pronounce Themselves Then Vanish--published in The /Vew Barker in February --opens with the CT scan that revealed Young's heart condition.

Answer: Answer:","output":"The poetry collection Fall Higher, written by Dean Young, showcases a strong theme of impermanence throughout its verses while delving into the poet's personal struggles with a weakening heart condition. It was published in April, shortly after Young received a life-saving heart transplant. The collection features a raw and twisted humor, as well as poems that carry themes of rebirth and renewal, such as \\"How Grasp Green.\\" Young's work has often been influenced by his own heart issues, making the use of hearts in his poetry more than just a metaphor. Alongside his physical struggles, his poems also explore more abstract matters of the heart, addressing emotional and philosophical aspects associated with human experiences and vulnerability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The next generation of smart phone could combine the date from its gyroscopes   with a built-in compass to allow you to track your indoor movements even without GPS.          Research described it in the international Journal of Innovative Computing and Applications by Shahid Ayub of Lancaster University, and his colleagues there and at HW Communications, suggests that the embedded inertial sensors   in many smart phones have added the facility to be used for localization and tracking applications. The primary benefit of using smart phones is that no additional infrastructure would need to be installed for monitoring personnel movements in a wide variety of situations not least staff, equipment and inventory movements in warehouse facilities, shopping malls and factories. In contrast, other technology being proposed would require new equipment,such as RFID technologies. However, smart phones do not yet have the ability to pinpoint their location without recourse to the GPS system, which is not accessible indoors and has the added disadvantage of using up battery power very quickly even if it could be used. Inertial navigation only provides the necessary information   to a specified starting point the team says. This is useful for anyone with a non-GPS smart phone who wishes to track the route they take when walking or jogging if they specify their starting point. The team suggests that pedestrians indoors could be positioned using a combination of the smart phone accelerometer   and an built-in digital compass, something that will become available in future smart phones. They have now investigated the potential of three different smart phone placement modes: idle, hand held and listening, which could be used with pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) techniques to allow users to record the path they follow or for various kinds of workplace or other monitoring requirements. \\"The technique could be used in underground tube stations, airports , train stations where there is no infrastructure installed for tracking or...

Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Question: Why did the actress feel bad about begin rejected? Options:  A. Because she thought the other actress did a bad job  B. Because she was treated like a liar  C. not enough information  D. Because the role had to be changed for the new actress Answer:","output":"B. Because she was treated like a liar"},{"instruction":"Q:Kings is a 2007 Irish film written & directed by Tom Collins and based on Jimmy Murphy's play The Kings of the Kilburn High Road.

Jenney cannot seriously contend that the employment agreement is protected by the attorney-client privilege be- ■ cause both he and Airdata had copies of the agreement before Jenney retained his former attorney to negotiate the retirement agreement. The fact that Jenney may have given a copy of the employment agreement to the attorney negotiating the retirement agreement does not convert the nonprivileged employment agreement into a privileged document.

IMF signs off 17.5bn loan for Ukraine in second attempt to stave off bankruptcy The International Monetary Fund has signed off on a 17.5bn (£11.8bn) four-year aid programme for Ukraine, the second attempt in less than a year to help the country avoid bankruptcy. The programme includes an immediate payment of 5bn for general budget support to help stabilise Ukraine’s listing economy. Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, said the aim was to provide immediate economic stabilisation for a country beset by conflict. The programme was ambitious and involved risks, Lagarde said, “notably those stemming from the conflict” with pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine. “With continued firm implementation, there is reasonably strong prospect of success.” Related: Russian military shelled Ukraine from mid-July, report says The IMF loan is expected to unlock further credits from other donors. Ukraine will also pursue debt-restructuring talks with existing bondholders. The combined package of assistance is estimated at 40bn, the IMF has said. In a televised statement, Arseny Yatseniuk, UKraine’s prime minister, said the IMF move would let the country tap 7.5bn in other loans. Another 15.4bn is expected in debt relief, according to sources familiar with the IMF programme. “[The money] will be used to stabilise the currency. It will enable the Ukrainian economy to grow from 2016,” Yatseniuk said. The IMF approved a 17bn two-year loan to Ukraine last year, but deemed it insufficient to support economic reforms while the government continued to battle pro-Russia separatists. Pro-Russia rebels and the government agreed to a peace deal in Minsk last month, but both sides continue to accuse each other of violations. The unrest in the east follows months of upheaval from anti-government protests and Russia’s subsequent annexation of the Crimea region. Lagarde said last week that an injection of financial support for Ukraine and its success largely hinged on the stability in the eastern of the country and how the security crisis was resolved. After a year of political upheaval and war, Ukraine’s economy is in a tailspin with a currency that just pulled back from record lows, the highest interest rates in 15 years, and central bank reserves of only 6.4bn, barely enough to cover five weeks of imports. Ukraine’s parliament last week approved a raft of IMF-backed amendments to its 2015 draft budget that were key preconditions for IMF approval of the bailout. The fund complimented those steps, including the willingness of Ukraine officials to let the currency float. “They have maintained fiscal discipline in very difficult conditions,” Lagarde said. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved a 17.5bn four-year aid program for Ukraine, aiming to provide immediate economic stabilization amidst ongoing conflict with pro-Russia separatists; this second attempt in less than a year is expected to unlock further credits from other donors and includes an immediate payment of 5bn for general budget support. The combined package of assistance is estimated to amount to 40bn, with the IMF deeming the previous 17bn two-year loan insufficient to support economic reforms as conflict continues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer to this question? who did the original voice for mickey mouse?","output":"The original voice of Mickey Mouse was provided by none other than the creator of the character, Walt Disney (born on December 5, 1901, in Hermosa, Chicago, Illinois, United States). Walter Elias Disney, an American entrepreneur, animator, and film producer, co-founded the reputable Walt Disney Productions (now The Walt Disney Company) with his brother, Roy O. Disney, in 1923. He rapidly gained prominence and recognition for his innovations in animation, becoming one of the most iconic animators globally. Mickey Mouse made its debut in the animated short film, \\"Steamboat Willie,\\" on November 18, 1928. This film followed earlier silent cartoon figures Oswald the Lucky Rabbit and Julius the Cat but received much more positive reception and popularity compared to its predecessors. In \\"Steamboat Willie,\\" Walt Disney himself provided the high-pitched, carefree voice of Mickey Mouse. Mickey's character was developed by Disney and his colleague Ub Iwerks, an American animator and cartoonist. Walt Disney continued providing Mickey's voice in numerous other films and short cartoons from 1928 to 1947. Some of the notable early works featuring Mickey Mouse include \\"The Barn Dance\\" (1929), \\"The Opry House\\" (1929), and \\"The Band Concert\\" (1935). Mickey Mouse has, over the years, evolved and become one of the most recognized and beloved characters in popular culture. The character is considered the mascot of The Walt Disney Company. In 1946, during production of the film \\"Mickey And The Beanstalk,\\" Disney realized that his extensive workload and smoking habit had taken a toll on his voice; he found it more challenging to perform Mickey's voice consistently. As a result, he passed on the responsibility of voicing Mickey Mouse to James MacDonald, a British-American musician and voice actor who was a member of Disney's animation team. MacDonald continued to voice Mickey Mouse until his retirement in 1977, after which Wayne Allwine took over the role. Today, Bret Iwan holds the honor of being the voice behind Mickey Mouse. Through Walt Disney's groundbreaking work and original voice performance, Mickey Mouse has become an iconic and enduring character that continues to captivate the hearts of millions and represents the magical world of Disney."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: Columbus, Ohio — The realities of the electoral map meant that the Romney campaign really had no choice but to bet big on Ohio, and that bet was a loser. In addition to some critical on-the-ground specifics — Ohio is not hurting as badly as the rest of the country — there were three main reasons for that.      1. Ohio likes crony capitalism. The automotive bailout is popular in Ohio, and not just among self-interested workers and investors in that industry. Putting General Motors on federal life support is economically daft and morally dubious, but it gave the Obama administration a powerful tool for convincing middle-class workers that the president is on their side. He might be doing something silly and destructive, but to be seen as doing something is politically useful. That it was General Motors and Chrysler was critical: Americans have a particularly romantic attitude toward automobile manufacturers, probably because Americans have a particularly romantic attitude toward automobiles. The (mostly mythical) image of the blue-collar homeowner supporting a four-person family in comfort by spending 40 hours a week on the assembly line is up there with mom and apple pie in the pantheon of American sentimentality. If President Obama had associated himself with the bailout of, say, Eastman Kodak — which will cease providing health care and other benefits to 56,000 retirees as part of its bankruptcy — it would not have imbued him with quite the same glow. And that is a specific instance of the more general and lamentable fact that . . .      2. Class warfare works. It is juvenile and it is economically illiterate, but a fair number of Americans worked themselves up into a lather over Mitt Romney’s paying a relatively low tax rate. Taxing capital gains at a lower rate than wages has been for a long time a mostly uncontroversial economic policy with fairly wide support across the partisan and ideological spectrum. When Bill Clinton signed into a law a reduction in the capital-gains tax rate, there was no mutiny on the left. More broadly, most voters do not have anything like the economic sophistication even to understand what Romney did at Bain Capital, much less how such private-equity firms provide real economic benefits. These are the citizens Bastiat had in mind when he wrote about what is seen and what is unseen: They can see outsourcing and declining manufacturing employment, but they cannot see (at least not very clearly) the benefits associated with integrated global supply chains or increases in manufacturing productivity. It may not be possible to be too thin, but it is, apparently, possible to be too rich, at least for an electorate that can be swayed by envy.      3. Repealing Obamacare was not a deal cincher in Ohio. A number of people I spoke to in the state suggested that the Romney-Ryan ticket paid too much attention to repealing Obamacare without spelling out an alternative that was sufficiently simple and attractive to voters who are not committed conservatives. One veteran of the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations argued that while Ohio voters may not be crazy about the Affordable Care Act, neither are they burning partisans of the campaign to repeal it. As with the GM bailout, many voters regard Obamacare as an example of the administration’s trying to do something for them, even if they are not entirely sold on the particulars.      There is not much in this to comfort conservatives. The lessons of Ohio are that Barack Obama is a skillful demagogue, that the ancients were wise to number envy among the deadly sins, and that offering Americans a check is a more fruitful political strategy than offering them the opportunity to take control of and responsibility for their own lives. This is what Oakeshott had in mind when he wrote that liberty was something that many people simply are not equipped to “enjoy as an opportunity rather than suffer as a burden.”      For many years, Republicans have relied on Jude Wanniski’s “Two Santa Claus” theory, the strategy of using the promise of tax cuts to compete with Democrats’ promises of cash and other benefits. In part as a consequence of that strategy, a great many Americans pay little or no federal income taxes, while many of the other federal taxes they pay are indirect or partly hidden. Mitt Romney was right: You can’t use tax cuts to buy off people who are net recipients of tax transfers. Figuring out what we can offer them that is consistent with our principles is the task of conservatives between now and the next election.      — Kevin D. Williamson is roving reporter for National Review. ||||| If his tweets are anything to go by, Donald Trump isn't a happy camper in the wake of President Barack Obama's victory over Republican challenger Mitt Romney in the 2012 election.      \\"Well, back to the drawing board!\\" he posted tonight, followed by a series of increasingly disgruntled remarks.      \\"We can't let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty,\\" Trump continued. \\"Our nation is totally divided! Lets fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice! The world is laughing at us. This election is a total sham and a travesty. We are not a democracy! ||||| Republicans never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. In 2010, they failed to win the Senate when it was theirs for the taking. Now they’ve lost the White House to President Obama, despite his poor record and the likelihood things won’t get any better in his second term. And they failed again to capture the Senate, though a takeover was initially thought to be a cinch.      The result was a status quo election, with Democrats entrenched in White House and Senate and Republicans firmly in control of the House. As it turned out, the election wasn’t historic at all, except that Barack Obama, the first African American president, became the first to be reelected.      The numbers and the faces in Washington have barely changed at all. We’re stuck with them. As hard as Republicans tried, they were unable to upset the balance of political forces.      What’s their problem? In Senate races, it’s bad candidates: old hacks (Wisconsin), young hacks (Florida), youngsters (Ohio), Tea Party types who can’t talk about abortion sensibly (Missouri, Indiana), retreads (Virginia), lousy campaigners (North Dakota) and Washington veterans (Michigan). Losers all.      And those are just the Senate contests decided yesterday. In 2010, it was similar. Republicans threw away two of their best chances to gain seats, choosing pathetically incapable candidates in Nevada and Delaware. It’s as if they have a political death wish.      Losing the presidential contest to Obama was different. Mitt Romney was the best possible candidate among the Republicans who ran for the presidential nomination.

Yet he actually seemed presidential. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"This news article discusses the 2012 U.S. Presidential Election in which President Barack Obama was victorious over Republican challenger Mitt Romney. The article highlights three main reasons for Romney's loss in the crucial state of Ohio: 1) Ohio's liking for crony capitalism like the automotive bailout, which was popular among middle-class workers, and allowed Obama to be seen as supporting their interests. 2) Class warfare tactics that swayed undecided voters with issues like Romney's low tax rate and painting him as the villain due to his wealth. 3) The fact that repealing Obamacare was not a deal-maker for people in Ohio, as many perceived it as something the administration was trying to do for them, despite not being completely sold on the idea. The article also mentions the failure of Republicans to gain control of the Senate in the 2012 elections, attributing it to bad candidates in various states. The inability to win the Senate and White House led to a status quo in politics, with Obama as the first African American President who was reelected and the House divided between Democrats and Republicans. The author criticizes Republicans' lack of offers that are consistent with their principles and values, leaving them searching for a solution before the next election."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It can also be expressed as 220 yards, 660 feet, 40 rods, or 10 chains. The term \\"furlong\\" originated from the Old English words \\"furh\\" (furrow) and \\"lang\\" (long), as it represented the distance that a team of oxen could plow without resting – typically around the length of a furrow in a field. While the use of furlongs has largely been replaced by modern metric measurements in most areas, it is still occasionally used in horse racing, agriculture, and surveying."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: How would Aubrey feel afterwards?  Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  A: unfriendly  B: warm inside  C: lonely The answer is:","output":"B: warm inside According to the given context, Aubrey is trying to get along with people who are making an effort to be friendly. This indicates that there is a positive interaction happening among the individuals, and they are putting in efforts to build a good rapport with each other. Under such circumstances, Aubrey would most likely feel positive emotions due to their attempts to be amicable and connect with others. Out of the three options provided: A: unfriendly - This answer is not consistent with the context, as Aubrey is trying to get along with others who are being friendly. It would be contradictory for Aubrey to feel unfriendly after attempting to build a positive relationship. B: warm inside - This answer best fits the context, as it reflects the positive emotions Aubrey is likely to feel after trying to establish a connection with friendly individuals. Feeling \\"warm inside\\" signifies inner happiness and contentment, stemming from the successful efforts to build strong relationships. C: lonely - This answer is not suitable, as the context suggests that efforts were made to establish a bond with others who are being friendly. Loneliness would indicate a lack of connection, which does not align with the described situation. In conclusion, the answer that best answers the question according to the context is B: warm inside.

If \\"Foreign folk dancers are dressed in outfits of bright lime green, red and white tops, lime green headbands and red, blousy trousers and open-toed specialty shoes while dancing in a city street, while spectators enjoy the show.\\", can we conclude \\"Folk dancers are entertaining people on a city street.\\"?","output":"Yes, we can indeed conclude that \\"Folk dancers are entertaining people on a city street.\\" The original statement is describing a scene where foreign folk dancers, specifically in brightly colored attire, are dancing in a city street. The costumes, which include bright lime green, red, and white tops, lime green headbands, red blousy trousers, and open-toed specialty shoes, indicate a festive and show-like scenario typically associated with performances or parades, composed to entertain an audience. Moreover, the statement mentions that there are spectators who are enjoying the show. This suggests that the activity is not merely a private or spontaneous dance by few individuals, but rather a performance meant to entertain a public audience. The word \\"spectators\\" derives its meaning from the act of spectating or observing - often associated with people in attendance at performances, sports events, or other public spectacles. The use of the term \\"city street\\" also adds to the understanding that this is a public event, possibly part of a parade or street performance. City streets often serve as venues for public gatherings, events, festivals, or shows due to their accessibility and visibility to a large number of people. Given these elements of the statement - the specific description of the dancers' outfits, their activity of dancing, the presence of spectators enjoying the show, and the location being a city street - we can therefore deduce that the folk dancers are indeed entertaining people on the city street. This conclusion is therefore a concise summary of the original statement, capturing the main activity - folk dancing as a form of entertainment for people in a city street."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is a natural substance  produced by the human body, and it helps children's bones and muscles  to grow. Scientists are allowed to make the drug and it is also legal to take HGH in most countries. HGH is considered a wonder drug for children. It helps many children with growth problems every year. However, some athletes are now taking the drug. HGH helps add muscle in adults and recent research by the World Anti-Doping Agency shows that HGH may improve the sportsman's time by 5% when he takes part in short, fast races. Some athletes say that HGH surely makes them stronger. It also helps them to recover  more quickly from injuries. Although it is _ by most professional sports, HGH is almost impossible to test for. The drug is completely natural and it will only show in tests for around 24 hours after taking it. Testing is usually done only during competitions, but athletes use HGH during training, so it is very difficult to know who has used the drug. This makes it very attractive for some athletes. Scientists are developing a new test which will find the drug in the body for up to two weeks. But it isn't going to be easy. Everybody has different levels of natural HGH in their body. For this reason, scientists are warning athletes of the possible problems with the drug. Research shows that HGH increase the risk of cancer. But is this enough to stop athletes from taking it? Scientists don't think so. Some athletes will do all they can to win, and worry about their health later. Question: Which of these statements is WRONG? - HGH is a natural substance. - HGH is needed to help bones and muscles grow. - HGH is used as medicine for children. - HGH is not allowed to be produced in many countries. Answer:","output":"The statement that is WRONG is - \\"HGH is not allowed to be produced in many countries.\\" The article clearly mentions that scientists are allowed to make the drug (HGH) and it is also legal to use the growth hormone in most countries. The information provided in the remaining options- HGH being a natural substance, its role in aiding the growth of bones and muscles, and its usage in medical treatments for children having growth issues, is accurate according to the article.

Behind the glass wall in front of me, three nurses were talking about their various ex-husbands. It sounded like the same guy to me.

In London, Murray beat both Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer on his way to a gold medal. He may have to beat the world's top two players in back-to-back matches again if he hopes to win his first Grand Slam title. Andy Murray of Great Britain hits a shot while practicing prior to the start of the 2012 U.S. Open on Friday. With Rafael Nadal out of this year's tournament due to injury, Murray moves into the No. 3 spot and could threaten the stranglehold that Djokovic, Federer and Nadal have held on Grand Slam trophies. The big three have won 29 of the last 30 Slams—although they rarely have had to beat both of the other big-three members in the same event. Djokovic accomplished the feat at last year's U.S. Open (beating Federer in the semifinal and Nadal in the final) and Nadal did it to win the 2008 French Open title. Federer, however, has never beaten both Djokovic and Nadal at the same Grand Slam event—although he beat Murray and Djokovic to win Wimbledon in July.

(Since the late 19th century, musical setting of prose and free verse has also been practiced in some art music, though popular music tends to remain conservative in its retention of stanzaic forms with or without refrains.)

When he keels over from a heart attack, now itâs up to a grad student, Allison (Kari WÃ¼hrer, reprising her role), to keep it from the forces of darkness. Cut to the streets of Bucharest. A young girl named Maria loses her ball into the busy street. Suddenly, Lucifer (reprised by John Light) appears to her and tells her she should go get it.

Both happened in Newport RI when I was in the US Navy. First, I lived in a cottage that was in an old motel. It had a cottage in front where the landlady lived and there were ten little cottages in a half-moon configuration around it. Ours was a party place and we didn't have a phone. This was in the early 1970's. The landlady was in her 50's I'd guess. The only phone was a pay-phone outside her cottage and it was o party line with her phone. When we used it, she would try to listen, especially if we were talking to a girl. We could tell and sometimes we'd ask he to hang up, but other times we'd talk about sexy stuff and let her listen. We could hear her breathing heavy when we did. When we'd be parting, she'd come to the door wearing sexy clothes that were completely inappropriate and want to be invited in. Though we were a bunch of horny sailors, no one wanted any part of that. We never let her come in. I got married and moved into an apartment that was three rooms in a huge old house.

Write an article based on this summary: Apply a cutting compound to your buffing tool.","output":"Title: The Power of Cutting Compounds and Proper Buffing Techniques Introduction Paint scratches, oxidation, and minor imperfections on your vehicle's surface can be a nuisance, not to mention a major eyesore. Fortunately, there's a way to handle these issues - by using a cutting compound on your buffing tool. This technique essentially removes a thin layer of paint to reveal a fresh, untouched surface underneath which looks much cleaner and is free from blemishes. In this article, we will discuss the importance of applying a cutting compound to your buffing tool, how to choose the right one, and the proper techniques to give your vehicle a renewed shine.  Why use a cutting compound? A cutting compound is a specialized abrasive paste that, when used in conjunction with a buffing tool, will remove minor scratches, paint defects, and other surface imperfections. Additionally, it serves to reduce signs of oxidation, restoring your vehicle's paint job to its original brilliance. In the hands of an experienced user, a cutting compound can work wonders – however, it's important to follow the correct techniques and procedures to avoid damaging your vehicle's paintwork. Choosing the Right Cutting Compound Cutting compounds come in various forms, with some being more aggressive than others. For beginners, it's best to start with a lighter compound to ensure that you don't inadvertently harm your vehicle's surface. Once you become more proficient in using a cutting compound, you can then graduate to heavier formulas. Some popular cutting compounds include: 1. Meguiar's Ultimate Compound: This versatile compound provides a high level of abrasion while remaining safe for clear coats. It's ideal for removing moderate oxidations, scratches, and swirl marks. 2. Chemical Guys V32 Optical Grade Extreme Compound: This innovative formula is designed for use on both conventional clear coats and harder ceramic clears. It works well for removing scratches, swirl marks, and light oxidation. 3. 3M Perfect-It Rubbing Compound: With advanced technology that provides cutting power while leaving a fine finish, this compound works great for addressing imperfections in a vehicle's paintwork. Preparing Your Buffing Tool Before you start buffing, ensure that you have the proper supplies and equipment, including: 1. A high-quality rotary or dual-action buffer 2. The appropriate cutting compound for your needs 3. A foam or wool buffing pad 4. A microfiber towel for wiping residue Applying the Cutting Compound to Your Buffing Tool Follow these steps to correctly apply the cutting compound to your buffing tool: 1. Attach the buffing pad to your buffer. If you're using a foam pad, you may need to spray it with a little water or a pad conditioner to dampen it slightly. 2. Apply a moderate amount of cutting compound onto your buffing pad. Start with a conservative amount, as too much compound can create a messy process and reduce its effectiveness. 3. Spread the compound evenly across the buffing pad, taking care to distribute it uniformly so that the pad makes consistent contact with your vehicle's surface. 4. Adjust your buffer's speed setting according to the manufacturer's recommendations for the cutting compound you are using. Some compounds require a slower buffing speed, while others may necessitate a higher speed. 5. With your buffer turned off, press the buffing pad against the vehicle's surface to distribute the compound across the area you'll be working on. Be sure to target the imperfections you want to remove. 6. Turn on your buffer and start working the compound into your vehicle's surface using slow, controlled motions. Keep the buffing pad flat and maintain consistent pressure throughout the process. 7. Evaluate your progress periodically, and apply more compound to the buffing pad as needed. 8. Once you are satisfied with the results, wipe off any excess residue using a microfiber towel. Conclusion The use of cutting compounds with your buffing tool is an effective and efficient way of addressing paint imperfections and restoring your vehicle's exterior to its original glory. By identifying the right type of compound, preparing your buffing tool, and following the correct application techniques, you can achieve a professional finish that will leave your car looking as good as new."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"The Bumbo cocktail and Clover Club cocktail are two distinct cocktails with unique ingredients, flavor profiles, and histories. Here's a detailed comparison between the two: 1. Origin and history: Bumbo: Bumbo, also known as Bombo or Bumboo, dates back to the 17th and 18th centuries. It was commonly consumed by pirates and sailors, particularly in the Caribbean region. The beverage is said to have been used as a means to make drinking highly potent and less flavorful rum more enjoyable at that time. Clover Club: The Clover Club cocktail has its roots in the late 19th century to early 20th century, originating from an elite social club in Philadelphia called the Clover Club. This pre-prohibition classic gained popularity at the club and eventually entered mainstream drinking culture. 2. Ingredients: Bumbo: - Dark rum (traditionally Caribbean rum) - Sugar or simple syrup - Freshly grated nutmeg - Water - Lime juice (optional) Clover Club: - Gin - Fresh lemon or lime juice - Raspberry syrup or grenadine - Egg white - Dry vermouth (optional) 3. Flavor profile: Bumbo: Bumbo has a rich, sweet, and spicy taste reminiscent of its Caribbean origins. The core flavors are derived from the rum, sugar, and nutmeg, with a possible hint of citrus from lime juice if included. Clover Club: The Clover Club cocktail offers a well-balanced combination of sweet, tart, and fruity flavors. It is characterized by the botanical taste of gin, complemented by the acidity of citrus juice, the sweetness of raspberry syrup or grenadine, and the velvety texture of the egg white foam. 4. Preparation: Bumbo: - Combine rum, sugar/simple syrup, and water in a glass. - Stir until the sugar dissolves. - Optionally, add lime juice to taste. - Top with freshly grated nutmeg and serve. Clover Club: - In a cocktail shaker, combine gin, lemon/lime juice, raspberry syrup/grenadine, and egg white. - Perform a dry shake (without ice) to froth the egg white and emulsify the ingredients. - Add ice to the shaker, and shake again to chill. - Strain into a chilled coupe or cocktail glass. - Optionally, garnish with fresh raspberries or a lemon twist. In conclusion, Bumbo is a dark rum-based beverage with a sweet and spicy profile, enjoyed mostly by pirates and sailors in history, while the Clover Club is a classic pre-prohibition era cocktail based on gin with a balanced fruity, citrusy, and creamy taste."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The economy of the town is mostly agricultural, and the town is surrounded by vast cornfields. One particular year the corn crop fails and the people of Gatlin turn to prayer in an attempt to ensure a successful harvest. A mysterious boy preacher, Isaac Chroner (John Franklin), arrives and takes all the children of Gatlin into a cornfield to speak to them about the prophecies of a demonic version of the Judeo-Christian God called \\"He Who Walks Behind The Rows\\". Isaac, through his lieutenant Malachai (Courtney Gains), leads the children of the town in a revolution, brutally killing all of the adults in the town. Over the ensuing years, the children take any adults passing through as sacrifices.Three years later, Burt (Peter Horton) and his girlfriend Vicky (Linda Hamilton) pass through Nebraska while driving cross-country to Burt's new job as a physician in Seattle, Washington. They are traveling in their car and hit a small boy out on the highway. This boy was one of the Gatlin children who tried to escape the iron hand of the death cult. The couple place his body in the trunk. They encounter an old mechanic, who is little to no help, as the children of Gatlin have employed him to lead all adults passing through to the town, but they betray him and kill him anyway. Burt and Vicky finally end up in Gatlin, after searching for several hours for a phone. A struggle ensues between the couple, \\"He Who Walks Behind the Rows\\" and the children as the couple are violently chased through the city.

It was said that there less than 20 jaguars in the world, one of which was living in the national zoo of Peru. In order to help this jaguar, Peruvians set up a zoo for it, where there were sheep and deer for the jaguar to eat. However, strange enough, no one had ever seen the jaguar hunt the deer and sheep. What they could see was its lying in its cave, sleeping and eating the meat provided by the zoo keepers. At first, people thought that the jaguar felt too lonely, so they found a female tiger to accompany it. However, it did not make too much sense. The jaguar just sometimes went out of its cave with its \\"girlfriend\\" for a while before it came back to its house again' It is normal for the jaguar to be lazy here. Tiger is the king of forest but you simply put some small animals around him. That is why the jaguar shows no interest in going out' a visitor said. So people put five wolves into the jaguar's zoo.

Please answer the following question: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators.  Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4]  Two coastal Canadian towns, Hammond and Soundville decided to start sand mining to bring more money to their budgets. A few months later however, Hammond decided to stop all mining operations and find other sources of income. they wanted to protect the environment.  Which village harmed fewer corals? Answer:","output":"In order to answer this question, I will consider the information given about each village and their respective actions. Step 1: Analyze the provided facts about sand mining and its impact on the environment, particularly corals. - Sand mining directly causes erosion and negatively affects local wildlife, including corals. - Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes water turbidity, which is harmful to corals. Step 2: Examine the actions taken by the two villages, Hammond and Soundville. - Both Hammond and Soundville started sand mining operations. - A few months later, Hammond decided to stop all mining operations to protect the environment. Step 3: Evaluate the potential harm to corals from each village. - Both villages engaged in sand mining, which is harmful to corals. - Hammond stopped mining operations sooner than Soundville, resulting in less time for their actions to affect corals. Based on these steps, I can conclude that Hammond likely harmed fewer corals than Soundville, as they stopped their mining operations earlier to protect the environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a goal: Add an ornament to a wrist cuff. How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of adding an ornament to a wrist cuff, you can follow these detailed steps: 1. Gather materials: Before beginning the project, gather all the materials you'll need. These may include:    - A wrist cuff (preferably made from a durable material like leather, metal, or fabric)    - The ornament(s) you wish to add (e.g. beads, crystals, charms, etc.)    - Needle and thread (or glue, if the ornament requires it)    - Pliers (for attaching jump rings)    - Jump rings (if your ornaments require them)    - Ruler or measuring tape    - Marker or chalk 2. Choose the ornament's design and placement: Decide on the design of the ornament and how you want it placed on the wrist cuff. Sketch out a rough design on paper so you have a visual reference when working on the actual piece. Use the ruler or measuring tape to measure the dimensions of the cuff and decide where the ornament(s) should be positioned. 3. Mark your measurements: Once you've chosen the ornament's placement, use the marker or chalk to transfer those measurements to the cuff. Be sure to measure accurately, so the outcome matches your vision. 4. Attach the ornament(s):    a) Sewing: If the ornament is a bead, sequin, or any type of sewable embellishment, thread the needle with a thread that matches the cuff or ornament's color. Carefully sew the ornament to the cuff, following the pattern or design you previously planned. Make sure to secure each stitch with a knot, so the ornament doesn't come loose over time. In case the ornament has a sewing loop, simply pass the thread through the loop and then sew it to the cuff.    b) Jump rings: If the ornament is a charm or requires a jump ring for attachment, use the pliers to open the jump ring by gently twisting its ends apart (don't pull them apart). Thread the charm onto the jump ring, then loop the ring through a hole, loop or other attachment point on the cuff. Finally, close the jump ring by twisting the ends back together.    c) Glue: If the ornament needs to be glued, apply a small amount of strong adhesive, like E6000 or super glue, to the back of the ornament. Carefully press it onto the desired spot on the cuff, and hold it in place until the glue sets. Follow the glue's curing time instructions for best results. 5. Check your work: Once the ornament(s) is attached, inspect your handiwork, ensuring everything is securely fastened, and the design matches your initial vision. If you find any loose strands of thread, trim them to ensure a clean and polished finish. 6. Allow time for adhesive to cure: If you used glue to attach the ornaments, it's crucial to let the adhesive cure for the recommended time (usually 24 hours) before wearing or handling the wrist cuff. The curing time ensures a strong bond between the ornament and the wrist cuff. 7. Wear and enjoy: Now that you have successfully added your ornament(s) to the wrist cuff, you can confidently wear your unique piece of jewelry. By following these steps, you will have successfully accomplished your goal of adding an ornament to a wrist cuff, creating a distinctive accessory that reflects your personal style."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It was part of the activities of Beijing Design Week, which ran from September 26 to October 3 in 2013. The Rubber Duck stayed in the park until September 23, then moved to the Summer Palace, a famous Beijing tourist spot, where it was on display until October 26. The duck is made of over 200 pieces of rubber. It was guarded not only by staff, but also by 10 volunteers wearing yellow T-shirts and hats with a rubber duck logo. Sun Yidong, a volunteer who guided visitors to the duck, said the art brought energy to the traditional Chinese park. \\"Seeing the giant Rubber Duck makes me feel like I'm a kid again.\\" Sun said. Because of the rain on Friday, there were not too many people coming to see it. The Expo workers said they expected more people to come and visit the duck on weekends.

Options: - winch - factory - roller coaster - ship - building  The answer is \\"factory\\" because Answer:","output":"The answer is \\"factory\\" because a factory is where raw materials, such as steel, are processed and converted into finished products, such as steel cables. Since you are looking for a steel cable that has not been completed yet, it is most likely still in the stages of manufacturing or processing. In a factory, steel cables undergo various stages of production before they are considered complete. These stages include using machines to twist and form the steel strands into a cable, as well as adding any necessary coatings or reinforcements. Once the steel cable is fully manufactured, it can be shipped out to its final destination - whether that be to a winch, roller coaster, ship, or building site. All of the other options mentioned are end-users or applications of steel cables, where the cables are utilized once they have already been completed. A winch uses steel cables for pulling heavy objects, a roller coaster uses them to pull and support cars along the tracks, ships use steel cables for hoisting and securing loads, and buildings may use steel cables for support and tension purposes in their structures. Hence, to find a steel cable that is not yet complete, your best bet would be to visit a factory where these cables are still being processed and manufactured."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Make a lemon juice and cream of tartar cleaner.","output":"Title: An Easy Guide to Removing Stubborn Stains with Everyday Household Items Introduction Often, we find ourselves in situations where spills, stains, and grease make their way onto our favorite clothes, shoes, or household items. Instead of immediately resorting to expensive cleaning products or professional cleaning services, try using some common everyday household items to tackle these issues. In this article, we will explore how to remove various types of stains using nail polish remover, rubbing alcohol, baking soda, toothpaste, lemon juice, and cream of tartar. 1. Remove stains with nail polish remover or rubbing alcohol For most stains, like ink, coffee, or paint, nail polish remover and rubbing alcohol can be your best friends. These two items are highly effective in breaking down the compounds in the stain, making them easier to clean. Step 1: Dampen a clean cotton ball or cloth with nail polish remover or rubbing alcohol. Step 2: Gently press the dampened cotton ball or cloth onto the stained area. Step 3: Blot until the stain begins to lift. Step 4: Rinse the item thoroughly to ensure no residue is left behind. Note: Perform a spot test on a hidden area of the material to ensure that it won't be damaged by the nail polish remover or rubbing alcohol. 2. Remove grease stains with baking soda Grease stains can be challenging to remove from clothing, but baking soda offers an inexpensive and effective solution. Step 1: If the stain is still wet, use a paper towel to absorb as much grease as possible. Step 2: Generously sprinkle baking soda onto the grease stain, completely covering it. Step 3: Let the baking soda sit for 30 minutes to an hour, allowing it to absorb the grease. Step 4: Brush off the baking soda and launder the item as usual. 3.

The Eagles got off to a slow start, only leading 3-0 after the first quarter. Late in the second quarter, the Eagles blew the game open. Carson Wentz found tight end Zach Ertz for a 1-yard touchdown in the back of the end zone off of a bootleg pass, and Jalen Mills intercepted rookie QB C.J. Beathard and returned it 37 yards for a touchdown. The 49ers appeared to have some life in the third quarter, following a Carson Wentz interception, leading to a Matt Breida 22 yard touchdown reception. However, the Eagles responded, with Wentz connecting with Alshon Jeffery for a 53-yard touchdown, putting the game out of reach. The Eagles went on to win 33-10 and advanced to 7-1 on the season. Despite the win, the Eagles played a sloppy game in a rainy afternoon at the Linc. Question: How many yards were gained on offensive touchdowns? Answer:","output":"In the game described, there were three offensive touchdowns: 1. Carson Wentz's 1-yard touchdown pass to Zach Ertz. 2. Matt Breida's 22-yard touchdown reception. 3. Carson Wentz's 53-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. To find the total yards gained on offensive touchdowns, we simply add the yardage from each touchdown: 1 (Ertz) + 22 (Breida) + 53 (Jeffery) = 76 yards.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: On Earth, the common weather phenomena include wind, cloud, rain, snow, fog and dust storms. Less common events include natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons and ice storms. Almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere).  Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood.Weather occurs primarily due to  air pressure, temperature and moisture differences between one place to another.  These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. In other words, the farther from the tropics one lies, the lower the sun angle is, which causes those locations to be cooler due the spread of the sunlight over a greater surface.   The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the large scale atmospheric circulation cells and the jet stream.  Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow (see baroclinity).  Weather systems in the tropics, such as monsoons or organized thunderstorm systems, are caused by different processes.  Now, I have a new situation: Two continents were separated by a large ocean. Oceania had milder weather and experienced common weather phenomena, while Lemuria experienced natural disasters.  Answer this question please: Which continent experienced fog phenomena?

The outer part, called the cortex, secretes hormones such as cortisol, which helps the body deal with stress, and aldosterone, which helps regulate the balance of minerals in the body. The inner part of each adrenal gland, called the medulla, secretes fight-or-flight hormones such as adrenaline, which prepare the body to respond to emergencies. For example, adrenaline increases the amount of oxygen and glucose going to the muscles. You can see an animation of this response at the link below.  and the situation: John is a biologist, who studies animal species of tundra biome. He noticed that they behave in certain way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' cortex. On the other hand, they behave some other way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' medulla. He termed the first process as process A and latter process as process B.  Answer the following question: Which process may not help the species during emergencies, process A or process B? Answer:","output":"Process A may not help the species during emergencies when compared to process B. To understand why, let us first examine the differences between the two processes. Process A is associated with the secretion of hormones from the adrenal gland's cortex, which produces hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone. These hormones have essential roles in the body, but they do not directly prepare the body for emergencies. Cortisol helps the body handle stress by regulating the body's use of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. It is also involved in controlling inflammation, maintaining blood pressure, and increasing blood sugar levels. Aldosterone, on the other hand, helps regulate the balance of minerals in the body, such as sodium and potassium, which is important for maintaining blood pressure and fluid balance. Process B is linked to the secretion of hormones from the adrenal gland's medulla, which produces fight-or-flight hormones like adrenaline (also known as epinephrine). Adrenaline is specifically designed to prepare the body to respond to emergencies by altering various physiological processes in the body. For example, it increases the amount of oxygen and glucose going to the muscles, which leads to a sudden burst of energy. It also increases heart rate, constricts blood vessels, and enhances focus and alertness, all of which are essential elements to act quickly in emergency situations. Based on these explanations, it is clear that process B (the secretion of hormones from the adrenal gland's medulla) is more directly aimed at preparing the body to deal with emergencies. Although process A (the secretion of hormones from the adrenal gland's cortex) has important functions, it does not have the immediate, emergency-focused effects that process B offers. Therefore, process A may not be as helpful for the species during emergencies as process B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was not formally trained but gifted?  At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in...

Write an article based on this summary: Nigeria's Ogoniland region could take 30 years to recover fully from the damage caused by years of oil spills, a long-awaited UN report says. Article:","output":"Title: The Long Road to Recovery- Ogoniland's 30-Year Battle with Oil Spill Aftermath A recent report from the United Nations (UN) has brought to light the disturbing and distressing fact that it could take up to 30 years for Nigeria's Ogoniland region to overcome the extensive damage caused by years of frequent oil spills. Once a flourishing, biodiverse region inhabited by several indigenous communities, Ogoniland now stands as a painful reminder of the devastating implications of oil pollution.  The distinct geographical identity of Ogoniland, located in the Niger Delta, has been severely compromised due to toxic contamination from oil spills. These spills have unleashed a catastrophic environmental crisis, plaguing the region for decades. The UN report, a result of comprehensive research and data analysis over the years, observes that the path to a complete recovery can only be envisaged on a 30-year timeline, given the extent of the damage incurred. The oil spills, negligence, and associated events have resulted in the loss of livelihood for the local communities, impacting their health and stripping the land of its natural resources. Ogoniland, once known for its rich soil that supported agriculture and fishing, has seen its primary sources of sustenance severely crippled. The role of oil companies that have been operating in the region cannot be overlooked in this context. These spills are frequently attributed to sabotage, operational failures, lack of proper mitigative measures, and inadequate responses to these disasters. The region has borne witness to some significant spills, high-profile litigation and strained relations between the oil companies, local communities, and the Nigerian government over the years. The UN's intervention and the resulting report have helped shed light on the extent of the problem and the urgency with which solutions need to be sought. According to the report, \\"The environmental restoration of Ogoniland could prove to be the world's most wide-ranging and long term oil clean-up exercise ever undertaken if contaminated drinking water, land, creeks and important ecosystems such as mangroves are to be brought back to full, productive health.\\" Nevertheless, the road to recovery is long and fraught with challenges. Firstly, there is the Herculean task of cleaning up contaminated soil and bodies of water. The UN report highlights the need for immediate action in providing clean drinking water to local communities that do not have access to the same, given the large scale of water poisoning. Threats posed to public health due to associated diseases are equally worrying. The revitalization of agriculture and fishing, other essential livelihood sources for locals, will require systematic planning and tremendous effort. Programs need to be developed that not only restore these sectors but also safeguard them against future mishaps. Additionally, issues of corporate accountability and governance also come to the fore in this context. Oil companies operating in the region need to reevaluate their operational practices, commit to higher safety standards and assume greater responsibility in preventing such mishaps in the future. There must be a shift toward sustainable practices along with transparency in corporate actions. As per the UN report, the recovery of Ogoniland is a long-term project that requires robust planning, adequate resources, cohesive effort from various stakeholders, and sustained commitment. It also necessitates a shared sense of responsibility and a collective aspiration towards restoration. In conclusion, Ogoniland's journey to recovery from the environmental devastation will be a long one, marked by considerable challenges. However, with persistent efforts championed by the UN, the Nigerian government, local communities, and oil companies, it's a journey that needs to be undertaken to repair the ecology and reinstate the economic stability of the region. It's a daunting task but not an insurmountable one. The healing of Ogoniland is indeed, as the UN report underscores, a paramount responsibility for humanity. Only in fulfilling this duty can we hope to restore Ogoniland to its rightful state of environmental balance and vibrant life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: What is the most common method for any type of manufacturer to gain market exclusivity? Context: There are special rules for certain rare diseases (\\"orphan diseases\\") in several major drug regulatory territories. For example, diseases involving fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States, or larger populations in certain circumstances are subject to the Orphan Drug Act.  Because medical research and development of drugs to treat such diseases is financially disadvantageous, companies that do so are rewarded with tax reductions, fee waivers, and market exclusivity on that drug for a limited time (seven years), regardless of whether the drug is protected by patents. The answer is:","output":"The most common method for any type of manufacturer to gain market exclusivity, particularly within the context provided, is through the development of drugs to treat rare diseases, commonly referred to as \\"orphan diseases\\". Companies that take on the challenging task of medical research and drug development for such diseases, that are financially disadvantageous due to smaller patient populations, are awarded with a system of incentives that includes market exclusivity on the developed drug for a limited time (seven years in the context) regardless of the drug's patent status. Additionally, these companies also benefit from tax reductions and fee waivers. The reference example is from the United States application of the Orphan Drug Act, a law specifically designed to encourage the development of drugs for diseases involving fewer than 200,000 patients, or larger populations in certain circumstances. This method stands as a strategy for manufacturers to gain exclusive rights to market their products. Please note, however, that the context provided only speaks to the method in terms of drug manufacturers. Other types of manufacturers might employ different methods for market exclusivity, given different industry norms, regulations and operational environments."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Process: - Dirty dishes are rinsed - Placed into the dishwasher - A detergent is added to the detergent dispenser - The dishwasher is closed - The power is turned on - In about 1.5-2 hours, the dishes are clean -   Question: suppose dishes are dirtier when going into the dishwasher happens, how will it affect HURTING the dishwasher to clean better.

Starting with the bottom of the shirt, roll or fold the bottom of the shirt up until your torso is exposed. This gets the majority of the shirt bunched together in one place, leaving the harder parts, like the neck and arms, for last. Keep rolling it upwards, bunching it so that the bottom of the shirt is now around your shoulders. You may have to push hard to stretch the bottom of the shirt around your shoulders, depending on how tight the shirt is. Once the shirt is completely over your shoulders, pull the neckline up over your head.

If you need to protect your hair-do, use both hands to stretch the neckline over your head without touching your hair. Now that your neck is through and the shirt is stretched around your upper body, raise your hands up. The shirt will pop off of your head and you’ll only be wearing the shirt on your arms.

Thus, Na+ is the sodium ion, Al3+ is the aluminum ion, Ca2+ is the calcium ion, and so forth. We have seen that some elements lose different numbers of electrons, producing ions of different charges (Figure 3.3 \\"Predicting Ionic Charges\\"). Iron, for example, can form two cations, each of which, when combined with the same anion, makes a different compound with unique physical and chemical properties. Thus, we need a different name for each iron ion to distinguish Fe2+ from Fe3+. The same issue arises for other ions with more than one possible charge. There are two ways to make this distinction. In the simpler, more modern approach, called the Stock system, an ion’s positive charge is indicated by a roman numeral in parentheses after the element name, followed by the word ion. Thus, Fe2+ is called the iron(II) ion, while Fe3+ is called the iron(III) ion. This system is used only for elements that form more than one common positive ion. We do not call the Na+ ion the sodium(I) ion because (I) is unnecessary. Sodium forms only a 1+ ion, so there is no ambiguity about the name sodium ion. The second system, called the common system, is not conventional but is still prevalent and used in the health sciences. This system recognizes that many metals have two common cations. The common system uses two suffixes (-ic and -ous) that are appended to the stem of the element name. The -ic suffix represents the greater of the two cation charges, and the -ous suffix represents the lower one. In many cases, the stem of the element name comes from the Latin name of the element. Table 3.2 \\"The Common System of Cation Names\\" lists the elements that use the common system, along with their respective cation names. Table 3.2 The Common System of Cation Names.   Q: The name of a monatomic cation is simply the name of the element followed by this word?

We have the equation: 257 = -17*g + 325. Our goal is to find the value of g, which is like figuring out the missing piece of the puzzle. First, let's try to move everything in the equation so that we only have g on one side. To do that, let's move 325 to the other side (where 257 is). To move the 325, we will subtract it from both sides of the equation. This is like taking away 325 marbles from both sides of a balance to keep it even. So now we have: 257 - 325 = -17*g When we subtract 325 from 257, we get: -68 = -17*g Now we need to find g. To do this, we'll divide both sides by -17, which is like sharing -68 cookies among -17 friends. -68 ÷ -17 = g Once we divide -68 by -17, we get: g = 4 So, g equals 4!

Who is this American actress who appeared on  the HBO series \\"The Sopranos\\" and in the 2007 television film \\"Snowglobe?\\" The answer to this question is:","output":"Lorraine Bracco. Lorraine Bracco is an American actress who gained recognition for her captivating performances on television and in film. She was born on October 2, 1954, in Brooklyn, New York. After beginning her career as a fashion model in France, she transitioned to acting in the early 1980s. Bracco made her cinematic debut in 1980 with a small role in the French film \\"Duos sur canapé.\\" She appeared in a few more European films before returning to the United States and securing American film roles such as in \\"Someone to Watch Over Me\\" (1987) and \\"The Dream Team\\" (1989). Her big breakthrough came when she received critical acclaim and an Academy Award nomination for her role as Karen Hill in the iconic Mafia film \\"Goodfellas\\" (1990), directed by Martin Scorsese. This role pushed her acting career to new heights and increased her visibility in Hollywood. However, it was her portrayal of Dr. Jennifer Melfi, an empathetic and rational psychiatrist, on the HBO series \\"The Sopranos\\" (1999-2007) that earned her widespread recognition. This groundbreaking television series, created by David Chase, focuses on the life and relationships of mob boss Tony Soprano, portrayed by James Gandolfini. Bracco's role in \\"The Sopranos\\" earned her multiple Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress and has cemented her place among the finest actors on television. In 2007, Lorraine Bracco appeared in the television film \\"Snowglobe,\\" a fantasy Christmas movie starring Christina Milian. Bracco played the role of Rose, the protagonist's mother.

You should describe the task and explain your answer. While answering a multiple choice question, first output the correct answer(s). Then explain why other answers are wrong. You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. If you have a mass of 50 kg on Earth, what is your weight in newtons? An object with more mass is pulled by gravity with greater force. Mass and weight are closely related. However, the weight of an object can change if the force of gravity changes. On Earth, the force of gravity is the same everywhere. So how does the force of gravity change? It doesnt if you stay on Earth. What if we travel to another planet or moon in our solar system? Look at the photo of astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. taken by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong in the Figure. They were the first humans to walk on the moon. An astronaut weighs less on the moon than he would on Earth. This is because the moons gravity is weaker than Earths. The astronauts mass, on the other hand, did not change. He still contained the same amount of matter on the moon as he did on Earth. If the astronaut weighed 175 pounds on Earth, he would have weighed only 29 pounds on the moon. If his mass on Earth was 80 kg, what would his mass have been on the moon? [Figure 3]  After reading the above, is \\"Mass is the amount of matter and weight is the force of gravity on the object\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What's the difference between weight and mass?\\"? Choices: a). no; b). yes;","output":"b). yes; The correct answer is \\"yes\\". The statement \\"Mass is the amount of matter and weight is the force of gravity on the object\\" is indeed the correct difference between weight and mass. Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object, usually measured in kilograms. In contrast, weight is the force on an object due to gravity and is commonly measured in newtons on Earth. While mass remains constant across different gravitational fields, weight can change as gravity changes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: -  You speak into the receiver on your phone - Sound waves move parts inside the receiver - Movement causes the magnet inside to produce eletricity - Electricity is transferred through  a wire or cable - A membrane in the other persons phone is vibrated by the magnet in their telephone - Sound is produced A:","output":"The final step of the process is the sound reproduction at the other person's phone, which allows them to hear and understand the message being conveyed. This is accomplished through the following sequence of events: 1. You speak into the receiver on your phone, and your voice generates sound waves. 2. The sound waves produced by your voice cause the diaphragm inside the receiver to vibrate. 3. These vibrations cause a magnet (attached to the diaphragm) to move back and forth within a coil of wire, generating an electrical current that corresponds to the original sound wave. 4. This electrical current is then transferred through a wire or cable (in the case of a landline phone) or is converted into a digital signal and transmitted wirelessly (in the case of a mobile or VoIP phone). 5. If the call is landline-to-landline, the signal is transferred through a series of cables and telephone exchanges. If the call is made using a mobile phone or VoIP service, the signal is transmitted via a network of cell towers or through the internet, respectively, before ultimately reaching the recipient's phone. 6. Upon reaching the other person's phone, the electrical current or digital signal is converted back into an analog signal (if necessary, in the case of digital transmission). This signal is then amplified and sent to the earpiece of their phone. 7. Inside the earpiece of the recipient's phone, there is a diaphragm (usually a small cone-shaped component) attached to a magnet. The electrical current or analog signal is used to create a magnetic field that causes the magnet and attached diaphragm to vibrate at specific frequencies that correspond to the incoming signal. 8. As the diaphragm vibrates, it generates sound waves that reproduce your voice with a high degree of fidelity. These sound waves travel through the air and ultimately reach the ears of the person on the other end of the call, allowing them to hear and understand the message you conveyed through your initial speech. This complex process ultimately allows for real-time communication between individuals over vast distances, making it possible for people to keep in touch with friends, family members, and colleagues around the world with relative ease."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: A month went by in this manner , but a month was all I could bear . The memory of Marguerite accompanied me wherever I went . I had loved that woman --- still loved her --- too much for her suddenly to mean nothing to me . Whatever feelings I might have for her now , I had to see her again . At once . ... I knew Marguerite . Meeting me so unexpectedly must have thrown her into a state of great confusion . Probably , she had heard of my departure which had set her mind at rest as to the consequences of our sudden parting . But , seeing me back and coming face to face with me , pale as I was , she had sensed that my return had a purpose , and must have wondered what was going to happen . If , when I saw her again , Marguerite had been unhappy ; if , in taking my revenge  , there had also been some way of helping her , then I might well have forgiven her , and would certainly never have dreamed of doing her any harm . But when I saw her again , she was happy , at least on the surface . Another man had ensured her the luxury  in which I had been unable to keep her . She brought shame both to my pride and my love ; she was going to have to pay for what I had suffered . I could not remain indifferent  to what she did now . It followed that the thing that would hurt her most would be exactly for me to show indifference . Indifference , therefore , was the feeling which I now needed to pretend , not only in her presence but in the eyes of others . I tried to put a smile on my face , and I went to call on Prudence with whom Marguerite was staying . Prudence saw me to the door , and I returned to my apartment with tears of anger in my eyes and thirst for revenge in my heart and thought only of finding a way to make the poor creature suffer . Question: What kind of feelings did the hero most probably have ? Answer: A:","output":"The hero in this story appears to harbor a mix of complex emotions towards Marguerite. They primarily include love, confusion, humiliation, indignance, anger, desire for revenge, and a need to feign indifference.  Even after a month of separation, the hero's love for Marguerite hadn't waned, suggesting a deep emotional attachment. Seeing her again, however, stirred up a whirlwind of distressing emotions. Discovering Marguerite in a state of happiness, in the arms of another man and enjoying a life of luxury presumably provided by this man, triggered feelings of humiliation and a bruised ego. The hero also felt indignance at the perceived betrayal by Marguerite – she seemed to not reciprocate the love he still held for her and appeared to have moved on easily. This greatly upset the hero, spawning a rage within him and a thirst for vengeance, which highlights an undercurrent of anger he held towards her. He wished to make her suffer for the heartache he underwent. Despite these intensely negative feelings, the hero understood that showing his true emotions would not be beneficial. The best way, he believed, to cause Marguerite pain was to demonstrate indifference towards her. This required him to suppress his actual feelings and pretend as though he was not bothered at all by her actions. This emotional turmoil between his genuine feelings and the need to seem indifferent highlights his state of inner conflict."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hypothesis: Southeast Asian ministers' meeting is held in Laos.","output":"Yes, based on the provided context, we can draw the hypothesis that the Southeast Asian ministers' meeting is being held in Laos. The context specifically mentions that the Southeast Asian ministers gather in Laos for their regional meeting. This statement alone gives us enough information to form the hypothesis. Let's break down the context to understand further: 1. \\"The Southeast Asian ministers\\" - This refers to a group of government representatives or decision-makers from Southeast Asian nations. Southeast Asia is a region comprising 11 countries: Brunei, Cambodia, East Timor, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. 2. \\"gather in Laos\\" - This indicates that these ministers or representatives from the Southeast Asian nations are converging in one location, which is Laos. Laos is a Southeast Asian country itself, making it an appropriate location for such a regional meeting. 3. \\"for their regional meeting\\" - This implies that the ministers have an assembly or meeting intended to address or discuss issues relevant to the Southeast Asian region as a whole. Taking all these points into consideration, the context strongly supports the hypothesis that the Southeast Asian ministers' meeting is being held in Laos. These meetings typically involve member countries discussing various regional cooperation matters, such as trade, economics, security, cultural exchange, or environmental conservation. Additionally, these meetings can also serve as a platform for the nations to address current or emerging global challenges and foster unity and collaboration across the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: If a wet diaper is worn for a long time, or if urine and/or stool irritate the infant’s skin, diaper rash can result. An infant’s bottom or genitals may become red and sore, causing discomfort and irritability. However, the condition can be easily treated at home. Usually, diaper rash will be avoided or disappear within twenty-four hours if:  Diapers are changed frequently The infant’s skin is washed carefully A non-prescription diaper ointment is applied at diaper changes This condition, called jaundice, is common in infants and is not usually associated with a disease or problem. It may cause yellowing of the skin, or orange or greenish in some cases. It may show up 24 hours after birth and peak at about 72 hours. It appears because an infant builds up a substance called bilirubin, and can have a number of causes ranging from not getting enough breast milk to the newborn having an immature liver. Usually, jaundice will clear on its own within a few days, but frequent feeding (every 2-3 hours) and a phototherapy treatment are also be recommended: Phototherapy treatments expose the infant to light, which helps to eliminate bilirubin. Your physician will explain what phototherapy to use, if one is deemed necessary. Light tan spots (sometimes called café-au-lait spots) may appear at birth or develop in a child’s first few years. If many of these spots (or especially large ones) are present, your doctor will monitor your child, since they may be a sign of a condition called neurofibromatosis. There may be moles present on your newborn, called congenital nevi. These can vary in size: they may be as small as a pea, or large enough to cover an entire limb. Your doctor will inspect and monitor nevi, since large ones have a greater risk of becoming skin cancer. Port wine stains (large purple-red patches) are often harmless, but could be a symptom of an underlying issue such as Sturge-Weber syndrome or Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome. Fat necrosis is a movable lump underneath the surface that appears on some infants. Though fat necrosis is often benign and will go away on its own within a few weeks, your doctor will want to examine the lump to make sure that it is not related to another condition (such as renal disease or hypercalcemia). If your newborn’s skin is bluish all over (cyanosis), let your physician know right away. This could indicate that your newborn’s blood is not circulating properly, or be a sign of a heart problem. If you feel that your baby is acting unusually, or if he or she develops unexplained skin conditions, talk to your physician, especially if you notice:  Pain, swelling, or warmth in an area of your baby’s skin Red streaks extending from an area on his or her skin Pus Swollen lymph nodes Fever (38°C / 100.4°F or higher) Your baby is unusually fussy Summary:","output":"Diaper rash can result from wearing a wet diaper for too long or from skin irritation, causing redness and soreness in the infant's bottom or genitals.

We tried a lot of samples, but didn't play with the toys much this visit.  We went to gets some cheese for the cheese fair on Wednesday at my daughter's after school program.  So naturally, what would take me five minutes turned into half an hour.  I picked up a pack of Babybel Cheese for the cheese fest and headed to the cashiers.  As usual, there was a longer-than-the-supermarket wait.  It's finally my turn, and I give the cashier my card, and he tells me that it is expired.  \\"Can we get a manager on aisle 4 please!!\\"  So the manager comes over, and the cashier pleads my case like a champ, \\"His card expired and he just wants to get the bag of cheese, he'll renew next time.\\"  I would have renewed then, but, of course, my MasterCard and Visa are no good at Costco.  I have the cash for the cheese, but not for the renewal as well.  The manager looks at my accounts and tells me that it has been expired since May, and that he can't let me buy the cheese.  So apparently my wife and I hadn't been to Costco since before May, but I'm sure it appeared as if I were a serial non-renewer.  That might be plausible if I weren't buying a single 24 pack of Babybels.  Yeah, I'm refusing to renew so that I can buy well priced cheese wrapped in wax.  The wax is actually really cool.

Question: President Donald Trump is counting on congressional Republicans to enact a package of tax cuts in the coming weeks, in the process delivering his first major legislative achievement since taking office in January. But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president. Trump probably feels that he should go forward with the plan despite some polls indicating it is viewed negatively because... Pick the correct answer from the following options: - He needs any kind of tax plan to remain president - not enough information - The people that voted for him like it - He needs the money to help accomplish his executive goals Answer:","output":"The correct answer is: The people that voted for him like it. In this situation, President Trump is likely to go forward with the tax plan, despite some polls indicating it is viewed negatively, because his core political base, who voted for him, are largely in favor of it. As mentioned in the text, 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president and this tax cut plan fulfills one of his main campaign promises. So, Trump is catering to the expectations of those who helped him get elected, prioritizing their support and showcasing that he is a man of his word."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Morgan Griffith (R-Va.) told the Loop Tuesday he surprised some colleagues when he told them he was the author of a new marijuana bill, but he hopes having a Republican at the helm will “make people take another look at it.” It’s not a new position for Griffith, who staked this position as Majority Leader in the Virginia legislature, and even drafted legislation in 2010 that swiftly died in the House of Delegates. Now as a member of Congress, Griffith has taken this libertarian view to a larger stage, introducing LUMMA, the Legitimate Use of Medicinal Marijuana Act. Griffith’s bill would ensure states could make their own decisions about medical marijuana usage without the federal government stepping in. His bill would also reclassify marijuana under the Justice Department’s controlled substances lists, so the drug wouldn’t be linked with harder drugs, such as heroin. “I am saying if we can use [opioids], why the fear of using [marijuana] for legit medicinal purpose?” Griffith said. Public support for medical marijuana use is overwhelming. A CNN/ORC poll in January found 88 percent of American adults supports legalizing the drug for medical reasons. Griffith still thinks legalizing marijuana fully, so just anyone can go down to “Billy Bob’s marijuana shop,” is “irresponsible,” he said. But there has also been a sea change in public opinion on legalizing marijuana for recreational use, as Colorado and Washington state did. A Pew Research Center study in February found 54 percent support making the drug legal, compared with 2010 when 41 percent supported marijuana legalization. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Republican Congressman Morgan Griffith is pushing for the legalization of medical marijuana through the Legitimate Use of Medicinal Marijuana Act (LUMMA).

She has the guilty musician, Gilbert Redman (Michael Redgrave), thrown out of his room, only to have him move into hers, forcing her to capitulate. Miss Froy (Dame May Whitty), a former governess and music teacher, listens to a tune performed by a folk singer under her window. Unseen by her, the singer is killed.

When Iris awakens, Miss Froy has vanished. The strangers in her compartment say they know nothing about an English lady. Even Todhunter in the next compartment, who spoke with Miss Froy earlier, pretends not to remember her. Iris searches, but cannot find her. She meets up with Gilbert, who agrees to help.

I read this background article the other day: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

(April 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)   Episode 1[edit] A United States government satellite crash lands near Piedmont, Utah, and two teenagers find it and bring it back to town. The town's inhabitants open it and release a deadly microorganism, which is later codenamed Andromeda by the Army. A team is sent from the Army's bio-defense department to retrieve the satellite, only to die from the disease themselves. The video footage recorded by the retrieval team and their strange deaths capture the attention of General George Mancheck, the head of the bio-defense department, who activates \\"Wildfire,\\" a team of five scientists who are called upon when high-level bioterror threats occur in the United States. The team, headed by its creator, Dr. Jeremy Stone, investigates Piedmont. They retrieve the satellite and rescue a hysterical 60-year-old man and a colicky baby who have survived the Andromeda outbreak. In an isolated underground laboratory, the Wildfire team begins their examination of the downed satellite and the two survivors. The laboratory is powered by a small water-cooled nuclear reactor. In the event of a contamination breach, a 15-minute self-destruct sequence would be automatically initiated; however if the activated sequence is deemed unnecessary, Major Bill Keane, designated by the Odd-Man Hypothesis (which states that unmarried men are capable of carrying out the best, most dispassionate decisions during crisis), is the only person able to deactivate the sequence, using his pass key and right thumbprint. The scientists begin their analysis of the Andromeda strain by recovering a sample from inside the satellite. They initially discover that the microorganism is contained within a delivery system of buckyballs, a technology more advanced than anything known at present. The team theorizes that Andromeda may have an... The answer is:","output":"The Andromeda Strain"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's do that: -60*i - 178*i + 86*i - 521*i = (-60 - 178 + 86 - 521) * i When we calculate the numbers in the parentheses, we get: (-238 - 435) * i = -673 * i Now our equation looks like this: -15479 = -673 * i Now, we need to find out what i is. It's like sharing candies equally among friends. So, we will divide -15479 by -673. i = -15479 / -673 When we do this division, we get: i = 23 So there you have it!

Write an article based on this \\"A terror suspect arrested near the Houses of Parliament is Khalid Mohamed Omar Ali, the BBC understands.\\"","output":"Title: Khalid Mohamed Omar Ali: A Terror Suspect Arrested Near the Houses of Parliament Introduction The significance of securing national landmarks and government institutions cannot be overstated, especially in times when the threat of terrorism looms large. The case of Khalid Mohamed Omar Ali serves as a stark reminder of the importance of relentless vigilance in protecting public spaces. In this article, we delve into the background of Ali, his arrest near the Houses of Parliament, and the potential repercussions of this incident. Background of Khalid Mohamed Omar Ali Khalid Mohamed Omar Ali is a British citizen, born in London to Somali parents. It is believed that Ali had displayed radical tendencies since a young age, and was reportedly inspired by extremist ideologies. Intelligence agencies had been keeping a watchful eye on him, following his visits to the Middle East and his suspected links to terror groups. His Arrest The arrest of Khalid Mohamed Omar Ali occurred on April 27, 2017, near the Houses of Parliament in London. The 27-year-old suspect was detained by the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command on suspicion of possessing weapons and planning to carry out a terrorist attack.  Ali was carrying a backpack containing multiple knives, raising immediate concerns among law enforcement authorities. Subsequently, during the course of investigation and interrogation, it was revealed that Ali had a history of involvement with extremist groups and had previously travelled to war-torn countries. He was also charged with preparing terrorist acts, and for his involvement in explosives manufacturing in Afghanistan between 2011 and 2012. Impact and Preventive Measures The arrest of Khalid Mohamed Omar Ali demonstrated the gravity of the situation in the United Kingdom, and the persistent threat of terrorism against vital institutions. The Houses of Parliament, an emblem of the British democracy and identity, symbolizes the heart of the nation's political and legislative system. This incident increased the pressure on law enforcement and intelligence agencies to ramp up vigilance, improve counterterrorism measures, and step-up security around sensitive locations. In the aftermath of Ali's arrest, and other high-profile terror attacks in the country, the British government implemented a series of security measures aimed at enhancing the protection of critical infrastructure and crowded public spaces. These measures included: 1. Enhanced surveillance and broader intelligence gathering to identify and track potential terrorists – Special attention was given to monitoring individuals with known extremist views, international travel patterns, and potential ties to terror groups. 2. Strengthening the cooperation and coordination among law enforcement, intelligence agencies and allied nations – By exchanging real-time information and sharing critical intelligence, authorities are able to better anticipate and prevent potential terror attacks. 3. Beefing up security around public spaces and iconic landmarks – The introduction of additional police forces, barricades, and sophisticated surveillance equipment are designed to mitigate the risk of an attack and provide an added sense of security for citizens. 4. Public awareness campaigns – Governments around the world are increasingly calling on the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the authorities. Encouraging an active citizenry can be a crucial asset in the fight against terrorism. Conclusion The arrest of Khalid Mohamed Omar Ali near the Houses of Parliament served as a wake-up call on the continuous threat of terrorism facing the United Kingdom and the world. As we strive to eliminate the scourge of terrorism, the need for robust, effective, and adaptive security measures is becoming all the more pertinent. It is not only the prerogative of governments and security agencies but also the responsibility of each citizen to contribute to efforts aimed at maintaining a safe and secure society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Draft National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for England recommend teachers demonstrate how to use soap and water correctly. And they should provide age-appropriate lessons on when antibiotic drugs are unnecessary, says NICE. For example, having a cold or the flu is not a reason to seek antibiotics. These infections are viral and cannot be treated with antibiotics, says NICE. NICE says an effective hand-washing technique involves three stages: preparation, washing and rinsing, and drying. Children, and adults for that matter, should always wash their hands after using the toilet, before eating, before touching the eyes or mouth, and after handling animals. The guidelines are a response to fears that unless action is taken, treatment resistant bacteria could kill more people than currently die from cancer by 2050. Last month, Nice published guidance aimed at health professionals, estimating that as many as 10 million prescriptions for antibiotics in England are being given out unnecessarily every year.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? One of the first elements of the universe you should focus on is the scope of the universe, or how much physical space the universe takes up in a larger world. Consider how big you want your universe to be. It might help to think about what you want your fictional universe to hold and how large it is compared to other universes or worlds.  Maybe the universe is the larger world, as far as your characters know, and there are several planets or lands within the universe. Or maybe the universe is very small and consists of only one planet or one land, which is then populated with many different cities and towns. Thinking about the scope of the universe can help give you a sense of the big picture. You can then zoom in to the smaller details once you have the larger details set. You should also think about how the universe looks in terms of geography and landscape. Are there many different terrains within the universe, depending on where you are in the universe? Is there one dominate terrain, such as a universe made of ice or a universe made of jungles?  You should also consider how many different terrains or landscapes are going to be in the universe. You may separate these terrains by area, province, or even by different planets. You may also start to think about how the landscapes in the universe might affect other elements, such as the economic systems, the social structures, and the customs of the world. You may have certain beings who live in specific terrains or landscapes only, such as humans who live in cities and towns, and mutants who live in jungles. You should also consider how weather functions in the universe. Is there always rain and monsoons on certain planets in the universe or droughts and wildfires in certain areas on a planet or land within the universe? Try to be specific about how the weather functions in each area of the universe. Keep in mind you are building a fictional universe, so the laws of physics and nature may not function in the same ways they do on earth or in our world. You are not bound by the rules of our world and you can make your fictional universe as strange and upside down as you would like. This means you may have areas of landscape where it rains fire or where there are jungles next to ice caves and waterfalls in deserts. of the universe. To get a better sense of the physicality of the universe, you may sit down and draw a map of the universe. This could be a detailed sketch of the different lands and areas in the universe as well as the names of these areas. You can also use a computer program to draw the map. Using a computer program might allow you to get more detailed and draw elements of the universe in proportion to each other.  Try to be as detailed as you can when you draw the map, as you will be using the map as a reference point when you sit down to create stories in your fictional universe. Include names of cities, towns, areas, and lands, as well as basic information about the landscape, terrain, and climate of the area. You may also color the map so it is easy to reference when you create stories set in the universe. You can view several examples of drawn maps of fictional worlds and universes, including an interactive map of J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle Earth from The Lord of the Rings. Summary:","output":"This article discusses the importance of considering the scope, geography, terrain, and weather of a fictional universe, suggesting that creating a detailed map can help in visualizing and developing stories within that universe."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

There are the drought--avoiders--those which persist  only as seeds, ready to spring up when it rains, to flower quickly and produce another crop of seeds, and to die again. There are also the drought--resisters--those which have evolved various methods for strong water, locating underground water, or reducing their need for water by such devices as shedding their leaves. The drought--resisters are perennials ,they manage to live from one rainy season to another, slowly growing bigger and bigger. Of these, the succulents  is a small but interesting fraction . They may store water in their leaves, in their stems, or in underground containers.    In the American deserts the best--known succulents are the cacti . They come in a wide range of sizes, from 50--foot tall giant saguaros  to tiny round cacti about the size of a thumb--nail. They take thick, cylindrical  or even spherical forms, thereby exposing a minimum of evaporating surface to the air and light. They are leafless, except in youth, and then the leaves are small. Typically their surfaces are spiny, discouraging thirsty animals, and channeled like an accordion , so the fleshy stem may expand quickly when the plant drinks and contract slowly as it uses up the water. The root system is widespread and shallow, with good reason; only about 3 per cent of the rain that falls on the desert penetrates to any significant depth into soil.

In the context provided, the pronoun \\"She\\" is being used to refer back to Susan, who was mentioned earlier in the sentence. This is an example of a pronoun acting as an anaphoric reference, where it points to a previously mentioned noun within the same sentence or discourse. In the sentence, \\"Jane knocked on Susan's door, but there was no answer. *She* was out,\\" the mention of Susan's door provides the connection between Susan and the subsequent \\"She.\\" When reading the sentence, our understanding of the context and the use of the pronoun lets us naturally assume that \\"She\\" is referring to Susan, since Susan is the only female character mentioned in the sentence. Furthermore, since Jane is the one knocking on the door, the pronoun \\"She\\" cannot be referring to Jane because the action that follows (\\"was out\\") is not related to Jane's action of knocking. Therefore, it makes logical sense that \\"She\\" is referring to Susan in this situation, as it is implied that she is not home. It's important to note that pronouns help the text to flow more naturally and prevents unnecessary repetition of nouns within a sentence or passage.

Use the following format: Part  # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Definition: This task is about classifying the similarity of two sentences. The sentences can be classified as (a) SIMILAR - similar to each other, and (b) DISSIMILAR - not similar to each other. Sentences that have the same RDF relationship in terms of [subject, predicate, object] are similar to each other. The input is a list of two sentences and the output is either SIMILAR or DISSIMILAR. Input: ['The Acharya Institute of Technology is located in Soldevanahalli, at the address Acharya Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan Road, Hessarghatta Main Road, Bangalore – 560090. Its director is Dr. G. P. Prabhukumar.', 'Elliot See was born in Dallas and went onto be a student at University of Texas at Austin which is affiliated to the University of Texas system. The University is competing in the Big 12 Conference. Elliot See died in St. Louis.'] Output:","output":"Part #1: Classifying the similarity of two sentences Usage: The main task is to determine if the given sentences are similar or not based on their RDF relationships. The output for the two sample input sentences could be \\"DISSIMILAR\\" since they discuss different subjects (The Acharya Institute of Technology and Elliot See) and have different relationships (location/director and biography/education).  Part #2: Understanding RDF relationships Usage: RDF (Resource Description Framework) relationships are defined by a set of [subject, predicate, object] triplets. In the first input sentence, an example of an RDF relationship would be [The Acharya Institute of Technology, located in, Soldevanahalli]. An RDF relationship in the second input sentence would be [Elliot See, born in, Dallas]. Part #3: Identifying SIMILAR or DISSIMILAR sentences Usage: Sentences are classified as SIMILAR if they share the same RDF relationship. Since the two input sentences don't share the same RDF relationship, they are classified as DISSIMILAR. Part #4: Analyzing the input list of two sentences Usage: The given input ['The Acharya Institute of Technology is located...', 'Elliot See was born in Dallas...'] is a list containing two sentences. Each of these sentences needs to be analyzed for their subjects, predicates, and objects to determine RDF relationships. Part #5: Presenting the output Usage: For the given input sentences, the output should be \\"DISSIMILAR\\" as the criteria for classification as SIMILAR is not met. The output should clearly mention whether the sentences are SIMILAR or DISSIMILAR based on their RDF relationships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Second answer: To be more strategic when coding, think like you're building a LEGO castle. Don't just start sticking bricks together randomly. Instead, plan out what different parts (like towers and walls) you want, then build those parts separately before putting them together! This helps you use object-oriented programming, which is a way to write code that's organized like a real-life object, with things it can do (methods) and details about it (properties).

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. You know that friction also causes heat. Think about when you rub your hands together. It is friction that makes them warm. But why does this happen? Friction causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster. Faster moving particles have more heat energy. Heat from friction can be useful. Can you think of other places where you might find friction? Friction also lets you light a match. Heat from friction can also cause problems. It can cause a car to overheat. To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. Oil coats the surfaces of moving parts. This coating of oil makes them slippery. When things are slippery there is less friction. Have you ever seen a sign that says, slippery when wet? This too has to do with friction. Water, like oil, can reduce friction. The wet surface may allow your shoes to slide more easily.  Question: \\"Can oil reduce the amount of heat that is produced from the moving parts of a car?\\" Response: \\"Can cause overheat\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct? OPT: + no + yes","output":"+ yes The response is factually correct. The paragraph specifically states that \\"Heat from friction can also cause problems. It can cause a car to overheat.

We have the equation:  3*w - 4560 = 113*w + 80*w First, let's combine the w's on the right side of the equation: 113*w + 80*w = (113+80)*w = 193*w Now our equation looks like this: 3*w - 4560 = 193*w Next, let's move the 3*w to the right side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 3*w from both sides: -4560 = 193*w - 3*w Now, we have: -4560 = 190*w To find the value of w, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 190: -4560 ÷ 190 = w Now let's find the answer: w = -24 So, the solution for the equation is: w = -24"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – Run Run Shaw might not be a household name, but these are: Chow Yun-fat and John Woo, who got their starts at his studio, and Quentin Tarantino, who was one of many filmmakers inspired by him. Shaw, the Hong Kong producer who is considered the father of the kung fu movie genre, died today at home in Hong Kong, aged 106. Shaw was born Shao Yifu; \\"Run Run\\" was a nickname. He and his older brother, the similarly-nicknamed Run Me, made their first film in 1924. By 1927, they had moved to Singapore and were producing movies as well as importing others to play in their theaters, the New York Times reports. After World War II, Run Run ended up in Hong Kong, where, by the late 1960s, he was enjoying great success making modern martial arts movies including Five Fingers of Death and Shaolin Avenger. The Shaw Bros. studio was the largest in Asia at that time, and produced the region's most popular films, the Los Angeles Times reports. \\"We were like the Hollywood of the 1930s,\\" Shaw once said; he had created Shaw Movietown, a huge complex where his employees both lived and worked. \\"We controlled everything: the talent, the production, the distribution and the exhibition.\\" But he lost out on one very big name: Bruce Lee. Lee wanted 10,000 per movie and a long-term contract, which Shaw rejected; a competing company, founded by a former Shaw employee, ended up backing Lee instead. But Shaw's success continued: In addition to the nearly 1,000 films his companies released, he eventually expanded into television, publishing, real estate, and more—he became one of Macy's biggest shareholders in the 1990s, to help save it from bankruptcy—and even co-produced US movies including Blade Runner. He was also a generous philanthropist who was eventually knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. He is survived by his second wife and four children, the AP reports. Article:","output":"Title: Remembering Run Run Shaw: The Father of Kung Fu Cinema Run Run Shaw may not be a name that is instantly recognizable like Chow Yun-fat, John Woo, or Quentin Tarantino, but his influence on the world of cinema, particularly in the kung fu genre, can be felt even today. Shaw, who was born Shao Yifu and affectionately nicknamed \\"Run Run,\\" passed away at 106 years old in his home in Hong Kong, leaving behind a legacy of martial arts films that have inspired generations of filmmakers. Starting with his older brother (also nicknamed Run Me), Run Run Shaw began making films in 1924. Within three years, the brothers had moved to Singapore, both producing and importing movies to be shown in their theaters. It was after World War II that Run Run found his greatest success in Hong Kong. By the late 1960s, he had become a significant figure in modern martial arts cinema, producing films such as \\"Five Fingers of Death\\" and \\"Shaolin Avenger.\\" The Shaw Bros. studio, which he established, grew to become the largest in Asia during its peak, producing the region's most popular films. Shaw once compared his studio to the Hollywood of the 1930s; he created Shaw Movietown, an expansive complex where employees resided and worked. He explained, \\"We controlled everything: the talent, the production, the distribution, and the exhibition.\\" However, this control did not extend to the legendary Bruce Lee, as Shaw had missed out on the opportunity to work with him. Lee demanded a 10,000 salary per movie and a long-term contract, which Shaw did not accept. Eventually, a former Shaw employee formed a competing company that signed Lee, leaving Shaw's studio without the iconic martial artist. Undeterred by this loss, Shaw went on to achieve continued success in the entertainment industry. His companies released nearly 1,000 films, expanded into television, publishing, real estate, and even co-produced US movies, including the iconic science fiction film \\"Blade Runner.\\" Furthermore, Shaw ventured into retail, becoming one of Macy's largest shareholders in the 1990s. Besides being an influential figure in the film industry, Run Run Shaw was also a philanthropist. His efforts earned him a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II, acknowledging his generosity and outstanding contributions. He is survived by his second wife and four children. As the father of the kung fu movie genre, Run Run Shaw will long be remembered for his impact on cinema and those he inspired along the way."},{"instruction":"Given this review: \\"Exceptional\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

Despite his ruthlessness in his job, he is illiterate and keeps to himself, trying to avoid making connections with the people around him. One day, Mathilda's family gets caught in the crossfire of a gang rivalry and are brutally murdered. Leon, who has been observing the situation from his window and has developed a soft spot for Mathilda, takes her in before the killers can find her.

Leon reluctantly agrees, and Mathilda begins her tutelage under the watchful eyes of her newfound mentor. As they spend time together, Mathilda learns of Leon's illiteracy and offers to teach him how to read in exchange for his guidance on becoming an assassin.

Answer: The 1927 Victor recording sessions in Bristol generally mark the beginning of the country music genre and the rise of the Grand Ole Opry in the 1930s helped make Nashville the center of the country music recording industry. Question: how tennessee became a state Answer:","output":"Tennessee becoming a state was a lengthy and intricate process that began long before 1927 Victor recording sessions in Bristol or the rise of the Grand Ole Opry in the 1930s. Understanding the historical context and key events that led to Tennessee's statehood is essential to fully appreciate how it became the 16th state of the United States. In the mid-18th century, Tennessee was mainly inhabited by various Native American tribes, primarily the Cherokee. European settlers, mainly from the British colonies, moved into the area in search of fertile lands. Initially, these settlers faced strong opposition and resistance from the native tribes, but eventually, they started establishing small frontier settlements. By the 1760s, the region had become a part of the British Province of North Carolina. The 1770s saw a series of developments that further shifted the geopolitical landscape in Tennessee. The Transylvania Purchase in 1775 led to an increase in the number of settlers and territorial disputes among the British, the native tribes, and colonial pioneers. Throughout the 1780s, the area that now encompasses Tennessee gained more autonomy but was still part of North Carolina. In 1784, the residents of the region east of the Appalachian Mountains, known as the Watauga Association, attempted to secede from North Carolina and form a separate state called \\"Franklin.\\" However, this proposal to create the State of Franklin was not approved by the Continental Congress, and the movement ultimately failed. After the signing of the United States Constitution in 1787, the Southwest Territory was established. This territory included the area west of the Appalachian Mountains, which comprises modern-day Tennessee. President George Washington appointed William Blount, a native of North Carolina, as the governor of the Southwest Territory in 1790. Governor Blount worked closely with the settlers and native tribes, helping to establish a peaceful relationship between them. He oversaw the treaty negotiations that led to the Treaty of Holston (White's Fort) in 1791, which established formal borders between the Cherokee Nation and the Southwest Territory. With the borders in place, the population in the territory grew significantly, reaching a level appropriate to pursue statehood. In the summer of 1795, Governor Blount called for a constitutional convention and tasked delegates to draft a state constitution. The convention produced the Tennessee Constitution, which included provisions like popularly elected governors, a bicameral legislature, and a bill of rights. With the new constitution in place, Tennessee's statehood proposal was sent to Congress. On June 1, 1796, the United States Congress admitted Tennessee into the Union as the 16th state. This marked the first instance of a new state being admitted under the process outlined in the U.S. Constitution. In conclusion, Tennessee's journey to becoming a state involved various factors like European settlement, territorial conflicts, governance under the Southwest Territory, and negotiation of treaties with native tribes. The process culminated with the drafting of the Tennessee Constitution and its admission to the Union on June 1, 1796. The development and growth of country music and the influence of the Grand Ole Opry, which came much later, would significantly contribute to the cultural identity of the state, but was not related to its admission as a state."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How is \\"The value of any material object in this world can be assessed, but not the value of love.\\" said in Russian?","output":"«Ценность любого материального объекта в этом мире может быть оценена, но не ценность любви» - this is how you can say \\"The value of any material object in this world can be assessed, but not the value of love\\" in Russian. Now, let me provide you with a detailed explanation and breakdown of this translation: 1. Ценность (Tsen-nost') - This word translates to \\"value\\" or \\"worth\\" in English. It is a noun and refers to the quality that makes something desirable, useful, or important. 2. любого (lyu-bo-go) - This is the Genitive case of the adjective \\"любой\\" (lyu-boy), which translates to \\"any\\" or \\"every\\" in English. It is used here to emphasize the indefinite nature of the material objects being referred to. 3. материального (ma-te-rial-no-go) - This is the Genitive case of the adjective \\"материальный\\" (ma-te-rial-ny), which means \\"material\\" or \\"tangible.\\" In the sentence, it is used to describe the type of objects that the speaker is talking about. 4. объекта (ob-ye-k-ta) - This is the Genitive case of the noun \\"объект\\" (ob-yekt), which translates to \\"object\\" or \\"item\\" in English. It is used here to refer to the material things whose value can be assessed. 5. в (v) - This simple preposition translates to \\"in\\" or \\"at\\" in English. It is used here to express the location of the objects mentioned. 6. этом (e-tom) - This is the Locative case of the pronoun \\"этот\\" (e-tot), which means \\"this\\" in English. It is used here to refer to the world being spoken about. 7. мире (mi-re) - This is the Locative case of the noun \\"мир\\" (mir), which translates to \\"world\\" or \\"earth\\" in English. It is used here as the location where the material objects are found. 8. может (mo-zhet) - This word is the 3rd person singular form of the verb \\"мочь\\" (moch), which means \\"can\\" or \\"be able to\\" in English. It is used here to express the possibility of assessing the value of the objects mentioned. 9. быть (byt') - This is the infinitive form of the auxiliary verb \\"быть\\" (byt'), which means \\"to be\\" in English. It is used here in conjunction with the main verb \\"мочь\\" (moch) to express possibility or capability. 10. оценена (o-tse-ne-na) - This word is the feminine passive participle form of the verb \\"оценить\\" (o-tse-nit'), which translates to \\"assess\\" or \\"evaluate\\" in English. It is used here to indicate the action of determining the value of the material objects. 11. но (no) - This is a simple conjunction that means \\"but\\" or \\"however\\" in English. It is used here to express the contrast between the value of material objects and the value of love. 12. не (ne) - This is a common negative particle that translates to \\"not\\" in English. It is used here to negate the possibility of assessing the value of love. 13. ценность (Tsen-nost') - This word, as mentioned before, translates to \\"value\\" or \\"worth\\" in English. It is repeated in the sentence to draw a parallel between the value of material objects and the value of love. 14. любви (lyub-vi) - This is the Genitive case of the noun \\"любовь\\" (lyu-bov'), which translates to \\"love\\" in English. It is used here as the object of the preposition \\"of\\" in the phrase \\"the value of love.\\" So, putting it all together, the translation of \\"The value of any material object in this world can be assessed, but not the value of love\\" in Russian is: «Ценность любого материального объекта в этом мире может быть оценена, но не ценность любви»."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - A department store or magazine is a retail establishment offering a wide range of consumer goods in different product categories known as \\"departments\\". In modern major cities, the department store made a dramatic appearance in the middle of the 19th century, and permanently reshaped shopping habits, and the definition of service and luxury. Similar developments were under way in London (with Whiteleys), in Paris (\\"Le Bon Marché\\" in 1852) and in New York (with Stewart's).  - Butchered From Inside ( BFI ) is an electronic magazine edited by the Italian hacker community ( most notably , the S0ftpj group ) . It has been published , albeit irregularly , for over 10 years . It has also published various paper editions , such as the one for MOCA , the 10 - year summer camp for the organization \`\` Metro Olografix '' , the oldest Italian hacker 's association ( similar in inception to the German CCC ) . The editing criteria of originality and the peer review process are very similar to the ones adopted by Phrack magazine ( which mentions BFI as \`\` nice mag '' ) . While all the published issues are in the Italian language , French and English translations of a few articles are available . An archive of tools produced by contributors is also available . Some well known , published software such as KSTAT ( Kernel Security Therapy Anti-Trolls ) have been published and developed on and for BFI . This , and other content published on BFI , has been cited in at least 4 books , as well as on VX Heavens , and in mixed other archives . The BFI staff has been interviewed a number of times by in - print media ( such as \`\` ICT Security '' , the only Italian printed magazine on the subject ) , as well as Internet media .  - A magazine is a publication, usually a periodical publication, which is printed or electronically published (sometimes referred to as an online magazine). Magazines are generally published on a regular schedule and contain a variety of content. They are generally financed by advertising, by a purchase price, by prepaid subscriptions, or a combination of the three.At its root, the word \\"magazine\\" refers to a collection or storage location. In the case of written publication, it is a collection of written articles. This explains why magazine publications share the word root with gunpowder magazines, artillery magazines, firearms magazines, and, in French, retail stores such as department stores.  - A gunpowder magazine, also known as a polverista, is a magazine (building) designed to store the explosive gunpowder in wooden barrels for safety. Gunpowder, until superseded, was a universal explosive used in the military and for civil engineering: both applications required storage magazines. Most magazines were purely functional and tended to be in remote and secure locations.  - An online magazine is a magazine published on the Internet, through bulletin board systems and other forms of public computer networks. One of the first magazines to convert from a print magazine format to being online only was the computer magazine Datamation.   - Advertising is an audio or visual form of marketing communication that employs an openly sponsored, nonpersonal message to promote or sell a product, service or idea. Sponsors of advertising are often businesses who wish to promote their products or services. Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser usually pays for and has control over the message. It is differentiated from personal selling in that the message is nonpersonal, i.e., not directed to a particular individual. Advertising is communicated through various mass media, including old media such as newspapers, magazines, Television, Radio, outdoor advertising or direct mail; or new media such as search results, blogs, websites or text messages.

Researchers from the University of Texas said those who drank two or more diet sodas a day had waist  size increases that were six times greater than those of people who didn't drink diet soda.\\"What we saw was that the more diet sodas a person drank, the more weight they were likely to gain,\\" said Sharon Fowler. The study was based on data from 474 participants in a large, ongoing research project, where the participants were followed for nearly l0 years. While the findings are surprising, they also offer some explanations. Nutrition  expert, Melanie Rogers, who works with overweight patients in New York, has found that when patients are switched  from regular to diet soda, they don't lose weight at all.\\"We weren't seeing weight loss necessarily, and that was confusing to us,\\" said Rogers. So why would diet soda cause weight gain? No one knows for sure yet, but it could be that people think they can eat more if they drink diet soda, and so over-compensate  for the missing calories( ). A related study found some sweeteners   raised blood sugar levels in some mice.\\" Data from this and other potential studies suggest that the promotion of diet sodas and artificial  sweeteners may be risky,\\" said study researcher Helen P.Hazuda, professor at the University of Texas's school of medicine.

Fact 2: People who are distracted are hazards.  Given the two facts above, what is something that can be hazardous to use in public? A:","output":"Given the two facts you've mentioned, using cell phones in public can be hazardous.  This is primarily due to the potential distraction they can cause. For instance, people may be so focused on their phones that they neglect to pay attention to their surroundings. This can lead to various accidents, like bumping into other people, or even dangerous situations such as walking into traffic or missing warning signs of danger. In addition, being distracted by cell phones can also make individuals more vulnerable to theft or other types of crime, as they may not be alert to what's happening around them.  However, it's important to clarify that it is not the cell phone itself that's hazardous, but the distraction it can cause when people fail to use their phones responsibly or mindfully. So, using smartphones or any other devices in public isn't inherently dangerous; it becomes hazardous when users become oblivious to their surroundings due to being overly engrossed in their screens."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On the European front, U.S. Army troops formed a significant portion of the forces that captured North Africa and Sicily, and later fought in Italy. On D-Day, June 6, 1944, and in the subsequent liberation of Europe and defeat of Nazi Germany, millions of U.S. Army troops played a central role. In the Pacific War, U.S. Army soldiers participated alongside the United States Marine Corps in capturing the Pacific Islands from Japanese control. Following the Axis surrenders in May (Germany) and August (Japan) of 1945, army troops were deployed to Japan and Germany to occupy the two defeated nations. Two years after World War II, the Army Air Forces separated from the army to become the United States Air Force in September 1947 after decades of attempting to separate.

By utilizing the given information that one focus of the hyperbola frac{x^2}{9} - frac{y^2}{m} = 1 is at (5, 0), we can derive the equation 9 + m = 25 to find the value of m. **Step-by-step Solution** 1. Recall that the standard equation of a hyperbola with foci on the x-axis is given by frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} - frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1. In this problem, the hyperbola is centered at the origin, so h = 0 and k = 0. The equation becomes frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1. 2. The given hyperbola equation is frac{x^2}{9} - frac{y^2}{m} = 1. By comparing it with the standard equation, we can conclude that a^2 = 9 and b^2 = m. 3. The distance between the center of the hyperbola and one of its foci is represented by c (the linear eccentricity). In this problem, we are given that one focus lies at (5, 0). Since the center is at (0, 0), we can find c using the distance formula: c = sqrt{(5-0)^2 + (0-0)^2} = 5. 4. Recall the relationship between a, b, and c for a hyperbola: c^2 = a^2 + b^2. In this problem, c^2 = 5^2 = 25, a^2 = 9, and b^2 = m. Substituting these values into the relationship, we get 25 = 9 + m. 5. Solving for m, we find that m = 16.

The total hours charged to the project by Pat, Kate, and Mark is 198 hours. So we can write the equation: Kate's hours + Pat's hours + Mark's hours = Total hours K + 2K + 6K = 198 9K = 198 Now we solve for K: K = 198 / 9 K = 22 Now that we know Kate charged 22 hours, we can find out how many hours Mark charged: Mark's hours = 6K Mark's hours = 6 * 22 Mark's hours = 132 To find out how many more hours Mark charged to the project than Kate, we subtract Kate's hours from Mark's hours: Mark's hours - Kate's hours = Difference 132 - 22 = 110 Mark charged boxed{110}  more hours to the project than Kate."},{"instruction":"Two circles, X and Y, with the same area are inscribed in a rectangle. An isosceles triangle with base on one side of the rectangle has its vertex touching the circumference of circle Y. Circle X has a circumference of 14π. If half of the radius of circle Y is 'a', find the length of the altitude of the isosceles triangle in terms of 'a'.","output":"First, let's find the radius of circle X. Since the circumference of circle X is given as 14π, we can use the formula for the circumference of a circle, which is C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius. So, we have: 14π = 2πr r = 14π / 2π r = 7 Now, since circles X and Y have the same area, they must also have the same radius. Therefore, the radius of circle Y is also 7. Given that half of the radius of circle Y is 'a', we have: a = r / 2 a = 7 / 2 Now, let's consider the isosceles triangle. The base of the triangle is on one side of the rectangle, and the vertex touches the circumference of circle Y. The altitude of the triangle will be a line from the vertex to the midpoint of the base, and it will be perpendicular to the base. Since the triangle is isosceles, the altitude also bisects the base, creating two right triangles. The altitude is the height (h) of these right triangles, and the half-base will be 'a' (since it's half the radius of circle Y). Using the Pythagorean theorem for one of the right triangles, we have: h^2 + a^2 = r^2 Substituting the values we have: h^2 + (7/2)^2 = 7^2 h^2 + 49/4 = 49 h^2 = 49 - 49/4 h^2 = (196/4) - (49/4) h^2 = 147/4 h = √(147/4) h = √(147)/2 So, the length of the altitude of the isosceles triangle in terms of 'a' is: h = √(147)/2 Since a = 7/2, we can express √(147) as 7√(3), so: h = (7√(3))/2 And since a = 7/2, we can write h in terms of 'a' as: h = a√(3) Therefore, the length of the altitude of the isosceles triangle in terms of 'a' is boxed{a√(3)} ."},{"instruction":"Let [x^8  50x^4 + 9 = p(x)q(x),] where p(x) and q(x) are monic, nonconstant polynomials with integer coefficients.

(　　) A: 1 B: 2 C: 12 D: 24","output":"**Answer**: Let's denote the angular velocity of the hour hand as w. Then, the angular velocities of the minute hand and the second hand are 12w and 720w, respectively.   First, consider the angle, denoted as x, at which the hour hand overlaps with the minute hand. We have the equation:    frac{x}{w} = frac{x + 360n}{12w}  where n is the number of times the minute hand has lapped the hour hand. The value of n ranges from 1 to 22, which is because although the minute hand completes 24 cycles in a day, the hour hand also completes 2 cycles. Thus, 24 - 2 = 22.   Next, we substitute values of n to solve for x.   After finding x, we need to check if the second hand is also at position x.   The time it takes for the hour hand to reach position x is   frac{x}{w}  , and during this time, the total angle covered by the second hand is 720w times frac{x}{w} = 720x.   Then, we simplify this value to see if it falls within 360 degrees and equals w. The simplification process is as follows:   When n=1, x = frac{360}{11}.   720 times frac{360}{11} rightarrow 5 times frac{360}{11}. It's evident that when the hour and minute hands overlap, the second hand does not overlap with them.   When n=2, x = 2 times frac{360}{11}.   720 times 2 times frac{360}{11} rightarrow 10 times frac{360}{11}. The second hand does not overlap.   When n=3, x = 3 times frac{360}{11}.   720 times 3 times frac{360}{11} rightarrow 4 times frac{360}{11}. The second hand does not overlap.   ...   When n=11, x = 11 times frac{360}{11} = 360. 720 times 360 rightarrow 360. The second hand overlaps, which corresponds to 12 noon.   Repeating the process...   From the above, it's clear that in a day, the three hands of the clock completely overlap twice, at 12 noon and 12 midnight.

We have a bamboo that originally stands one zhang tall. In ancient Chinese measurements, one zhang is equivalent to 10 chi. The bamboo breaks, and the top part touches the ground, creating a right-angled triangle with the ground and the remaining part of the bamboo. The height from the ground to the point where the bamboo broke is x chi. The distance from the base of the bamboo to where the top touches the ground is 3 chi. The length of the bamboo from the ground to the break point plus the length from the break point to the top (which now touches the ground) still equals the original length of the bamboo, which is 10 chi. To find the correct equation that represents this situation, we apply the Pythagorean theorem to the right-angled triangle formed. The sides of the triangle are x (the height from the ground to the break point), 3 (the horizontal distance from the base to where the top touches the ground), and (10-x) (the length of the top part of the bamboo that has fallen, acting as the hypotenuse in this scenario). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Therefore, we have: [x^{2} + 3^{2} = (10-x)^{2}] This equation correctly represents the relationship between the lengths of the sides of the triangle formed by the broken bamboo.

If the resulting polynomial has no real roots, (A) wins; otherwise, (B) wins.

Of these coefficients, (n) correspond to odd powers of (x) (odd degree terms) and (n-1) correspond to even powers of (x) (even degree terms). 3. **Strategy analysis - Player (B):**    Player (B) (who moves second) can employ a strategy to fill all terms associated with even degrees initially with the goal of creating a specific condition for the last odd term filled.    So, during the game:    - After (A) and (B) have alternated for a while, (A) and (B) will have filled (2n-4) coefficients.    - This leaves at most one even degree coefficient unfilled. 4. **Final stages of the game - ensuring a real root:**    Suppose the game reaches a stage where the polynomial takes a form like:    [    P(x) = Q(x) + square x^s + square x^t    ]    Here, (Q(x)) has its coefficients already filled, and (s neq t), with at least one of (s) or (t) being odd.

A word is called \\"good\\" if it is impossible to erase all but four of its letters, resulting in a sequence of the form ( aabb ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are distinct letters. We need to find the maximum possible length of such a \\"good\\" word. 1. **Length of the word**:    Define the length of a word as the number of letters in it. Let ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) be the letters of the alphabet. It is straightforward to verify that the word    [    a_n a_{n-1} ldots a_2 a_1 a_2 a_1 a_2 a_3 ldots a_n    ]    is good. This word has ( 2n+1 ) letters. 2. **Proof by contradiction**:    To show that no good word can be longer than ( 2n+1 ):    - Assume there exists a good word of length ( 2n+2 ).      Then some letter, say ( a_1 ), appears at least three times in this word. Let ( V ) and ( P ) be the second and the last occurrences of ( a_1 ), respectively. 3. **Occurrence constraints**:    - Any other letter appears at most once before ( P ) and at most once after ( V ). Otherwise, it is possible by erasing letters to form the forbidden sequence ( aabb ).    - Hence, each letter ( a_2, ldots, a_n ) appears at most twice. Moreover, if a letter appears twice, one occurrence must be before ( V ) and the other after ( P ). 4. **Counting letters**:    - Let ( a_1 ) appear ( k geq 3 ) times. Then there are at least ( k-3 ) letters different from ( a_1 ) between ( V ) and ( P ).    - All such letters occur exactly once between ( V ) and ( P ). 5. **Calculation**:    - The total length of the word would be:      [      k + (k-3) cdot 1 + (n-k+2) cdot 2 = k + (k-3) + 2(n-k+2) = 2n+1      ]      This contradicts our assumption of the existence of a good word of length ( 2n+2 ).

Since 345 is the product of H and k, and we know that the LCM is also a multiple of H, 14, and 15, we can look for a common factor of 345 that is also a factor of the LCM. The prime factorization of 345 is: 345 = 3 * 5 * 23 The prime factorization of 14 is: 14 = 2 * 7 The prime factorization of 15 is: 15 = 3 * 5 Since the LCM is a product of H, 14, and 15, and we know that 345 (which is A) is a multiple of H, we can deduce that H must be a common factor of 345 and the product of 14 and 15.

Therefore, the lack of this specification makes proposition (1) technically incorrect. 2. **Proposition 2: \\"A diameter perpendicular to a chord bisects the chord\\"**. This statement is accurate in geometry. When a diameter of a circle is perpendicular to a chord, it bisects the chord, meaning it divides the chord into two equal parts.

Goal: Prove that any other segment on the line ( l ) is also three times as long as its shadow. 2. **Theoretical Background:**        According to the Thales' Theorem, if a set of parallel lines intersect two transversals, then they divide the transversals proportionally. To apply this theorem to our problem, consider segments and their shadows as two transversals intersected by the shadow-forming process (like sunlight or an artificial light). 3. **Initial Assertion:**        Let a segment be ( AB ) which has length ( 3x ) and its shadow ( A'B' ) which has length ( x ). We know ( AB = 3 cdot A'B' ). 4. **Extending the Segment:**        Suppose we take another segment on the same line ( l ), say ( CD ), such that its length is ( y ). We plan to prove that ( CD ) will be three times the length of its shadow ( C'D' ). 5. **Application of Thales' Theorem:**        - According to Thales' Theorem, if we consider the segments ( AB ) and ( CD ) along with their shadows, then if the lengths of ( AB ) and its shadow ( A'B' ) maintain a proportion (frac{AB}{A'B'} = 3), the same proportion must hold for any other segment ( CD ).    - This means, (frac{CD}{C'D'}) must equal (frac{AB}{A'B'}). 6. **Proportional Relationships:**        Thus, we have:    [    frac{AB}{A'B'} = 3 implies frac{3x}{x} = 3    ]    Similarly,    [    frac{CD}{C'D'} = 3    ] 7. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, any segment ( CD ) on line ( l ) will be three times as long as its shadow ( C'D' ), proving the assertion.

Since the ratio of canoes to kayaks is 3:2, we can express the number of canoes rented as ( frac{3}{2}x ). But we also know that the number of canoes is ( x + 4 ), so we can set up the following equation: [ frac{3}{2}x = x + 4 ] To solve for ( x ), we multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: [ 3x = 2(x + 4) ] [ 3x = 2x + 8 ] Subtract ( 2x ) from both sides: [ x = 8 ] So, 8 kayaks were rented out. Since there were 4 more canoes than kayaks rented out, there were ( 8 + 4 = 12 ) canoes rented out. Now, we know the total revenue for the day was 288, and we know the cost of canoe rental is 14 per day. So the revenue from canoe rentals is ( 12 times 14 ). Let's calculate that: [ 12 times 14 = 168 ] So, the revenue from canoe rentals is 168. Since the total revenue is 288, the revenue from kayak rentals must be ( 288 - 168 ). Let's calculate that: [ 288 - 168 = 120 ] So, the revenue from kayak rentals is 120.

The overall class average is 94 points, and the total number of students in the class is B + G. The total points scored by the class would be the sum of the points scored by the boys and the girls, which is 90B + 96G. The overall average is calculated by dividing the total points by the total number of students, so we have: 94 = (90B + 96G) / (B + G) Now, we can multiply both sides by (B + G) to get rid of the denominator: 94(B + G) = 90B + 96G Expanding both sides gives us: 94B + 94G = 90B + 96G Now, let's group like terms: 94B - 90B = 96G - 94G 4B = 2G Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: 2B = G So the ratio of boys to girls is B:G = boxed{1:2} .

Who has more ways to do this?","output":"1. Convert the problem of moving a token on a strip of 101 cells into an equivalent problem on a ring by connecting the beginning to the end. This transformation does not change the nature of the moves because moving a specific number of steps forward or backward produces the same effect. 2. Define the movements allowed:     - Forward only by an even number of cells (2, 4, 6, etc.)     - Backward only by an odd number of cells (1, 3, 5, etc.) 3. Transform the idea of moving the token clockwise (forward) and counter-clockwise (backward) on the ring.     - Moving backward by an odd number of cells is equivalent to moving forward by the complement to 101 cells.     - For example, moving backward by 1 cell is equivalent to moving forward by ( 101 - 1 = 100 ) cells.     - Moving backward by 3 cells is equivalent to moving forward by ( 101 - 3 = 98 ) cells.     - This equivalence holds for all backward movements. 4. Hence, performing a backward move of any (k) odd cells corresponds to a forward move (101 - k) cells on the ring, and since (101 - k) will be even if (k) is odd, the moves remain consistent with the allowed rules. 5. Under this equivalence, whether Vasya starts from the 1st cell or Petya starts from the 50th cell becomes irrelevant, as they both have equivalent sets of moves available to traverse all 101 cells of the board. 6. Given the symmetry and equivalence of their starting positions when thought of in the ring's context, both Vasya and Petya have the same number of ways to cover all cells. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Both have the same number of ways}} ]"},{"instruction":"John can read some books a day.

A: 1 B: 2 C: 0 D: 3","output":"To find the value of k for which x_0 in [k, k+1), where x_0 is the zero point of the function f(x)=ln x-frac{1}{x}, we analyze the function behavior step by step. 1. First, we note that f(x) is defined for x > 0 because of the ln x term. 2. The function y = ln x is monotonically increasing for x > 0, meaning as x increases, ln x also increases. 3. Similarly, y = -frac{1}{x} is also monotonically increasing for x > 0. This may seem counterintuitive, but as x increases, -frac{1}{x} decreases (because the negative sign makes larger values of x lead to smaller negative values), which means it moves towards 0 from the negative side. 4. Combining both, since f(x) = ln x - frac{1}{x} comprises both ln x and -frac{1}{x} which are monotonically increasing, f(x) itself is monotonically increasing on (0, +infty). Now, to find where the function crosses the x-axis (i.e., f(x) = 0), we evaluate f(x) at specific points: - At x=1: f(1) = ln 1 - frac{1}{1} = 0 - 1 = -1. Thus, f(1) < 0. - At x=2: f(2) = ln 2 - frac{1}{2}. Since ln 2 > 0 and ln 2 > ln sqrt{e} = frac{1}{2} ln e = frac{1}{2}, we have ln 2 - frac{1}{2} > 0 - frac{1}{2} = -frac{1}{2}. So, f(2) > 0. Given that f(x) is monotonically increasing and f(1) < 0 while f(2) > 0, the zero point x_0 must lie in the interval (1, 2).

The x-coordinate indicates the position along the x-axis, and the y-coordinate indicates the position along the y-axis. For the point P(0, -4), we observe the following: - The x-coordinate is 0. This means that the point is located exactly on the y-axis because it is not displaced to the left or right of the origin. - The y-coordinate is -4. This indicates the point is 4 units below the origin along the y-axis. Given these observations, we can determine where the point P(0, -4) lies in the Cartesian coordinate system: - It is not on the x-axis because for a point to be on the x-axis, its y-coordinate must be 0. - It is on the y-axis because its x-coordinate is 0. - It is not at the origin because for a point to be at the origin, both its x and y coordinates must be 0. - It is not on a line parallel to the x-axis because such a line would have a constant y-value but would not necessarily intersect the y-axis at x=0 unless it is the x-axis itself.

Step 1: Explain the context and necessary theorem In the given problem, points (B) and (C) are points of tangency of the incircle or an excircle of triangle (ABC) to the sides (AC) and (AB), respectively. The tangents to the circumcircle of (ABC) at (B) and (C) intersect at point (P). We need to prove that line (AP) contains the symmedian (AS). We will use the result from problem 3.30, which states: **Theorem (Problem 3.30):** The point of intersection of the tangents to the circumcircle of a triangle at two vertices lies on the symmedian of the triangle through the third vertex. Understanding that this theorem directly applies, we move forward with our proof.  Step 2: Define symmedian The symmedian of a triangle is a line passing through one vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side. It is the isogonal conjugate of the median. For triangle (ABC), the symmedian through vertex (A) (denoted as (AS)) reflects the corresponding sides at (A). By problem 3.30, we know: 1. The tangents to the circumcircle of a triangle at vertices (B) and (C) intersect at point (P). 2. This point of intersection lies on the symmedian from vertex (A).  Step 3: Apply the theorem to the given problem Given that P is the intersection of the tangents to the circumcircle at (B) and (C), by the theorem mentioned, line (AP) must contain the symmedian (AS) of triangle (ABC). This completes the proof that line (AP) lies along the symmedian (AS) of triangle (ABC).

Therefore, the first person must be an A.    - The last person (at the end of the line) says: \\"There are more B people behind me than A people in front of me.\\"      Since there are no people behind the last person, the statement is false if the person is a B (because a B would lie).      Therefore, the last person must be a B. 3. **Iterative Trimming Argument**:    - Remove the first person (known A) and the last person (known B).    - Now, we have 2012 people left, and the statement still holds for them because we've just removed one A from the front and one B from the back. 4. **Repeat the Process**:    - Repeat the process of removing the first and last person:      - The new first person in the line is also an A, and the new last person in the line is also a B after each iteration.    - Each iteration removes one A and one B, decreasing the total number of people by 2 each time. 5. **Final Condition**:    - After (frac{2014}{2} ) iterations, there will be no more people to remove.    - Thus, we will have removed (1007) A's from the front and (1007) B's from the back.

Step 2: **Case 1 - Line passes through the origin:** In this scenario, the equation of the line could be of the form y=mx, where m is the slope. Because it passes through A(1,4), we can determine the slope as m = frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = frac{4-0}{1-0} = 4. Thus, the equation becomes y=4x, which can be rearranged to 4x-y=0. Step 3: **Case 2 - Line does not pass through the origin:** Let the intercepts be x=a and y=-a (since their sum is zero, one intercept should be the negative of the other). The general equation of such a line is frac{x}{a}+frac{y}{-a}=1. Given that the line passes through point A(1,4), substituting these values gives frac{1}{a}+frac{4}{-a}=1. Simplifying, we get -3/a=1, leading to a=-3. Substituting a into the general equation, we get x-y+3=0. # Solution 2: Step 1: Analyze the slope of the line. The slope must not be 0 or undefined, implying the line cannot be perfectly horizontal or vertical. Step 2: Let the equation of the line be y-4=k(x-1), where k is the slope.  Step 3: Calculate the intercepts. When x=0, we have y=4-k. When y=0, we have x=1-frac{4}{k}. Step 4: Given the condition that the sum of intercepts equals zero, we have 1-frac{4}{k}+4-k=0. Simplifying, we get 5-frac{4}{k}-k=0. Multiplying through by k, we have 5k-4-k^2=0, rearranging gives k^2-5k+4=0. Step 5: Solve the quadratic equation for k. Factoring, we find (k-4)(k-1)=0, which gives k=4 or k=1.  Step 6: For k=4, the equation of the line is y-4=4(x-1) implies y=4x, which can be rearranged to 4x-y=0. For k=1, the equation is y-4=(x-1) implies x-y+3=0. # Conclusion: Both solutions lead to the same pair of possible equations for the line: 4x-y=0 or x-y+3=0, which corresponds to answer boxed{D}."},{"instruction":"the polar coordinate system, the equation of circle C is rho = 2acostheta.

The equation of circle C in polar coordinates is rho = 2acostheta.

Using the distance from a point to a line formula, we have: [ frac{|4a - 2|}{sqrt{4^2 + (-3)^2}} = |a|. ] Solving the above equation, we work out the absolute value and square both sides to eliminate the square root: [ frac{(4a - 2)^2}{4^2 + 3^2} = a^2. ] Expanding and simplifying, we obtain: [ frac{16a^2 - 16a + 4}{25} = a^2. ] Multiplying through by 25 to clear the denominator: [ 16a^2 - 16a + 4 = 25a^2. ] Rearranging terms and solving for a yields: [ 9a^2 - 16a + 4 = 0. ] Factoring this quadratic equation, we find: [ a(a - frac{2}{9}) = 0. ] Thus the real values of a for which line l is tangent to circle C are a = 0 and a = frac{2}{9}.

The key knowledge points include the formula for the distance from a point to a line, basic inequalities, and the solution methods for quadratic inequalities. When a line is tangent to a circle, the distance from the circle's center to the line equals the circle's radius. Mastering this property is crucial to solving this problem. From the given information, we know the center of the circle is at (1,1) and its radius is r=1. Since the line (m+1)x + (n+1)y - 2 = 0 is tangent to the circle, the distance d from the circle's center to the line is 1: d = frac{|m + n|}{sqrt{(m+1)^2 + (n+1)^2}} = 1.

The slope of line AB is calculated as follows: [k_{AB} = frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = frac{2 - 4}{3 - 1} = frac{-2}{2} = -1] Since line l is parallel to AB and passes through point C(2,-1), the equation of line l can be derived from the slope-point form of a line equation, which is y - y_1 = m(x - x_1). However, knowing that the slope is -1, we can directly infer that the line has a slope-intercept form of y = -x + b. To find b, we use the fact that line l is parallel to AB and thus has the same slope but different intercept. Since it passes through C, we adjust the equation to match the format of the given options, leading to the equation x + y - 1 = 0. **Scenario 2: Points A and B are on different sides of line l.** In this case, line l must pass through the midpoint of segment AB, denoted as M. We find M by averaging the coordinates of A and B: [M = left(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}right) = left(frac{1 + 3}{2}, frac{4 + 2}{2}right) = (2, 3)] Given that l passes through both C and M, and considering the coordinates of C(2, -1) and M(2, 3), we observe that the x-coordinates of both points are the same. This indicates that line l is vertical and can be represented by the equation x = 2, or equivalently, x - 2 = 0. **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, the equation of line l could either be parallel to AB resulting in x + y - 1 = 0, or it could pass through the midpoint of AB resulting in x - 2 = 0.

We'll use the monotonicity of g(x) to find where g(x) > g(0), which will help us solve the inequality. 1. Define g(x) = frac{f(x)}{cos x}. Then, g'(x) = frac{f'''(x) + f(x)tan x}{cos x}. 2.

Then, Oleg writes the sum of the number to the left of the row and the number above the column in each cell of the grid (creating an addition table).

There are 100 real numbers in total, 50 of which are rational and 50 of which are irrational. The numbers in each cell of the grid are the sum of the number to the left of that row and the number above that column. The task is to determine the maximum number of rational numbers that can appear in the grid. 1. We denote (x) as the number of rational numbers written to the left of the rows. Consequently, (50 - x) will be the number of irrational numbers written to the left of the rows. 2. Similarly, the number of rational numbers written above the columns is (x), and the number of irrational numbers written above the columns is (50 - x). 3. For a cell in the grid, the sum of the numbers from the row and column can either be rational or irrational. This depends on whether both contributing numbers are rational or both are irrational. Specifically:    - The sum of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational.    - The sum of a rational number and another rational number is rational.    - The sum of an irrational number and another irrational number can be rational or irrational but we will consider they are irrational as a necessary simplification for this context. 4. Therefore, we can compute the number of irrational sums by considering:    - (x^2) as the number of sums where both addends are rational.    - ((50 - x)^2) as the number of sums where both addends are irrational. 5. The total number of irrational sums ((N_i)) in the grid is given by:    [    N_i = x^2 + (50 - x)^2    ] 6. Simplify the expression for (N_i):    [    N_i = x^2 + (50 - x)^2 = x^2 + 2500 - 100x + x^2 = 2x^2 - 100x + 2500    ] 7. We need the minimum number of irrational numbers because the complement will give us the maximum number of rational numbers. Since (2x^2 - 100x + 2500) is a quadratic equation, we find its minimum value by completing the square or by using the vertex form. The minimum value occurs at:    [    x = frac{-b}{2a} = frac{100}{2 times 2} = 25    ]    Substitute (x = 25):    [    N_i = 2 times 25^2 - 100 times 25 + 2500 = 2 times 625 - 2500 + 2500 = 1250    ] 8. Therefore, the minimum number of irrational numbers in the grid is 1250, which implies the maximum number of rational numbers is:    [    50^2 - 1250 = 2500 - 1250 = 1250    ] 9. To confirm that this is possible, consider filling the left and upper labels of the grid as follows:    - For the left side: (1, 2, ldots, 25, 1 + sqrt{2}, 2 + sqrt{2}, ldots, 25 + sqrt{2})    - For the top side: (-1, -2, ldots, -25, 1 - sqrt{2}, 2 - sqrt{2}, ldots, 25 - sqrt{2})    Each rational row label combined with each rational column label forms a rational number.

First, let's convert the flow rate from kilometers per hour (kmph) to meters per minute (m/min). There are 1000 meters in a kilometer and 60 minutes in an hour, so: Flow rate = 4 kmph * (1000 m/km) / (60 min/h) = 4000 m/60 min = 66.67 m/min Now, we know the amount of water that runs into the sea per minute is 6000 cubic meters. This volume is the product of the cross-sectional area of the river (width * depth) and the distance the water travels per minute (flow rate). Volume per minute = Width * Depth * Flow rate We can rearrange this formula to solve for the depth: Depth = Volume per minute / (Width * Flow rate) Plugging in the values we have: Depth = 6000 m³/min / (45 m * 66.67 m/min) = 6000 m³/min / 3000.15 m²/min Depth ≈ 2 m Therefore, the depth of the river is approximately boxed{2}  meters."},{"instruction":"Find the curve defined by the equation [ r = 3costheta. ] (A) Line (B) Circle (C) Parabola (D) Ellipse (E) Hyperbola Enter the letter of the correct option.","output":"The equation ( r = 3costheta ) is a polar equation.

This relationship is quadratic, meaning that the area increases with the square of the side length, not in a direct linear manner. Therefore, this does not represent a direct proportion. **Option B**: For a triangle with a constant area of 20, the relationship between the height h on one side and the length a of that side can be represented by the formula h = frac{40}{a}. This formula shows an inverse proportion, where increasing the side length a decreases the height h, and vice versa. This is not a direct proportion. **Option C**: The perimeter C of a square in relation to the length of its side x is given by C = 4x. This formula indicates that the perimeter is directly proportional to the side length; as the side length increases, the perimeter increases linearly at a constant rate. This is a direct proportion. **Option D**: Considering a water tank that releases water at a rate of 0.5L/min, the remaining water volume V in the tank as it changes with the time t of water release can be represented by V = x - 0.5t, assuming the tank initially contains x liters of water. This formula indicates that the volume decreases linearly over time, but it represents a decrease rather than a direct proportion in the context of increasing one variable leading to a proportional increase in another.

Establishing the Reasoning: 1. **Basic Facts**:    - A's action: Poisoned C's water.    - B's action: Made a hole in C's water bag causing water to leak out.    - C died of thirst and not from poison. 2. **Argument 1** (In support of B being the murderer):    - If it weren't for B, C would have died from the poison anyways.    - Thus, B's action of making the hole directly resulted in C's death by thirst. 3. **Argument 2** (In support of A being the murderer):    - Even though B made the hole, C would have died anyway because the water was poisoned by A. 4. **Legal and Moral Perspectives**:    - From a moral standpoint, both A and B are guilty of planning murder.    - Legally, establishing the cause of death requires looking at causality: C died of thirst, so it directly correlates to B's action. 5. **Considering Intentions**:    - A intended to kill C by poison.    - B intended to kill C by depriving him of water. 6. **Scientific Approach to Causality**:    - C's death from thirst was due to the lack of water, which was directly caused by B.    - Poison played no part in C's death because he never drank it.  Conclusion: While the moral guilt is shared by both A and B, from a strict causality perspective, B's action of making the hole in the water bag directly led to C's death from thirst.

Let u represent the number of golden cells within such a 2 times 2 square. 2. **Counting in 3×3 Squares**:     Each 3 times 3 square must contain exactly A golden cells. Now, note that within this configuration, every 3 times 3 square is composed of overlapping 2 times 2 squares. 3. **Counting in 2×4 and 4×2 Rectangles**:     Similarly, every 2 times 4 or 4 times 2 rectangle must contain exactly Z golden cells. 4. **Relation Between Adjacent 2×2 Squares**:     Considering adjacent 2 times 2 squares, if one has u golden cells, then the adjacent one must have v = Z - u golden cells because the shared side of 2 times 4 or 4 times 2 rectangles essentially integrates these squares' values.     Therefore, our board consists of alternating neighbors (u, v) in a checkerboard pattern. 5. **Analysis with Larger Square Segments**:     Consider a larger 6 times 6 section of the board, which can be divided into nine 2 times 2 squares. If we represent u cells in one 2 times 2, then, due to checkerboard property, adjacent 2 times 2 squares will have v = Z - u and vice versa. 6. **Counting Golden Cells in a 6×6 Square**:     The 6 times 6 square is composed of four overlapping 3 times 3 squares, thus totally containing 4A golden cells. By counting:     - If the 6 times 6 square is filled such that alternating squares have u and v, then the total number of golden cells is given by (4u + 5v) or (5u + 4v) because each pattern arrangement has to sum to a multiple sequence.     - Hence, equating both gives 4u + 5(Z - u) = 5u + 4(Z - u), which simplifies to (u = v). 7. **Conclusion from Uniformity**:     Since (u = v), it follows (u = v = frac{Z}{2}), matching constraints for perfect blending. 8. **Solving (u) and (A)**:     We have 9u = 4A. Now evaluating multiple values:          - u = 0 implies a barren, all-silver scenario, leading to A = 0, Z = 0.     - u = 4 implies golden filling, where 4u = 9 Rightarrow 36=4A Rightarrow A= frac{36}{4} = 9, Z = 8. 9. **Conclusion**:     The possible solutions for A and Z in the context of filling patterns proposed are:     [     boxed{A = 0, Z = 0} quad text{or} quad boxed{A = 9, Z = 8}     ]"},{"instruction":"Given the lengths of the sides of a regular hexagon as follows: 5 inches, 8 centimeters, 6 inches, 10 centimeters, 7 inches, and 12 centimeters.

Since f(x) is a monotonic function defined on (0,+infty), f(x)-log_{2}x is a constant value. Let t=f(x)-log_{2}x, then f(x)=log_{2}x+t. Since f(t)=3, we have log_{2}t+t=3. Solving for t, we get t=2. Therefore, f(x)=log_{2}x+2 and f'(x)=frac{1}{xln2}. Substituting these expressions into the equation f(x)-f'(x)=2, we have log_{2}x+2-frac{1}{xln2}=2. This simplifies to log_{2}x-frac{1}{xln2}=0. Let h(x)=log_{2}x-frac{1}{xln2}. We can easily verify that h(1)=frac{1}{ln2}<0 and h(2)=1-frac{1}{2ln2}>0. Therefore, the zero of h(x)=log_{2}x-frac{1}{xln2} lies in the interval (1,2).

Our goal is to prove that angle CNL = 90^circ.  3. Observe that since AM bisects angle LAN, it follows that triangle ABK is isosceles, with AK = BK. Moreover, the given condition AL = CK implies that ABK is symmetric with respect to the perpendicular bisector of AK. 4. Designate point X on BK such that LX parallel AK. By symmetry of triangle ABK, we have KX = AL. Hence, KX = CK and MK parallel LX.  5. Now, because MK parallel LX, MK is the midline in triangle CLX. Therefore, we have CM = LM.  6. The resulting conclusion is that CM = LM = MN, indicating that triangle CML is an isosceles triangle. Also, since M lies on both the angle bisector AD and the segment AK, and given that M lies on the perpendicular bisector of CX, the segment CM must be perpendicular to LN. 7.

The corresponding recurrence relation is:    [    b_{m+1} = 4b_m - 2b_{m-1}, quad m geq 2.    ] 4. **Characteristic equation:**    The common recurrence relation for both a_m and b_m is:    [    lambda^2 - 4lambda + 2 = 0.    ]    Solving this quadratic equation:    [    lambda = frac{4 pm sqrt{16 - 8}}{2} = 2 pm sqrt{2}.    ]    Thus, the solutions are lambda_1 = 2 + sqrt{2} and lambda_2 = 2 - sqrt{2}. 5. **General solution for a_m and b_m:**    The general solution to the recurrence relation is:    [    a_m = alpha_1 (2 + sqrt{2})^m + beta_1 (2 - sqrt{2})^m,    ]    [    b_m = alpha_2 (2 + sqrt{2})^m + beta_2 (2 - sqrt{2})^m.    ] 6. **Finding the coefficients alpha and beta:**    Using the initial conditions x_1 = 2, x_2 = 3, x_3 = 5 and x_4 = 11:    [    a_1 = x_1 = 2, quad a_2 = x_3 = x_2 + x_1 = 5,    ]    [    b_1 = x_2 = 3, quad b_2 = x_4 = x_3 + 2x_2 = 11.    ] 7. **Solving for alpha_1 and beta_1:**    [    begin{cases}    alpha_1 (2+sqrt{2}) + beta_1 (2-sqrt{2}) = 2,    alpha_1 (2+sqrt{2})^2 + beta_1 (2-sqrt{2})^2 = 5.    end{cases}    ]        Solve the system to get:    [    alpha_1 = frac{1}{4}(3-sqrt{2}), quad beta_1 = frac{1}{4}(3+sqrt{2}).    ] 8. **Solving for alpha_2 and beta_2:**    [    begin{cases}    alpha_2 (2+sqrt{2}) + beta_2 (2-sqrt{2}) = 3,    alpha_2 (2+sqrt{2})^2 + beta_2 (2-sqrt{2})^2 = 11.    end{cases}    ]        Solve the system to get:    [    alpha_2 = frac{1}{4}(1+2 sqrt{2}), quad beta_2 = frac{1}{4}(1-2 sqrt{2}).    ] 9. **General term for n:**    [    begin{cases}    x_n = frac{1}{4}(3-sqrt{2})(2+sqrt{2})^{m} + frac{1}{4}(3+sqrt{2})(2-sqrt{2})^{m}, quad &n=2m-1,     x_n = frac{1}{4}(1+2sqrt{2})(2+sqrt{2})^{m} + frac{1}{4}(1-2sqrt{2})(2-sqrt{2})^{m}, quad &n=2m.    end{cases}    ] Therefore, the general term formulas for the sequence {x_n} are: [ boxed{left{ begin{aligned} &x_n = frac{1}{4}(3 - sqrt{2})(2 + sqrt{2})^{m} + frac{1}{4}(3 + sqrt{2})(2 - sqrt{2})^{m}, quad n = 2m-1,  &x_n = frac{1}{4}(1 + 2 sqrt{2})(2 + sqrt{2})^{m} + frac{1}{4}(1 - 2 sqrt{2})(2 - sqrt{2})^{m}, quad n = 2m. end{aligned}right.} ]"},{"instruction":"Given that the roots of the equation x^2x1=0 are also roots of the equation x^6px^2+q=0, find the values of p and q.","output":"Let the two roots of the equation x^2-x-1=0 be x_1 and x_2.

Since x_1 neq x_2, x_1^2-x_2^2 neq 0, simplifying gives: [(x_1^2)^2+(x_2^2)^2+x_1^2x_2^2]-p=0, Thus, p=(x_1^2)^2+(x_2^2)^2+(x_1x_2)^2=7+(-1)^2=8.
