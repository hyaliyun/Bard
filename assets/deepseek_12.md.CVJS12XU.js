Q:Instagram is containing so many photos of food--now a pop-up diner in London is taking advantage of this new trend by letting people settle the bill for their meals simply by uploading photos of their dishes to social networks. I always thought people's taking pictures of their food was kind of silly, but at this new  pop-up restaurant in the UK, I'd probably do it too. 'The Picture House' is the world's first pay-by-photo restaurant--you order, click a photo of the food, share on Instagram and eat for free! The restaurant belongs to frozen food giant   Birds Eye, who came up with the idea to cash in on people's addiction with photographing food and sharing the pictures online. They conducted a survey and found out that more than half of the British population regularly took pictures of their meals. So they realized it was a better way to advertise their new dining range. The pop-up diner was open in Soho, London for three days in May, and is now moving to other major UK cities. They serve two-course meals that customers don't have to pay for, if they photo and Instagram it. The restaurant is a part of Birds Eye's 'Food for Life' campaign, a new marketing project that aims at changing the way people look at frozen food. \\"Taking photos of food enables people to show off and to share their mealtime moments--from the everyday to the special,\\" said marketing director Margaret Jobling. The reaction to The Picture House has been great so far. And the pay-by-picture concept has proven to be an effective way.

A composer may also respond to a text by expanding a choral symphony beyond the normal bounds of the symphonic genre. This is evident in the unusual orchestration and stage directions Berlioz prepared for his Roméo et Juliette. This piece is actually in seven movements, and calls for an intermission after the fourth movement – the \\"Queen Mab Scherzo\\" – to remove the harps from the stage and bring on the chorus of Capulets for the funeral march that follows. Berlioz biographer D. Kern Holoman observed that, \\"as Berlioz saw it, the work is simply Beethovenian in design, with the narrative elements overlain. Its core approaches a five-movement symphony with the choral finale and, as in the [Symphonie] Fantastique, both a scherzo and a march.... The 'extra' movements are thus the introduction with its potpourri of subsections and the descriptive tomb scene [at the end of the work].\\"Mahler expanded the Beethovenian model for programmatic as well as symphonic reasons in his Second Symphony, the \\"Resurrection\\", the vocal fourth movement, \\"Urlicht\\", bridging the childlike faith of the third movement with the ideological tension Mahler seeks to resolve in the finale. He then abandoned this pattern for his Third Symphony, as two movements for voices and orchestra follow three purely instrumental ones before the finale returns to instruments alone. Like Mahler, Havergal Brian expanded the Beethovenian model, but on a much larger scale and with far larger orchestral and choral forces, in his Symphony No. 1 \\"The Gothic\\". Written between 1919 and 1927, the symphony was inspired by Goethe's Faust and Gothic cathedral architecture. The Brian First is in two parts.

He cocked his head. “What do you mean?” I had no idea—on a conscious level—what I was asking for, just that I felt in a desperate sense that the self I knew was slipping away. An inability to recognize myself either in my writing or in reflecting upon my own actions was taking over. And then…? I didn't care. I wanted to kiss girls. Which is fine—just not something I ordinarily do. I wanted to drink, smoke. Again, fine—but not something I ordinarily do. “Do I seem…okay?” I asked a colleague at work. A woman I barely knew. Insanely, I thought that since she worked with disabled students, many of whom struggled with mental illness, she would know mania when she saw it. This was a rather foolish assumption—especially since she's an educator, not a psychiatrist, especially with how skilled I am at wearing the mask of calm, the face of sanity. “You seem great, Julie. Cheery. Professional as always.” I let her reassurance placate me. Wanted to be placated. Yet, within months I lost my job. And not only that, but a chance at a scholarship, two really important long term friendships—relationships I'd enjoyed since high school. I was hospitalized three times between September and February. I lost my ability to trust myself, lost my mind. It is now a little over two years since I first felt that sliding. Twenty-six months since I knew that somewhere in the deepest parts of who I am, I was slipping. Nine seasons since I begged Dr. Poe, “Remember me to myself!” I'm still recuperating. Yes. I have felt like I wasn't me. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What kind of help did Julie get after the situations in her story?

Movie title: Wrath of the Titans Context: Ten years after he defeated the Kraken, Perseus (Sam Worthington), the demigod son of Zeus (Liam Neeson), now lives as a fisherman with his 10-year-old son, Heleus (John Bell). One night, Perseus is visited by Zeus, who tells him that the powers of the gods are fading and the walls of the underworld prison of Tartarus are breaking due to the lack of devotion from humans and states they will need the world's armies to combat the potential threat, but Perseus shows little interest and refuses to get involved. Afterwards, Zeus travels to Tartarus to meet with his brothers Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Poseidon (Danny Huston), and his son Ares (Edgar Ramirez). He tells Hades they must forget the past and unite to rebuild Tartarus, but Hades orders his minions to attack. They severely injure Poseidon, and Ares betrays Zeus over showing Perseus more affection, taking him prisoner and stealing his thunderbolt. Hades and Ares plan to drain Zeus' power to revive Kronos, the father of Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon, in exchange for the two to remain immortal. The walls of Tartarus break, unleashing monsters into the world.After slaying a Chimera that attacks his village, Perseus takes Heleus to the Mount of Idols, so they can speak to Zeus, but the dying Poseidon arrives instead. He informs Perseus that Hades and Ares are holding Zeus in Tartarus, and tells him to meet with his demigod son Agenor (Toby Kebbell) to find the fallen god Hephaestus, who knows the way into Tartarus. Poseidon then gives Perseus his trident before succumbing to his injuries and crumbling into dust. Perseus flies on Pegasus to the campsite of Queen Andromeda's army.

Choices:  - developed reaction  - Quick reaction  - toxic reaction  - chemical reaction  A: The answer is:","output":"Step 1: Identify the key concept in the question In this question, the key concept is \\"matter is always conserved.\\" This means that the total amount of matter remains constant in the reaction. Step 2: Analyze the given choices We are given four choices: developed reaction, quick reaction, toxic reaction, and chemical reaction. Let's analyze each choice: - Developed reaction: This term doesn't have a specific scientific meaning, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer. - Quick reaction: Although some reactions are fast, the speed of a reaction doesn't necessarily correlate to matter conservation. So, this is not the correct answer. - Toxic reaction: Toxicity refers to how harmful a substance is, not to how matter is conserved in a reaction. Hence, this is not the correct answer. - Chemical reaction: A chemical reaction occurs when substances combine or break down to form new substances, and the total mass of the reactants equals the total mass of the products. This choice aligns with the concept of matter conservation. Step 3: Choose the appropriate answer Based on our analysis, the correct answer is \\"chemical reaction\\" because it is the only choice where matter conservation is a fundamental principle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: It seems hard to watch someone yawn  and not to yawn ourselves. Even reading about yawning can make you do it. Now, a new study has found why yawning has such a powerful force. Yawning when others yawn, the study suggests, is a sign of pity and a form of social connection. Kids don't develop this deeply rooted behavior until around age four, the study found. Kids with autism   are less likely to catch yawns. In the most serious cases, they never do. Yawning might help doctors to see whether the children are developing rightly. The work could also lead to a better understanding of the ways that people communicate and connect. \\"Emotional infection seems to be a born thing that connects us together,\\" said Molly Helt, a graduate student in psychology at the University of Connecticut. \\"Yawning may be part of that.\\" Inspiration for her study came when she tried to get her own autistic son to clear his ears on an airplane. She repeatedly yawned at him, hoping he would yawn back. He never did. \\"The fact that autistic kids don't do it might mean they're really missing out on that emotional connection with people around them,\\" she said. \\"The biggest thing people try to figure out after birth is how we become humans and understand that humans have minds that are different from others',\\" she added. \\"Autistic people never seem to understand that.\\" Like infectious  laughter and crying, scientists have found that yawning is a shared experience that promotes social connection. Helt said it could fight stress after a period of being nervous and spread a feeling of calm through a group. Question: Which of the following is NOT true about yawning? Options: A: It is natural to yawn back if people around you yawn. B: Some kids are too young to yawn after others. C: Yawning can be used to test children's development.

The band was founded by Englishman Eamon McLoughlin and Australians Kym Warner and Carol Young. The musicians originally performed in local Austin bars, and soon found increasing acclaim. They have released one independent album, Movin' On, in 2003, and two albums, Weather and Water and Viridian, on the Dualtone record label. Their fourth album, Fascination, was released on Sugar Hill in 2009. Their fifth album, The Brick Album (2011), was self-produced with the direct support of their fans. Pre-production donors were recognized with their names inscribed on the \\"bricks\\" that make up the cover art. Their debut album, Movin' On, was the recipient of local Texas awards and charted on Americana radio stations. Country Music Television named their follow-up Weather and Water as one of the ten best bluegrass albums of 2005, and The Greencards were invited to tour with Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson in the same year. Viridian would go on to take the number one position on Billboard magazine's Bluegrass Music Chart, making the Greencards the first international band to do so.

USA TODAY      A gunman opened fire on a Republican congressional baseball team practicing on a suburban Virginia field wounding Louisiana congressman Steve Scalise and at least four others. (Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY)      A gunman opened fire on a Republican congressional baseball team practicing on a suburban Virginia field Wednesday, critically wounding Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise and shooting four other people as horrified legislators and staffers scrambled for cover amid a barrage of bullets.      Capitol Police, who provided security for the practice, engaged the shooter, identified by authorities as James Hodgkinson, 66, from Belleville, Ill. President Trump later said the suspect was killed in the ensuing shootout.      Congressional aide Zachary Barth, Tyson Foods lobbyist Matt Mika, and Capitol Police special agents Crystal Griner and David Bailey also were wounded in the rampage. The agents were hailed as heroes.      \\"Many lives would have been lost if not for the heroic actions of the two Capitol Police officers who took down the gunman despite sustaining gunshot wounds during a very, very brutal assault,\\" Trump said. \\"Melania and I are grateful for their heroism and praying for the swift recovery of all victims.\\"      Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., also praised the officers.      “Had they not been there it probably would have been a turkey shoot,” he said. “There were, I don’t know, 40, 50 congressmen and senators out there on an open field - very few places to hide.’’      Trump made a visit at 8:45 p.m. ET at Medstar Washington Hospital Center, where Scalise underwent surgery earlier Wednesday. The hospital said in a statement after the surgery that Scalise remained in critical condition and that the bullet that entered his hip \\"travelled across his pelvis, fracturing bones, injuring internal organs, and causing severe bleeding.\\" The statement said that Scalise will require additional operations.      Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., was standing on the third base line and was about to take batting practice when he heard a loud bang behind him. He turned and saw, past a dugout, a middle-aged man pushing a rifle through the chain-link fence, firing toward second base and the outfield.      “He was not saying anything,” Brooks said. “He was just blasting away with his gun, shooting rapidly.”      Bedlam erupted on the field. Brooks heard someone scream “active shooter.” Someone else yelled “take cover.” In the chaos, Brooks heard a yell from Scalise standing at second base.      Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, R-Tenn., said the baseball practice session was almost over when the rampage began on the field shortly after 7 a.m. “I heard a bang, and I thought it sounded like a gun. I never saw a shooter,\\" he said. \\"I got bloody running and jumping into the dugout.”      Read more:      Fleischmann said the practice was attended by House members, senators and their staff, among others. “A lot like me got bloody running for cover,” he said.      “It is just a madhouse here,” Fleischmann added. “It’s horrible. I’ve never experienced anything like that.”      St. Clair County, Ill., Sheriff Richard Watson said Hodgkinson is believed to have left his Illinois home four or five weeks ago and had been in the Alexandria area since then.      Deputies last encountered Hodgkinson at his Belleville, Ill., home on March 24, when a neighbor reported gunshots fired in the area, Watson said. Deputies found Hodgkinson with a hunting rifle on his property where he was apparently engaged in target practice, Watson said.      “The guy was very cordial,’’ the sheriff said. “He showed the deputy his firearms identification card. Even though he was on his own property, he told the deputy that he probably should take the rifle to a gun range, just to be safe.’’      On Wednesday morning, South Carolina Rep. Jeff Duncan said he was leaving practice early when the man he believes was the gunman asked him if the players were Democrats or Republicans.      \\"I told him they were Republicans, he said 'OK, thanks,' and turned around,\\" Duncan told reporters. \\"I got in the car and left.\\"      Minutes later he heard about the rampage.      Read more:      Tim Slater, an FBI special agent in charge of the investigation, said it was too early to say if the shooter was targeting Republicans. Hodgkinson, however, had a history of raging online against President Trump and other Republicans and once singled out Scalise.      \\"Here's a Republican that should lose his job, but they gave him a raise,'' Hodgkinson allegedly wrote in a 2015 post to his Facebook account. The message was accompanied by a cartoon depiction of Scalise.      In a March 22 Facebook post, Hodgkinson described Trump as a \\"traitor.''      \\"Trump Has Destroyed Our Democracy,'' he wrote. \\"It's Time to Destroy Trump & Co.\\"      Former Alexandria Mayor Bill Euille said Wednesday that he remembers meeting Hodgkinson more than a month ago at the YMCA, adjacent to the baseball field where the attack occurred.      Euille said that Hodgkinson referred to him as “Mr. Mayor’’ and that he would regularly see him at a table at the Y, drinking coffee and using his laptop. He said it didn't occur to him that the man was the shooter until he saw his photograph in media accounts.      Sen. Bernie Sanders issued a statement saying the suspect apparently had volunteered on his presidential campaign. Sanders said he was \\"sickened by this despicable act.\\"      \\"Let me be as clear as I can be. Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms,\\" Sanders said. \\"Real change can only come about through nonviolent action, and anything else runs against our most deeply held American values.\\"      Scalise, the third-ranking GOP whip in the House, was shot in the hip and listed in critical condition after surgery at MedStar Washington Hospital Center.      \\"Prior to entering surgery, the Whip was in good spirits and spoke to his wife by phone,\\" his office said in a statement. \\"He is grateful for the brave actions of U.S. Capitol Police, first responders, and colleagues.\\"      Rep. Roger Williams, R-Texas, said his staffer Barth was among the wounded and was in stable condition. U.S. Capitol Police Chief Matthew Verderosa said the wounded officers were in good condition. Mika was shot several times and was in critical condition, his family said in a statement.      The team of Republican congressman and staff members were practicing for a charity baseball game scheduled for Thursday against a Democratic team.      Pennsylvania Rep. Patrick Meehan said he had been joking and talking trash to Ohio Democrat Tim Ryan since striking him out on a curveball last year. \\"He just came up and gave me a hug,\\" Meehan said.      Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., said his team was practicing elsewhere when they heard about the attack. \\"We're safe & with police, everyone praying for GOP colleagues, staff & Cap police,\\" Huffman tweeted.      The shooting took place at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park, in the Del Ray section of Alexandria about seven miles from the Capitol. It's a quiet community made up of restaurants, small businesses and lots of families. Residents describe it as a safe neighborhood where people walk around outside until late at night. The field serves as a community hub, with games and activities at all hours.      The special agents were providing security at the practice and quickly returned fire when the shooting began, Verderosa said. Alexandria Chief Michael Brown said his officers arrived three minutes after the first emergency call came in at 7:09 a.m. ET, and also joined the gunfight.      Sen. Rand Paul said he was \\"shaken but unharmed\\" after the rampage.      \\"Many people likely would have died this morning if not for the bravery of the Capitol Police,\\" Paul said. \\"My thanks to them are inadequate but heartfelt. They never hesitated to put their lives on the line to save everyone.\\"      Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., told CNN people scattered when the shooting began. Scalise was standing in the infield and fell where he stood.      \\"He was not able to move under his own power. He was dragging his body from second base,\\" Brooks said. \\"There was not a whole lot we could do.\\"      \\"It's not easy when you see people around you being shot and you don't have a weapon yourself,\\" Brooks added. \\"You feel helpless.\\"      Contributing: Michael Collins, Deborah Berry, Susan Miller, Eliza Collins, Heidi Przybyla, Bryan Lyman of the Montgomery (Ala.)

Related Image Expand / Collapse      Scalise was in critical condition Wednesday afternoon, MedStar Washington Hospital tweeted. He had surgery after being shot in the hip and was initially said to be stable.      The shooter, who had a violent history including arrests for battery, resisting arrest and drunken driving, was identified as 66-year-old James T. Hodgkinson, of Illinois, Fox News confirmed. President Trump said Hodgkinson died from injuries sustained when he was shot by police.      \\"I have just been informed that the alleged shooter at the Republican baseball practice is someone who apparently volunteered on my presidential campaign,\\" Sanders said in a statement. \\"I am sickened by this despicable act. Let me be as clear as I can be. Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms.\\"      President Trump addressed the nation before noon and revealed Hodgkinson died in police custody.

Mika was shot multiple times and was in critical condition, his family said in a statement.      Special Agents David Bailey and Crystal Griner were both wounded in the incident. Griner was shot in the foot or leg and Bailey, who was not shot, sustained another, unspecified injury.      “Congressman Scalise is a friend and a very good friend,” Trump said in the White House address. “He’s a patriot and a fighter. He will recover from this assault. And, Steve, I want you to know that you have the prayers of not only an entire city behind you, but the entire nation – and frankly the entire world.”      Williams, who was injured after diving into the dugout, later told reporters on Capitol Hill about his experience.

Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., told Fox News he left just before the shooting. As he walked to his car, a man asked DeSantis if it was Republicans or Democrats practicing. About 3 minutes later, at around 7:09 a.m., the shooting began, DeSantis said. He later told Fox Business he believed the man who approached him was the shooter.

Rand Paul, R-Ky., described the chaotic scene to Fox News: \\"We were like sitting ducks.\\"      \\"Without the Capitol Hill police it would have been a massacre,\\" Paul said, calling the scene \\"sort of a killing field.\\"      Hodgkinson was shot by Capitol Police and Alexandria Police, apprehended and taken to the hospital, officials said. The incident occurred at Simpson Field in Alexandria, about 10 miles from Washington D.C. The FBI was taking over the investigation because a federal official -- Scalise -- was assaulted in the attack.      \\"An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us,\\" House Speaker Paul Ryan said in an address from the floor of the House of Representatives. His words were greeted by a bipartisan standing ovation from the gathered legislators.      Related Image Expand / Collapse      Ryan added: \\"We are all one family. These are our brothers and sisters who were in the line of fire.\\"      FBI Special Agent in Charge of the Washington Field Office Timothy Slater said it was too early to tell if the attack was terror-related.      Trump had spoken to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Ryan, Scalise's wife and chief of staff and the chief of the Capitol Hill Police.      The Department of Homeland Security was monitoring the episode.      Williams was seen being taken from the field on a stretcher, but he was reportedly injured while jumping into the dugout as the shots rang out.      \\"Finally, the shooter was shot behind home plate as he was circling around to the first base dugout where there were a number of US congressmen and other folks,\\" Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., told FMTALK1065. \\"Our security detail was able to incapacitate him at that point. I don't know if he [the shooter] was dead. He was wounded. I don't know how many times he was wounded.\\"      Brooks reportedly used a belt as a tourniquet to stop the bleeding of an aide who was shot in the leg.

Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, told Fox News he \\"felt like I was in Iraq, but without my weapon.\\"      \\"Behind third base, I see a rifle...I hear Steve Scalise over near 2nd base scream,\\" Brooks said. \\"...While all of this is going on, Steve Scalise our whip was lying on the ground near the second base position crawling into right field, leaving a trail of blood.\\"      Brooks said the gunman was using the dugout as cover and estimated the assailant got off 50-100 shots during the attack on the 15-25 people gathered at the field.      “We were there within 3 minutes,” Brown said. “Two of our officers engaged in gunfire and returned fire.”      Related Image Expand / Collapse      A man walking his dog at a park near the field told Fox News he heard police yelling at the gunman to put the gun down followed by someone in or around the dugout screaming back \\"Just shoot him.\\"      Aside from Scalise, Williams, Paul, Brooks, Wenstrup and DeSantis, Sen. Jeff Flake and Reps. Mike Bishop, Jack Bergman, Chuck Fleischmann and Joe Barton were also at the field. A photographer and Bishop's aides were present, too.      Alexandria schools were placed on lockdown as the incident unfolded. There was an uptick in the police presence around the Capitol, however, the building was still open. There was not expected to be any votes held on Wednesday in light of the shooting.      Witnesses and residents described a shattered calm Wednesday morning in a normally peaceful neighborhood now plastered with police tape.      Reba Winstead, who lives in the area, described hearing a “boom boom boom boom.\\" She said she was getting her daughter ready for school and then “all of a sudden there was gunfire in our neighborhood.”      Scalise, 51, is the House majority whip. He has represented Louisiana’s 1st Congressional District since 2008 and chairs the House Republican Study Committee. He is married with two children. Scalise's district includes New Orleans.      Since he's in leadership, Scalise has a security detail.      Scalise, who studied computer science at Louisiana State University, worked as a systems engineer before launching his political career. Scalise endorsed President Trump during last year’s presidential campaign, and has been a vocal backer of Trump’s travel ban. As leader of the powerful study group, he has also spearheaded the effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare.      The Congressional Baseball Game is scheduled for June 15 at Nationals Park.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Rhapsody in Blue is a 1924 musical composition by American composer George Gershwin for solo piano and jazz band, which combines elements of classical music with jazz-influenced effects. Commissioned by bandleader Paul Whiteman, the composition was orchestrated by Ferde Grofe several times, including the original 1924 scoring, \\"theater orchestra\\" setting published in 1926, and the symphony orchestra scoring published in 1942, though completed earlier. The piece received its premiere in the concert, An Experiment in Modern Music, which was held on February 12, 1924, in Aeolian Hall, New York, by Whiteman and his band with Gershwin playing the piano. The editors of the Cambridge Music Handbooks opined that \\"The Rhapsody in Blue (1924) established Gershwin's reputation as a serious composer and has since become one of the most popular of all American concert works.\\" Two audio recordings exist of Gershwin performing an abridged version of the work with Whiteman's orchestra: an acoustic recording made for Victor on June 10, 1924, and running 8'59'' (this recording includes the original clarinetist, Ross Gorman, playing the glissando) and a Victor electrical recording made April 21, 1927, running 9'01'' (about half the length of the complete work). This 1927 version was also dubbed onto an RCA Victor  33 1/3 rpm Program Transcription in 1932. The latter version was actually conducted by Nathaniel Shilkret after an argument between Gershwin and Whiteman. A 1925 piano roll captured Gershwin's performance in a two piano version. Whiteman's orchestra also performed a shortened version of the piece in the 1930 film The King of Jazz featuring Roy Bargy on piano. Whiteman re-recorded the piece on both sides of a 12-inch Decca 78 rpm (29051) recorded on October 23, 1938. The first complete recording, with pianist Jesus Maria Sanroma and Arthur Fiedler conducting the Boston Pops Orchestra, was issued by RCA Victor in 1935.  Since the mid-20th century, the 1942 version has usually been performed by classical orchestras playing the expanded arrangement. In this form, it has become a staple of the concert repertoire. It has direct popular appeal while also being regarded respectfully by classical musicians.  On August 21, 1945, a recording by Oscar Levant with the Philadelphia Orchestra (conducted by Eugene Ormandy) entered at its peak position of number 23 on the Cash Box survey (Columbia Masterworks 251).  In 1973, the piece was recorded by jazz-rock artist Eumir Deodato on his album Deodato 2. The single reached Billboard peak positions number 41 Pop, number 10 Easy Listening. A disco arrangement was recorded by French pianist Richard Clayderman in 1978 and is one of his signature pieces.  In the late 1970s, interest in the original arrangement was revived. On February 14, 1973, it received its first performance since the 1920s: Kenneth Kiesler secured needed permissions and led with work with pianist Paul Verrette on his U. of New Hampshire campus. Reconstructions of it have been recorded by Michael Tilson Thomas and the Columbia Jazz Band in 1976, and by Maurice Peress with Ivan Davis on piano as part of a 60th-anniversary reconstruction of the entire 1924 concert. Andre Watts (1976), Marco Fumo (1974), and Sara Davis Buechner (2005) released recordings of the work for solo piano as did Eric Himy (2004) in a version that featured the uncut original short score. Meanwhile, such two-piano teams as Jose Iturbi and Amparo Iturbi, France Veri and Michael Jamanis and Katia and Marielle Labeque, also recorded the piece. Michel Camilo recorded the piece in 2006, winning a Latin Grammy award. Who put together the orchestration","output":"Ferde Grofe put together the orchestration for Rhapsody in Blue. He did this several times, including the original 1924 scoring, \\"theater orchestra\\" setting published in 1926, and the symphony orchestra scoring published in 1942."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. What is the solution? Solve -10627 = -1187*x - 2318 for x.","output":"We are asked to solve for 'x'. Here is the equation presented: -10627 = -1187*x - 2318 From the above equation, we are going to solve for x step by step. Step 1: Rewrite the equation and isolate 'x' by getting rid of the constant that is with 'x'.  We can achieve this by moving 2318 from the right hand side of the equation to the left. This is done by addition operation since the opposite operation to subtraction is addition. So we do: -10627 + 2318 = -1187*x  Which gives: -8309 = -1187*x Step 2:  Now we just have to do one more step. 'x' is multiplied by -1187 in the right hand side of the equation. We have to get rid of this -1187 by division operation as the opposite operation of multiplication is division. So we have: x = -8309 / -1187   Getting the results of the division, we obtain: x = 7 So x = 7 is the solution to the equation.  Note: It can be checked by substitifying the result back into the original equation and both side of the equation will be equal, proving that the solution is correct."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By Matt Chorley, James Chapman and Tim Shipman PUBLISHED: 11:39 EST, 30 October 2012 | UPDATED: 04:52 EST, 1 November 2012 The coalition risked descending into political infighting today, after David Cameron suffered his first significant Commons defeat at the hands of Labour and Tory rebels demanding a tougher stance on the EU’s budget. Tory rebels claimed they had defied the Prime Minister to vote for the British people, while loyalists warned Conservatives must ‘get a grip’ and support Mr Cameron or face defeat at the 20-15 general election. Chancellor George Osborne refused to say a real-terms reduction in Brussels spending was impossible but Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned those demanding a cut had ‘absolutely no hope’ of achieving their goal. He also attacked Labour, claiming its tactics reminded him of the ‘unprincipled’ stances taken by Conservatives in the wake of the OPTIONS: - British landslide in 1997. - Brussels landslide in 1997. - Cameron landslide in 1997. - Commons landslide in 1997. - David Cameron landslide in 1997. - EU landslide in 1997. - George Osborne landslide in 1997. - James Chapman landslide in 1997. - Labour landslide in 1997. - Matt Chorley landslide in 1997. - Nick Clegg landslide in 1997. - Tim Shipman landslide in 1997. - Tory landslide in 1997.","output":"Labour landslide in 1997.

You know how in our toy games, there are winners and losers, right? Well, in real life too, companies also play their own type of game - doing business. And when they earn more money, it's like they're kinda winning in their own big game.  Now let's talk about this particular company, Total. They're \\"French\\", which means they're from a country in Europe called France (the same place where Disneyland Paris is!) They're an \\"oil major,\\" just like your kitchen major is where we cook our food. But instead of cooking, what they do is really big and important - they find and sell oil. Oil is super important for a lot of things like cars, which need oil to run, just like you need food to play. So, Total has been doing pretty awesome in their game recently. They've made 20% more money this past year. Now, you might be wondering, \\"what's 20%?\\" Imagine if you had 10 candies and I gave you 2 more. Those 2 extra candies are 20% of your original 10 candies. Cool, right? Now, let's look at how much money Total has made. It's a lot - 5.1 billion. A billion is a tremendously big number, bigger than a million. If we imagine each dollar as a lego block, 1 billion of them would make a tower way taller than our house, maybe even taller than the clouds! The last year, Total made 4.2 billion. Again, using our lego example, it's like they had built a super tall tower, but this year their tower got even taller by 20%.  So, at the end of their annual game, Total has more money which makes them a big winner this year! Just like when you score more points than your friends in your games, you become the winner.

When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&R Block. He'd been pulling shifts for about six months, knew nothing about drugs beyond that bad people used them to escape their problems and that they were tools of Satan, and he always needed Ray's advice about one thing or another. This arrangement was not problematic as Pete had long ago given up trying to convert him. Pete was also the only guy in the city who was, as Ray figured it, making less money than he was at such an hour. In return for Ray's magnanimity, Pete had done Ray's taxes for free last year. They had never actually met, though Ray had faxed him the tax forms and Pete had faxed back a photo of his two pre-teen daughters and his geriatric Lab. \\"What's the problem?\\" Ray asked. \\"I have a recalcitrant.\\" That's what he called them, the drunk and definitely disorderly.

In this case, we can combine the constants on the right side of the equation: -89d = -112 - 244 -89d = -356 Step 2: Isolate the variable d. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable, which in this case is -89: -89d / -89 = -356 / -89 This simplifies to: d = 4 Step 3: Check the solution. Plug the value of d back into the original equation to make sure it is correct: -89(4) = -112 - 244 -356 = -112 - 244 -356 = -356 Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution d = 4 is correct.

To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 269:     q = -269 / 269 3. When we divide -269 by 269, we get:     q = -1 So the answer is: q = -1.

A: unprepared afterwards  B: as dumb  C: energetic afterwards The answer is:","output":"A: unprepared afterwards According to the context provided, Jan skips breakfast and then realizes she has to take a late lunch later in the day. Skipping breakfast can have various impacts on an individual's mood and energy levels. Breakfast is an important meal, as it provides the body with essential nutrients and energy after a long period of fasting during sleep. Skipping breakfast can lead to lower energy levels, feelings of fatigue, and difficulty concentrating. In this situation, Jan may feel unprepared afterwards because she did not provide her body with the necessary fuel to function optimally throughout the morning and early afternoon. Without the energy and nutrients obtained from breakfast, Jan might find her ability to focus, concentrate, and maintain a consistent energy level throughout the day compromised.  Feeling unprepared in this context means that Jan may not feel mentally and physically equipped to handle the challenges she faces throughout the day because of her skipped breakfast and the subsequent late lunch. Between the time she skipped breakfast and the time she eventually has her late lunch, she may experience hunger pangs, lack of concentration, irritability, or fatigue. Answer B, \\"as dumb,\\" and answer C, \\"energetic afterwards,\\" do not accurately reflect the feelings that Jan might experience based on the context provided. Feeling \\"dumb\\" is not a direct result of skipping breakfast or having a late lunch, although difficulty concentrating or forgetfulness could be side effects.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the friend of the person that is accused of murdering two soldiers in Afghanistan? from the following article ?  After busting a human trafficking ring led by Sheriff Wood, Jack Reacher returns to his old military headquarters to meet Major Susan Turner, whom he has been working with during his travels and has become his closest friend – only to learn from Colonel Sam Morgan that Turner has been accused of espionage and detained. Turner's attorney, Colonel Bob Moorcroft, reveals that there is evidence that Turner is involved in the murders of two soldiers in Afghanistan, but Reacher believes she is being framed. Moorcroft also reveals an old acquaintance of Reacher, Candice Dutton, has filed a paternity suit against him, claiming he is the biological father of her 15-year-old daughter, Samantha Dutton. Reacher tries to reach out to Samantha, but she rebuffs him, believing he is after her biological mother due to her past as a prostitute. Moorcroft is later killed by an unknown assassin known as the Hunter. Reacher is framed for Moorcroft's murder and arrested and transported to the prison where Turner is being detained. Two hitmen arrive to kill her, but Reacher neutralizes them, rescues her and they escape to Morgan's house, having deduced he is involved in the conspiracy, to extract information. After they leave, the Hunter, revealed to be working with Morgan, kills Morgan and frames Reacher which he learns about from a friend, Sergeant Leach, when he asks her to investigate a military contractor. Reacher and Turner uncover surveillance pictures of Samantha and surmise she is in danger, arriving at her home to find her foster parents dead and Samantha hiding in the kitchen. Reacher and Turner decide to escort Samantha to Turner's old private school for protection, but discover that she has her mobile phone with her and that the enemy probably knows exactly where they are. They discard the phone and make a quick exit, during which Samantha steals a backpack from one of the students to use the credit cards.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Jacob is performing a chemistry experiment using two different liquids. Before starting the experiment, Jacob is told that liquid A molecules have strong intermolecular forces, while liquid B molecules have weak intermolecular forces. Jacob now has to decide how to use this information to guide  him as he develops the experimental procedures for these two liquids.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which liquid will have lower viscosity?  Hint: Vapor pressure is a measure of the pressure exerted by a gas above a liquid in a sealed container. While viscosity and surface tension increase as the strength of intermolecular forces increase, vapor pressure decreases . This is because the stronger the intermolecular forces are, the harder it is for liquid molecules to escape into the gas phase. Vapor pressure a measure of how much of a substance is in the gas phase when that substance is at equilibrium; that is, the number of molecules in the gas and liquid phases are not changing. The more molecules that are able to escape into the gas phase, the higher the vapor pressure. Vapor pressure is also proportional to temperature. As temperature increases, vapor pressure also increases. Answer:","output":"Liquid B will have lower viscosity. To understand this answer, we need to dive deeper into the concepts of intermolecular forces, viscosity, surface tension, and vapor pressure. Intermolecular forces are the forces that hold molecules together in a substance. These forces include van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding, and dipole-dipole interactions. In the given scenario, liquid A has stronger intermolecular forces compared to liquid B, which has weak intermolecular forces. Viscosity is the measure of a liquid's resistance to flow or its internal friction, which is determined primarily by the strength of intermolecular forces. When a liquid has stronger intermolecular forces, its molecules have a higher tendency to stick together, resulting in a higher resistance to flow. Conversely, a liquid with weaker intermolecular forces will have molecules that can more easily overcome the attractive forces and move past each other. This results in lower internal friction, and hence, lower viscosity. Therefore, given that liquid B has weaker intermolecular forces, it will have a lower viscosity compared to liquid A. Surface tension is a measure of the energy required to increase the surface area of a liquid by a unit area, and it is also related to the strength of the intermolecular forces in the liquid. A liquid with strong intermolecular forces will have a higher surface tension because more energy is needed to break the attractions between the molecules at the surface. Vapor pressure is a measure of the pressure exerted by a gas above a liquid in a sealed container. When for a substance, the strength of intermolecular forces increases, the vapor pressure decreases. This is because stronger intermolecular forces make it more difficult for the molecules in the liquid phase to escape into the gas phase. Since liquid A has stronger intermolecular forces, its vapor pressure will be lower as compared to liquid B with weaker intermolecular forces. In conclusion, since viscosity decreases as the strength of intermolecular forces decrease, liquid B, with weak intermolecular forces, will have lower viscosity as compared to liquid A with strong intermolecular forces."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Who negotiated more favorable terms on behalf of the UK in the Destroyers For Bases Agreement? Context: In May 1940, the US requested base rights in Bermuda from the United Kingdom, but British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was initially unwilling to accede to the American request without getting something in return. In September 1940, as part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, the UK granted the US base rights in Bermuda. Bermuda and Newfoundland were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received by the UK in exchange. One of the terms of the agreement was that the airfield the US Army built would be used jointly by the US and the UK (which it was for the duration of the war, with RAF Transport Command relocating there from Darrell's Island in 1943).

You must generate a detailed and long answer. How are most wars started? Why do wars happen? Do those questions have the same meaning? Pick from: - no; - yes;","output":"No, the two questions do not have the same meaning, as they address different aspects of wars. The first question focuses on the causes of wars, while the second question is more about the reasons behind them. To address the first question, how most wars are started: Wars can be initiated for various reasons, including: 1. Territorial disputes: Many wars have been fought over disputes related to land or borders. Conflicting claims about territorial sovereignty often lead to conflicts, as countries seek to assert their control over specific regions. 2. Resource control: Wars can be initiated by nations seeking to secure access to crucial resources (such as oil, minerals, or water) that may be scarce or unequally distributed. 3. Political/power rivalries: National leaders might engage in wars to assert their political power or protect their interests. For example, the power struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War led to numerous proxy wars around the globe. 4. Ideological differences: Wars can be waged because of deep ideological differences between countries or groups. For instance, the spread of communism was a major factor in several conflicts during the 20th century, such as the Korean War and the Vietnam War. 5. Ethnic or religious tensions: Wars may arise due to long-standing ethnic or religious tensions between different groups or communities. An example of this is the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia during the 1990s. 6. Revenge or retaliation: Wars can be declared in response to acts of aggression, such as terrorist attacks or other acts of violence, to avenge the event or ensure that the attacker does not pose a further threat. Now, addressing the second question, why do wars happen: Wars happen for a variety of reasons, some of which are rooted in human nature and history. Factors contributing to the occurrence of wars can include the following: 1. Human aggression: There is a long-standing debate about whether humans are inherently aggressive or if aggression is learned culturally. Either way, aggression can play a significant role in conflicts between groups or nations. 2. Fear of attack: Protection and self-preservation are fundamental human instincts. Countries might go to war due to the perceived threat from another nation and the need to defend their territory and people. 3. Economic gain: War can be a means for a nation to secure access to valuable resources or to expand its markets, leading to an improved economy. 4. Nationalism: A strong sense of national pride and unity can lead to an \\"us versus them\\" mentality, which can contribute to the outbreak of war, particularly when combined with other factors. 5. Political power: Some leaders might see war as an opportunity to increase their popularity and power. In some cases, going to war can be a way to divert attention from domestic issues or consolidate political power. 6. Miscommunication and misunderstanding: Wars can also be triggered by miscommunications, misunderstandings, or lack of diplomatic channels. In these cases, conflicts may spiral out of control unintentionally, with the situation escalating to the point of war. In conclusion, while both questions address the topic of wars, they do not have the same meaning. Understanding the specific causes of wars and the reasons behind their occurrence can help nations and global communities work towards peace and conflict resolution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if fewer embryos develop, it may lead to less or smaller nests being constructed. The effect of this perturbation on the bird nest-building process can be direct or indirect. A direct effect could be that birds, upon realizing that fewer embryos are developing, might consciously or instinctively build smaller nests. They might collect fewer materials and create a more compact nest to accommodate the reduced number of offspring. An indirect effect could be related to the availability of resources in the environment and the amount of time and energy birds must devote to collecting nest-building materials. If birds are experiencing a decrease in embryo development, they might have to focus more on survival and reproduction strategies rather than investing time and energy in building larger, more elaborate nests. This focus on resources for survival may indirectly lead to the construction of smaller or fewer nests. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that a decrease in embryo development might have an effect on nest size or number, either directly by birds consciously or instinctively adjusting their nest-building behavior to accommodate fewer offspring, or indirectly by reallocating resources and energy towards other survival and reproduction strategies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the context: What will Quinn want to do next?  Possible answers: Get a ride home from a friend, Buy a new car, Get back in the jeep and drive away Answer:","output":"Given the context of the situation, it seems that Quinn's primary concern is resolving the issue with his Jeep's headlights. Taking this into consideration, the most appropriate action for Quinn to do next would likely be to get a ride home from a friend. Upon taking his vehicle to the shop, Quinn is likely expecting professional assistance in diagnosing and fixing the problem with his Jeep's headlights. It's reasonable to assume that the repair might take some time to complete, as the mechanic might need to examine the wiring, fuse, bulbs, or even the headlight switch itself to determine the root cause of the problem. With the car in the shop and not knowing how long it will take to complete the repairs, Quinn would not want to be stranded without transportation. Getting a ride home from a friend would be a practical choice, enabling him to continue with his day and not feel stuck while waiting for the mechanic to finish their work on his Jeep. While buying a new car might seem like an option, it is not practical in this situation. Purchasing a new vehicle can be a significant financial decision, and it would not make sense to impulsively buy a new car simply because of a temporary, fixable issue with the headlights. It is more logical and cost-effective to repair the current problem than to invest in an entirely new vehicle. Similarly, getting back in the Jeep and driving away is not a viable choice for Quinn. With the headlights not functioning properly, driving the vehicle would be a safety risk, especially at night or during poor weather conditions when visibility is critical. Additionally, operating a car with non-functioning headlights would likely be illegal in most jurisdictions, potentially resulting in fines or penalties for Quinn. In conclusion, based on the context provided, the most reasonable course of action for Quinn would be to seek a ride home from a friend while his Jeep is being repaired at the shop. This choice would ensure his safety, maintain his responsibilities, and allow him to address the headlight issue without resorting to more extreme or risky options."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: U.S. President Donald Trump filed his annual financial disclosure form this week with the Office of Government Ethics, the U.S. government's ethics watchdog. Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. Question: How long did the affair, if true, between Trump and the adult film star most likely continue? Answer: Answer:","output":"The context provided does not mention the specific duration of the alleged affair between Trump and the adult film star."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — During his first year in office, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s persistent pursuit of diplomacy, often working in parallel with U.S. President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, played a significant role in persuading North Korea to engage in talks to end its nuclear program. “Before the extreme measures might have been chosen by the United States, he gave diplomacy another chance to succeed,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University’s Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul. A year ago this week, Moon, a former human rights lawyer and candidate for the progressive Democratic Party, won a special presidential election held after former conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached for her involvement in a bribery and corruption scandal. This year, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison during criminal trial related to the scandal in which she was charged with abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Moon assumed power at a time of increasing tensions, not just concerning North Korea’s accelerated nuclear and ballistic missile tests, but also China’s imposing of informal economic sanctions against South Korea for deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, and the Trump administration’s talk of possible military action to end the North’s efforts to develop a nuclear armed intercontinental missile that could strike the U.S. mainland. In his inaugural address in May 2017, Moon promised to engage in shuttle diplomacy with Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang to work out a peaceful solution to the growing crisis. In a July speech in Berlin, President Moon laid out his vision for inter-Korean reconciliation that called for peaceful co-existence of the two Korean governments, but also said that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is “the absolute condition for peace.” But unlike past progressive South Korean governments that provided unconditional economic assistance, the Moon administration complied with economic sanctions in place and...

The lack of sufficient shelving not only made the educational environment appear cluttered and disorganized, but it also hindered the teacher's ability to efficiently locate and access specific textbooks when needed, ultimately causing considerable delays and disruptions in the overall teaching process.  Moreover, many of the textbooks represented a considerable financial investment by the school, and they needed to be well-preserved in order to maximize their shelf life and minimize the need for frequent replacements, which could strain the already limited school budget. The current overcrowding of the existing shelves did not afford each textbook the space and ventilation required to prevent them from becoming damaged or compromised, which could potentially lead to an increased risk of deterioration over time.  Furthermore, the insufficient shelving units prevented the teacher from adequately displaying various manuals, atlases, dictionaries, workbooks, and supplementary materials that were essential complements to the main textbooks, which would have otherwise facilitated the learning process and sparked students' curiosity while promoting independent exploration and discovery. Additionally, such a lack of organized storage spaces also reduced the overall aesthetic appeal of the classroom environment, which can significantly impact the students' motivation and engagement level, as research has demonstrated that an organized, comfortable, and visually appealing learning space can contribute to enhanced student learning outcomes and overall classroom satisfaction. It became increasingly evident that providing additional shelves to hold the textbooks would not only ensure that these valuable resources were properly stored, maintained, and displayed, but it would also play a crucial role in creating a more inviting, organized, and conducive learning environment, with positive repercussions on both the efficiency of the teacher and the performance and well-being of the students.

Minutes from the Fed's meeting on 28-29 July show one policymaker was ready to vote for a rate rise at the meeting. However, other policymakers remained concerned that inflation would remain weak because of the strong dollar and falling commodity prices. The Fed's key interest rate has been kept near zero since December 2008. There has been speculation that the Fed will raise rates at its meeting in September, and last month Fed chair Janet Yellen said she thought a rate rise this year was likely. In assessing the strength of the US economy, the Fed has been keeping an eye on the US jobs market - which has seen the unemployment rate fall to 5.3%. However, inflation is still below the Fed's target of 2%. The minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) July meeting said: \\"Most judged that the conditions for policy firming had not yet been achieved, but they noted that conditions were approaching that point.\\" The committee noted that the labour market \\"had continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment\\". However, when assessing inflation, it said that \\"some members continued to see downside risks to inflation from the possibility of further dollar appreciation and declines in commodity prices\\". The FOMC said it would continue to monitor inflation \\"closely, with almost all members indicating that they would need to see more evidence that economic growth was sufficiently strong and labour market conditions had firmed enough for them to feel reasonably confident that inflation would return to the committee's longer-run objective over the medium term\\". Inflation figures released earlier on Wednesday showed that consumer prices rose by 0.1% in July, and were 0.2% higher from a year ago. So-called core inflation, which ignores changes in food and energy prices, also rose 0.1% last month, but was up 1.8% over the year. The committee also cited China as a potential problem, saying that a \\"material slowdown\\" in the Chinese economy could affect the US economic outlook. The FOMC's meeting came before last week's action by China to weaken its currency. Following the release of the Fed's minutes, US stocks rallied briefly but then fell back, while the dollar weakened on the currency markets. \\"The Fed minutes don't rule out a September rate hike but they are certainly saying they want more evidence on the data,\\" Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital, told Reuters.","output":"The people who help decide when to change the interest rates in America had a meeting, and most of them think they should wait a little longer, but one person wanted to increase the rate now."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Campion is the second of four women ever nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director and is the firstand thus far, onlyfemale filmmaker in history to receive the Palme d'Or, which she received for directing the acclaimed film \\"The Piano\\" (1993), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.  - Alice James (August 7, 1848  March 6, 1892) was an American diarist, sister of novelist Henry James and philosopher William James. Her relationship with William was unusually close, and she seems to have been badly affected by his marriage. James suffered lifelong psychological problems, that were generally dismissed as hysteria, in the style of the day. She is best known for her published diaries, which reveal much about her obsessions and mental imbalance. They display sharp insights into psychosomatic illness as a deliberate flight from reality.  - A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based.  - William James (January 11, 1842  August 26, 1910) was an American philosopher and psychologist who was also trained as a physician. The first educator to offer a psychology course in the United States, James was one of the leading thinkers of the late nineteenth century and is believed by many to be one of the most influential philosophers the United States has ever produced, while others have labeled him the \\"Father of American psychology\\".  - The Piano is a 1993 New Zealand drama film about a mute piano player and her daughter. Set during the mid-19th century in a rainy, muddy frontier backwater town on the west coast of New Zealand, it revolves around the piano player's passion for playing the piano and her efforts to regain her piano after it is sold. \\"The Piano\\" was written and directed by Jane Campion, and stars Holly Hunter, Harvey Keitel, Sam Neill, and Anna Paquin in her first acting role. The film's score for the piano by Michael Nyman became a best-selling soundtrack album, and Hunter played her own piano pieces for the film. She also served as sign language teacher for Paquin, earning three screen credits. The film is an international co-production by Australian producer Jan Chapman with the French company Ciby 2000.  - The Portrait of a Lady is a 1996 film adaptation of Henry James 's novel The Portrait of a Lady directed by Jane Campion . The story was also previously a Broadway play , which opened in December 1954 , with Barbara O'Neil in the role of Madame Serena Merle . The film stars Nicole Kidman , Barbara Hershey , John Malkovich , Mary - Louise Parker , Martin Donovan , Shelley Duvall , Richard E. Grant , Shelley Winters , Viggo Mortensen , Valentina Cervi , Christian Bale , and John Gielgud .  - Henry James, OM ( ) was an American-born British writer. He is regarded as one of the key figures of 19th-century literary realism. He was the son of Henry James, Sr. and the brother of philosopher and psychologist William James and diarist Alice James.  - The Portrait of a Lady is a novel by Henry James, first published as a serial in \\"The Atlantic Monthly\\" and \\"Macmillan's Magazine\\" in 188081 and then as a book in 1881. It is one of James's most popular long novels and is regarded by critics as one of his finest.  - Literary realism is part of the realist art movement beginning with mid nineteenth-century French literature (Stendhal), and Russian literature (Alexander Pushkin) and extending to the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Literary realism, in contrast to idealism, attempts to represent familiar things as they are.

Translate this to English?","output":"Turkey continues to negotiate with the EU on the details of the Nabucco pipeline project. The Nabucco pipeline project, which is named after Giuseppe Verdi's opera \\"Nabucco,\\" is a regional natural gas pipeline system that was designed to transport natural gas from the resource-rich Eastern regions, like the Caspian and Middle East, to the energy-hungry European markets. The project aimed to diversify energy resources, enhance energy security, and reduce the dependence on Russian gas supplies. The proposed pipeline route passes through various countries such as Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary, eventually reaching Austria.  The negotiations between Turkey and the European Union (EU) revolve around several aspects of the pipeline project. These aspects include the legal framework, financing, management, technical specifications, and even political matters considering the strategic importance of the pipeline in the region. It is crucial for Turkey and EU countries to agree upon fair and balanced terms in order to make the most of the pipeline project and ensure the stability and security of the natural gas supply in the long term. While the Nabucco project has faced obstacles such as cost overruns, delays, and competition from other pipeline projects, it remains a crucial topic for both the EU and Turkey. The negotiations highlight the importance of such a project in diversifying the sources of energy imports, ensuring the availability of competitive natural gas prices, and enhancing regional cooperation for a more sustainable and secure energy future. Both parties are expected to continue their discussions to reach a mutually beneficial outcome, as the success of the Nabucco project would greatly benefit all parties involved. The project has the potential to strengthen Turkey's role as an energy hub and could provide the EU member countries with a secure, reliable, and diverse source of natural gas, contributing significantly to the EU's energy security strategy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Stossel was born on March 6, 1947, in Chicago Heights, Illinois, the younger of two sons, to Jewish parents who left Germany before Hitler rose to power. They joined a Congregationalist church in the U.S., and Stossel was raised Protestant. He grew up on Chicago's affluent North Shore and graduated from New Trier High School. Stossel characterizes his older brother, Tom, as \\"the superstar of the family\\", commenting, \\"While I partied and played poker, he studied hard, got top grades, and went to Harvard Medical School.\\" Progressive organizations such as Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) and Media Matters for America (MMfA) have criticized Stossel's work, for what they perceived as a lack of balance of coverage and distortion of facts. For example, Stossel was criticized for a segment on his October 11, 1999, show during which he argued that AIDS research has received too much funding, \\"25 times more than on Parkinson's, which kills more people.\\" FAIR responded that AIDS had killed more people in the United States in 1999, but Stossel was speaking in more broad terms than a single country over a single year.  In a February 2000 Salon.com feature on Stossel entitled \\"Prime-time propagandist\\", David Mastio wrote that Stossel has a conflict of interest in donating profits from his public speaking engagements to, among others, a non-profit called \\"Stossel in the Classroom\\" which includes material for use in schools, some of which uses material made by Stossel.  University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith has alleged that Stossel, in his September 1999 special Is America #1?, used an out-of-context clip of Galbraith to convey the notion that Galbraith advocated the adoption by Europe of the free market economics practiced by the United States, when in fact Galbraith actually advocated that Europe adopt some of the United States' social benefit transfer mechanisms such as Social Security, which is the economically opposite view. Stossel denied any misrepresentation of Galbraith's views and stated that it was not his intention to convey that Galbraith agreed with all of the special's ideas. However, he re-edited that portion of the program for its September 2000 repeat, in which Stossel paraphrased, \\"Even economists who like Europe's policies, like James Galbraith, now acknowledge America's success.\\" Entity:","output":"The text is about John F.

Context: The Quran most likely existed in scattered written form during Muhammad's lifetime. Several sources indicate that during Muhammad's lifetime a large number of his companions had memorized the revelations. Early commentaries and Islamic historical sources support the above-mentioned understanding of the Quran's early development. The Quran in its present form is generally considered by academic scholars to record the words spoken by Muhammad because the search for variants has not yielded any differences of great significance.[page needed] University of Chicago professor Fred Donner states that \\"...there was a very early attempt to establish a uniform consonantal text of the Qurʾān from what was probably a wider and more varied group of related texts in early transmission. [...] After the creation of this standardized canonical text, earlier authoritative texts were suppressed, and all extant manuscripts—despite their numerous variants—seem to date to a time after this standard consonantal text was established.\\" Although most variant readings of the text of the Quran have ceased to be transmitted, some still are. There has been no critical text produced on which a scholarly reconstruction of the Quranic text could be based. Historically, controversy over the Quran's content has rarely become an issue, although debates continue on the subject.","output":"The text the professor is discussing is the Quran, and it is generally considered by academic scholars to record the words spoken by Muhammad."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.Sigurður was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment.

Would \\"The title is a play on surgical scrubs and a term for a low-ranking person because at the beginning of the series, most of the main characters were medical interns .\\" be a reasonable answer? Options are: [-] No. [-] Yes. Answer:","output":"No, \\"The title is a play on surgical scrubs and a term for a low-ranking person because at the beginning of the series, most of the main characters were medical interns.\\" would not be a reasonable answer to the question: \\"How did Scrubs end?\\" This statement explains the meaning behind the title of the show, but does not provide any information about the show's ending. A more detailed and long answer to the question would be: Scrubs, a popular medical comedy-drama series that aired from 2001 to 2010, follows the lives of medical interns and residents at the fictional Sacred Heart Hospital. The show concluded at the end of its ninth season. However, the de facto main ending of the series is considered to be the season 8 finale, titled \\"My Finale,\\" as season 9 acted more as a spinoff focusing on new characters and a different setting.  The season 8 finale revolves around the protagonist, John \\"J.D.\\" Dorian (played by Zach Braff), as he bids farewell to Sacred Heart Hospital. Throughout the episode, J.D. reflects on his relationships with the various characters he has encountered during the series, including his best friend Christopher Turk (played by Donald Faison), love interest Elliot Reid (played by Sarah Chalke), mentor Perry Cox (played by John C. McGinley), and hospital chief Bob Kelso (played by Ken Jenkins). J.D.'s departure from Sacred Heart is marked by emotional goodbyes with his friends, coworkers, and even the enigmatic janitor, who reveals his true name. As J.D. walks down the hallway for the last time, he envisions his future with Elliot as they celebrate significant milestones, such as their wedding, having children, and growing old together. A fitting end to the series, J.D.'s exit parallels his entrance into the hospital at the start of the show. As he leaves, he unfolds a screen displaying a personal message from the janitor, revealing that J.D. has made a lasting impact on the hospital and those around him. Consequently, the season 8 finale of Scrubs offers a sense of closure for the show's main cast, but it also leaves some open-ended possibilities in the lives of the characters. Season 9, though it received mixed reviews, continued with a primarily new cast and shifted its setting to med school. The new series protagonist, Lucy Bennett (played by Kerry Bishé), studies under the mentorship of Dr. Cox and Dr. Turk, who return as series regulars. Despite the altered focus, the series retained its signature blend of humor, drama, and medical education until its ultimate conclusion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"no they haven't\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"We need to prepare for the possibility of them doing it in the future.\\"?","output":"The premise \\"No, they haven't\\" suggests that, in the context of the conversation, a certain action or event has not yet occurred. This suggests that the subjects 'they' have not yet performed an expected or suggested activity. However, the inferred implications about the hypothesis \\"We need to prepare for the possibility of them doing it in the future\\" are not definitively settled by this particular premise.  The premise itself isn't directly linked to a predictive action of those being referenced. It's purely factual and represents a state of things at the present moment or in the past. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is forward-looking and anticipatory in nature. The hypothesis suggests a need for preparedness based on a possible future action by the subjects referred to as 'they.' Whether the premise implies this hypothesis depends highly on the context of what the aforementioned \\"it\\" actually is and the likelihood of 'them' pursuing this action in the future. For instance, if 'they' are a group of scientists who have not yet tried a particular experiment, and there is reason to believe they will in the future, then the premise could suggest the relevance of the hypothesis.  However, if 'they' are a group of people that have historically shown no interest or intent in the action (let's say, climbing Mount Everest), then although the premise is true, the anticipation of them doing 'it' in the future based on the premise might be less probable.  So, in essence, \\"No, they haven't\\" and \\"We need to prepare for the possibility of them doing it in the future\\" could be related if context and logical progression indicate that the particular action not yet done is likely or even possible in the future. But the premise itself doesn't inherently entail the hypothesis. To determine if the premise supports the hypothesis, we would need additional contextual information about the specifics of 'it', the capability or intentions of 'they', and their relationship to 'it'.  Moreover, in a logical or argumentative structure, additional premises may be required to firmly ground the hypothesis, such as \\"They are considering doing it\\", or \\"There is a likelihood that they will do it in the future\\", or \\"There is a precedent of others in similar situations doing it later\\".  So, the statement \\"No, they haven't\\" can provide useful information about past or present state, but additional support would be necessary to robustly imply the forward-looking hypothesis \\"We need to prepare for the possibility of them doing it in the future\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On 21 January 1818, Friedrich married Caroline Bommer, the twenty-five-year-old daughter of a dyer from Dresden. The couple had three children, with their first, Emma, arriving in 1820.  Physiologist and painter Carl Gustav Carus notes in his biographical essays that marriage did not impact significantly on either Friedrich's life or personality, yet his canvasses from this period, including Chalk Cliffs on Rügen—painted after his honeymoon—display a new sense of levity, while his palette is brighter and less austere. Human figures appear with increasing frequency in the paintings of this period, which Siegel interprets as a reflection that \\"the importance of human life, particularly his family, now occupies his thoughts more and more, and his friends, his wife, and his townspeople appear as frequent subjects in his art.\\"Around this time, he found support from two sources in Russia. In 1820, the Grand Duke Nikolai Pavlovich, at the behest of his wife Alexandra Feodorovna, visited Friedrich's studio and returned to Saint Petersburg with a number of his paintings, an exchange that began a patronage that continued for many years. Not long thereafter, the poet Vasily Zhukovsky, tutor to Alexander II, met Friedrich in 1821 and found in him a kindred spirit. For decades Zhukovsky helped Friedrich both by purchasing his work himself and by recommending his art to the royal family; his assistance toward the end of Friedrich's career proved invaluable to the ailing and impoverished artist. Zhukovsky remarked that his friend's paintings \\"please us by their precision, each of them awakening a memory in our mind.\\"Friedrich was acquainted with Philipp Otto Runge, another leading German painter of the Romantic period.

According to the Knox County Sheriff David Shaffer, Officer Thomas Cottrell was killed in the line of duty late Sunday night.      Sheriff Shaffer said around 11:20 p.m. Sunday, the Knox County dispatch center received a call stating that police officers in Danville were in danger. The woman told dispatchers that her ex-boyfriend, Herschel Ray Jones had left with weapons and was looking to kill an officer.      Dispatchers then tried to contact the Danville officer on duty, but were unsuccessful. Deputies from the Sheriff’s Office then searched the village.      Shortly before midnight, deputies found the body of Officer Thomas Cottrell on the ground behind the municipal building. His gun had been taken and his cruiser was missing.      Investigators say Jones was seen running from a residence on East Washington Street around 1:36 a.m. Monday. After a foot chase, Jones was taken into custody.      The suspect’s brother, John Jones, told NBC4 he spoke to Herschel Jones minutes before he was taken into custody. He said Herschel had taken a quantity of an anti-anxiety drug called Klonopin.      “He was out of his mind on drugs,” Jones said. “He already had done what he done. He still didn’t admit it to me though – that’s how far out of his mind he was. He completely went over the edge.”      John Jones says family members called Herschel’s parole officer last week to report that he had guns and drugs and was at risk of doing something bad. John Jones says nothing was done.      Jones says his brother had asked judges on several occasions to send him to a mental institution rather than to prison. He says those requests were denied.      A woman who was outside of the residence was also taken into custody and later released.      The Knox County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the incident with the help of the Ohio Bureau of Investigation.      Danville is a village in Knox County with a population of just over 1,000 people. The police department employs six people and Chief Daniel J. Weckesser was appointed to the job on January 4.

Police say a woman in Danville called dispatch Sunday evening around 11:20 p.m. to warn them her ex-boyfriend, identified as 34-year-old Hershel Ray Jones III, was armed and \\"looking to kill an officer,\\" reports CBS affiliate WBNS-TV in Columbus.      The woman said officers in the area of Danville, near Columbus, were in danger.      Dispatchers frantically put out a call and failed to make contact with Danville Officer Thomas Cottrell. Deputies from the Knox County Sheriff's officer were dispatched, but all they turned up initially was a Cottrell's hat with blood on it, and nothing more.      Their worst fears were later realized 20 minutes later when they Cottrell's body behind the Danville Municipal Building, clearly dead from gunshot wounds. His gun and patrol car had been stolen.      He was the first officer killed in the state of Ohio in 2016, reports WBNS.      Jones was tracked down a short while later, and spotted at 1:30 a.m. running out of a house. Police gave chase, and caught him near Danville Park. He has been named as the prime suspect in the murder.      No charges have been announced yet. ||||| A Danville police officer is dead after authorities say a gunman was on the hunt to kill a member of law enforcement.      Police say dispatchers received a call from a woman in Danville around 11:20 p.m. on Sunday, saying police were in danger because her ex-boyfriend, 32-year-old Herschel Jones, was armed and “looking to kill an officer.” Danville is a small village about 60 miles northeast of Columbus.      In response, dispatchers tried to make contact with Danville Officer Thomas Cottrell who was on patrol, but were unsuccessful. A statewide alert was issued, and deputies from the Knox County Sheriff’s Office also searched the village, but couldn’t locate the officer. Only Cottrell's hat, which had been covered in blood, was located during the search.      Around 20 minutes later, Cottrell’s body was found shot to death behind the Danville Municipal Building. His service weapon and cruiser had been stolen.      Just after 1:30 a.m., the alleged killer was spotted running from a home on East Washington Street. After a foot chase with police, Jones was taken into custody near Danville Park. As of Monday afternoon, he faces a charge of tampering with evidence.      Court records show Jones has a lengthy criminal record, and in one case tried to claim he was legally insane.      Officers from the Knox County Sheriff’s Office and B.C.I. are investigating the deadly shooting.      Cottrell’s death marks the first for an officer in the line of duty in Ohio in 2016. ||||| Chief of Police      Daniel J. Weckesser      Letter From the Chief      The Danville Police Department experienced many changes during 2016. Upon the retirement of Chief Monte Vance, I was appointed Chief of Police January 04th, 2016. Then on January 17th, 2016 our Department was dramatically affected by the tragic shooting death of Officer Thomas Cottrell Jr. Our small Department could have easily dissolved but through the support and prayers of everyone we continue to slowly recover. The Department has a strengthened commitment to provide the best police protection to our community. We are a dedicated force to all we serve and will continue to do our best to earn your respect and honor. This yearly report is to inform you of statistics and enlighten you as to notable changes in 2016.      In 2016, K-9 Officer Lasko was officially retired after 10 plus years of service. K-9 Officer TC joined the Department with the certification of K-9 handler Sgt. Lishness. K-9 Officer Diesel was sworn to serve with myself as his handler. Officers Mark Perkins and Joshua Abshire joined the Department and with the certification of Officer Perkins, K-9 Officer Rezza joined as his partner. With the assistance of the Columbus Police Dept. Mounted Unit and the Ohio State University Mounted Unit, Corporal Lisa Lyons helped to form our first Mounted Police Unit which consists of Corporal Lyons, Officer Kevin Henthorn and the two horses “Casino” and “Levi”. The Mounted Patrol will be used for parades, special events, and community outreach. Additionally we intend to initiate a Mounted Search and Rescue Team.      We purchased a new police cruiser equipped with fresh graphics that are now displayed on all three cruisers. Our Department replaced the outdated computers and the phone system in our office. The new phone system allows the public to make direct contact with an officer or leave a message to any officer as needed. In addition, we managed to update and replace our uniforms. All units received additional training and/or “specialized” training which enhances the officer(s) with additional skills and knowledge in the performance of their duties.      Looking forward to 2017 and beyond, I would like to assure the Community that the Danville Police Department will continue to provide the best service possible. We work for you, the people. We will strive to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America, the laws of the State of Ohio and the Village of Danville. We will not be influenced by anything, anyone, any agencies or organizations who attempt to hinder the performance of our duties as your Police Department. We plan to continue educating and equipping the department in order to provide the best possible service to our community. Continued dialogue with our citizens will help to educate and inform each one of you to the many dangers and types of crime that could possibly affect our community.      It is our goal to establish a program that will allow officers more one- on- one time with our youth in the schools and in our churches. This program will be created in the memory of our fallen brother, Officer Cottrell.      Danville is not immune to the impact of illegal drug use. Many people in our community have been affected in some way by the increased drug abuse issues. In 2017, a top priority of our Police Department will be combating the illegal drugs infiltrating our community. Many additional crimes can be alleviated with the eradication of the illegal drugs. We will continue to build community relations by educating the public on protecting themselves and their property from criminal acts.      Our police department’s office is extremely small, which creates many issues. We are investigating different options for expanding our departmental offices. The goal is to remodel or possibly build a new structure in the future.      Danville Police Department      Front L-R      Cpl. Kevin Henthorn - Sgt. Lisa Lyons - Ofc. Josh Abshire      Rear L-R Lt.

Danville Officer Thomas Cottrell was gunned down shortly before midnight behind the Danville Municipal Building, Knox County Sheriff David Shaffer said. His service weapon and cruiser were missing. Cottrell's cruiser was later found approximately half a mile from his body.            The suspected gunman, Herschel Ray Jones III, was taken into custody around 1:30 a.m. after he briefly ran from officers. Knox County Prosecutor Chip McConville says he expects Jones to face a murder charge, but it's not clear how soon it would be filed.      Court records show Jones, 32, has multiple convictions dating back to 2001 for breaking and entering, burglary, receiving stolen property and carrying a concealed weapon. In a 2011 case, he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity before changing his plea to guilty. Ohio prison records show he served nearly four years for the 2011 convictions of receiving stolen property and possession of chemicals for manufacture of drugs. He was released last April.            Shaffer said authorities received a call at approximately 11:20 p.m. from a woman saying police officers in Danville were in danger, and her ex-boyfriend, Jones, had weapons and was looking to kill an officer.      Shaffer said dispatchers tried to make contact with Cottrell, but were unable to do so. That prompted the Knox County Sheriff's Office to search the village.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Andy Murray lost the match but did enough to remind why he has won Grand Slams in the past and might yet do so again in the future. At 1.17am, before the unruly remnants of the Flushing Meadows crowd, he finally succumbed to the barrage of Novak Djokovic in their US Open quarter final, going down 7-6 6-7 6-2, 6-4 in three hours and 31 minutes. By the end Murray's spirit was willing but the legs had weakened, as he paid the price for taking three and a half hours longer to get to this match than his opponent. VIDEO Scroll down for Novak Djokovic: Didn't play the way I wanted to against Murray. Time to celebrate: Novak Djokovic raises his arms after beating Andy Murray in their quarter-final game. Too good: Novak Djokovic celebrates holding serve in the third set against Andy Murray on Wednesday. Verbal volley: Andy Murray lets out his frustration as Novak Djokovic starts to assume control of the match. Down and out: Andy Murray appeared to be feeling the pace as the quarter-final wore on. Departing: Andy Murray salutes the crowd as he leaves the Arthur Ashe stadium. This result was not unexpected, but for sustained periods he stood toe-to-toe with the world’s best player, whose standards he must aspire to if he is to re-attain the success of 2012-13. Murray said afterwards: 'He was definitely physically fresher, the pace of my serve slowed down towards the end. My back towards the end stiffened up, it is physically extremely demanding to play him. I tried to hang in at the end but was a little bit disappointed how my body reacted, I have trained hard. 'There was some good stuff in the first two sets, I was down in them but I fought back, I just didn’t play a good first tiebreak.' Djokovic added: 'We both gave our best. At times the tennis was not that nice, we made a lot of unforced errors, but it was due to the very physical battle in the opening two and a half sets. 'I didn't expect any less knowing I was going to face Andy. The last five times we played, it was always over three or four hours. I'm very glad to get through to another semi-final.' Neither player was flawless but there were plenty of magnificent exchanges which frequently pushed the Serb to his limits. Djokovic, who now plays Kei Nishikori, will surely win this event now. There were ample unforced errors and both players went through sporadic lapses and, especially in Murray’s case, the return much outshone the serve. There was also much to admire. The Scot’s forehand was particularly potent, and he will contemplate what might have happened if he had avoided one of those lapses in the opening tiebreak. Murray fought hard into the early hours. Ultimately, however, Djokovic with his seven breaks of serve bossed proceedings and from the second tiebreak never looked like losing. Murray at least knows he has created something to build on. Shock and awe: Andy Murray was appeared to be having trouble with his eyes during the game. Tunnel vision: Andy Murray was seen struggling with his sight during the game. On the move: World No 1 Novak Djokovic seemed the fitter of the two players. Back to his best? Andy Murray proved he is still a major force at Grand Slams.

Unstoppable: Andy Murray reacts after Novak Djokovic slams down another serve. Gracious: Andy Murray congratulates Novak Djokovic on his win after the match had finished. Two years after their epic final in 2012, the former junior rivals were reunited on the same court at the Arthur Ashes Stadium, this time with one of them ranked as the world’s top player and the other the No 8 seed. Murray's lower than normal seed being the reason why they were now meeting in the last eight. That is not by accident, Murray is taking small steps on his way back from surgery while Djokovic has rediscovered the art of winning Grand Slams after a period of near misses. On a balmy night, the Arthur Ashe Stadium was packed to the gunwales and the 27-year-old Scot made the perfect start when his piercing returns resulted in an opening break. He was always likely to make inroads on the Djokovic serve but protecting his own was going to be the problem. He had dropped it thirteen times coming into this match and the fourteenth was not far behind as Djokovic immediately levelled. The inability to gain free points against someone who returns even better than he does saw him go 1-4 down - but the damage was swiftly repaired. The Serb, ever the rolled up ball of Balkan anger, started ranting at himself in the seventh game and was pressured into several errors to allow Murray back in. The Scot’s big chance came when be forced a break point at 4-4, but a finely angled serve meant he could only just lay a racket on it. Breather: Andy Murray looked to be feeling the pace during parts of the match on Wednesday. Plenty to ponder: Daniel Vallverdu and Amelie Mauresmo watch on as Andy Murray crashes out. Support: Andy Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears was in attendance and roaring her man on. By the time the tiebreak came around they had won 45 points each, but Murray could not recover from a dismal start - he hit a double fault followed by a pedestrian 77 mph second serve that got the full treatment. The tiebreak was over in a blink of an eye, with the Serb taking it 7-1, and Djokovic looked to be in full control when a run of 12 out of 14 points saw him go 3-1 up, with Murray's net play notably more hesitant than in previous rounds. But again Murray’s superb returns meant he was not finished and after breaking back for 4-4 - the top seed rightly being given a time violation - he forced a set point at 6-5. But he could not get enough on the return, was forced back and his attempted lob was put away. The tiebreak was the inverse of the first, Murray far more purposeful and Djokovic ended up slapping errors in frustration by the end as he went down 7-1. Eyes on the prize: but Andy Murray ultimately fell short and crashed out of the tournament. Hand it to him: Novak Djokovic gestures to the umpire as a point goes against him. Full crowd: The Arthur Ashe stadium was nearly full as spectators stayed up for the main game. While there were frequent mistakes on both sides, Djokovic stayed strong to stem any momentum and broke for 3-1 in the third before holding off two break points when his opponent pulled the trigger too early in draining exchanges. There was a devil-may-care attitude about Murray for the rest of the set as he focussed on energy conservation. Murray began this tournament cramping against Robin Haase and ended it in a similar state, his body creaking at the end as he sought to hold in the fourth. He had a break point at the start but the body language sagged and he could not seriously threaten after that. The break of serve to seal it came entirely on cue.

Djokovic, who now faces Kei Nishikori, is expected to win the tournament. Even though he made many unforced errors, he managed to seize control in seven service games. He was not threatened after winning the second tie break. 6. The article suggests that Andy Murray can however feel, that he has created something to build upon. His forehand was particularly potent and he managed to stay in the match against the world's top-seeded player, which could hold potential for his future games.  7. In 2012, Murray and Djokovic faced each other in the final of the same tournament, but this time, they met in the last eight due to Murray's lower seed.

Summarize this article: Attach the yarn to your hook using a slip knot, then work a foundation of chain stitches in multiples of 10.  In other words, the foundation chain can consist of 10 chains, 20 chains, 30 chains, 40 chains, 50 chains, etc. The length of your foundation chain will be the final length of your project. At the end of your foundation chain, work two more chain stitches to serve as a turning chain for your next row. Half double crochet once into the second chain from your hook. When counting chains, do not count the loop currently on your hook. To create the first shell of your first official row, you will need to work a series of treble crochets and half double crochets.  Skip four chains in your foundation. Work nine treble crochets into the fifth chain. Skip another four chains in your foundation. Half double crochet once into the next chain. Repeat the previous step across the full length of your foundation, stopping only once you reach the end of the row.  This completes the first official row. If desired, you can change yarn colors after the end of your first row. Doing so is not necessary, though. Chain three, then work one treble crochet into the front posts of each of the next four stitches. Keep the last loop of each treble crochet on the hook.  After the last treble crochet, yarn over the hook and pull the yarn-over through all the loops on the hook. Chain four again. Work one half double crochet into the next stitch in the previous row. Work a series of treble clusters, chains, and half double crochets across the entire second row, stopping before you work the last five stitches. For each group:  Chain four. Work a front post treble crochet into each of the next four stitches, leaving the last loop on the hook after each one. Half double crochet once, then work another four treble crochets across the next four stitches. Leave the last loop on the hook after each stitch, then yarn over and pull it through the all the loops on your hook after the final stitch. This counts as a nine-stitch shell cluster. Chain four. Work one half double crochet into the front post of the next stitch. Chain four, then work a treble crochet into the front posts of each of the final five stitches in the row, keeping the last loop on the hook for each one.  Yarn over and pull through all the loops after completing the last one. This completes the row. Chain four, then turn the work over. Work four treble crochets into the top of the first cluster, then half double crochet once into the next half double crochet.  Create connecting shells across the entire row, stopping just before the last cluster. For each connecting shell:  Work nine treble crochets into the center of the next cluster. Half double crochet into the next half double crochet.   For the final cluster of the row, work five treble crochets into the top of the cluster. You can change colors at the end of this row or keep going with the color you currently have. At the end of this row, you should also chain one and turn the work over. Work one half double crochet into the first stitch, then work a series of nine-stitch cluster shells across the rest of the row until you reach the end and finish the row.  For each group:  Chain four. Work a nine-stitch shell cluster over the next nine stitches, following the same procedure used to make the nine-stitch shell clusters in your second row. Chain four. Work one half double crochet into the next stitch.   At the very end of the row, chain one and turn the work over. At the start of the fifth row, half double crochet into the first half double crochet stitch. Work across the rest of the row using a series of treble crochets and half double crochets.  For each connecting shell:  Work nine treble crochets into the center of the first cluster. Half double crochet into the next half double crochet.   Continue until you reach the end of the row. If desired, change colors at the end of this row. You've completed a full set of Bavarian crochet at this point. Repeat rows two, three, four, and five until the project reaches your desired width. If you're changing colors, do so at the end of each odd numbered row. When your project is finished, cut the yarn, leaving a tail 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) long. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off and finish the work. Weave the secured tail into the back of the work to hide it. Summary:","output":"To create a Bavarian crochet project, start with a foundation chain in multiples of 10 and add two chains for the turning chain. Begin the first row by working a series of treble and half double crochets, followed by alternating rows of treble clusters, chains, and half double crochets. After completing a full set of rows, repeat the pattern until desired width is achieved. Change yarn colors at the end of odd numbered rows, if desired. Finally, cut the yarn, pull it through the loop on the hook, and weave the tail into the back of the work to finish."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As clerk to President Circle, B Square wants to warn his big brother to stay home that afternoon while there is a meeting at the Senate of the Great Southern Republic of Flatland.The Senate session has been called to discuss the increasing hostilities between the Chromatist movement and the government. Senator Chromatistes is the irregular polygon who leads this rebellious movement that wants to legalize the right of Flatlanders to color their sides as they see fit. Traditionally a taboo practice, the laws were previously relaxed somewhat which emboldened the Chromatists to demand legalization against the will of the majority. The Great Southern Republic distinguishes itself from its enemy, the Northern Kingdom, by its stances on Chromatism and Irregulars along with a democratic government. Relaxing the laws has already been perceived as weakness by the Northern Kingdom who are massing on the borders.Unable to heed his brothers advice, A Square meets with his new client, the first female charged as a Chromatist and on his way home finds himself embroiled in the melee issuing forth from the Senate. President Circles soldiers have assassinated Senator Chromatistes along with his supporters thus sparking a riot that has spilled into the streets of the city. A Square barely makes it home safely where he then barricades his family against the chaos for the night.Once asleep, though, A Square has an unusual dream in which he visits a one dimensional world, Lineland, and attempts to convince the realm's ignorant king of a second dimension. A Square finds it essentially impossible to make the King of Lineland see outside of his eternally straight line. After waking...

The answer to the question: What are the three names of the Daoist fouder? is inside the article: The Li family belonged to the northwest military aristocracy prevalent during the Sui dynasty and claimed to be paternally descended from the Daoist founder, Laozi (whose personal name was Li Dan or Li Er) the Han dynasty General Li Guang and Western Liang ruler Li Gao.  This family was known as the Longxi Li lineage (Li lineage; 隴西李氏), which includes the Tang poet Li Bai.  The Tang Emperors also had Xianbei maternal ancestry, from Emperor Gaozu of Tang's Xianbei mother, Duchess Dugu. Li Yuan was Duke of Tang and governor of Taiyuan, modern Shanxi, during the Sui dynasty's collapse, which was caused in part by the Sui failure to conquer the northern part of the Korean peninsula during the Goguryeo–Sui War. He had prestige and military experience, and was a first cousin of Emperor Yang of Sui (their mothers were sisters). Li Yuan rose in rebellion in 617, along with his son and his equally militant daughter Princess Pingyang (d. 623), who raised and commanded her own troops. In winter 617, Li Yuan occupied Chang'an, relegated Emperor Yang to the position of Taishang Huang or retired emperor, and acted as regent to the puppet child-emperor, Yang You. On the news of Emperor Yang's murder by General Yuwen Huaji on June 18, 618, Li Yuan declared himself the emperor of a new dynasty, the Tang.Li Yuan, known as Emperor Gaozu of Tang, ruled until 626, when he was forcefully deposed by his son Li Shimin, the Prince of Qin.

Fighting a numerically superior army, he defeated Dou Jiande (573–621) at Luoyang in the Battle of Hulao on May 28, 621.  In a violent elimination of royal family due to fear of assassination, Li Shimin ambushed and killed two of his brothers, Li Yuanji (b. 603) and Crown prince Li Jiancheng (b. 589), in the Xuanwu Gate Incident on July 2, 626.

Premise: \\"Annual investment is the full cost of the investment.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Annual investment is not equivalent to the cost of the investment.\\" true?","output":"Based on the provided premise, \\"Annual investment is the full cost of the investment,\\" the hypothesis \\"Annual investment is not equivalent to the cost of the investment\\" appears to be false. Before explaining further, it is crucial to define and understand the terms 'annual investment' and 'cost of investment.' Annual investment refers to the total amount of money an investor puts into a particular investment or investment portfolio over a one-year period. This could include contributions to retirement accounts, selecting individual stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, or more broadly towards any investment that the investor has committed to grow and develop with their funds over time.  On the other hand, the cost of investment refers to the overall financial outlay required in acquiring an asset or taking part in a specific investment endeavor. This could include, but is not limited to, the purchase price, transaction charges, taxes, and any additional expenses incurred while acquiring the asset or managing the investment. Based on the premise, which equates annual investment to the full cost of the investment, there is a direct correlation between the two terms. This means that when we refer to one, we are essentially speaking about the other, as they are indicated to share an identical value. Therefore, if we accept the premise as true, the hypothesis \\"annual investment is not equivalent to the cost of the investment\\" would be false. The premise suggests that, at least within the context provided, annual investment and cost of investment are considered equal, so any hypothesis stating otherwise would contradict the original statement. However, it is important to note that, in practice, the cost of an investment and the money an investor contributes annually to their investments may not always be equivalent. Investments can have varying upfront costs or ongoing expenses that might not be included in the annual investment but will impact the overall cost of the investment. In such cases, it could be argued that the hypothesis holds some truth. That said, the conclusion we draw within the context of this specific premise remains unchanged: the hypothesis \\"annual investment is not equivalent to the cost of the investment\\" is considered to be false when based on the provided statement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Heat supplies the energy that causes motion. The deeper you go into toward the Earths core, the hotter it gets. At the core it is really hot. All that heat tries to rise toward the surface.

News article: About New York - James Webb Telescope Takes Baby Pictures of Universe - NYTimes.com Richard Perry/The New York Times A model of the James Webb Space Telescope, on display at Battery Park; the actual telescope will allow us to see much closer to the beginning of time. Here was a model for the next great time machine, just over John Grunsfeld’s shoulder in a field in Battery Park: a giant telescope that will be launched in 2014 and sent one million miles from Earth. By looking deep into space, it will collect light and images that have been traveling since nearly the beginning of the universe, and send them back here. Dr. Grunsfeld, trim and compact at 51, has floated in space for hours at a time, miles above the Earth, fixing the Hubble Space Telescope. At one time, the mirrors on the Hubble were not working properly, and it was thought to be the world’s highest and most expensive lemon. Instead, when Dr. Grunsfeld and his colleagues finished their repairs, it was able to take pictures from billions of years ago. Scientific theories about the dawn of the universe and early galaxies had to give way to actual data from the Hubble. Its successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, will be 80 feet long, 37 feet wide and 40 feet high. The designers say it will be powerful enough to reveal the details on a penny at a distance of 24 miles. Light from the moon takes less than two seconds to reach Earth, 8.5 minutes from the sun and 55,000 years from close galaxies. “Instead of looking at toddler pictures of the universe, we will be able to look at baby pictures,” Dr. Grunsfeld said. “The Hubble has seen back 13 billion years, into galaxies 600 or 700 million years after the Big Bang. Hopefully, the Webb will get us back to 200 million years after the Bang.” The Webb model will be on view in Battery Park until Sunday, as part of the city’s World Science Festival. Other than throwing ticker-tape parades for astronauts and graduating smart kids from schools that specialize in science, the city rarely has much direct contact with the American space program. On Friday night, Dr. Grunsfeld, who retired as NASA’s chief scientist at the beginning of the year, and other astronomers will set up 100 telescopes in Battery Park for star gazing. “Saturn should be up” then, he said. “Saturn is a huge favorite of mine.” In its current state, the Webb model is not an especially graceful-looking structure, and it is hard to imagine how it will be able to travel a million miles. The bottom of it consists of a sun shade, an umbrella about the size of a tennis court. “The umbrella will be closed up until it’s finished traveling,” Dr. Grunsfeld said. “Then it will open up like origami.” The purpose of the sun shield is to keep the telescope cool; it will operate at 40 degrees Kelvin, or nearly minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit, Dr. Grunsfeld said. By way of comparison to suntan lotion, the umbrella will provide a sun protection factor of 1.2 million. “All the instruments together will use about the same amount of electricity as a hair dryer, and that will come from solar power,” said Blake Bullock, a manager at Northrop Grumman, the principal contractor building the telescope for NASA. “Once it is out there, you will have these photons that have been traveling for 12 billion years without hitting anything until they run into” the Webb telescope. Stars formed out of helium and hydrogen; nuclear fusion got turned on and created carbon and other elements; many explosions later, organic chemistry, life and humans came along. “We have zinc in our vitamins,” Dr. Grunsfeld said. “Why zinc? It comes from the supernova explosions. To account for what we’re made of, you have to have three supernova explosions.” THE power of the telescope is that it can answer the deepest questions about how things came to be. “We don’t know why the Big Bang happened,” Dr. Grunsfeld said. “In my job, I think about what happened right after that. But look at this: furry mammals on Earth can build a telescope that can look back to the beginning of time.” A couple of hundred students gathered to look at the Webb model on Tuesday morning. Brian Greene, a physicist and author who is one of the organizers of the festival, asked those in the audience how many of them believed that there was life out there, beyond the Earth. A good majority of the crowd, students, teachers, scientists, raised their hands. Then Dr. Grunsfeld stood. How many, he wanted to know, believed that aliens from out there were walking the Earth. This time, only a few raised their hands. “If there are aliens, they’ll be here in New York,” Dr. Grunsfeld said.

Perseus tries to save his family, but to no avail.The surviving soldiers take Perseus back to Argos. During a feast for the returning soldiers King Kepheus (Vincent Regan) and Queen Cassiopeia (Polly Walker and Katherine Loeppky) of Argos compare themselves and their daughter, Andromeda (Alexa Davalos), to the gods, much to their daughter's dismay. After convincing his brother to let him loose on humanity to punish Argos for its hubris, Hades appears in the courtroom before killing the remaining soldiers while Perseus is unaffected. Revealing Perseus to be the demigod son of Zeus, and aging Cassiopeia to death, Hades threatens that if Princess Andromeda is not sacrificed to the Kraken, Argos will be destroyed in 10 days. Hermes (Alexander Siddig), the messenger god, approaches Zeus on Olympus, revealing the location of his son Perseus. Hermes suggests offering Perseus sanctuary, but Zeus declares that he...

It is the first theatrical release in the Pokémon franchise.It was released in Japan on July 18, 1998. The English-language adaptation, produced by 4Kids Entertainment and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures (under its Kids' WB banner), was released in North America on November 12, 1999.The film primarily consists of three segments: Pikachu's Vacation, a 21-minute feature focusing on the series mascot Pikachu; Origin of Mewtwo, a 10-minute featurette that functions as a prologue to the main feature; and Mewtwo Strikes Back, the main 75 minute film feature. The North American version omitted Origin of Mewtwo from the package before its U.S. theatrical run due to its dark nature, as the target MPAA rating was G; the first two minutes were restored in the film's release on VHS and DVD as The Story of Mewtwo's Origin. The featurette was eventually dubbed and restored as a special feature in the U.S. release of the direct-to-video follow-up film sequel Pokémon: Mewtwo Returns as The Uncut Story of Mewtwo's Origin.As Pokémon was extremely popular when the film was released, it was a box office success worldwide.

Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: John's preferred plan involved using Poitou as a base of operations for his strategic movements. With this starting point, he aimed to advance up the Loire valley toward Paris, which would force the French forces to confront him, disrupting their coordinated efforts. By doing so, John hoped to break Philip Augustus's internal lines of communication, undermining the unity and effectiveness of the French forces. Additionally, John planned to deploy a maritime force to the Duchy - an area under his control - to provide further pressure on the French forces from another direction. This multi-pronged approach was John's preferred strategy, as it would create multiple threats for the French to deal with simultaneously, making it more difficult for Philip Augustus to maintain control over his forces and territory. In summary, John's preferred plan aimed to create a powerful offensive strategy by threatening Paris from the Loire valley, disrupting internal French communication, and establishing a maritime force in the Duchy.

Article: There are various aspects that go into making a successful school, and success can be measured in various ways. Often, the teachers are praised for a school's success and blamed for its failure. Yet, in order for a school to be effective, it must be a place where teaching and learning can easily take place, and that requires the hard work of more than just educators. Students must take learning into their own hands and feel as if what they are doing is as important as it actually is. This can only be done with the cooperation of every adult that is involved in the students' life. Some of these individuals often go unnoticed, yet the role they play in the students' lives is immeasurable. In the school, administrative assistants greet students at the start of the day and answer a large quantity of questions. When an assistant remembers a student's name or even something special about that student, it communicates to him that he is cared for. The assistant can also give that extra encouragement for a student to make better choices, especially when they are visiting the principal's office. Meanwhile, though cafeteria workers have a short space of time to interact with students, they can make a big difference as well. Beyond meeting nutritional needs, cafeteria workers may also on occasion meet the emotional needs of the students they serve. Students benefit from positive interaction with adults, and cafeteria workers may give that extra bit of encouragement that a child needs. Custodians   are usually underappreciated for what they offer to schools. They have to be knowledgeable about everything from cleaning to fixing the most intricate   tools. They get to school early in the morning before teachers arrive and lock up late at night after the last student has left from the after-school event. They also make sure teachers are equipped with the necessary items and prepare the rooms so that they are ready for learning. A great custodian also gives that kind word or extra smile to that student who needs it most. Question: Which of the following is TRUE about cafeteria workers? Options: A: It's enough for them to cook for the students. B: It's hard for them to interact with the students. C: They have the most interaction with students at school. D: They can also meet the emotional needs of the students. Answer:","output":"D: They can also meet the emotional needs of the students."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Analyzing the question: We need to find out which option can be used to write with a steel pen.  2. Eliminating irrelevant options: Here, we will eliminate options that have no direct connection to writing with a steel pen:    - Warehouse: A storage space, not related to the writing process.    - Desk drawer: A storage area in the desk, not involved in actual writing.    - Veterinary office: A medical facility for animals, unrelated to writing with a steel pen. 3. Comparing the remaining options: We are left with \\"arm\\" and \\"hand\\". While both arm and hand are parts of the human body, let's analyze their roles:    - Arm: Functions to support and provide a wide range of motion, helps in holding writing instruments, but doesn't have the fine motor skills needed for writing.    - Hand: Contains fingers which provide the necessary precision and control for holding and maneuvering a steel pen while writing. 4. Finalizing the answer: Considering the analysis, the most logical option would be the \\"hand\\" as it possesses the motor skills and dexterity needed to write with a steel pen.

Students are often overwhelmed by the vast amount of information available, leading to decreased retention and poor academic performance. By harnessing the power of active learning, one can elevate their learning experience, leading to increased confidence, profound subject knowledge, and better academic outcomes. In this article, we outline key steps that can transform your learning by fostering active engagement with classroom material and incorporating alternative learning methods in and out of the school environment. 1. Listen Attentively and Clear Your Mind The first step towards effective learning is honing your listening skills. Begin by clearing your mind and focusing solely on the teacher. Distracting thoughts and background noises can impede comprehension, making it challenging to absorb the material being presented. Actively engage in the learning process, maintaining an open and receptive mind as the teacher delivers information. By concentrating on the content, you will create a more attentive learning environment and experience deeper understanding of the subject matter. 2. Ask Questions Proactively The quest to obtain knowledge is fueled by curiosity. Ask questions when you have them, and do not hesitate to request clarification when you feel confused or unsure. By engaging with the teacher in this manner, you not only demonstrate your eagerness to learn, but you also form connections that aid in retention and understanding of the material. In addition, asking questions can facilitate a more collaborative learning environment, inviting others to share insights and fostering a collective growth mindset. 3. Dedicate Time to Learning Outside of the Classroom Although school plays a pivotal role in the acquisition of knowledge, it is essential to put in the hours outside of the classroom to truly grasp the concepts being taught. Allocate ample time each day to studying the subject matter, revisiting difficult concepts, and practicing skills that may require additional attention. By doing so, you reinforce the information acquired in school, allowing it to become more deeply ingrained in your memory. 4. Read Extensively and Diversify Your Reading Material Reading is a cornerstone of learning, as it enhances comprehension, expands vocabulary, and improves critical thinking skills. Delve into a variety of reading materials, ranging from textbooks and academic journals to novels and news articles. This practice will broaden your intellectual horizons and stimulate a myriad of ideas that can be applied to your studies. In addition, exposing yourself to new concepts and different perspectives will enrich your understanding of various subject matters and help you make interdisciplinary connections. 5. Speak Up with Confidence Voicing your opinion, asking questions, and engaging in discussions during class benefit both you and your peers. By speaking up, you show confidence in your knowledge and create a more dynamic learning environment. Articulating your thoughts allows you to better comprehend the material, receive valuable feedback, and identify areas that may require further exploration. Moreover, engaging in discussions with others often leads to collaborative insights and the exploration of new ideas. 6. Enhance Your Thinking Skills by Problem-Solving Developing your problem-solving skills is essential for effective learning, as it allows you to confront challenges and adapt to new situations with confidence. Actively seek out opportunities outside of school to practice your problem-solving abilities, such as participating in extracurricular activities, joining clubs, or pursuing personal interests. These experiences will not only hone your critical thinking skills but also ignite your creativity and curiosity, making you a more well-rounded and adaptive learner. Conclusion Active learning is a powerful tool that can dramatically transform your educational experience. By incorporating the strategies outlined in this article, you can deepen your understanding of various subjects, boost your confidence, and improve your academic performance. Remember, learning is a life-long journey, and by taking the initiative to engage actively with your education, you empower yourself to achieve personal growth and academic success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Austin gave candy to people around him at school because he got too much at his birthday.  Given the context: How would Others feel as a result? Available options: - appreciated his generosity; - offended and disgusted; - mad at Austin; A:","output":"When considering the situation that Austin has too much candy from his birthday and decides to give some to people around him at school, the most likely reaction of others would be to appreciate his generosity. Step 1: Understanding the context In this situation, Austin has received an excess of candy at his birthday and wants to share it with others at school. Sharing something with others, especially treats like candy, is usually seen as a kind gesture. Step 2: Evaluating each option Option 1: appreciated his generosity This option is highly plausible, as sharing and giving away something one has in abundance is often seen as a generous act. People would likely be thankful for Austin's willingness to share his candy with them. Option 2: offended and disgusted Offense and disgust are strong negative reactions. Given the context, there is limited reason for people to feel this way. Austin is giving away candy – which is a treat that most people enjoy – and sharing it with others. There doesn't appear to be any reason for people to feel offended or disgusted in this case. Option 3: mad at Austin Considering the context, there is no obvious reason for people to be mad at Austin for sharing his candy. He received too much candy as a gift for his birthday and decided to share it with others. It is a kind and generous act that should not trigger anger in others. Step 3: Select the most plausible option Based on the context and evaluating each option, the most likely reaction others would have to Austin's actions is to appreciate his generosity. Sharing treats like candy is generally seen as a kind and considerate act, and people around him would likely feel grateful for his thoughtfulness."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the album on which Glyn Johns was given \\"free rein,\\" as the band had \\"all but washed their hands of the entire project\\"? from the following article ?  Although Let It Be was the Beatles' final album release, it was largely recorded before Abbey Road. The project's impetus came from an idea Martin attributes to McCartney, who suggested they \\"record an album of new material and rehearse it, then perform it before a live audience for the very first time – on record and on film\\". Originally intended for a one-hour television programme to be called Beatles at Work, in the event much of the album's content came from studio work beginning in January 1969, many hours of which were captured on film by director Michael Lindsay-Hogg. Martin has said that the project was \\"not at all a happy recording experience. It was a time when relations between the Beatles were at their lowest ebb.\\" Lennon described the largely impromptu sessions as \\"hell ... the most miserable ... on Earth\\", and Harrison, \\"the low of all-time\\". Irritated by both McCartney and Lennon, Harrison walked out for five days. Upon returning, he threatened to leave the band unless they \\"abandon[ed] all talk of live performance\\" and instead focused on finishing a new album, initially titled Get Back, using songs recorded for the TV special. He also demanded they cease work at Twickenham Film Studios, where the sessions had begun, and relocate to the newly finished Apple Studio. The other band members agreed, and the idea came about to salvage the footage shot for the TV production for use in a feature film. In an effort to alleviate tensions within the band and improve the quality of their live sound, Harrison invited keyboardist Billy Preston to participate in the last nine days of sessions. Preston received label billing on the \\"Get Back\\" single – the only musician ever to receive that acknowledgment on an official Beatles release.

Article: Bill Javis took over our village news-agency at a time of life when most of us only want to relax. He just thought he would like something but not too much to do, and the news-agency was ready-made. The business produced little enough for him, but Bill was a man who only wanted the simplicity and order and regularity of the job. He had been a long-serving sailor, and all his life had done everything by the clock. Every day he opened his shop at six a.m. to catch the early trade; the papers arrived on his door-step before that. Many of Bill's customers were city workers, and the shop was convenient for the station. Business was _ by 10 o'clock, so at eleven sharp Bill closed for lunch. It was hard luck on anybody who wanted a paper or magazine in the afternoon, for most likely Bill would be down on the river bank, fishing, and his nearest competitor was five kilometers away. Sometime in the afternoon, the evening paper landed on the doormat, and at 4 o'clock Bill reopened. The evening rush lasted till seven, and it was worthwhile. He lived in a flat above the shop, alone. Except in the very bad weather, you always knew where to find him in the afternoon, as I have said. Once, on a sunny afternoon, I walked home along the river bank from a shopping trip to the village. By my watch it was three minutes past four, so I was astonished to see Bill sitting there on his little chair with a line in the water.

He wants to improve the terrible traffic problems in the city. At first, 40 to 60 bikes will be available only to city workers. People will give their old bikes to the city to use in the program. If this program is successful, one day more than 1000 bicycles will be available. Everyone, not just city workers, will be able to use these bicycles. People in Fresno,Californiaalready have a free bicycle program. In fact, this idea began inAmsterdamover 40 years ago. These programs encourage citizens to get out of their cars and onto pollution-free bikes. Fresno's Yellow Bike Program puts about fast bicycles around the city. The bikes are painted bright yellow so people know they can take them. When people take a yellow bike, they can ride to work or to shopping areas, and then leave the bike for the next rider. Some people worry that the free bikes will be stolen. However, theft hasn't been a problem in other free-bike cities.

Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death. At about twelve o'clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand, opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze. He hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again. A half hour later, at a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man's feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his...

When a local petty gambler, \\"Click\\" Dade, begins to prey on her students, she takes a leading position in an attempt to force the gambling location to close down. Dade had been one of her former pupils. Her efforts are opposed by two local politicians, Holland and Joseph Killaine. Holland is a small time political boss, while Killaine is the superintendent of schools. So Bayles decides to fight fire with fire. With a stake of 250, and a pair of Dade's own loaded dice, she wins enough money to open a club to compete with Dade's, taking away his business. However, after an incident in which Killaine's daughter, Gerry, causes a fight at Bayles' club, causing the club's closure. Killaine then presses his advantage, demanding that Bayles also resign as principal, which will make her ineligible for a pension, being two years short of retirement.  Upon hearing of her fate, Gerry goes to Bayles to apologize for her actions, and their end result. An apology which Bayles accepts.

The key subjects (the cow) and actions (standing in a field) are consistent across the sentences, making their meanings predominantly alike.

Article: So long as teachers fail to distinguish between teaching and learning, they will continue to undertake to do for children what only children can do for themselves. Teaching children to read is not passing reading on to them. It is certainly not endless hours spent in activities about reading. Douglas insists that \\"reading cannot be taught directly and schools should stop trying to do the impossible.\\"      Teaching and learning are two entirely different processes. They differ in kind and function. The function of teaching is to create the conditions and the climate that will make it possible for children to devise the most efficient system for teaching themselves to read. Teaching is also a public activity. It can be seen and observed.      Learning to read involves all that each individual does to make sense of the world of printed language. Almost all of it is private, for learning is an occupation of the mind, and that process is not open to public scrutiny.      If teacher and learner roles are not interchangeable, what then can be done through teaching that will aid the child in the quest   for knowledge? Smith has one principal rule for all teaching instructions. \\"Make learning to read easy, which means making reading a meaningful, enjoyable and frequent experience for children.\\"      When the roles of teacher and learner are seen for what they are, and when both teachers and learners fulfill them appropriately, then much of the pressure and feeling of failure for both is eliminated.

McCain wants review on defense work by retired brass By Ken Dilanian and Tom Vanden Brook, USA TODAY WASHINGTON  The Pentagon should rewrite ethics rules for retired generals who work as advisers for the military while representing defense contractors, Arizona Sen. and other lawmakers said Wednesday. \\"The important thing is that they avoid the appearance of conflict,\\" McCain, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in an interview. McCain was among several members of Congress who called for changes in the wake of a USA TODAY investigation published Wednesday. The newspaper found that many retired officers collect their annual pensions, work for defense firms and draw government consulting fees as \\"senior mentors\\" to the military services. Of the 158 retired generals and admirals identified as senior mentors, 80% had financial ties to defense contractors, including 29 who were full-time executives of defense companies. Hired as independent contractors, the retired officers working as mentors are not subject to the ethics rules that would apply if they were brought in as part-time federal employees. Nor do they have to disclose, to the military or the public, their ties to defense contractors. A spokesman for Marine Corps Commandant James Conway said in a statement that the program offers a high return for a modest investment. \\"We are comfortable that a clear line separates the work our mentors do for us and any outside corporate interests they might have, and to assume otherwise is unfair,\\" Maj. David Nevers said. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and the Air Force, Army and Navy declined to comment on USA TODAY's findings or the reaction from Congress. Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., who chairs the House subcommittee that writes the defense budget, called for Pentagon officials to explain the mentor programs. \\"The committee was not aware of this program, and we have told the Defense Department to immediately provide us with the justification and criteria for this kind of work,\\" Murtha said in a statement. McCain said he would prohibit officers from mentoring at war games that deal with weapons systems or other issues of interest to the defense companies that pay them. Mentors should also have to disclose their financial ties to defense contractors, McCain said. \\"I'm sure most of them would have no problem with that,\\" he said. Two Democrats on the same panel, Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Jim Webb of Virginia, agreed. \\"There have to be some disclosure rules about potential conflict,\\" said Reed, a former Army Ranger.

Question: suppose the star has less hydrogen happens, how will it affect the star is larger.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"To answer the question, let's break down the steps and consider how the amount of hydrogen might affect the star's size. 1. A star burns in space - A star with less hydrogen will have less fuel to burn, which can have an impact on its overall size. 2. Eventually, it burns all its hydrogen - If the star has less hydrogen, it will burn through its fuel more quickly, potentially shortening its overall lifespan. 3. Becomes a red giant - A red giant forms due to the fusion of helium in the core, causing the outer layers to expand. If a star has less hydrogen, it may have a smaller core and thus may expand less when it becomes a red giant, making it smaller. 4. Once the red giant burns itself out - The outer layers will eventually disperse, but a star with less hydrogen may burn itself out more quickly, again affecting its overall size. 5. The core of the star collapses - A star's core is primarily composed of the remaining hydrogen and other elements. With less hydrogen, the core may be less massive and thus collapse to a smaller size. 6. The gasses will start to disperse - With less hydrogen to feed the red giant phase, there may be less gas to disperse when the star's core collapses. 7. Only the core is left - A white dwarf has been formed. A white dwarf forms from the remaining core of a star after it has dispersed its outer layers. With less hydrogen and a smaller core, the resulting white dwarf will likely be smaller than if the star had started with more hydrogen.

Although it's challenging to pinpoint exact dates due to the gradual nature of cultural shifts and historical events, most historians agree that the Viking Age began around 793 AD with the raid on the Lindisfarne monastery in northern England and concluded around 1066 AD with the Battle of Stamford Bridge in England and the Norman Conquest led by William the Conqueror. The Vikings, hailing predominantly from present-day Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, were renowned for their expertise in seafaring and navigation. This skill allowed them to travel, explore, and establish settlements throughout numerous regions, including the British Isles, Iceland, Greenland, Russia, and parts of the European mainland. Their advances in shipbuilding and their iconic longships contributed significantly to their success as conquerors, traders, and explorers. Throughout the Viking Age, these fierce warriors engaged in various activities, including raids, conquests, and trade with other cultures. The Vikings were known for their proficiency in battle, employing both superior tactics and advanced weapons and armor. Their aggressive approach and fearsome reputation led to widespread influence, as they significantly impacted the political and cultural landscape of the territories they encountered, and their influence can still be felt today. In addition to their warrior reputation, the Vikings were also skilled traders. Their trade networks spanned as far east as the Byzantine Empire, the Islamic Caliphate, and even reached North America (where they established a short-lived settlement in present-day Newfoundland). Their trade activities fostered cultural exchange and the sharing of ideas, which played a vital role in shaping medieval Europe. The gradual end of the Viking Age was due to several factors. Firstly, their sheer success led to Viking communities becoming more settled and less focused on raiding and conquest, as they became integrated into the societies they had once attacked. Secondly, Christianity played a significant role in shifting the Viking's traditional cultural values and motivations. Christian conversion from their native pagan beliefs contributed significantly to a more unified and pacified society, leading to the decline of their warrior culture. Moreover, military and political pressure from neighboring states grew as they began to organize themselves and develop defensive measures against Viking attacks, making it increasingly challenging for the Vikings to continue their raids and conquests. Finally, the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 by William the Conqueror, a descendant of Viking ancestors, marked the end of an era and marked the transition into the next phase of European history. In conclusion, the Viking Age started around 793 AD with the raid on Lindisfarne and lasted until around 1066 AD, ending with the Battle of Stamford Bridge and the Norman Conquest. This remarkable period in history is characterized by the Vikings' incredible feats in exploration, conquests, and cultural influences that continue to shape and inspire modern society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This Burke did in April 1791 when he published A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed \\"a considerable insight into human nature\\" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–7 Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau \\"entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but vanity\\"—which he \\"was possessed to a degree little short of madness\\". He also cited Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau had a life of \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" that was not \\"chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action\\". Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: \\"a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred\\".\\"?

Nelson smelled much cleaner and fresher than Samuel did although  Choices: [a]. Nelson had taken a better shower.; [b]. Samuel had taken a better shower.;","output":"[b]. Samuel had taken a better shower. In the quaint little town of Oaksworth, best friends Nelson and Samuel lived side by side. Despite being close friends, they had several different habits and interests that made their friendship unique. One such difference was their daily showers. Nelson smelled much cleaner and fresher than Samuel did, although Samuel had taken a better shower. Samuel never missed his morning and evening showers, and on some days, even had an additional one right after playing soccer with his friends. He used fragrant soaps and shampoos to ensure he smelled absolutely fresh and clean. His mother had instilled this habit in him from a young age, and now, as a teenager, Samuel took pride in his hygiene routine. Nelson, on the other hand, wasn't so fond of long showers. A bit more laid back in his demeanor, he was content with a quick wash in the morning. His showers barely lasted five minutes, compared to Samuel's 20-minute extravaganzas. Nelson did not see the point of elaborate shower routines and considered them a waste of time, much to Samuel's dismay. But as fate would have it, Nelson had a naturally subtle and fresh scent that people liked. His family lineage might have been the reason — genetics blessed him with fewer problems related to sweating and body odor. So, even after an intense workout, Nelson's sweat would evaporate quickly, leaving behind a subtle scent that people found somewhat comforting. Samuel, however, had no such luck in the olfactory department. Despite his immaculate showering habits, he struggled with perspiration throughout the day. He had tried different antiperspirants and deodorants but to no avail — his body swiftly broke them down, leaving behind only a faint trace of the earlier fragrant spray. It puzzled Samuel how Nelson managed to smell better than him, seemingly without any effort. It also frustrated Samuel, who thought it unfair that he invested so much time and effort into maintaining his hygiene, only to have Nelson waltz through life without a care and still smell fresher. One day, after playing soccer in the local park, Samuel finally decided to confront Nelson about it. As they sat down on a park bench, their faces both flushed from the vigorous game, Samuel tentatively broached the subject. \\"Nelson, don't think I'm being weird or anything,\\" Samuel started uncomfortably, \\"but you always smell surprisingly fresh, even after working up a sweat like now. Do you have any secrets I should know about?\\" Nelson chuckled and revealed the truth about his lack of extensive hygiene routine and how luck seemed to side with him. Both friends laughed over the absurdity of the situation. Nelson then empathetically lent Samuel his unconditional support to find a more tailored solution to help maintain Samuel's fresh scent all day long. The two began researching extensively about skin types, fragrances, and other factors that influence body odor. They spent countless hours on online forums and speaking to dermatologists, ultimately leading to Samuel's discovery of a milder but more effective antiperspirant. The pair learned that it was not just about shower lengths or soap brands, but the understanding of one's individual body chemistry and finding the most suitable products and routines accordingly. In the end, both Nelson and Samuel embraced their differences and continued cherishing their friendship. With the help of his friend, Samuel ultimately found the balance that worked best for him. The whole endeavor served as a testament to their bond — a friendship that celebrated their differences and flourished through understanding and support."},{"instruction":"Two neighboring dairy farms produced milk for half the state.

The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, 1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.During the 1930s, parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practice. This period was known as the Dust Bowl, throughout which areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall, strong winds, and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl. Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.In 1995, Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001.

Hint: Higher pressures increase the solubility of gases. You are probably familiar with this concept as it relates to carbonated beverages. Before opening the container, the inside is pressurized, so a large amount of CO 2 is dissolved in the liquid.

Andrew Foster, 32, and his wife Lucy, 28, were hit by more than 1,000 tons of rock as they prepared for a climb at the end of a three-week trip to the Californian park.            The couple, from Cardiff, are believed to have been scouting the route on the El Capitan rock face when a “sheet” of granite measuring 40m by 20m fell from a height of about 200m on Wednesday.      Andrew was killed instantly while his wife was rescued and airlifted to hospital where she is understood to be in a critical condition.      The couple, who met at Cardiff University, shared a passion for outdoor adventures, and had climbed some of the most difficult rock faces in the UK. They had told friends it was their “big dream” to test themselves in the Yosemite national park. The trip was, reportedly, planned as part of their first wedding anniversary celebrations.            They flew to the US on 11 September with friends who were also experienced climbers, and had blogged about their preparations and training for the adventure.            Andrew, originally from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, who worked as a sales rep for the outdoor clothing and gear company Patagonia, was pictured on Instagram in the national park looking exhausted but smiling on the day before the tragedy.      He and his wife, originally from Market Drayton, Shropshire, were also keen skiers, and he proposed in the French Alps in March 2015. They married in a yurt in August 2016.            On their blog, Cam and Bear, they wrote: “We are a young married couple who enjoy nothing more than getting out and having adventures in the mountains together. We are not extreme athletes and describe ourselves simply as passionate weekend warriors. We hope to inspire other people to get out and experience the natural world.”            Alex Beasley, Patagonia’s country manager for UK and Ireland, said: “It is with much sadness that we mourn the loss of our dear friend and colleague Andrew Foster, who was killed in a tragic accident in Yosemite.      “He was a much-loved member of our team and a passionate climber, mountaineer and skier who loved being in the outdoors.      “Our thoughts and condolences are with his wife, Lucy, and their families. We offer them our deepest sympathies.”            Andrew often worked out of the Up and Under climbing store in Cardiff.            The couple had practised for their trip to Yosemite by climbing cliffs in Cornwall and Pembrokeshire and Lucy told friends they were both “Yosemite virgins”.            On their return from America they planned to travel around the Alps for a year “skiing, climbing and being extreme” and had bought a van for the journey.      Fellow workers at Up and Under later put a statement on their website describing former worker Andy as “inspirational”.      It said: “Andy Foster was an inspirational member of the Up and Under family. He was a highly regarded member of staff for five years, before he took a job with Patagonia. He remained a dedicated friend of Up and Under, and was regularly to be found in the store.      “His passion for the outdoors, and mountains in particular, was enormous and infectious. Andy and Lucy’s intentions upon returning from Yosemite were, with the help of Andy’s father, to covert a van into a motorhome to enable them to explore the European Alps for the next twelve months      “It was then our hope that Andy would return to Up and Under in a part time consultative role, whilst he also chased other ambitions. Andy was highly respected, loved and his loss will be sorely felt by us all. Our thoughts are with Lucy and his family.”      In a Facebook tribute, friend Jess Spate described him as “always cheerful” and everyone who had climbed with him would remember “his good humour and unrivalled sense of adventure”.            “There’s nobody I’d rather climb a rapidly thawing frozen waterfall with at 2am on a work night. Nobody better to play hangman with at midnight in Cardiff City Hall, waiting to impersonate beautiful female ninjas. Nobody better to be topping out of a mountain route with when the weather turned”. He added: “Go hard my friend. May the skies always be clear for you and the thermometer stay below -5.”      Scott Gediman, from Yosemite national park, speaking, on Thursday said: “With all the craziness I don’t exactly know where they were going but chances are they were going up. From what I understand the were buried under rock… they were crushed by falling rocks.”      They were the only known casualties despite being with a group of other climbers when the series of collapses struck.            One witness, Mike Kane, tweeted that the collapse was “very loud”, adding it was a “miracle more [were] not hurt”. A second rockfall at the site on Thursday left one person injured.            A Foreign Office spokesman said: “We are in contact with the local authorities and providing assistance to both families at this very difficult time.”       ||||| The British couple hit by a 1,300-ton “sheet” of granite at Yosemite National Park on Thursday were on a dream holiday to celebrate their first wedding anniversary.

While our blog is just a log of what we have done we do hope that it will inspire other people to get out and experience the natural world.”      Facebook and Instagram pages linked to the blog also show the couple happily scaling Yellowstone’s Washington Column and Serenity Crack in the days before tragedy struck.      In one post, Andy is shown with a damaged hand after he “took a wiper off serenity crack.” He bravely added, “Pride was more damaged than my hands or shoes.”      Another post reveals they attempted to climb up the Washington Column but decided to turn back at the “half way ledge” because the face was overloaded with other climbers. “There [were] loads of other teams so decide to bail rather than spend hours waiting in line,” reads the post.      Tragically, the feeds end with a picture of a tired but happy Andrew Foster at the foot of a climb, alongside the chilling words “Yosemite has broken Andy. Time for a rest.”      While Yosemite records about 80 rockfalls per year, Foster’s death is the first rockfall-related fatality in the park for 18 years. Overall, there have now been 16 fatalities and more than 100 injuries from rockfalls since park records began in 1857.      “It is with much sadness that we mourn the loss of our dear friend and colleague Andrew Foster, who was killed in a tragic accident in Yosemite,” reads a statement from Alex Beasley, U.K. manager for clothing company Patagonia.      “Andy was a sales representative working in our UK team and had been with the business for five years. He was a much-loved member of our team and a passionate climber, mountaineer and skier who loved being in the outdoors. Our thoughts and condolences are with his wife Lucy and their families. We offer them our deepest sympathies.” ||||| Image copyright Facebook | Andrew and Lucy Foster Image caption Mr Foster, who moved to Cardiff for university, was a sales representative for an outdoor clothing firm      A climber from Wales has been killed by a rock fall in Yosemite National Park in California.      Andrew Foster, 32, originally from Cheltenham, was trapped while his wife, Lucy, 28, was seriously hurt when rocks fell from El Capitan.      Park ranger Scott Gediman said it was a tragic situation of \\"wrong place, wrong time\\" for the Cardiff couple.      Mrs Foster remains in a \\"critical condition\\" after being airlifted from the collapse, park officials said.      Scott Gediman, of Yosemite National Park, said Mrs Foster was being treated for life threatening injuries in an area hospital and had been told of her husband's death.

In 2006 he began working for the Cardiff-based outdoor activity shop Up and Under, before joining the international company Patagonia.      Up and Under said: \\"His passion for the outdoors, and mountains in particular, was enormous and infectious.\\"      A Patagonia spokesman said: \\"He was a much-loved member of our team and a passionate climber, mountaineer and skier who loved being in the outdoors.      \\"Our thoughts and condolences are with his wife Lucy and their families.\\"      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Footage of a further rock fall at Yosemite National Park this week      Paying tribute on Facebook, Mr Foster's friend Jess Spate said: \\"Everyone who climbed with him will remember his good humour and his unrivalled sense of adventure.\\"      Mrs Foster is originally from Staffordshire and went to school in Market Drayton in nearby Shropshire.      She studied ecology at Cardiff University from 2008 and works for the international engineering company AECOM.      A Foreign Office spokesman said: \\"We're providing support and assistance to both families following this tragic event and remain in contact with local authorities.\\"      One witness, Mike Kane, tweeted that the collapse was \\"very loud\\", adding it was a \\"miracle more [were] not hurt\\".      Mr Foster's death is the first fatality from a rock fall in the park in four years, according to the parks service.      Another rock fall at the site on Thursday led to one injured person being airlifted to hospital.      Rachael Evans' husband was slightly hurt while she and her sister Ruth Merrell had a lucky escape following the second larger rock fall.      Ms Evans told BBC Radio 4 the rock fall had \\"sounded like thunder\\".      Art Cormier, a regular climber who witnessed Thursday's rock fall, said Yosemite locals knew of the \\"regular risk\\" of rock falls in the popular spot.

An occasional crack ricochets across the landscape, a reminder of the thunder and dust which erupted two days in a row with devastating effect.      This has been a tough time here in Yosemite but park rangers say rock falls are not actually that unusual: 80 are recorded every year and many more go unreported.      Rarely do they have such devastating effect though — but while the mood of adventurers is sombre it is also resolute.      El Capitan draws people, it lures them in, because it is untamed, because of the risks.      Already climbers are setting out again.

Their levels of fitness are very different with Teddy having a much higher overall fitness level than Fluffy.  Hint: All of these animal behaviors are important. They help the animals get food for energy, make sure their young survive, or ensure that they, themselves, survive. Behaviors that help animals or their young survive, increase the animals’ fitness.

Information:  - Mexican muralism was the promotion of mural painting starting in the 1920s, generally with social and political messages as part of efforts to reunify the country under the post Mexican Revolution government. It was headed by the big three painters, Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros. From the 1920s to about 1970s a large number of murals with nationalistic, social and political messages were created on public buildings, starting a tradition which continues to this day in Mexico and has had impact in other parts of the Americas, including the United States where it served as inspiration for the Chicano art movement.  - The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (: RKKA, frequently shortened in Russian to ; KA, in English: Red Army also in critical literature and folklore of that epoch - Red Horde, Army of Work) was the army and the air force of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and after 1922 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The army was established immediately after the 1917 October Revolution (Red October or Bolshevik Revolution). The Bolsheviks raised an army to oppose the military confederations (especially the various groups collectively known as the White Army) of their adversaries during the Russian Civil War. Beginning in February 1946, the Red Army, along with the Soviet Navy, embodied the main component of the Soviet Armed Forces; taking the official name of \\"Soviet Army\\", until its dissolution in December 1991.  - Leon Trotsky (; born Lev Davidovich Bronstein;  21 August 1940) was a Marxist revolutionary and theorist, a Soviet politician who engineered the transfer of all political power to the Soviets with the October Revolution of 1917, and the founding leader of the Red Army.  - Lázaro Cárdenas del Río (May 21, 1895  October 19, 1970) was a general in the Mexican Revolution and a statesman who served as President of Mexico between 1934 and 1940. He is best known for nationalization of the oil industry in 1938 and the creation of Pemex, the government oil company.  - The Mexican Communist Party (PCM) was a communist party in Mexico. It was founded in 1911 as the Socialist Workers' Party (PSO) by Manabendra Nath Roy, a left-wing Indian Bengali intellectual. The PSO changed its name to the Mexican Communist Party in November 1919, following the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. It was outlawed in 1925 and remained illegal until 1935, during the presidency of the leftist Lázaro Cárdenas. The PCM later lost its registration in 1946 because it did not meet the new requirements of at least 30,000 registered members in at least 21 of Mexico's 31 states and the Federal District. It is not clear whether the party was unable to recruit enough members or whether, fearing repression, it refused to turn membership rolls over to the Secretary of the Interior, then in charge of elections.  - David Alfaro Siqueiros ( born José de Jesús Alfaro Siqueiros , December 29 , 1896 , in Chihuahua - January 6 , 1974 , in Cuernavaca , Morelos ) was a Mexican social realist painter , better known for his large murals in fresco . Along with Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco , he established \`\` Mexican Muralism . '' He was a Marxist - Leninist in support of Stalin and a member of the Mexican Communist Party who participated in an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Leon Trotsky in May 1940 . His surname would normally be Alfaro by Spanish naming customs ; like Picasso ( Pablo Ruiz y Picasso ) and Lorca ( Federico García Lorca ) , Siqueiros used his mother 's surname . It was long believed that he was born in Camargo in Chihuahua state , but in 2003 it was proven that he had actually been born in the city of Chihuahua , but grew up in Irapuato , Guanajuato , at least from the age of six . The discovery of his birth certificate in 2003 by a Mexican art curator was announced the following year by art critic Raquel Tibol , who was renowned as the leading authority on Mexican Muralism and who had been a close acquaintance of Siqueiros . Siqueiros changed his given name to \`\` David '' after his first wife called him by it in allusion to Michelangelo 's David . Another factual confusion is the year of his birth : he was born in 1896 , but many sources state 1898 or 1899 .  - The Mexican Revolution was a major armed struggle that radically transformed Mexican culture and government. Although recent research has focused on local and regional aspects of the Revolution, it was a \\"genuinely national revolution.\\" Its outbreak in 1910 resulted from the failure of the 35-year long regime of Porfirio Díaz to find a managed solution to the presidential succession. This meant there was a political crisis among competing elites and the opportunity for agrarian insurrection. Wealthy landowner Francisco I. Madero challenged Díaz in 1910 presidential election, and following the rigged results revolted under the Plan of San Luis Potosí. Armed conflict ousted Díaz from power and a new election was held in 1911, bringing Madero to the presidency.

He also wounded five others before fleeing the post with his rifle and ammo, an army spokesperson tells AFP. Authorities haven't speculated about a motive, but so far there's no indication that North Korea played a role in the rampage. It took place in Gangwon, specifically in Goseong County, described by Reuters as a mountainous region that borders the North on the eastern end of the Korean peninsula. Expand this summary.","output":"A South Korean soldier, stationed at a remote border outpost in Goseong County, Gangwon province, has reportedly shot and killed five of his fellow soldiers, according to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). The tragic incident, which unfolded in the mountainous region bordering North Korea on the eastern side of the Korean peninsula, also left five other soldiers severely injured. The unidentified soldier, who later fled the scene, was armed with his service rifle and ammunition. An army spokesperson told Agence France-Presse (AFP) that the fugitive soldier has not been apprehended yet, highlighting the ongoing efforts by military and police forces to locate and capture the suspect. Despite the proximity to the North Korean border, authorities have not yet speculated on a potential motive behind the soldier's rampage. At the time of the report, there was no indication suggesting that North Korea had any role in the shooting incident. The South Korean military is expected to carry out a thorough investigation to determine the possible reasons for the soldier's actions and to evaluate existing preventive measures in hopes of preventing similar future occurrences. It is worth mentioning that this is not the first time such an incident has occurred within the South Korean military. In the past, there have been cases of soldiers opening fire on their colleagues, often stemming from issues surrounding stress, mental illness, or difficulties adjusting to the strict military environment. In 2014, a similar situation occurred when a South Korean Army sergeant went on a shooting spree, killing five and wounding seven others after a dispute with his colleagues. The incident raises concerns over the mental health and well-being of soldiers stationed in these remote and high-pressure border areas, and it is likely that calls will be made for increased psychological monitoring and support for these servicemen, given the possibility of their exposure to immense stress and potential risk of engaging with hostile forces across the border. Additionally, this tragic event underlines the significance of reviewing and refining military procedures and policies to ensure that incidents like these can be avoided in the future."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let's learn some ways to make the most out of our reading experience. First, just like it's hard to build a puzzle with a lot of noise around, it's also challenging to read a book when there are distractions around you. So, find a quiet, cosy corner or put on your favourite pair of headphones to block out the noise, and dive into your book. While reading, it's essential to play detective and answer some basic questions about the story before trying to understand the bigger things, kind of like learning to walk before you can run. Who are the characters? What's happening in the story? Where and when does it take place?  In some books, the one telling the story, the narrator, is a character in the story itself. If this is the case, take some time to ponder about their role in the story, sort of like how you think about why the gingerbread man decided to run away. Also, pay attention to the style of the book - the flavour of the cake, if you will. Is it funny? Sad? Scary? Fast-paced like a race car or slow and dreamy like a cloud? This makes each book unique! Remember, your mind is like a magic bag that stores all details about the adventure the book takes you on. After finishing each chapter or part, jot down a nutshell version of the main events or happenings. This will make remembering easier, like how a treasure map helps a pirate remember where the gold is buried. Reading together with friends, siblings, or parents can make the journey more fun and exciting, like going to an amusement park together. Stories often have special surprises like gifts hidden within them. Look out for patterns, things that repeat, unexpected events, and seeming coincidences - all these can enrich our understanding of the story and make it more enjoyable. Once you've finished the book, go back to the start and rethink the beginning. It's like when you've finished a treasure hunt, looking back at the first clue gives you a different perspective! Finally, after the journey of reading the book comes the part of sharing. Don't hesitate to form your opinion on the book, it can be your special treasure from the reading journey. But remember, your thoughts and feelings about the book should be supported with the facts from the book, like a tree standing tall with its roots firmly in the ground. Reading a book is a wonderful adventure. Prepare well, explore with curiosity, and share your unique discoveries, and you'll enjoy every part of it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

China’s Defense Ministry said Thursday that a U.S. decision to disinvite China from a major international maritime exercise is “unconstructive.” A ministry statement said despite the decision, China will continue playing a role in “maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.” The United States announced its move Wednesday, saying Beijing’s “destabilizing behavior” in the South China Sea is inconsistent with the principles of the U.S.-led drill. “China’s continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serve to raise tensions and destabilize the region,” read a statement from Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Since 2014, China has taken part in RIMPAC, the world’s largest international maritime drill, which is held every two years in Hawaii.

Sent2: The only way to prevent guns from falling in the hands of criminals is by law abiding people buying every gun that is manufactured and thus leaving no guns available for criminals to buy.","output":"The classification of the given argument pairs (discussing Gun Control) is NOT SIMILAR. Explanation: Sent1 is talking about the ease of access to firearms for criminals before the implementation of the Brady Law. It highlights how criminals could easily purchase a gun without restrictions. Sent2, on the other hand, proposes a rather unrealistic solution of law-abiding citizens purchasing every manufactured gun to prevent criminals from obtaining firearms. The focus here is on the hypothetical idea of total firearms control and eradication by civilians, which is a different aspect of the gun control debate. In conclusion, the two sentences are discussing different aspects of gun control and are therefore NOT SIMILAR."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Last year the two leaders traded insults, with Trump calling Kim “rocket man,” and the North Korean leader calling the U.S. president a “dotard,” and they both threatened military action as tension rose over the North’s accelerated weapons testing to develop an operational nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile capability. But after North Korea successfully test-fired missiles it claimed could carry nuclear warheads capable of reaching the United States, Pyongyang pivoted to diplomacy by suspending further provocations and indicating a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. Trump surprised allies and adversaries alike by immediately agreeing to meet with Kim, long before the specifics of a nuclear deal could be negotiated. Tuesday’s first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader produced a broad declaration to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty to end the long standing hostiles between the U.S. and North Korea. Trump called the agreement “very comprehensive,” but it will be left to negotiators to later resolve differences between Washington’s call for complete and verifiable nuclear dismantlement before any sanctions relief is provided, and Pyongyang’s demand that concessions be linked to incremental progress. Some in South Korea remain skeptical that the broad commitment reached at the U.S.-North Korean summit in Singapore will lead to North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons program. “North Korea did not keep its promise in the past, even after signing the agreement. This is what I am disappointed and doubtful about,” said Shim Jae-yeon, a housewife who lives in Seoul. Others...

Answer the question...who did we fight in the war of 1812??","output":"The War of 1812 was a military conflict fought between the United States of America and the British Empire, specifically, the British North American colonies, which later became modern-day Canada. The conflict took place between June 1812 and February 1815, and although it originated due to trade issues and political tensions, it significantly impacted the nations involved, their territories, and the indigenous populations in the region. The primary parties involved in the War of 1812 include: 1. United States of America: The U.S. was a young and growing nation at the beginning of the 19th century, seeking to assert its sovereignty, protect its international trade rights, and possibly expand its territories. It declared war on Britain because of various grievances, including Britain's attempts to restrict U.S. trade, the impressment of American sailors into the British Royal Navy, and Britain's support of Native American tribes against American expansion. 2. British Empire (Britain and British North American Colonies): Britain was, at that time, engaged in the Napoleonic Wars with France, and its primary concern was its ongoing conflict on the European continent. However, it maintained a presence in North America, especially in the British North American colonies, which later became Canada. The colonies included Upper Canada (now Ontario), Lower Canada (now Quebec), Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, among others. British forces in North America had to defend their territories from the Americans and maintain control over the lucrative fur trade, which required the support of indigenous tribes in the region. 3. Native American Tribes: Several Native American tribes sided with the British during the War of 1812. They did so primarily because they hoped to create a Native American buffer state between the United States and Canada, which would protect their lands from American expansion. Key tribes that fought alongside the British included the Shawnee, led by Tecumseh, the Creek, the Ojibwa, the Ottawa, and the Wyandot. Throughout the war, they engaged in several battles against American forces. The War of 1812 included various theaters of conflict, such as land battles on the U.S.-Canada border, naval battles on the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean, and military engagements in the American South. Notable battles include the Battle of Queenston Heights, the Burning of Washington, the Battle of Baltimore, the Battle of New Orleans, and the Battle of Lake Erie. The war concluded with the signing of the Treaty of Ghent in December 1814, which essentially restored the status quo ante bellum (the state of affairs before the war). Neither the British nor the Americans gained or lost significant territories, and many of the issues that led to the war, such as trade restrictions and impressment, were resolved or faded away as the global context changed with the end of the Napoleonic Wars. In summary, in the War of 1812, the United States of America fought against the British Empire (Britain and its North American colonies, including present-day Canada) and various Native American tribes. The conflict stemmed from unresolved tensions over trade, territorial disputes, and perceived British support for Native American resistance against American expansion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which should the student most likely do to check the accuracy of the results? Options are: i. complete the experiment in one day; ii. test multiple brands of soap; iii. record data in metric units; iv. repeat the experiment;","output":"Option IV: Repeat the experiment. In order to check the accuracy of the results obtained from determining the density of different bars of soap, the student should most likely choose to repeat the experiment. Here is a detailed explanation for each option, explaining why option IV is the most appropriate choice to ensure accuracy: i. Complete the experiment in one day While completing the experiment in one day might help maintain consistent conditions, such as temperature and humidity, it is not the most effective way to ensure the accuracy of the results. Repeating the experiment on different days may also help capture any potential environmental variations that could impact the results. Therefore, completing the experiment in one day is not the best way to check the accuracy of the results. ii. Test multiple brands of soap Testing multiple brands of soap might provide a broader understanding of the different soap densities, but it won't necessarily ensure the accuracy of the results. This is because the student's main objective is to check the accuracy of density measurements for the soap bars they have already tested, and not to make comparisons between different brands. Adding additional soap brands to the experiment would only increase the breadth of data rather than directly addressing the accuracy of the initial measurements. iii. Record data in metric units Recording data in metric units is an important aspect of scientific experiments, as it ensures that the data is easily communicated and understood by others. However, simply using metric units in data recording doesn't automatically guarantee accurate results. The main issue to address when checking the accuracy of results is whether the appropriate measuring techniques and equipment have been used, in conjunction with a consistent and reliable experimental procedure, which leads us to the most appropriate option. iv. Repeat the experiment Repeating the experiment is the best way to check the accuracy of the results. This is because repeating the experiment helps to verify that the measurements obtained are consistent, reliable, and not influenced by experimental errors, random fluctuations, or other external factors. By conducting the experiment multiple times, the student can obtain additional data points, which can be used to calculate an average density for each soap bar and assess the variability of the results. Additionally, repeating the experiment allows the student to refine their techniques and correct any potential procedural errors, ultimately increasing the confidence in their findings. In conclusion, to check the accuracy of the results from determining the density of different bars of soap, the student should choose option IV: Repeat the experiment. This will ensure greater reliability and consistency of the measurements, decrease the impact of any potential experimental errors, and provide a more accurate representation of the true density values for the soap bars."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In order to provide a detailed analysis, let's break down the sentence into its individual components. \\"It's a smart, funny look\\" indicates a favorable point of view towards the subject. The usage of 'smart' suggests that the work or object in question is intelligent or well-thought-out. Along with that, the addition of 'funny' reveals an element of humor or amusement. Both of these adjectives express positive sentiments, as they imply a clever and enjoyable aspect to the subject. \\"at an arcane area of popular culture\\" refers to a less known or understood aspect of popular culture.

Forging a Healthy Relationship with Money: Quid Pro Quo Years ago I started relating to my finances in a new way that helped me feel more in control and more confident with money. I was able to get out of credit card debt and grow my business. The key was intimacy. Instead of avoiding and fearing my money situation, I had to face it head on and get intimate. I actively brought myself closer to money and all I had been neglecting. To do this required a huge shift in the way I was used to thinking about money. I started personalizing it. I called it my money, not just “money.” After all, I’ll only know money that is my own—the money I physically earn, hold, exchange, save, and invest. “Money” was just money out there that I had no connection to. Then, I started personifying my money; I referred to it as a partner that would help me fund my dreams. Eager to tend to this new relationship, I wondered, “What does my money need from me?” My money was thrilled to be asked. It said, “I need a vision, your attention, and clear directives.” (My money is very articulate and opinionated.) Vision: Just like me, my money needs something to aspire to besides paying the bills and whatever “retirement” means. I had to think about what I really wanted in the short-, mid-, and long-term. Attention: To stop the pattern of neglect and avoidance, I had to actively tend to my money. That meant knowing exactly how much I owed and what my monthly expenses were. It also meant paying attention to—and managing—my fears. Directives: Instead of “action steps,” the term “directives” put me in the driver’s seat with my money. A directive is an instruction issued by a central authority about how to fulfill a goal. Laying out clear directives connected to my overall vision allowed me to move forward one step at a time with more confidence and purpose. Quid pro quo. Just like other healthy relationships in your life, your relationship with money must also be grounded in mutuality and respect. If you want something, you must be prepared to give. The more you give, the more you receive. Translating this quid pro quo approach to tangible results wasn’t easy, but it felt much better than the way I was behaving with money before. By getting more intimate with my money, my fears became manageable and most importantly, I had a plan. My relationship with money is ongoing. When I have a setback financially, I ask myself where I dropped the ball and inevitably, it has to do with lacking a clear vision, not paying attention, or failing to follow through on directives. It’s easier to get back on track now. I spend less time worrying and more time figuring out how to regroup. I can truly say I’ve made peace with money. It’s not a perfect relationship, but it’s healthy and growing. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"This text is about building a healthy relationship with money by treating it like a partner who helps you achieve your dreams.

He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister.In September 2008, after his appearance on Britain's Got Talent but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir. Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, The Choral Music of F.W Wadely, released in November 2008. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was 8 months old when his parents separated?, what is it ?

Vick studied more about the troposphere, while Frank studied more about the Greenhouse Effect.  Which friend studied more about carbon dioxide?  Hint: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. The answer to this question is:","output":"Frank studied more about carbon dioxide. Step 1: Identifying the subjects of study for each friend Vick studied the troposphere, which is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere.

Step 2: Relating the subjects to carbon dioxide The troposphere is indeed where the majority of carbon dioxide resides, but Vick's focus was on the entire troposphere and not specifically on carbon dioxide, considering other atmospheric aspects as well. Frank studied the Greenhouse Effect, and the hint provided a clear indication that carbon dioxide is one of the key greenhouse gases responsible for this effect. While studying the Greenhouse Effect, Frank would have needed to learn about carbon dioxide and its role in the process. Step 3: Determining who studied carbon dioxide more Since Frank's studies were directly related to the Greenhouse Effect and the role of carbon dioxide, it's reasonable to conclude that he studied more about carbon dioxide than Vick did."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:My parents lived through the Great Depression of the 1930s and I heard stories from both of them about how their lives changed because of it. The same was true of my in-laws whose lives were also affected negatively. For example, my husband's grandfather owned a factory. Owing to the stock   market crash, he lost the factory and went back to work in the very factory he'd once owned. He could no longer afford to send my father-in-law to college. My father-in-law worked full time as a pipe fitter and went to school part-time to earn his degree, which took seven years. Somehow, my husband and I never dreamed that we would live through anything similar. However, as they say, history often repeats itself. In 1929, the stock market crashed in the month of October. The same thing happened in 2008. My husband, who had invested   all our money in the market, was in a state of shock. Each day the news was more terrible. \\"We've lost more than half of our wealth,\\" he told me. I just stared at him. \\"How can that be?\\" \\"I thought we had good, solid investments, but it seems I was wrong.\\" \\"Well, we do have pensions  ,\\" I said. \\"Hopefully, they won't be affected. Since we have never lived a high lifestyle to begin with, I don't think we have to worry.\\" \\"I did hope to leave our children and grandchildren a generous inheritance  ,\\" my husband said. He shook his head in disbelief. \\"We'll still be able to give gifts. Love is the most important gift anyway.\\" Our children are grown and we always try to be generous to them and our grandchildren. \\"It just won't be the same.\\" \\"The world is always changing,\\" I said. \\"You never know what will happen. The main thing is not to get discouraged. As long as we have our health and can afford the necessities of life, there's no reason to be upset.

The Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) forecasts now predicts a surplus of £10.0bn in 2019-20. In March, the OBR forecast a surplus of £5.2bn in 2018-19, but that has now been revised to a £6.4bn deficit. The OBR had described the March Budget plans as a rollercoaster rise because of the cuts in the first two years of the parliament and increased spending in the last two years. The plans have now been smoothed, with more borrowing in each of the three years following 2015-16. International organisations such as the OECD had suggested that the government's plans should be smoothed. In 2016-17, the predicted deficit is up from £39.4bn to £43.1bn, while in 2017-18 it has gone up from £12.8bn to £24.3bn. Mr Osborne told the House of Commons that his economic aims could be \\"achieved without a rollercoaster ride\\", describing his new plans as a \\"smoother rise to the same destination\\". The forecast for the deficit in the current financial year has been cut from £75.3bn to £69.5bn. Mr Osborne had already cut back the pace of his deficit-cutting in the March Budget, when the surplus in 2019-20 was revised down from £23.1bn to £7.0bn. In its commentary on the Budget, the OBR said: \\"The new government has used its first Budget to loosen significantly the impending squeeze on public services spending that had been pencilled in by the coalition in March.\\" \\"This is being financed by welfare cuts, net tax increases and three years of higher government borrowing.\\" There were only moderate changes to the OBR's forecasts of economic growth, which has gone down from 2.5% to 2.4% this year. It is unchanged at 2.3% in 2016, rising from 2.3% to 2.4% in the following two years.

Given the question: Process:  - Food is put into mouth - Food is chewed and mixed with saliva (spit) - Food travels down the esophagus (throat) - Food travels into the stomach - Acid in the stomach breaks the food down further - Food travels into the small intestine - Nutrients from food are absorbed into the blood stream - Food travels into the large intestine - Most of the remaining material is now waste - The waste is eventually removed from the body.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more food is put into the mouth happens, how will it affect LESS food being digested.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the perturbation of putting more food into the mouth can potentially have a direct or indirect effect on the process of digestion, leading to less food being effectively digested. The digestive system is a complex and finely-tuned process that relies on a balance of mechanical and chemical actions to break down food and absorb nutrients. When more food is ingested than the body is accustomed to or able to handle efficiently, this balance can be disrupted, affecting the overall digestion process. There are several ways in which this perturbation may impact digestion: 1. Chewing and saliva production: Introducing more food into the mouth may lead to inadequate chewing and insufficient saliva production. Chewing is essential for breaking down food into smaller, more manageable particles, facilitating digestion by increasing the surface area available for enzymatic action. Saliva contains enzymes like amylase that initiate the breakdown of carbohydrates. If the amount of food overwhelms the mouth's capacity to effectively chew and produce the necessary saliva, the food may not be adequately prepared for subsequent stages of digestion. 2. Esophageal transit: When large quantities of food are ingested, the food bolus may be too large to effectively pass through the esophagus. This can lead to longer transit times, improper mixing with stomach secretions, and discomfort or difficulty swallowing. 3. Stomach capacity and gastric acid production: The stomach has a limited capacity to hold and process food. Overloading it with an excessive amount of food can lead to slower gastric emptying, as the stomach walls may not contract as efficiently, hampering the churning and mixing of ingested food with gastric acids. Moreover, a large amount of food may dilute the acid concentration in the stomach, affecting its ability to sufficiently break down proteins and other food components. 4. Nutrient absorption: If the small intestine is overwhelmed with partially digested food, the rate of absorption of nutrients may be impaired. Since the small intestine is responsible for the majority of nutrient absorption, a decreased efficiency in this stage can lead to less overall absorption of essential nutrients. 5. Impact on large intestine function: The large intestine is responsible for absorbing water and electrolytes from the remaining indigestible food matter and forming feces. Overloading the large intestine with undigested food components could result in an altered transit time, potentially leading to constipation or diarrhea due to improper water absorption. As a result, the perturbation of putting more food into the mouth can impact the entire digestion process, potentially leading to less food being effectively digested. It is essential for individuals to maintain a balanced diet and control portion sizes to ensure optimal digestion and nutrient absorption."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: -  Your town or a private company collect and transport the aluminum to a recycling facility - The aluminum is sorted and cleaned at the central recycling facility - The aluminum is melted down to remove coatings and inks - The melted aluminum is formed into large formations called ingots - The ingots are transported to another facility and rolled out to make them easier to manipulate - The ingots can now be turned into new aluminum products.

I was working a shift at a chain cafe one afternoon in England, it was during the lunch rush, so we had a back up of customers lined up to the exit. See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don’t leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere. Now my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a ‘customer is always right’ the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite ‘fuck off'. All I say is ‘Good’ and move on to the next customer. Hitler-lite phones my corporation to voice a complaint, so a suit comes out and asks the team who did it, I fess up so I can save the time and not have a reason to hate one of my co-workers. I get a lecture and a warning, the end. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Process:  - Air is taken into the body via the nose or mouth - The air travels into the windpipe - The windpipe divides the air to the two lungs via the bronchial tubes - The lungs oxygenate the blood in the body - Carbon dioxide is filtered out by every cell in the body - The carbon dioxide is carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide is exhaled.  suppose the air not cleared through the lungs happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen being brought to the body.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"The proposed situation, in which the air is not properly cleared through the lungs, can lead to less oxygen being brought to the body. This falls under an instance of directly impacting a step of the process.  The process by which oxygen is transferred from the air to the cells of the body and carbon dioxide removed is known as respiration. This process involves several steps, starting with inhalation through the nose or mouth, where air enters the windpipe and proceeds to the lungs via the bronchial tubes. Within the lungs, there exist numerous small, balloon-like capillaries called alveoli which function as the main site for gas exchange. The walls of these alveoli are thin and permeable, allowing oxygen to diffuse into the tiny blood vessels, or capillaries, enveloping the alveoli. The oxygen binds to red blood cells where it's then carried to the rest of the body for vital cellular processes.  Concurrently, carbon dioxide, which is a byproduct of cellular metabolism, is carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream where it diffuses from the capillaries back into the alveoli. This carbon dioxide is then exhaled from the body when we breathe out. If the air is not sufficiently cleared through the lungs, it could indicate potential issues with the alveoli. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as blockages in the airways, a build-up of mucus, infections, or diseases like emphysema or bronchitis which lead to damage of the alveoli. As a result, the body's ability to intake oxygen and expel carbon dioxide may be compromised which adversely affects the entire process of respiration. When less air is cleared, it directly impacts the oxygenation process and gas exchange in the alveoli. Because the primary function of the lungs is to replenish the body's oxygen supply and eliminate carbon dioxide, failure to clear or fully exhale air results in less available oxygen for transfer into the bloodstream with each breath. This, in turn, leads to less oxygen being available for delivery to cells in the body, which can potentially disrupt normal cellular functions and overall metabolism. In conclusion, any perturbation or failure in completely clearing air from the lungs directly interferes with the essential process of respiration, leading to less oxygen being carried to cells in the body. The impacts can be serious and wide-ranging, affecting everything from energy levels to organ function."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Remember that the grass isn’t always greener. Set boundaries. Give yourself time.\\"","output":"Title: Managing Emotions and Setting Boundaries: A Journey Towards Self-Growth Introduction In today's fast-paced world, it is increasingly important to learn how to separate fantasy from reality and make informed decisions. This involves understanding that emotions are not always an accurate reflection of the situation and that sometimes, it is necessary to take a step back, evaluate, and set boundaries for oneself. As individuals, we must give ourselves time to process our emotions and become more grounded, preventing impulsive decisions that may result in unfavorable consequences. In this article, we will explore strategies for separating fantasy from reality, putting feelings into perspective, remembering that the grass isn't always greener, setting boundaries, and giving ourselves time. 1. Separate Fantasy from Reality The first step towards emotional regulation is learning to separate fantasy from reality. Often, our thoughts and perceptions are colored by emotions, which can result in a distorted view of a situation. To counter this, try examining the objective facts. Write them down if necessary, as this can help create a more accurate picture of the situation. Additionally, talking to trusted friends or professionals about your thoughts and feelings can provide helpful insights, as they may offer a more grounded perspective. 2. Realize that You Don't Always Have to Act on Your Feelings Our feelings can significantly affect our decisions, sometimes leading us to act impulsively. While it is essential to acknowledge and validate our emotions, it is equally important to recognize that they are not always the best guide for decision-making. Pause and consider if your feelings are truly representative of the situation or are possibly magnified by other factors, such as stress or fatigue. If necessary, take deep breaths and engage in calming activities, such as meditation or the practice of mindfulness. 3. Remember that the Grass Isn't Always Greener The common saying \\"the grass is always greener on the other side\\" reminds us not to compare our lives to others', as we never truly know their struggles and challenges. Social media makes it easy to fall into the trap of comparing ourselves to others and feeling unsatisfied with our lives as a result. Recognize that others may only show their best moments on social media, and their lives may not be perfect behind the scenes. Instead, focus on cultivating gratitude for what you have in your life and look for areas where you could take action to improve your situation. 4. Set Boundaries Boundaries are crucial in maintaining mental and emotional well-being. They involve setting limits with others to protect your energy, time, and emotions. Boundaries can consist of stating how much time you are willing to spend with someone, not engaging in conversations that are emotionally draining, or setting expectations in relationships. Communicate your boundaries to those around you and be open about your needs and limits. Remember that setting boundaries is a form of self-care and self-respect and that they may need occasional readjustment. 5. Give Yourself Time In a world where instant gratification is often the norm, giving ourselves the necessary time to process and understand our emotions can be challenging. However, investing time in introspection allows for a clearer understanding of our emotional landscape and promotes healthier decision-making. Engage in self-reflection regularly through activities such as journaling, meditation, or therapy. Take time to process emotions and formulate a thoughtful response rather than reacting impulsively. This approach encourages self-awareness and fosters personal growth. Conclusion In conclusion, managing emotions and setting boundaries are integral aspects of self-growth. By separating fantasy from reality, acknowledging but not necessarily acting on our feelings, appreciating what we have, setting boundaries, and granting ourselves time for introspection, we can lead more balanced and fulfilling lives. As with most things in life, this journey involves continuous growth and learning. Embrace these strategies and adapt them as needed, knowing that your emotional and mental well-being is vital to your overall happiness and success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After Unusual Stumbles, Rafael Nadal’s Year Ends in Hope LONDON — On the eve of the year-end ATP World Tour Finals, Rafael Nadal mused, “In the work, always there is a solution, no?” Several days later and true to his words, Nadal was plugging away on the practice courts. He finished a 90-minute practice session Thursday afternoon with Richard Gasquet, then relocated to another bubbled court inside O2 Arena and logged another 45 minutes, mostly hitting serves. Nadal’s coach, his uncle Toni, and his longtime physical therapist, Rafael Maymo, were at his side. When they were done, Nadal helped pick up his own balls, too. His lunch-pail work ethic has been a bedrock of his appeal and success. It seems central to a late-season resurgence after a lackluster year for him. The surest evidence that Nadal, a 14-time Grand Slam champion and a former No. 1 who is now ranked fifth, is finding solutions in sweat is his 5-2 record against the top 10 players since the Shanghai Masters last month. He was 2-8 against them this year before that point. That includes straight-set wins this week in the round-robin portion of the finals against No. 2 Andy Murray and No. 4 Stan Wawrinka. On Friday afternoon, Nadal improved to 3-0 with a grinding 6-7 (2), 6-3, 6-4 defeat of seventh-ranked David Ferrer. On Saturday, Nadal faces No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the first of two semifinals. The two have met an ATP record 45 times, with Nadal holding a 23-22 edge, although he has only one victory in their last eight matches. Later Saturday, No. 3 Roger Federer plays Wawrinka, who beat Murray, 7-6 (4), 6-4, to secure the final semifinal berth. This remains the biggest title that Nadal, 29, has yet to claim. A two-time finalist in the event, Nadal has missed large portions of previous seasons with injuries. He has missed the World Tour Finals four times in the last decade. Last year, Nadal withdrew to have surgery for appendicitis. Since winning a record ninth French Open in 2014, Nadal has looked diminished. The viciously spinning forehands, the irrepressible fight, the groans and the grimace on his face are still there, but the menace is his game has gone. “This year, I have been losing much more than usual,” Nadal conceded this week. For the first time since 2005, he failed to add to his Grand Slam total; he is tied with Pete Sampras for second to Federer’s 17. In June, Nadal dropped to No. 10 in the rankings, his lowest since April 2005, one month before his first French Open title. His 19 losses are his most in a season during his 14-year career. A few have been stunners, including a season-opening loss to No. 127 Michael Berrer and a second-round loss at Wimbledon to No. 102 Dustin Brown. Nadal, the undisputed king of clay, also came up short against Murray in Madrid, against Wawrinka in Rome and against Djokovic at the French Open. He lost three times to Fabio Fognini — twice on clay and then in the third round of the U.S. Open, after holding a two-set lead. There have been no apparent injuries, or excuses. Nadal has been transparent about his woes — the “fixes” he needs to his game, the “nerves,” the lack of confidence. “If you are able to compete the whole year, as I did, as Novak did, as Andy did, as Roger did, as Wawrinka did, then the ranking is fair,” Nadal said Wednesday after beating Murray, 6-4, 6-1, for his best win since defeating Djokovic in the 2014 French Open final. But Nadal scoffed at the idea that there was anything shameful about a No. 5 finish, although it is his poorest since finishing No. 51 as a teenager in 2004. “After a tough season, if you arrive to this tournament with this number, that says the level is still there,” he said. Some have suggested a coaching change. Nadal has said repeatedly that he believes in his team. Any dip in performance is his to bear alone. Toni Nadal said he had not discussed revamping the team. “It’s true — sometimes, someone needs new words,” Toni Nadal said Thursday, adding that it was “not my responsibility” to make any substitutions. He also rejected the idea that 2015 was a lost season. Rafael Nadal’s improving form on his least favorite surface — indoor hardcourts — at a time of year when he has often hobbled to the finish line is a building block for better things to come. “For us, I think it is very important,” Toni Nadal said of a post-U.S. Open period in which Nadal has recorded career highs in matches (21) and victories (17-4). “I think we can have a possibility to make a good 2016. We have played in a part of the year where normally we have more problems.” Rafael Nadal’s strong results this autumn include runner-up finishes at Beijing and in Basel, Switzerland, a semifinal at the Shanghai Masters and a quarterfinal at the Paris Masters this month. Nadal also has an eye on next season. “If I am able to play well here, I think that’s great news, because that can be a good chance to start next year again with positive feelings,” he said. The growing self-belief has been evident in Nadal’s aggressive tactics. He is serving more effectively. His whipping left-handed forehand is finding the corners and allowing him to control rallies and move forward on the court. In beating Murray, Nadal used a variety of angles and spins and depth to exploit the entire geometry of the court. He even found his way to the net, winning 11 of 13 points. “I go to the net when I am confident,” he said. The key, Nadal said, is that he is no longer pressing. He is not thinking too much. He is allowing himself to flow. “This year I have been more worried about myself than the opponents for a lot of matches,” he said, adding, “Today I feel free.” Whether Nadal can return to take his place alongside Djokovic, Murray and Federer on the Mount Rushmore of men’s tennis is for many the only question that counts. No rival in London doubted he could. Federer said he considered Nadal a threat to win anywhere he plays. The road back to No. 1 gets more difficult each passing year, Toni Nadal said. Rafael Nadal finished No. 1 in 2008, 2010 and 2013, the last two after significant injury setbacks. “We can improve,” Toni said. A win over Djokovic would send a strong message. These days, that is tall order, no matter how much perspiration one spills. With 10 titles, including the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, Djokovic has been nearly untouchable in 2015. He has lost only six of 86 matches — three of them to Federer, who ended Djokovic’s 23-match unbeaten streak this week. Djokovic is seeking his fifth year-end title and his fourth in a row. Nadal did not take a set off Djokovic in three matches this year, including a quarterfinal loss at the French Open. Last month, Djokovic thumped Nadal, 6-2, 6-2, in the final at Beijing on outdoor hardcourts. “The best tactic possible is play very, very well,” Nadal said. “Let’s see tomorrow if I am able to win more games.” If he cannot solve Djokovic, Nadal will return to the practice court for answers. He is not allowing himself much downtime during the off-season. “I don’t deserve vacation this year,” he said with a grin.

James' mother died when he was very young and he had difficulty getting along with his stepmother. Black ran away from home to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at age 8 and was apprenticed to a silversmith. At age 18 he migrated westward and took jobs on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. In 1830, Black made the famous Bowie knife for Jim Bowie who was already famous for knife-fighting from his 1827 sandbar duel. Bowie's killing of three assassins in Texas and his death at the Battle of the Alamo made him, and Black's knife, legends. After Bowie's death in 1836, Black did a brisk business selling his knives to pioneers bound for Texas. Everyone seemed to want \\"Jim Bowie's knife.\\" Black forged his knives behind a leather curtain and kept his process a secret. Black's knives were known to be exceedingly tough yet flexible. Many claimed that Black had rediscovered the process to make Damascus steel.  James Black's wife Anne died in 1838; and in 1839, while Black was in bed from an illness, his father-in-law Shaw broke into Black's house and brutally attacked him with a club. Black's life was saved by the family dog; he survived, but his eyes were severely damaged by the attack. He went north to seek medical advice, where his eyes were further damaged by the inept ministrations of a Cincinnati, Ohio, physician. When Black returned to Arkansas he discovered that his father-in-law had sold his business and property, illegally, and disappeared with the cash.  Black lived on a local plantation for a couple of years until Dr. Isaac Newton Jones took him into his home. Black lived with the Jones family for the next 30 years. He attempted to pass on his knife-making secrets to Daniel Webster Jones, but unfortunately he could not remember the technique. Jones would later become Governor of Arkansas. James Black died on 22 June 1872 in Washington, Arkansas.  More skeptically, \\"...[T]here is no direct contemporary evidence to establish that James Black made a knife for James Bowie... The story rests solely on Black's claims made well after he had been adjudged mentally incompetent...\\" \\"...[T]he only time that [James Bowie] verifiably used a knife in a personal encounter was on the Sandbar in 1827...\\" \\"...[T]o this day there is no known knife bearing his name that is proven authentic, nor positively identified as the work of James Black.

These days, unfortunately, my spa trips are few and far between. I blame the damn kids for that one! So, as you can imagine, I was pretty damn excited when the in-laws presented me with an Urban Spa voucher for the Urban Indulgence package: one hour hot stone Lomi Lomi massage followed by a Heavenly Spa Facial - two hours on indulgent bliss, for Christmas. I had never had a hot stone massage before so was very much looking forward to this, if nothing else out of curiosity about what is involved. Whenever you see pictures advertising a hot stone massage, the beautiful model always has a bunch of largish stones on her back so I wasn't sure whether it was more an acupressure experience where they left the stones strategically placed on the back to work their magic or whether it was an actual massage.  Turns out that it is an actual massage. I requested a firm massage as my back has really been giving me issues. Carrying 15kgs of Crazy Kid or 9kgs of Kiki (or 26kgs of double babies) really isn't too good for the back so it had been causing me problems for a couple of months. My therapist (the lovely Kristy) gave me an expertly firm massage and used a small, smooth hot stone, along with her hands, to perform the massage. It was quite a unique experience as one minute I could sense that she was using her hands to do the massage then then next I'd get a sweep of hotness as the stone was run over me. It really was a delightful sensory experience. As my back was a problem area, Kristy spent 30 minutes just on that then the other 30 minutes was spent on the rest of my body. I could feel myself drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the massage. One really special thing about this massage was that the massage table was heated. Such a small touch, but one that was greatly appreciated (although it was a great contributor to my lack of consciousness!). Question: Why did the therapist work mainly on the author's back? Answer:","output":"The therapist worked mainly on the author's back because the author mentioned that their back had been causing them issues due to carrying their children, who weighed 15kgs (Crazy Kid) and 9kgs (Kiki) respectively. The author requested a firm massage to address the problems their back had been experiencing for a couple of months. Thus, the therapist, Kristy, tailored her treatment to focus on the problem area by spending 30 minutes of the one-hour hot stone Lomi Lomi massage exclusively on the author's back to provide relief and work on the area that needed the most attention."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It usually highlights the shortcomings or issues that the reviewer faced, with the objective of informing others about the drawbacks and potentially influencing their decision-making process. Below is an example of a negative review for a smartphone: Title: Disappointing performance and poor battery life Rating: 1.5/5 stars I recently purchased the XY100 smartphone, and unfortunately, I have been far from impressed with the device. I had high expectations based on the company's reputation, but I want to share my experience with potential buyers to give an honest view of some of the drawbacks that I have encountered with this smartphone. Firstly, the overall performance of the XY100 is subpar for a device in its price range. With its advertised specifications, a smoother experience was expected, but even with minimal apps running, the phone feels sluggish and unresponsive at times. Multitasking can be a chore, as app switching can cause notable lags. This can be particularly frustrating when trying to complete important work on the go that requires a more responsive device. Additionally, the battery life of the XY100 is extremely disappointing. Contrary to the claim of \\"all-day battery life\\" by the manufacturer, I noticed my battery percentage dropping alarmingly quickly, even during periods of light use. With moderate to heavy usage, I often found myself scrambling for a charger before the day was over. A smartphone with a more reliable battery life would be better suited for those with busy schedules and limited access to charging facilities throughout the day. Another problem worth mentioning is the camera performance. The XY100's camera delivers mediocre photo quality, especially in low-light environments. Indoor photos often appear dark, grainy, and lack fine detail. This poses a significant challenge for individuals who rely on their smartphone camera for photography, or for capturing important memories during special events. On a positive note, the build quality of the smartphone is decent, and the screen display is quite vibrant. However, these features do not compensate for the phone's shortcomings in terms of performance, battery life, and camera quality. In conclusion, as someone who values a responsive, reliable, and good-quality smartphone that delivers a satisfying user experience, I cannot recommend the XY100. Potential buyers may want to explore other options and consider smartphones that better meet their expectations and requirements. The substandard user experience from the XY100 has left me feeling frustrated and disappointed, leaving me to question the credibility of the manufacturer's claims and ultimately making me reconsider my future purchasing decisions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"What did Lyell suggest to Darwin as a solution to the issue of Darwin and Wallace both coming up with similar ideas?\\" is in \\"Darwin was hard at work on his \\"big book\\" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \\"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\\" and he would \\"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\\" that Wallace chose, adding that \\"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\\". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, by Wallace and Darwin respectively, were read out but drew little reaction. While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Some historians have suggested that Wallace was actually discussing group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"In response to the issue of Darwin and Wallace coming up with similar ideas on evolution and natural selection, Charles Lyell, a close friend of Darwin, offered a solution to ensure that both the scientists would receive credit for their work. Lyell, alongside Sir Joseph Hooker, suggested that a joint publication should be put together, combining Wallace's received pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Asa Gray. This joint publication was presented at the Linnean Society on 1 July 1858. The papers were titled \\"On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection\\" with respective contributions by Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Darwin. Despite the joint publication, the presentation drew little reaction at that time, and historians have since pointed out some differences in how each of them described natural selection. While Darwin focused on competition between individuals and drew comparisons to artificial selection, Wallace emphasized ecological pressures and local adaptation, without referring to selective breeding. Some historians even suggest that Wallace's idea was closer to group selection rather than individual variation.

We have five beautiful children together and they remain our top priority. We ask for your privacy during this time.”      The president’s daughter-in-law filed for an uncontested proceeding, meaning she’s not likely to fight her ex for custody of the couple’s five children or over their assets.      Legal experts say the former couple likely has a prenuptial agreement.      “Prenuptial agreements and confidentiality agreements are in the Trump dynasty DNA so I would be surprised if Donald Jr. went into the marriage completely naked,” said divorce lawyer Michael Stutman, of the firm Stutman Stutman & Lichtenstein LLP. He is not involved in the case.      Vanessa and Don Jr., ​both ​40, were married in 2005.      Page Six first reported that they were struggling with marital problems related to Don Jr.’s travels and controversial tweets.      The filing comes the same day as special counsel Robert Mueller subpoenaed President Trump’s family business, demanding that the Trump Organization release information related to Russia.      Don Jr. and his younger brother Eric Trump have been running their father’s company while he’s in office.      Nancy Chemtob, another family law expert who is not representing either party, said Vanessa could invoke spousal immunity to avoid testifying against her husband while their divorce is still pending.      Chemtob speculated that Vanessa may be filing for the split now to secure a financial settlement before the Mueller probe potentially puts her husband’s assets at risk. ||||| \\"After 12 years of marriage, we have decided to go our separate ways.

Generally, people use umbrellas to protect themselves from rain, not snow. When it snows, the snowflakes are usually lighter, and it's not very common for people to close their umbrellas while it's snowing. However, it is still possible that someone might decide to close their umbrella in this situation.

Background: Liuzzo was born Viola Fauver Gregg on April 1, 1925, in the small town of California, Pennsylvania, the elder daughter of Eva Wilson, a teacher, and Heber Ernest Gregg, a coal miner and World War I veteran. He left school in the eighth grade but taught himself to read. Her mother, Eva Wilson Gregg, had a teaching certificate from the University of Pittsburgh. Context: The next phase of the lengthy process began when a federal trial charged the defendants with conspiracy to intimidate African Americans under the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act, a Reconstruction civil rights statute. The charges did not specifically refer to Liuzzo's murder. On December 3, the trio were found guilty by an all-white, all-male jury, and were sentenced to ten years in prison, a landmark in southern legal history.  While out on appeal, Wilkins and Thomas were each found guilty of firearms violations and sent to jail for those crimes. During this period, the January 15, 1966, edition of the Birmingham News published an ad offering Liuzzo's bullet-ridden car for sale. Asking 3,500, the ad read, \\"Do you need a crowd-getter? I have a 1963 Oldsmobile two-door in which Mrs. Viola Liuzzo was killed. Bullet holes and everything intact. Ideal to bring in crowds.\\"  After all three defendants were convicted of the federal charges, state murder cases proceeded against Eaton and Thomas. Eaton, the only defendant who remained out of jail, died of a heart attack on March 9. Thomas's state murder trial - the final trial - got under way on September 26, 1966. The prosecution built a strong circumstantial case in the trial that included an FBI ballistics expert testifying that the bullet removed from the woman's brain was fired from a revolver owned by Thomas. Two witnesses testified they had seen Wilkins drinking beer at a VFW Hall near Birmingham, 125 miles from the murder scene, an hour or less after Liuzzo was shot. Despite the presence of eight African Americans on the jury, Thomas was acquitted of the state murder charge the following day after just 90 minutes of deliberations. State attorney general Richmond Flowers, Sr. criticized the verdict, deriding the black members of the panel, who had been carefully screened, as \\"Uncle Toms.\\"  On April 27, 1967, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans upheld the federal convictions of the surviving defendants. Thomas served six years in prison for the crime. Due to threats from the Klan, both before and after his testimony, Gary Thomas Rowe went into the federal witness protection program. Rowe died in 1998 in Savannah, Georgia, after having lived several decades under several assumed identities. Question: What were the results of the trial?. Whats the answer?","output":"The results of the trial were that three men were found guilty of conspiracy to intimidate African Americans under the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act. They were sentenced to ten years in prison, which was a significant moment in southern legal history. Two of them were also found guilty of firearms violations. When the state murder trial happened, one defendant died before it started, and the other, Thomas, was found not guilty. Later, the federal convictions were upheld, and Thomas served six years in prison for the crime."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The couple had separated in 2010. Deacon Allan is very upset with his wife, Pastor Deborah, because he thinks she did not pay him for some special lessons he gave her. These lessons were for playing music and arranging flowers, which are skills that help make their church beautiful and enjoyable for everybody. Deacon Allan was so unhappy about this situation that he decided to go to a special place called an employment tribunal. An employment tribunal is where people go when they have problems related to their work. It is like a court, but instead of a judge, there are people called tribunal members who listen to both sides of the story and help decide the best solution. Deacon Allan told the tribunal that he felt \\"robbed\\" because his wife did not pay him for the lessons he provided. He is not giving up and wants to keep fighting for his case using the legal system. The legal system is a set of rules and processes that helps people in the country solve their problems fairly. In this story of Deacon Allan and Pastor Deborah, it is important to remember that even though they are grown-ups and have important jobs at their church, they still have disagreements like everyone else. Sometimes, people need to ask for help from others to solve problems, like going to a tribunal or using the legal system."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Read the article and select the best answer.

The University of Florida’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said Tuesday they are working together on the project as well as one that involves using detector dogs to help remove pythons.      UF/IFAS wildlife biologist, Frank Mazzotti, and his team are working with the Irula tribe, and on Jan. 17, four pythons were removed from the Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge.      “It is outstanding that they have been able to remove pythons from Key Largo,” said Mazzotti. “And to get four pythons, including a 16-foot female, is just incredible.”      Traditionally, the main occupation of the Irula tribe has been catching snakes. They have successfully hunted and captured Indian pythons in their home province of Tamil Nadu.      Two tribesmen and two translators arrived in early January and will be in South Florida through February. The FWC is funding the 68,888 project.      Efforts by UF/IFAS researcher, Christina Romagosa, and her team involve working with Auburn University’s Canine Performance Sciences Program. Work by the Auburn/UF detection dog team has focused on searches performed in Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge, and has helped the Irula tribe find the location of and ultimately capture the snakes.      Detection dogs, trained by Auburn University, use scent profiles of pythons to help target search areas.

It's impossible to say Based on the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that Charles Rashad Jamaal Brown wanted to play for the New England Patriots. The details given outline his football career, including his time in college and the teams he played for in the NFL, namely, the New Orleans Saints, New York Giants, and Dallas Cowboys. However, there is no mention of any connection or interest Brown had in playing for the Patriots.  In general, a player's desire or intention to play for a specific team can be influenced by factors such as individual preferences, professional aspirations, relationships with team members or management, geographic location, or even specific contractual negotiations. However, since none of these factors are addressed in the information provided about Brown, it is impossible to say whether or not he wanted to play for the Patriots. In order to have a more accurate understanding of Brown's preferences regarding the Patriots or any other team, we would need additional information about his personal and professional interests and background, as well as any potential connections or interactions with the Patriots organization and its personnel.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Ukrainian Skier and Coach Withdraw to Protest Kiev Violence KRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia — Two members of Ukraine’s Olympic team withdrew from the Sochi Games on Thursday in a show of solidarity with protesters who are locked in a violent conflict with their government in the capital city of Kiev. Bogdana Matsotska, an Alpine skier, and her father and coach, Oleg Matsotskyy, announced on Matsotskyy’s Facebook page that they would be leaving Sochi before Matsotska had finished competing. Matsotska, 24, will not take part in the women’s slalom, which is scheduled for Friday. Other Ukrainian athletes have left the Games to return to their homeland, though reports have indicated that most of them had completed their events. Others, like the figure skater Natalia Popova, have remained in Sochi. After finishing her figure skating short program on Wednesday night, Popova said that she had not tracked the protests on television because she did not have a TV in her room here, “but my friends and family have been telling me that it’s getting worse.” She added: “That’s very unfortunate because you just want peace everywhere. But all I can do is just focus on my performance and, hopefully, my skating can inspire the people back in Ukraine to be more peaceful with each other.” In explaining the decision to leave early, Matsotskyy wrote in his Facebook post that “as a protest against lawless actions made towards protesters, the lack of responsibility from the side of the president and his lackey government, we refuse further performance at the 2014 Sochi Olympic Games.” It is believed that at least 25 people have died and hundreds more were injured in a confrontation in Kiev this week. Along with his message, Matsotskyy posted a picture that appeared to be of him and Matsotska, standing in front of the Olympic rings and holding a Ukrainian flag. He wrote that he and his daughter had come to Sochi hoping that President Viktor F. Yanukovych and his government would negotiate peacefully with the opposition during the Olympics. They added that they believed the violence that erupted against protesters was a “violation of the old principle of the Games — the Olympic Truce.” The situation in Kiev has lingered over the Ukrainians’ participation in Sochi from the beginning of the Games. The Ukrainian Olympic Committee petitioned Olympic officials for permission to give their athletes black armbands to wear during competition, as a way to honor those who were killed during the violence. That request was rejected, as Olympic rules are strict when it comes to the uniformity of equipment and apparel. In the Olympic Village, Ukrainian athletes on Thursday added black mourning bands to the blue and yellow Ukrainian flags hanging from the balconies of the rooms where they are staying. In a statement on Wednesday, the Ukrainian team had expressed condolences for the dead and appealed for peace. “We are thinking about our families and loved ones back home in Ukraine, and we are doing our best to honor them on the fields of play here in Sochi,” the team said. “We appeal for peace and mutual understanding to find a positive way forward for Ukraine.” Sergei Bubka, a former pole vault champion and president of the Ukrainian Olympic Committee, issued a separate statement, in which he called for dialogue. “For the sake of the future of our kids let’s do everything possible to get back to negotiations and make a compromise,” he wrote on his blog. Sochi’s local government did approve a request for a demonstration related to the Ukrainian protest. The approved protest zone is in the city of Khosta, on the road between the city of Sochi and the Olympic Park, roughly eight miles from the Olympic venues in the coastal cluster. “One of the topics that has been approved is the events in Ukraine, which is the hot potato right now,” Anton Gusev, an official with Russia’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, said Thursday. Top Ukrainian officials have also been in Sochi as part of Lviv’s’s bid to host the 2022 Olympics. Bubka said he did not see why the current conflict should stand in the way of the bid. “It is eight years before the Games start,” he said. “I think it will be settled. We are building our future and democracy. People have the possibility to express their views. Many issues in this moment will be solved shortly. Politicians are working very hard to make change and improve the situation in our country.” An earlier version of this article misidentified the Ukrainian city that is bidding for the 2022 Olympic Games. It is Lviv, not Kiev. An earlier of this article misspelled the given name of the president of the Ukrainian Olympic Committee. He is Sergei Bubka, not Sergie.

Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday that North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il is using his claims of a successful rocket launch to shore up his political strength within his country. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright discusses North Korea on CNN's \\"American Morning\\" on Tuesday. Albright, who was secretary of state in the Clinton administration, told CNN's \\"American Morning\\" that \\"it was a huge mistake for the United States to stop talking to North Korea\\" when the Bush administration took over. The communist nation launched the rocket over the weekend in defiance of international opposition. Satellite images released Monday appear to show the rocket in flight, according to a  nonprofit institution that focuses on stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. The following is a transcript of Albright's conversation with CNN's Carol Costello. Carol Costello, CNN: We do have this video from North Korea of this rocket taking off. What do you make of that? Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright: Well, I think that the North Korean leadership is living in a parallel universe of acting as if the launch was a success, when tracking and everything has shown that in fact, it is a failure. And I think it proves a point, which is that the North Koreans, Kim Jong-Il is doing this for his own internal reasons -- because on Thursday, tomorrow, there will be a rubber stamp by the parliament of his leadership -- and the problems that he's generally had since he had his stroke. So this is part of their kind of Orwellian approach of saying that \\"This is what happened, and wasn't it a success,\\" when we know it wasn't. Costello: The U.N. Security Council hasn't been able to come up with any sort of resolution because apparently that body is split. President Obama made a really big deal of this and said this was like a clear violation. It sort of seems like the United States is stuck, and it can't do anything about North Korea. Albright: Well, I don't think that's true, because what has happened is there have been individual condemnations by leaders of various countries. And I have to say from my own experience of the United Nations, it does take a while to get the 15 members [of the Security Council] together. But the saddest for me is the fact that the U.N. passed a resolution, 1718, which said that this was not acceptable. So the truth is that the U.N. has to live up to its own resolutions. And Ambassador Rice, I think, is working very hard up there in order to get some action, but there have been condemnations already throughout the world. And the bottom line here is that President Obama's speech, for instance, in Prague, when he talked about the importance of cooperation generally on a whole nonproliferation regime -- it's very clear that there's going to have to be a lot of work on that and that President Obama laid out a very, very important set of goals. amFIX: Your thoughts on the rocket launch. Costello: And, you know, there has been some criticism that President Obama turned to the U.N. to try to solve this crisis. I want to read you a quote from Politico. It interviewed Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House. I want to read you his quote. Newt Gingrich said, \\"The embarrassing repudiation of the United States appeal to the United Nations Security Council Sunday afternoon is a vivid demonstration of weakness. This is beginning to resemble the Carter administration's weakness in foreign policy.\\" How would you respond to that? Albright: Well, I think that it's just kind of typical of Newt Gingrich, frankly. But the bottom line here is, I think the United States and President Obama has made very clear the leadership of the United States, his concern about, generally, proliferation issues. I think his trip, for instance, laid out a whole set of issues that prove that American leadership is essential, the respect that he gained for American leadership. And I think you're going to see additional ways that we all work together, because the issues that are out there that have to be dealt with require cooperation, and they will require international organizations and cooperation through NATO and a number of activities. So I'm very confident that President Obama is going to be able to prove American leadership. Costello: Well, I guess many Americans look at it this way, you know: You talk about sanctions, but sanctions have been instituted against North Korea before, and it hasn't really worked. North Korea just seems to kind of do what it wants. You've met Kim Jong-Il. I mean, what does he want? Albright:  Well, what he wants is respect. And I have to say that part of the problem here is -- and as you mentioned, I met Kim Jong-Il. We were in the middle of negotiations with him. In fact, we had a missile moratorium. And President Bush came in and canceled those talks. It was confusing to everybody. And I do think that what is important now is to get the North Koreans back into the six-party talks, to make it clear to them that the only way that they are going to have respect is to abide by international regulations and to try to deal with the fact that they would be better off if, in fact, they allowed their people to be fed and an economy that functions, rather than be living in this way where poverty is rampant, and hunger, in every way in North Korea, and a leadership that is shaky. But the bottom line is, I think it was a huge mistake for the United States to stop talking to North Korea. And in the interim period, they were able to develop material in order to create nuclear weapons, and so I hope very much that the six-party talks continue. Costello: We'll see. Madam Secretary, thanks so much for joining us this morning. We appreciate it. Thank you. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"The key highlights from the conversation with former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright are as follows: 1. Albright commented on North Korea's rocket launch, suggesting the North Korean leadership is deluded and living in a parallel universe by claiming the launch as a success despite tracking evidence showing the contrary. She believed Kim Jong-Il is using the launch to firm up his political strength within his country. 2. Albright dismissed notions that the U.S. is stuck and unable to do anything about North Korea, pointing to individual condemnations from leaders worldwide and stressing the need for the United Nations to live up to its own resolutions. 3. On the criticism of President Obama turning to the United Nations for crisis resolution, Albright defended Obama's focus on American leadership and the importance of international cooperation on nonproliferation and other security matters. 4. Discussing Kim Jong-Il's motivation, Albright remarked that he seeks respect and argued that the United States made a huge mistake by stopping talks with North Korea during the Bush administration. She emphasized the importance of bringing North Korea back to the six-party talks and abiding by international regulations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A recent clip that left audiences both baffled and amused involved a popular television personality clad in a leather harness and chains, hosting an interview with actors. As shocking as this may appear, this visual gag was cooked up by none other than legendary television host and comedienne, Ellen DeGeneres. In an impeccable demonstration of her practical joke prowess, Ellen DeGeneres and her team recently created a computer-generated clip featuring NBC host Matt Lauer in a rather… unconventional wardrobe. The digital prank depicted Lauer wearing a leather harness, complete with chains as he interviewed Hollywood celebrities on national television. Of course, the internet went wild with reactions, ranging from confusion and hilarity to sheer disbelief. The clip quickly gained a sizeable social media following, generating numerous shares, memes, and comments. Many were initially unsure if the video was genuine, with some even speculating about the reason behind Lauer choosing such an outfit for his interviews. However, the possibility of it being real was doused by the revelation that the entire scene was nothing more than the comedic genius of the one and only Ellen DeGeneres. Displaying their skill in digital manipulation, Ellen's team carefully crafted the video incorporating Lauer into a situation that treads the line between reality and fiction. It was done so convincingly that even long-time fans of the NBC host found it difficult to discern whether or not the clip was an authentic blooper. Upon being informed about this creative and hilarious act of mischief, Lauer couldn't help but chuckle at the joke he found himself in the center of. However, there was also a sense of playful defiance in his reaction. Lauer, being no stranger to practical jokes on television, embraced the humor while acknowledging that this amusing act of visual trickery deserved an equally memorable response. The NBC host was quick to assure all the fans who were puzzled by the peculiar clip that there was no need to doubt the fashion choices of their favorite television personalities. At the same time, Lauer announced his intention to settle the score, vowing to seek revenge on the comedienne for the unexpected prank in a light-hearted challenge. As of now, only time can tell what Lauer has in store for DeGeneres, but this episode has surely heightened anticipation among fans of both the hosts. The world of television is no stranger to pranks and gags, but when the comedienne extraordinaire Ellen DeGeneres meets the formidable charisma of Matt Lauer, you can only expect the unexpected."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room.

At their earlier dinner on New Year's Eve, George said that time was \\"the fourth dimension\\".

George bids his guests a good evening, then heads downstairs where his full-size time machine awaits. He presses a lever and moves forward through time 17 years into the future to September 15, 1917. He meets Filby's son, James, who tells him of Filby's death in a war.

Justification: Incentives drive motivation, which enhances the likelihood of task completion. Step 6: Share time management techniques. Justification: Effective time use keeps work focused and prevents burnout. Step 7: Support the implementation of a routine. Justification: Consistent habits result in steady progress towards meeting goals.

Answer:","output":"Question: Based on the information provided in the article, how old is the woman? A) 48 years old B) 50 years old C) 42 years old D) 54 years old Step 1: Identify the information from the article to construct the question. From the article, we learn that the woman got married at the age of 18, her husband was 30 then, and now her husband is 60. Step 2: Determine the difference in age between the woman and her husband. We know her husband is 12 years older than her, as he was 30 when they got married and she was 18. Step 3: Calculate the woman's age now. The article states that her husband is currently 60 years old, which is twice 30. Since her husband is 12 years older than her, we subtract 12 from 60 to get the woman's age: 60 - 12 = 48. Step 4: Generate answer choices. Create a set of plausible answer choices based on the calculation from Step 3. In this case, A) 48 years old is the correct choice, and B) 50 years old, C) 42 years old, and D) 54 years old are incorrect but plausible answers.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Moss was born in London, son of Alfred Moss, a dentist of Bray, Berkshire, and Aileen (nee Craufurd). He was brought up at Long White Cloud house on the right bank of the River Thames. His father was an amateur racing driver who had placed 16th at the 1924 Indianapolis 500. Stirling was a gifted horse rider as was his younger sister, Pat Moss, who became a successful rally driver and married Erik Carlsson. Although ostensibly retired from racing since 1962, Moss did make a number of one-off appearances in professional motorsport events in the following two decades. He also competed in the 1974 London-Sahara-Munich World Cup Rally in a Mercedes-Benz, but retired from the event in the Algerian Sahara. The Holden Torana he shared with Jack Brabham in the 1976 Bathurst 1000 was hit from behind on the grid and eventually retired with engine failure. Moss, at the wheel of the Torana when the V8 engine let go, was criticised by other drivers for staying on the racing line for over  2/3  of the 6.172 km long circuit while returning to the pits as the car was dropping large amounts of oil onto the road. He also shared a Volkswagen Golf GTI with Denny Hulme in the 1979 Benson & Hedges 500 at Pukekohe Park Raceway in New Zealand.  In 1980 he made a comeback to regular competition, in the British Saloon Car Championship with the works-backed GTi Engineering Audi team. For the 1980 season Moss was the team's number two driver to team co-owner Richard Lloyd. For the 1981 season Moss stayed with Audi, as the team moved to Tom Walkinshaw Racing management, driving alongside Martin Brundle.  Throughout his retirement he raced in events for historic cars, driving on behalf of and at the invitation of others, as well as campaigning his own OSCA FS 372 and other vehicles.  On 9 June 2011 during qualifying for the Le Mans Legends race, Moss announced on Radio Le Mans that he had finally retired from racing, saying that he had scared himself that afternoon. He was 81. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Who are some other drivers he raced with besides Jack Brabham?","output":"Aside from Jack Brabham, Stirling Moss raced with several other notable drivers throughout his career, including: 1. Denny Hulme - Moss shared a Volkswagen Golf GTI with Denny Hulme in the 1979 Benson & Hedges 500 at Pukekohe Park Raceway in New Zealand. 2. Richard Lloyd - Moss was the number two driver to team co-owner Richard Lloyd in the GTi Engineering Audi team during the 1980 British Saloon Car Championship. 3. Martin Brundle - In the 1981 season, Moss stayed with Audi as the team moved to Tom Walkinshaw Racing management and drove alongside Martin Brundle. Although not explicitly mentioned in the original text, Moss also likely raced with or against various other professional drivers in the numerous events he participated in during his long career."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The idea was to market third-party fund offerings to wealthy families and individuals with existing relationships to Forbes, although it also solicited capital commitments from traditional limited partners (endowments, pension funds, etc.).

Answer: The Kingdom of Bithynia managed to maintain its independence and significance among the minor monarchies of Anatolia through the strong leadership of its kings and strategic decisions. The native king Bas successfully defeated Calas, a general of Alexander the Great, and secured the independence of Bithynia after the region came under threat following Alexander's conquests. Zipoetes I, Bas' son, further maintained this autonomy against powerful figures like Lysimachus and Seleucus I and assumed the title of king in 297 BCE. During the reign of Nicomedes I and his successors, the kingdom held a considerable place in Anatolia due to the founding of Nicomedia and the city's subsequent prosperity. Nicomedes I also strategically invited the Celtic Galatians into Anatolia as mercenaries; however, they later turned on his son Prusias I, who managed to defeat them in battle. The kingdom's incorporation into the Roman Republic occurred after its last king, Nicomedes IV, struggled to maintain power against Mithridates VI of Pontus.

Article: On the first day of school I brought my camera to school. I gave the students a piece of 8 x11 cardboard , and asked them to write their names on both sides. As they finished, I asked them to get into groups of three to four students and took photographs of them holding their name cards. After school, I developed the film and printed two sets of photos. That evening, I started to match the names with the faces. I kept one set of pictures at home for about a week so that I could review their names each night. On the second day of school, I put up the other set of photos as a bulletin board  , with a title such as \\"Presenting Room 108, ...\\" The kids loved it! After I had learned all of their names I brought the second set back to school and stuck them onto an 8 x11 sheet of paper. I placed it in the classroom for other teachers. The cardboard name cards that were made on the first day were collected and put on a shelf. From time to time, they were given back to the students and placed on their desks so that guests or supply teachers   could identify all of the students. I've been doing this with my grade 7 students for the last nine years and they liked it. It's fun to bring the photos out again at the end of the school year to see how much they have all changed in ten months. Question: Why did the writer leave the second set of the photos at home?

Yes Both sentences essentially convey the same meaning, which is that Spain recognized Irish nobles on equal terms as Spaniards, and Irish citizens could claim Spanish citizenship. The only difference is the choice of words and their structure within the sentences.  In the first sentence, \\"Spain recognized Irish nobles on equal footing as Spaniards\\" and \\"Irish could claim Spanish citizenship\\" emphasize the equality between Irish nobles and Spaniards as well as the ability of Irish citizens to claim Spanish citizenship. The phrase \\"on equal footing\\" is utilized to express the equal status of the two groups. In the second sentence, \\"Spain recognized Irish nobles as Spaniards on equal terms\\" and \\"Irish citizens could claim Spanish citizenship\\" follow the same idea. The equality between the Irish nobles and Spaniards is conveyed through the phrase \\"on equal terms.\\" The rest of the sentence focuses on the same concept of Irish citizens having the opportunity to claim Spanish citizenship.

Tocqueville thought the conquest of Algeria was important for two reasons: first, his understanding of the international situation and France's position in the world, and, second, changes in French society. Tocqueville believed that war and colonization would \\"restore national pride, threatened\\", he believed, by \\"The gradual softening of social mores\\" in the middle classes. Their taste for \\"material pleasures\\" was spreading to the whole of society, giving it \\"an example of weakness and egotism\\". Applauding the methods of General Bugeaud, Tocqueville went so far to claim that \\"war in Africa is a science. Everyone is familiar with its rules and everyone can apply those rules with almost complete certainty of success. One of the greatest services that Field Marshal Bugeaud has rendered his country is to have spread, perfected and made everyone aware of this new science.\\" Tocqueville advocated racial segregation in Algeria with two distinct legislations, one for European colonists and one for the Arab population. Such a two-tier arrangement would be fully realised with the 1870 Cremieux decree and the Indigenousness Code, which extended French citizenship to European settlers and Algerian Jews, whereas Muslim Algerians would be governed by Muslim law and restricted to a second-class citizenship.

The second of Knox's lawyers to speak, Luciano Ghirga, said Knox was \\"very afraid but her heart is full of hope and she hopes to return to freedom.\\"  Her \\"image was massacred\\" by the media and the attacks on her character started before the trial, he said, adding that he considered her as a daughter.  Concluding an emotional appearance, he appealed to the jury to put themselves in the shoes of Knox's family -- a counterpoise to the words of appeals court prosecutor Giancarlo Costagliola, who asked the jury to put themselves in the shoes of Kercher's family at the start of the closing arguments a week ago.  1.

Start with a genuine compliment or a question that shows your interest in their opinions, experiences, or thoughts. This will provide a comfortable environment for the both of you to begin interacting. As the conversation progresses, let your body language convey your intentions subtly by mirroring their gestures, maintaining eye contact, and leaning slightly towards them, which emphasizes your engagement in the conversation. Give them your full attention, actively listen, and respond thoughtfully to ensure that the interaction remains enjoyable and meaningful for both parties. Look for an opportune moment to bring up a common interest or a specific event, such as a movie, a new restaurant, or an art exhibit, that you would like to share with them. You can then casually suggest that the two of you engage in this activity together. For example, say something like, \\"Have you heard about the new Italian restaurant that just opened downtown? It looks really amazing, and I've been wanting to give it a try. Would you be interested in joining me for dinner there sometime?\\" Keep the tone light and playful to avoid putting too much pressure on the other person. Remember that they may need some time to think, so don't rush them in their decision-making. If they accept your offer, exchange contact information, and agree on a date and time for the proposed activity. Be sure to follow up with a message or a phone call as the date approaches to confirm the details and express your enthusiasm to spend time together. If they decline or are unable to commit to a specific date, don't be discouraged. They may genuinely have prior commitments, or they may simply need more time to get to know you better before agreeing to a one-on-one outing. In this case, maintain a positive attitude, express your understanding, and consider inviting them to a group event instead, where they might feel more at ease and can still enjoy your company. Building a connection based on mutual interests, respect, and trust takes time and effort from both parties involved. Remember to stay patient, authentic, and open-minded throughout the process.

Oral Rehydration Solution is a vital tool in treating mild to moderate dehydration, particularly in cases of diarrhea and vomiting. The main aim of ORS is to prevent or treat dehydration by replenishing lost fluids and electrolytes, rather than stopping diarrhea. It does this by providing an optimal mix of water, sugar, and salt, which facilitates the absorption of fluids and electrolytes in the intestines. The WHO's recipe for ORS consists of the following ingredients: 1. One liter of clean drinking water. 2. One teaspoon (approx. 3 grams) of salt. 3. Two tablespoons (approx. 18 grams) of sugar. These ingredients should be combined and mixed well until both the sugar and salt are dissolved. The resulting solution should have a taste similar to tears. It is important to note that ORS does not provide essential nutrients or calories and should not replace regular meals for those who can tolerate it. Moreover, severe dehydration or persistent illness should always be treated by a healthcare professional, as they might need further evaluation and intravenous (IV) rehydration. In summary, the WHO's recipe for homemade ORS consists of one liter of water with one teaspoon of salt and two tablespoons of sugar added.

A London firm has created a £10 (15) micro-sized projector that can display instagram pictures on a nearby wall. The Projecteo project has become a huge hit online - reaching its funding target on the Kickstarter site in less than 24 hours. Scroll down for video. The projecto is a tiny replica of a slide projector that can display instagram pictures printed onto film. 'Projecteo is a tiny Instagram projector,' the site says. 'It uses wheels of 35mm slide film you make online and each one holds nine photos. 'Whether they're of your best friends, that holiday last summer or good old pictures of cats, just pop them into Projecteo, focus by twisting the lens barrel and sit back to enjoy your slideshow.' Benjamin Redford of London Agency Mint, which created the product, said he was amazed by the response. 'It's been wicked,' he said. 'We hit our funding target in under 24 hours, and the response has been incredible.' The projector is a fully working system that uses pictures printed onto Kodak film instead of traditional slides. Inside the projector is a single LED light which projects the image when focused. The firm says the projector works exactly like a normal sized one. 'Like all projectors, Projecteo works best in the dark,' they say. 'We've had great looking images up to two and a half feet wide in a pitch black room. 'Unlike screens, slide film doesn't have pixels. 'This means you get beautiful looking images from a device the size of a matchbox.' The projector is designed to look like a retro slide proctor, complete with slide carousel. The images are first chosen on an app, which send the order to Mint.

Whether it's due to budget constraints, time shortages, or the desire to learn a new skill, many people opt for DIY haircuts. In this article, we will provide expert guidance on how to properly cut your hair at home. Follow the steps below to achieve a salon-worthy outcome. Step 1: Prepare Your Hair and Tools Before beginning the haircut, it's crucial to have your tools ready and your hair in optimal condition. You will need a sharp pair of hairdressing scissors, a wide-toothed comb, a fine-toothed comb, a spray bottle filled with water, and a few hair clips to section your hair. Ensure that your scissors are specifically designed for hair-cutting; using any other type of scissors may lead to uneven and damaged hair. Step 2: Wet the Hair and Comb Out Any Tangles To achieve a more accurate and even cut, it's essential to wet your hair before cutting. Wet hair is easier to handle and allows the scissors to glide more smoothly, preventing any snags or inadvertent tears. Use a spray bottle to dampen your hair evenly, making sure not to drench it too much as this could weigh it down and lead to an uneven cut. Once your hair is damp, use a wide-toothed comb to gently work through any tangles or knots. Removing these will help in achieving a precise haircut and prevent any pulling or pain during the process. Don't forget to pay special attention to the ends, as they tend to have the most tangles. Step 3: Section Your Hair Dividing your hair into sections will help you maintain control while cutting and ensure a more even outcome. Start by using the fine-toothed comb to create a center parting from the front of your hair to the nape of your neck. Then, divide each half into smaller sections, using hair clips to keep them separate. Aim for approximately 2-inch-wide sections depending on the thickness of your hair. For curly or wavy hair, this may require smaller sections, while those with fine hair could manage slightly wider ones. Step 4: Begin Cutting Your Hair Now, it's time to start cutting. Hold the comb in your non-dominant hand and use it to lift a thin, 2-inch-long section of hair away from your scalp, pinching it between your index and middle fingers. Ensure that your fingers are perpendicular to the scalp, and be mindful not to pull the hair too taut, as this could result in an uneven cut. Hold the scissors in your dominant hand and angle them straight down, parallel to the section of hair held between your fingers. Carefully snip the ends, starting at the bottom and gradually working your way up to the top of the section. For a more natural look or to add soft layers, bevel the scissors at a slight angle as you trim upwards. Always cut slightly less than you initially intended, as it's easier to make further adjustments later if needed.  Step 5: Continue with the Remaining Sections After cutting the first section, release another section from your clips and repeat the process, using the previously cut section as a guide. Work your way around your head, being mindful to keep the sections thin, so that you maintain control and precision. Continuously check for symmetry as you cut, adjusting as needed. In Conclusion Cutting your hair at home can be a daunting task, but with patience and the right technique, it's possible to achieve professional-quality results. Remember to be patient, go slow, and don't hesitate to ask for help if needed. Use these expert tips to trim and maintain your hair in between salon visits or to experiment with a new look in the comfort of your home."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Summarize the following: It’s important to loosen up your muscles before you begin to exercise. This can prevent injuries and reduces the risk of cramps while you run. Do a set of walking lunges. Take a large step forward with your right leg so that your left leg is extended far behind you. Lower yourself until your right thigh is parallel to the floor. Make sure your left knee doesn’t touch the ground and that your right knee is above your right ankle! Repeat for the left leg and do ten lunges per leg. Hold on to a sturdy object such as a chair. Stand on one leg and swing your other leg forward and backward. Make sure to go through your full range of motion; this means swinging your leg up as high as is comfortable and then extending it behind your back as high as you can. Repeat for both legs. Don’t swing your leg haphazardly or you may hurt yourself. Try to swing your leg in a smooth, controlled motion. Even though you’ll be exhausted from running, it’s important to stretch so that your muscles don’t cramp up. Do some standing quads. Stand with your legs together. Bring your left foot behind your back to your left hand, keeping your thighs firmly pressed together. Press your foot with your hand, taking care not to overextend your leg. Face a wall and press your palms against the wall at chest-level. Press the ball of your left foot against the wall with your left heel on the ground.

However, litter sizes can occasionally range from 1 to 7 kits, depending on factors such as the mothers' age, health, and environmental conditions. Raccoon mothers give birth to their litters in a den, usually during the spring, after a gestation period of about 63 to 65 days. Baby raccoons are born blind and helpless, with their eyes opening at around 3 weeks of age. They wean at about 8 to 10 weeks, and remain with their mother through the first winter. After that, they gradually become independent and disperse to find their own territories. They reach sexual maturity at approximately 1 year of age for females and 2 years for males."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: At what lake in the area that has been covered by sea water at least seven times do nutrients quickly deteriorate? is inside the article: A vast marshland could only have been formed due to the underlying rock formations in southern Florida. The floor of the Everglades formed between 25 million and 2 million years ago when the Florida peninsula was a shallow sea floor. The peninsula has been covered by sea water at least seven times since the earliest bedrock formation. The rock that makes up the Everglades floor was created as layers of calcium carbonate were compressed by ocean water, making limestone. Fossilized bryozoans and tiny shells, or ooids, make the limestone porous. Water is stored in the rock, sometimes from one year to the next. The length of time that a region in the Everglades remains flooded, called a hydroperiod, determines what particular soils and vegetation are present. Shorter hydroperiods of three or four months promote the growth of periphyton: algae and other microscopic organisms covered with calcium carbonate crystals. Periphyton is the basic building block of marl, a calcitic mud. In areas with hydroperiods of longer than nine months, peat builds up over hundreds or thousands of years due to many generations of decaying plant matter. Peat and marl are considered nutrient-poor soils that foster the growth of specialized vegetation depending on the length of the regional hydroperiod. Five types of peat appear in the Everglades system; each type supports a specific type of vegetation, such as sawgrass, tree islands, or custard apple trees. Peat buildup is possible because water prevents oxygen from quickly decomposing plant matter. Once peat buildup reaches the surface, oxygen reacts with the microorganisms to decay the peat rapidly in a process called subsidence. Initial attempts at developing agriculture near Lake Okeechobee were successful, but the nutrients in the peat quickly deteriorated by drying, and were broken down by bacteria in the soil. The dried peat burned or was degraded into carbon dioxide and water by microorganisms. Some homes built near early farms had to restructure their foundations on stilts as..., can you guess it ?

Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly.  Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light. Yet, despite constant interrogations, just two meals of beans a day and a tiny cell with barely enough room to sleep, he says the worst part of prison was not knowing. Why were the family singing? - the hymns were shared from Sudan - they wanted to show Facebook - they wanted to persecute Christians - not enough information","output":"The Abduraheem family were singing hymns from their former home in Sudan, in Arabic, to share their faith and cultural background with their new neighbors at the Tar Wallet Baptist Church in Virginia."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Trying to snap a two-game losing skid, the Bills flew to FedExField for a Week 13 interconference duel with an emotionally charged Washington Redskins. Before the kickoff, the stadium held a memorial service for Sean Taylor, as well as all players across the NFL wearing a #21 sticker on the back of their helmets. Due to the recent poor play of QB J. P. Losman, rookie QB Trent Edwards once again got the start. In the first quarter, Buffalo trailed early as Redskins kicker Shaun Suisham managed to get a 27-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Bills continued to trail as Suisham kicked a 28-yard field goal.  Afterwards, Buffalo got on the board as LB Angelo Crowell sacked Washington QB Jason Campbell in his own endzone for a safety.  The Redskins would end the half with Suisham getting a 33-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Bills started to reply as kicker Rian Lindell got a 38-yard field goal, yet Washington replied with RB Clinton Portis getting a 3-yard TD run.  Buffalo would close out the period with Lindell kicking a 43-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Buffalo drew closer as Lindell kicked a 24-yarder, followed by a 33-yard field goal.  On the Bills final drive, Lindell managed to set up for a 51-yard field goal.  The first try was good, but Redskins Head Coach Joe Gibbs called time out.  After the first time out, Gibbs tried to call a second time out, which led to them getting called for unsportsmanlike conduct and the Bills moved 15 yards closer to the end zone, which reduced Lindell's field goal to 36 yards.  In the end, Lindell managed to nail the game-winning 36-yard field goal, squeaking a last second win in the dying seconds of the game. With the win, Buffalo snapped a two-game losing streak and improved to 6-6. Answer this question based on the article: How did the Bills finally get on the board?","output":"The Bills finally got on the board when their linebacker, Angelo Crowell, sacked the Washington Redskins' quarterback, Jason Campbell, in his own endzone.

Answer: At the same time, David H. Price's work on American anthropology during the Cold War provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies.  A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Choose from:  A). yes.  B). no.","output":"A) Yes. According to David H. Price, several anthropologists have been dismissed from their jobs due to alleged communist sympathies during the Cold War period. Price, an anthropologist and historian himself, has extensively researched and written on the intricate relationship between anthropology and politics, particularly focusing on how anthropologists have been targeted and marginalised for their political beliefs. There are multiple factors as to why some anthropologists faced dismissal from their jobs during this period: 1. Political climate: The Cold War era was marked by heightened political tensions and rhetoric between the United States and Soviet Union. The fear of communism infiltrating American society prompted a state of paranoia known as the 'Red Scare'. As a result, individuals with leftist or communist affiliations, or even perceived sympathies, were often subject to surveillance, harassment, and even professional consequences. 2. Academic affiliations: Anthropologists, given their research involving diverse cultures and societies, often came into contact with individuals and groups promoting alternative social and political ideologies. In the context of the Cold War, these encounters may have resulted in false assumptions or allegations of collusion with communist entities, placing their careers in jeopardy. 3. Susceptibility to political pressure: Universities and other research institutions, as primary employers of anthropologists, were vulnerable to political pressure from the government and other external organizations. In order to preserve their reputation and funding, such institutions may have been inclined to dismiss faculty members accused of communist sympathies, irrespective of the authenticity of such claims. 4. Professional and personal rivalries: The general environment of suspicion and distrust during the Cold War period provided a fertile ground for professional jealousy and personal vendettas to flourish. Accusing a rival anthropologist of communist affiliations could be a convenient way of damaging their reputation and career prospects, potentially leading to dismissal. 5. Ethical concerns: Anthropologists generally strive to provide an unbiased and holistic understanding of human societies and cultures. However, the perceived alignment with a particular political ideology, in this case communism, might have raised concerns about the ethical integrity of the anthropologist and the objectivity of their research. Consequently, institutions might have chosen to dissociate from such individuals to maintain credibility. In conclusion, David H. Price's work highlights the influence of political, institutional, and personal factors on the dismissal of anthropologists from their jobs due to alleged communist sympathies during the Cold War era. The situation reflects the precarious balance between academic freedom, political ideologies, and the quest for knowledge in the field of anthropology."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Process: - Rock begins as magma from a volcano - The magma cools - Crystals form and the magma become igneous rocks - The igneous rocks break down into sediment - Become sedimentary rocks - If subjected to heat and/or pressure from plate-tectonic activity the sedimentary rocks become metamorphic rock - The metamorphic rocks melt - Become magma again.  Question: suppose there are more crystals that form happens, how will it affect MORE igneous rock forming.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"If there are more crystals that form, this could potentially lead to a greater amount of igneous rock forming. This is because the cooling and crystallization process is an essential part of the transformation of magma into igneous rocks.  The second effect mentioned is the breakdown of igneous rocks into sediment, which later becomes sedimentary rocks. An increase in the amount of igneous rocks formed due to more crystals forming could lead to more sediment being produced as these rocks break down. This, in turn, could lead to an increased formation of sedimentary rocks. So, the perturbation would have a 'more' effect on the second effect mentioned, as an increased formation of igneous rocks would likely result in a greater quantity of sediment and, consequently, more sedimentary rocks being formed in the long run."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

KAPITOLA 18 Doba před svítáním v uličkách karavanní stanice nebyla tak smolně černá jako noc v horách. Translate to English","output":"CHAPTER 18 The time before dawn in the alleys of the caravanserai was not as pitch black as the night in the mountains. In this chapter, the scene depicted is set during the pre-dawn hours at a caravanserai, which is a roadside inn or resting place for travelers typically found in the countries of the Middle East and Central Asia. As the translation suggests, the darkness experienced at the caravanserai is relatively less than that of the mountains during the nighttime. The caravanserais were vital during ancient trade routes, especially along the Silk Road, as they served as places for travelers to rest, eat, and seek shelter, often within the safety of a walled enclosure. They were essential for facilitating commerce between countries and played a significant role in cultural and knowledge exchange between various regions. The distinction made between the darkness of night in the mountains and the pre-dawn hours at the caravanserai signifies the contrast between the isolated and dangerous conditions of the mountainous wilderness and the relative safety provided by the caravanserai. The mountains at night symbolize the uncertainty, risk, and isolation that travelers face during their journeys. Conversely, the caravanserai represents a beacon of safety and refuge where travelers, merchants, and traders can find rest before continuing their difficult journey. The pre-dawn moment provides a sense of anticipation and renewal, as the night's darkness is about to fade and the new day is beginning. By setting the scene during the early hours before dawn, the author emphasizes the transition between the darkness and the light, a theme that can be metaphorically linked to the unfolding story and its characters' experiences. The pre-dawn hours are a liminal space, much like the caravanserai itself, where travelers are between destinations, caught in a moment that is neither completely dark nor entirely light. This interstitial space can serve as a backdrop for exploring themes such as change, transformation, and the potential for new beginnings. In summary, this line from Chapter 18 describes a scene occurring just before sunrise at a caravanserai, where the darkness is not as intense as the impenetrable blackness of night in the mountains. The passage metaphorically highlights the contrast between danger and safety, isolation and community, and the transitions that occur in liminal spaces. The caravanserai, as a refuge for weary travelers, underscores the importance of such establishments in facilitating trade and cultural exchange in ancient times and contributes to the larger themes present in the narrative."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information:  - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.   - In ecclesiastical heraldry, papal coats of arms (those of individual popes) and those of the Holy See and Vatican City State include an image of crossed keys to represent the metaphorical keys of the office of Saint Peter, the keys of heaven, or the keys of the kingdom of Heaven, that, according to Roman Catholic teaching, Jesus promised to Saint Peter, empowering him to take binding actions. In the Gospel of Matthew , Jesus says to Peter, \\"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven.\\" The keys of heaven or keys of Saint Peter are seen as a symbol of papal authority: \\"Behold he [Peter] received the keys of the kingdom of heaven, the power of binding and loosing is committed to him, the care of the whole Church and its government is given to him [cura ei totius Ecclesiae et principatus committitur (Epist., lib. V, ep. xx, in P.L., LXXVII, 745)]\\".  - The Papal conclave of October 1978 was triggered by the death, after only thirty-three days in office, of Pope John Paul I on 28 September. When the cardinals elected John Paul I on 26 August, they expected he would reign for at least a decade. Instead they found themselves having to elect his successor within six weeks. The conclave to elect John Paul I's successor began on 14 October, and ended two days later, on 16 October, after eight ballots. The cardinals elected Cardinal Karol Wojtya, then Archbishop of Kraków, as the new pope. Resulting in the most recent Year of Three Popes, he accepted his election and took the pontifical name of \\"John Paul II\\".  - Karol : A Man Who Became Pope ( pl : Karol - Czowiek , który zosta Papieem , it : Karol , un uomo diventato Papa ) is a 2005 TV miniseries directed by Giacomo Battiato , and created as a Polish - Italian - French - German and Canadian joint cooperation project . Karol is a biography of Karol Wojtya , later known as Pope John Paul II , beginning in 1939 when Karol was only 19 years old and ending at the Papal conclave , October 1978 that made him Pope . The TV miniseries was supposed to première at the very beginning of April 2005 in the Vatican , but it was delayed due to the Pope 's death . It was broadcast for the first time by the Italian television station Canale 5 on the first day of the 2005 papal election . Although it was originally broadcast on television , it was also released in theaters , which allowed the film to be shown in Poland . The incredible success of the movie prompted the creation of a sequel , Karol : The Pope , The Man ( 2006 ) , which portrayed Karol 's life as Pope from his papal inauguration to his death .  - Jesus (; c. 4 BC  c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.  - Pope John Paul I, born Albino Luciani (17 October 191228 September 1978), served as Pope from 26 August 1978 to his sudden death 33 days later. His reign is among the shortest in papal history, resulting in the most recent Year of Three Popes, the first to occur since 1605. John Paul I remains the most recent Italian-born pope, ending a succession of such popes that started with Clement VII in 1523. He was declared a Servant of God by his successor, Pope John Paul II, on 23 November 2003, the first step on the road to sainthood.  - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments.  - A papal conclave is a meeting of the College of Cardinals convened to elect a new Bishop of Rome, also known as the Pope. The pope is considered by Roman Catholics to be the apostolic successor of Saint Peter and earthly head of the Roman Catholic Church. The conclave has been the procedure for choosing the pope for almost a thousand years, and is the oldest ongoing method for choosing the leader of an institution.  - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.

They had been friends since their childhood, sharing a bond that only grew stronger with time. Lawrence had always been the more adventurous one of the two, while Joseph preferred calm, intellectual pursuits. When Lawrence enlisted in the military, Joseph supported his decision wholeheartedly, knowing that his friend's dedication to protecting their nation was genuine. However, their differing paths only seemed to deepen the connection between them. Joseph often envied the tales of camaraderie and brotherhood shared with Lawrence upon his return from military duties. During the deployment, they would exchange letters, and Lawrence often regaled Joseph with colorful accounts of his comrades, the missions, and the military life in general. Joseph, in turn, took solace in his academic pursuits and would share intricate details about the subjects he was passionate about. From politics and astronomy to science fiction novels, they maintained a strong bond and enjoyed their intellectual exchanges. Years passed, and it was Lawrence's final tour of duty before his honorable discharge from the military. Word spread of a dangerous mission his unit was about to embark upon—one that had high stakes and an unprecedented level of risk. Joseph was understandably anxious, fearing for his friend's safety. He expressed his concerns in the letters, to which Lawrence reassured him that his training and the support of his fellow soldiers would be enough to see them through any adversity they may face. The day of the mission arrived. Unbeknownst to Lawrence, Joseph had not slept a wink, keeping a vigil for his friend's safety. Meanwhile, Lawrence's unit carried out their operation under the cover of darkness, relying on stealth and precision to achieve their objective. Unfortunately, unforeseen complications arose, and the mission went awry. Upon receiving news of the failed mission, Joseph's world was shattered. His worst fears had come to pass; Lawrence was listed among the missing in action. The days turned into weeks, and despite the military's continuous search and rescue efforts, they could not locate any trace of Lawrence. Joseph struggled to move forward in the absence of his friend, his heart filled with a blend of sorrow and anger. Determined to honor Lawrence's memory, Joseph dedicated himself to researching and applying advancements in military technology, hoping that his work could prevent such a tragedy from befalling someone else's beloved friend or family member. Through years of diligent study and collaboration with experts in the field, Joseph played a vital role in the development of lifesaving equipment and innovative communication systems that would ultimately change the face of modern warfare and rescue operations. It was during this time that Joseph's efforts paid off in an unexpected way. Ten years after Lawrence had been declared missing in action, a recovery team stumbled upon a hidden underground bunker where a group of survivors had been living in hiding, one of whom was Lawrence. Against all odds, these soldiers had managed to stay alive and elude enemy capture, thanks to their fortitude, loyalty, and comradery. Upon learning of Lawrence's rescue, Joseph was overjoyed. It was nothing short of a miracle. The friends were reunited, their bond now deeper than ever. Lawrence expressed his gratitude to Joseph for his relentless pursuit of innovation, insisting that the technology Joseph had helped develop contributed significantly to the successful recovery mission and the survival of his entire unit. From that day forward, Lawrence and Joseph understood the true meaning of brotherhood, knowing that despite their different journeys, they would always be there for each other. They continued to share their stories, dreams, and passions. And while their friendship had been tempered in the crucible of war and loss, it emerged stronger and more resilient, firmly cementing their unique bond for the rest of their lives."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This was summarised at the time by the slogan \\"No taxation without representation\\", a perceived violation of the guaranteed Rights of Englishmen. The American Revolution began with rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards self-government. In response Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule, leading to the outbreak of war in 1775. The following year, in 1776, the United States declared independence. The entry of France to the war in 1778 tipped the military balance in the Americans' favour and after a decisive defeat at Yorktown in 1781, Britain began negotiating peace terms.

José Mourinho not convinced about signing Cesc Fábregas for Chelsea José Mourinho is unconvinced about signing Cesc Fábregas with the Chelsea manager retaining a preference for Atlético Madrid’s Koke, the midfielder with whom Barcelona want to replace the former Arsenal captain. Fábregas has been told by the Catalan club that he is for sale for £30m. The 27-year-old would prefer to return to the Premier League and to a Champions League club, his options have narrowed to Chelsea, as Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City have all – for the moment, at least – passed up the opportunity to buy him. With Louis van Gaal, the new manager of Manchester United, having also not identified Fábregas as a priority as the Dutchman seeks to rebuild the squad, the Chelsea hierarchy have presented the Spaniard to Mourinho as an ideal goal-scoring midfield successor to Frank Lampard, who is leaving after 13 years at the west London club. Mourinho, however, is unsure about the Spaniard, preferring instead to target Koke. And, with Mourinho having also sold another diminutive goal-scoring playmaker in Juan Mata to United in January, plus Fabregas’s history with the Portuguese, whether he joins Chelsea is in the balance. In February Fábregas told Mourinho to “shut up” after the 50-year-old had branded Barça the worst team the club had fielded in “many, many years”. Although Mourinho would rather sign Koke, Barça are favourites to do so. Koke is five-years younger than Fábregas and was part of the successful Atlético side that won La Liga and were 90 seconds away from defeating Real Madrid to lift the Champions League. Given that Fábregas has won the World Cup and the last two European Championships with Spain and is a proven Premier League performer the reluctance of three of the clubs competing in next season’s elite competition – plus United – to buy him is a big surprise. Fábregas is understood to be relaxed about the situation, though with Spain’s World Cup defence starting on Thursday-week in Brazil, whether his future can be decided before then becomes less likely as the tournament nears. Fábregas’s stock has fallen considerably from last summer. Then, United had a £35m bid for him rejected by Barça, with Fábregas prepared to move to Old Trafford had his club been prepared to sell.

Mr Corbyn said Tom Watson's suggestion that \\"Trotsky entryists\\" are manipulating young party members to boost his support were \\"nonsense\\". But Mr Watson responded saying there was \\"clear and incontrovertible evidence\\" to back his claims. The Labour leader is embroiled in a contest with challenger Owen Smith. In an interview with the Observer, Mr Corbyn said: \\"I just ask Tom to do the maths - 300,000 people have joined the Labour party. What is a Trotskyist? \\"At no stage in anyone's most vivid imagination are there 300,000 sectarian extremists at large in the country who have suddenly descended on the Labour party. Sorry Tom, it is nonsense - I think he knows it's nonsense.\\" Mr Watson said he believed the \\"overwhelming majority\\" of new members joined the Labour Party because they want to build a \\"fairer and more equal society\\". But he said: \\"There is clear and incontrovertible evidence that a small group of Trotskyite activists have taken leading roles in the Labour Party or are seeking to do so. \\"They are also explicitly targeting Young Labour and Labour student clubs with the aim of recruiting new members. That is beyond dispute. We can't deal with this problem until we acknowledge it exists.\\" BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said \\"the open row\\" between the Labour leader and his deputy  \\"is a further sign of deep divisions within the party\\". There has been Labour in-fighting over the massive influx of new members that have signed up to the party since Mr Corbyn became leader last September. Mr Watson told the Guardian earlier this week that Labour was being infiltrated by \\"Trotsky entryists\\" who had \\"come back\\" to bolster Mr Corbyn. The Labour leader's campaign team hit back accusing Mr Watson of \\"peddling baseless conspiracy theories\\" but the deputy leader then wrote a letter to Mr Corbyn urging him to take action against infiltrators. Trotskyism has its origins in early 20th Century Russian politics and the path pursued by one of the founders of the Soviet Union, Leon Trotsky. Trotsky was the head of the Red Army and a key player in the violent revolution that toppled the Russian tsar and established the world's first socialist state. But he split with the other revolutionary leaders Lenin and Stalin, who believed they could create a socialist society in their own country without a world revolution. Trotsky believed his country could achieve socialism only if the working classes around the world rose up as one to overthrow the ruling classes - the doctrine of \\"international socialism\\".

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who came of age during a period when a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality?, using the article: Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 – 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \\"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \\"the tragedy of landscape\\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The answer to the question would be: Friedrich.  Caspar David Friedrich is the person who came of age during a period when a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. As a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, his primary interest was the contemplation of nature, often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, which aligned with the shift in ideals at the time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Man with the Golden Arm is a 1955 American drama film with elements of film noir, based on the novel of the same name by Nelson Algren, which tells the story of a drug addict who gets clean while in prison, but struggles to stay that way in the outside world. Although the addictive drug is never identified in the film, according to the American Film Institute \\"most contemporary and modern sources assume that it is heroin\\", in contrast to Algren's book which named the drug as morphine. The film stars Frank Sinatra, Eleanor Parker, Kim Novak, Arnold Stang and Darren McGavin. It was adapted for the screen by Walter Newman, Lewis Meltzer and Ben Hecht (uncredited), and directed by Otto Preminger. Preminger decided to release the finished film prior to submitting it for a Code seal of approval. He contended that his film would not entice any viewers to take drugs, since drug use was depicted as having severely negative consequences. The black-and-white film was also the first to portray heroin use as a serious literary topic, rejecting the standard \\"dope fiend\\" approach of the time. United Artists, which had invested 1 million in the film's production, opted to distribute the film, even though doing so could result in the company being fined 25,000 by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). The president of United Artists, Arthur Krim, expressed the company's hope that the PCA would make an exception to its usual rules and grant the film approval because of the film's \\"immense potential for public service.\\" The film received several advance bookings in November and early December 1955, before the PCA had made a decision on whether to grant a Code seal.  However, in early December 1955, the PCA denied the film a Code seal, and the decision was upheld upon appeal to the MPAA. As a result, United Artists resigned from the MPAA that same month (although the company re-joined a few years later). The National Legion of Decency also showed disagreement with the PCA ruling by rating the film as a \\"B\\" meaning \\"morally objectionable in part for all\\", instead of a \\"C\\" meaning \\"condemned\\", which was the rating normally given to films that were denied a Code seal. Large theater circuits including Loews also refused to ban the film and instead showed it despite the lack of a Code seal. As a result of the controversy, the MPAA investigated and revised production codes, allowing later movies more freedom to deeply explore hitherto taboo subjects such as drug abuse, kidnapping, miscegenation, abortion, and prostitution.  In the end, The Man With The Golden Arm finally received the Production Code seal number 17011 in June 1961, which permitted the film to be reissued and sold for television broadcast. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did the controversy delay the release?","output":"The controversy surrounding \\"The Man with the Golden Arm\\" did not significantly delay the release of the film.

Economic issues, including inflation, and external pressure on the frontiers combined to make the 3rd century politically unstable, with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers. Military expenses increased steadily during the 3rd century, mainly in response to the war with Sassanid Persia, which revived in the middle of the 3rd century. The army doubled in size, and cavalry and smaller units replaced the legion as the main tactical unit. The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial, or landowning, class, and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns.

As a young boy, I always sort of hated \\"Cinderella,\\" since I was outvoted by my two sisters when my parents were considering what Disney movie to buy. I wanted \\"Dumbo,\\" but my sisters won out, and we got \\"Cinderella.\\" They thoroughly enjoyed the movie while I sulked in the back of the room playing with my Star Wars action figures. A lot has changed since then. My love of the Disney theme parks landed me an internship at Walt Disney World, and I now have two young nieces. I like to showcase Disney to them as much as I can, and we recently watched \\"Cinderella\\" together. With my newfound appreciation for all that is Disney, I watched \\"Cinderella\\" with a new perspective and was impressed with what I saw. From the beginning of the movie, though, I didn't quite understand why Cinderella was trapped in such a horrible predicament. Why was she such a slave to her stepfamily, and why couldn't she just run away? I wasn't too sympathetic to Cinderella, but as the story progressed, I found myself becoming immersed in the story. Maybe the eye-catching animation or the fun-loving characters drew me in, or maybe it was the timeless songs. Listening to songs like \\"Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo\\" and \\"A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes\\" sort of whisked me back to the theme parks. I can picture myself in that carefree and fun atmosphere while looking at the awe-inspiring Cinderella Castle. Something about this movie just evokes the magic of Disney. That may make many people scoff, but go to the Magic Kingdom and see all the little girls dressed up like Cinderella that are excited to be in this fantasy world, and you'll know what I'm talking about.

Afghans lower the coffin of Afghan cameraman Zubair Hatami, who died on Saturday of injuries sustained in a Taliban attack at a French cultural centre, in Kabul December 21, 2014.      KABUL Afghanistan's Taliban on Sunday accused the United Nations of \\"enmity and political motives\\" in reporting that three-quarters of a record-high number of civilians killed and wounded this year were victims of the insurgents.      Denouncing a U.N. report as \\"biased and unfounded\\", the insurgents accused U.N. investigators of intentionally skewing statistics to blame the Taliban.      The United Nations said that for a second year, insurgents were responsible for about 75 percent of civilians killed, with the toll reaching a new high of 3,188 through November, more than for any other full year since it began tracking numbers.      The Taliban said in a statement emailed to journalists the assertion was false.      \\"Civilian casualties in the current war are mainly caused by the heavy blind U.S. air bombardments,\\" the militants said, citing disputed reports that a U.S. air strike killed several school children last week.      They also asserted that Afghan army, police and militias indiscriminately kill civilians and slammed the United Nations for classifying government officials who were assassinated as civilians - the Taliban consider all Afghan government workers legitimate targets.      The United Nations called on Friday on all sides of the war to work to limit civilian deaths and injuries.      (Editing by Robert Birsel) ||||| KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — At least 151 Taliban fighters have been killed by government forces during 12 days of fighting in the volatile east, near the border with Pakistan, the police chief of Kunar province said Tuesday.      Gen. Abdul Habib Sayedkhaili said at least another 100 insurgents were wounded in the fighting in Dangam district.      He said the Pakistani Taliban and Lashkar-i-Taiba -- the group responsible for the attacks on Mumbai in 2008 in which more than 160 people were killed -- were also taking part in the battle.      \\"That 17 foreign fighters that were killed during the battle prove that foreigners are supporting local insurgents in the area,\\" he said.      \\"As Dangam is so close to the border, it is very easy for them to cross the border into Afghanistan and help the insurgents here. We are very careful with conducting our operations to prevent civilian casualties,\\" he said.      The presence of foreign fighters in Taliban battles in Afghanistan is not unusual. The Afghan Taliban leadership is believed to be based in the Pakistani city of Quetta, and Kabul has long accused Pakistan of turning a blind eye to the group. Dangam is four kilometers (2.5 miles) from the porous border.      The Taliban denied losing so many fighters but did not provide their own figures.      Sayedkhaili said local people had joined the fight against the insurgents, and that five had been killed and 12 wounded, including both locals and security forces. He said there was no involvement of either Pakistani government forces or international forces that have been based in Afghanistan for the past 13 years. The U.S. and NATO are due to withdraw the last of their combat troops on Dec. 31, leaving behind a residual force of 13,000 to provide training and some battlefield backup.      Taliban attacks have escalated since international forces withdrew from Kunar four months ago and the fight across the country has intensified.      Kabul and Islamabad have discussed joining forces to launch operations against insurgent groups following last week's school massacre in the Pakistani city of Peshawar, in which Pakistani Taliban fighters killed more than 140 people, mainly children.      Gen. Sher Muhammad Karimi, chief of the general staff of the Afghan National Army and Gen. John Campbell, commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, met with the head of the Pakistani army, Gen. Raheel Sharif, in Islamabad on Tuesday, Pakistan's military said in a statement.      The statement referred to \\"recently commenced operations by Afghan forces\\" against the Pakistani Taliban in areas close to border.      \\"Gen. Raheel Sharif vowed to extend full support to the visiting Afghan Chief of General Staff and ISAF Commander in all spheres, including coordinated operations in respective areas by both sides and sharing of intelligence,\\" it said, without further elaboration.      Senior Afghan officials have said that no joint Afghan-Pakistani operations have yet been launched in border areas, but that cooperation against the Taliban is being discussed. ||||| Georgette Gagnon, director of human rights for the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), speaks during a news conference in Kabul July 31, 2013.      KABUL At least 3,188 Afghan civilians have been killed in the intensifying war with the Taliban in 2014, making it the deadliest year on record for non-combatants, the United Nations said on Friday.      The numbers are a sharp reminder that the Afghan war is far from over, even as a U.S.-led international force formally ends its combat mission at the end of the month, shifting to a supporting role for Afghan forces after 13 years.      \\"The situation for civilians in Afghanistan is becoming increasingly dire,\\" said Georgette Gagnon, human rights director for the U.N. mission in Kabul.      As of Nov. 30, the United Nations had recorded a total of 3,188 civilian deaths and 6,429 injuries.      That puts 2014 on track to be the first year on record that combined civilian casualties will surpass 10,000.      Civilian deaths over the year to the end of November were up 19 percent over the same period last year and had already surpassed the previous high set in 2011, when 3,133 civilians were killed.      For the first time, ground battles between the Taliban and Afghan forces became the main cause of civilian deaths. In previous years, planted bombs killed the most civilians.      \\"That is very worrying,\\" said Gagnon, calling on all sides to do more to keep civilians from being caught in crossfire of mortars and other heavy weapons.      About three-quarters of civilian casualties were caused by Taliban insurgents, who are intensifying their fight to re-establish their hardline Islamist regime that was toppled in a U.S.-backed military intervention for sheltering the al Qaeda architects of the Sept 11, 2001, attacks on U.S. cities.      Since the U.N. began tracking civilian casualties in 2009, a total of 17,252 civilian deaths and 29,536 injuries have been recorded.      While U.S. military officials have portrayed the war as in the process of being won by Afghan security forces, the national army and police have also suffered record losses this year, with more than 4,600 killed.      Since 2001, nearly 3,500 foreign soldiers from 29 countries have been killed in Afghanistan, including about 2,200 Americans.      (Editing by Robert Birsel) ||||| What is a summary?","output":"The conflict in Afghanistan between the Taliban insurgents and the Afghan government continues to intensify, with civilian casualties reaching record high numbers. The United Nations reported that 3,188 Afghan civilians were killed in 2014, making it the deadliest year on record for non-combatants. These numbers highlight the fact that the war in Afghanistan is far from being resolved, even as the U.S.-led international force formally ends its combat mission and transitions to support Afghan forces. The intensifying conflict has led to significant civilian suffering, with ground battles between the Taliban and Afghan forces becoming the primary cause of civilian deaths for the first time. Previously, planted bombs were responsible for the highest number of civilian casualties. The Taliban are responsible for around 75% of civilian casualties, as they continue to fight in order to re-establish their hardline Islamist regime that was toppled in 2001.

Muffin top, spare tyre, blubber, belly fat, beer belly - a multitude of names but they all mean the same thing. Abdominal fat. And in the summer many turn to quick fixes to get rid of it, writes Saleyha Ahsan. The problem with belly - or abdominal - fat isn't just the way it looks on the beach. It could be a sign that your health is at risk. Belly fat is around our midriff - the subcutaneous fat that we are referring to when we ask if you can pinch more than an inch and also the visceral fat around our organs, like the liver, pancreas and intestines. Last year I had an MRI scan which showed me the fat I had around my own organs and it was a sobering moment. Fat around our vital organs can lead to adverse health effects. Saleyha Ahsan (pictured) is one of the presenters of Trust Me I'm a Doctor: Summer Special, on BBC Two, Tuesday 12 July at 20:00 BST - catch up on BBC iPlayer Take the test: How can I lose an inch of belly fat in four weeks? Visceral fat is believed to be more metabolically active than subcutaneous fat and has a higher turnover. If you gain weight you put it on there first - and if you lose weight, you lose it from there first. Although it is considered the more dangerous to our health, the good news is that it is easier to shift than the subcutaneous fat. But the question is how. On health and fitness websites you can see the promise of \\"spot reduction\\" of belly fat. These are the quick-fix tricks that promise to help melt fat away. But how reliable are they? The Trust Me I'm A Doctor team have done some experiments to finally get to the bottom of it. So how do you get rid of it? We recruited 35 volunteers - splitting them into four groups - along with two experts in the field of exercise and diet. All the volunteers carried abdominal fat which gave them waist sizes that put them in the danger zone for type-2 diabetes and heart disease. Fredrik Karpe, a professor of metabolic medicine from the University of Oxford, and Prof Dylan Thompson, from the University of Bath, each had to come up with two methods to try with the four groups, aligned with their own areas of expertise. Before the experiment, each person had their health parameters taken. One of the most crucial measurements was a DEXA scan - short for dual X-ray absorptiometry - to get a really detailed picture of the amount of fat everyone had and where it was distributed. Other health parameters were measured - resting heart rate, blood glucose, blood lipids, weight, blood pressure and of course waistline measurements. Prof Thompson took on two groups for two types of exercises, while Prof Karpe took two groups for two dietary interventions. The first of Prof Thompson's groups wore monitors to check activity throughout the day and the volunteers were told to eat as they normally would. He gave them simple lifestyle changes to make them more active and increase their daily step count. Prof Thompson's second group was given a classic internet belly-fat fix - sit-ups. Each volunteer did six exercises three times each - every other day over the six-week period. Lie on your back, knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart. Place your hands on your thighs, across your chest or behind your ears. Slowly curl up towards your knees until your shoulders are about three inches off the floor. Hold the position for a few seconds and lower down slowly. The third group, monitored by Prof Karpe, was given the task of following another popular online belly fat reduction suggestion - consuming up to three glasses of milk (one litre) a day. Is it time to Make Your Move? Find out about our new campaign promoting accessible, physical challenges for everyone here. There has been research suggesting that dairy consumption might promote fat excretion. Fat comes out in the faeces rather than being absorbed. The fourth group was the diet group. They were not told to change the type of food they ate. Their task was simply to reduce portion size, measuring foods with their hands and fingers. They were also told to cut out snacks between meals. The aim was to make this as easy to follow as possible - if people are given separate meal plans from the rest of the family it can be difficult to follow and more expensive. A dietician supported this group through the process, giving the volunteers coping strategies if they were suffering from hunger pangs. She had individual sessions with everyone at the start and continued to support them during the six weeks with phone calls. At the end of the six-week period, all the participants were tested again on waistline, blood cholesterol, blood glucose and blood pressure. The results were rather revealing. The first exercise group didn't lose any fat, but their health markers vastly improved, with drops in blood pressure and one participant even reducing their blood glucose levels from being in the diabetic range to normal. The sit-up group didn't lose any weight and didn't get any healthier through their parameters. But they did lose an impressive 2cm (0.8in) from their waistlines. Prof Thompson explained that this was due to an improved core strength and the muscles in the abdomen just holding their fat better. A bit like a muscle version of body-shaping underwear. But a good core is beneficial for protection against lower back pain and improves posture. Turning to Prof Karpe's groups - the milk drinkers didn't show any change in weight or health. However although they were being asked to consume an extra 400 calories a day they didn't gain any weight or fat. Prof Karpe thought this might be to do with them being too full from milk to eat as they normally do. The clear winner was the diet-control group. This group lost a collective 35kg (77lb) between them which was an average of 3.7kg (8.2lb) each over just six weeks. Their average waistline reduced by 5cm (2in). The DEXA scan readings were the most interesting with 5% less body fat and an impressive 14% reduction of the dangerous visceral fat inside the abdomen. This group lost overall body fat as well as abdominal fat. They also saw improvements in the health parameters. But they did lose some muscle tone from their legs, which is not a good thing. Thus, the conclusion is that if you want to bust the belly fat in a healthy and effective way, it's the age-old advice of a combination of diet and exercise. Leave the fads where you found them.

In the 1980s Nicaragua started clearing up some of these forests. Instead, they have now vast tract of sugarcane production in that land. One can still visit Costa Rica where they kept those pristine forests intact.  Which country's indigenours animals would most likely survive and stay put? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Costa Rica's indigenous animals would have a higher chance of surviving and staying put in their natural habitat. This is due to several reasons: 1. Preservation of Pristine Forests: Costa Rica has maintained its pristine forests, providing a continuous and undisturbed habitat for the indigenous species. These forests serve as crucial breeding and nesting grounds and also supply abundant food sources for the native wildlife. On the other hand, the deforestation in Nicaragua for sugarcane production has resulted in the loss of natural habitats for many species, forcing them to relocate or face diminishing populations due to habitat fragmentation. 2. Ecotourism Initiatives: Costa Rica has made substantial efforts in promoting ecotourism as a significant source of income. This has led to a focus on preserving natural resources, such as the country's pristine forests, to attract tourists. This approach has also helped in generating awareness and providing financial incentives for conservation efforts, ultimately benefiting the indigenous animals that rely on these habitats for their survival. 3. Conservation Policies: Costa Rica has implemented multiple conservation policies to protect its flora and fauna. The country has designated nearly 26 percent of its land as protected areas in the form of national parks, wildlife refuges, and biological reserves. These protected areas create a safe sanctuary for many indigenous species, helping to ensure their long-term survival. 4. Biodiversity Programs: Costa Rica has also invested in various biodiversity programs and partnerships with international organizations, such as the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) and the Convention on Biological Diversity. These programs focus on research, conservation, and sustainable use of the country's biological resources, ultimately benefiting the indigenous wildlife and their habitats. 5. Resilience to Climate Change: By preserving their forests, Costa Rica has contributed to the overall resilience of their ecosystems against the impacts of climate change. Forests help in regulating climate, providing a buffer against temperature extremes and weather variations. This stability ensures that the indigenous species have a more predictable and stable environment in which to thrive. In conclusion, it is more likely that the indigenous animals of Costa Rica would survive and stay put due to the country's dedication to preserving its pristine forests, implementing conservation policies, supporting ecotourism initiatives, and investing in biodiversity programs. These factors help maintain the ecological integrity of the country's natural habitats and provide a secure environment for the survival of its native wildlife."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Rest: If you've been using your hands a lot, maybe by playing with building blocks, drawing a lot, or other activities, just like when you feel tired from running around too much, your hands can feel tired too. So, give them a bit of rest, just like you take a nap when you're tired. 2. Ice: You know how you put a cold bag of frozen peas on your knee when you fell down and it hurt? Well, that cold can help your hands too. You can wrap some ice in a cloth (don't put it directly on your skin because it's too cold), and place it on your sore hands for about 10 minutes. 3. Warm Bath: Warmth can also make your hands feel better. Just like how a warm bath makes your body feel relaxing, soaking your hands in warm (but not too hot!) water could do the same for your hands. 4. Creams: You know how mama applies lotion to your skin when it's dry? Some creams are made to help sore hands too. You can ask an adult to help you apply it to your hands. And remember, if your hands are very sore and these things don't help, it's a good idea to tell an adult so they can check what's happening or take you to see a doctor.

Given the context: How would Jan feel afterwards? A:","output":"Given the context that Jan skips breakfast and has to take a late lunch, it is likely that Jan would feel quite hungry, potentially fatigued, and possibly irritable or anxious due to low energy levels. Skipping breakfast may cause a dip in blood sugar levels, leading to a lack of energy and concentration. In this situation, the body may use its energy reserves or break down muscle tissue, further contributing to fatigue or tiredness. Additionally, some individuals may experience headaches or dizziness as a result of a prolonged period without food intake. Emotional effects such as irritability, anxiety, or mood swings could also arise as the brain relies on a steady supply of glucose (broken down from food) to function properly. It is important to note that individual responses to skipping meals could differ significantly, and some individuals might experience milder or more intense feelings of hunger, fatigue, or discomfort."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was the last day I worked. Memorial Day at the city rec center is SLOW, especially when it's beautiful outside, but for some reason, we had two front desk attendants: me, and “bully #1”. Bully #1 clearly had a major distaste for me. She hated my tattoos, the way I would get into a heated debate one day with a police officer patron, then have a fantastic conversation with him days later about legalizing marijuana. She hated that I was liked, but still could give fuck-all about what others thought of me. Bully #2 was our financial director, who got stuck as the manager on duty that day. I honestly never had a clue she didn't like me. She was intense and sarcastic with everyone. I liked her style. On this day, I really got the feeling they were trash talking me pretty hard, the way they kept disappearing, talking over me, laughing like mean girls. I blew it off, because I was down an internet rabbit hole, trying to wrap my brain around some concepts. I was looking at a word, and while I like to think I know exact definitions, sometimes I ask people their take on it. Many psychological terms have some subjective meaning. I spun around in my chair, locked eyes with #2, and asked her: “What do you know about Machiavellianism?” I swear to God, all I wanted was her take on it (she's a smart cookie), and all hell broke loose. I now realize that she thought I was passive-aggressively accusing her of said word. They got really nasty (behind my back, of course). They retreated to the back for awhile, and left me by myself. Cue loud, mean girl laughter. When #1 resumed her post next to me at the front desk, I calmly told her, “I'm cashing out, and leaving. I'm uncomfortable.” And I did. It was noon.

Michael Andrew McKagan grew up in Seattle's largely working-class University District, the youngest of eight children born to Marie and Elmer \\"Mac\\" McKagan. He has been called \\"Duff\\" since toddlerhood, to which he once referred as \\"an Irish thing\\". Following his parents' divorce, his mother supported the family by taking a job as a medical stenographer. He was taught how to play bass by his brother Bruce, further developing his skills by playing along with the albums 1999 by Prince and Damaged by Black Flag. In April 1985, McKagan replaced bassist Ole Beich in Guns N' Roses, which was newly founded by singer Axl Rose and guitarist Izzy Stradlin of Hollywood Rose. McKagan's Road Crew bandmates Slash and Steven Adler joined the band two months later. After two days of rehearsal, the line-up played its debut gig at The Troubadour on June 6. In 1987, Guns N' Roses released its debut album, Appetite for Destruction, which to date has sold over 28 million copies worldwide, 18 million of which were in the United States, making it the best-selling debut album of all time in the U.S. The following year, the band released G N' R Lies, which sold over five million copies in the U.S. alone, despite containing only eight tracks, four of which were included on the previously released EP Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide.  In 1990, Steven Adler was fired from the band because of his heroin addiction; he was replaced by Matt Sorum of The Cult.  In May 1991, Guns N' Roses embarked on the two-and-a-half-year-long Use Your Illusion Tour. The following September, the band released the long-awaited albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II, which debuted at No. 2 and No. 1 respectively on the U.S. chart, a feat unachieved by any other group. In November 1991, Izzy Stradlin abruptly left the band; he was replaced by Gilby Clarke of Kill For Thrills. In 1993, the band released \\"The Spaghetti Incident?\\", a cover album of mostly punk songs, which proved less successful than its predecessors. McKagan took on lead vocals on four songs, including live favorite \\"Attitude\\", originally by the Misfits. That same year, McKagan released his debut solo album, Believe in Me, on which he sang lead vocals and played virtually every instrument.  In 1995, with Guns N' Roses largely inactive, McKagan formed the supergroup Neurotic Outsiders with Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols, John Taylor of Duran Duran, and his Guns N' Roses bandmate Matt Sorum. Originally a gathering of friends jamming together at the Viper Room in Hollywood, they released their self-titled album on Maverick Records in 1996. The band played a brief tour of Europe and North America, before disbanding in 1997. McKagan was the last member of the Appetite for Destruction lineup to leave Guns N' Roses, resigning as bassist in August 1997. McKagan had recently become a father and wrote about his decision to leave in his autobiography, stating \\"Guns had been paying rent on studios for three years now--from 1994 to 1997--and still did not have a single song. The whole operation was so erratic that it didn't seem to fit with my hopes for parenthood, for stability.\\" Entity:","output":"The entity in this text is Michael Andrew McKagan, also known as \\"Duff\\" McKagan, a musician best known as the bassist for the rock band Guns N' Roses."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume, so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals. The need to limit body weight in order, for example, to fly, has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species, such as bats. Most of the brain's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge (membrane potential) of neurons. Most vertebrate species devote between 2% and 8% of basal metabolism to the brain. In primates, however, the percentage is much higher—in humans it rises to 20–25%. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET, fMRI, and NIRS. The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen-dependent metabolism of glucose (i.e., blood sugar), but ketones provide a major alternative source, together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids (caprylic and heptanoic acids), lactate, acetate, and possibly amino acids.

This can be convenient if there is an aggressive antivirus on the computer that prevents the creation of dummydrivers Add punctuation","output":"This can be convenient if there is an aggressive antivirus on the computer that prevents the creation of dummy drivers. In certain situations, aggressive antivirus software can cause issues when it comes to creating dummy drivers. These dummy drivers are useful when testing or debugging certain aspects of computer systems or the software running on them. However, when an aggressive antivirus is present, it can mistakenly flag and block the creation of these drivers. This can lead to a disruption in the workflow, slow down the development process, and even cause harm to the system if it prevents essential updates or patches from being applied. To avoid these inconveniences, you have several options to work around the issue and ensure that your projects can proceed unimpeded. Some possible solutions include: 1. Temporarily disabling the antivirus: You can deactivate the antivirus just for the duration of the dummy driver creation process. However, it's important to remember that this leaves your system vulnerable, so it's crucial to turn it back on as soon as possible. Moreover, this may not be a real solution for corporate environments with strict security measures and policies. 2. Adding exceptions to the antivirus: A less risky approach is to add your dummy driver development tools and the folder containing your dummy driver files to the whitelist or exceptions of your antivirus software. This will allow you to create and work with dummy drivers without interference from the antivirus. Keep in mind that this might also require approval from your IT department or security team. 3. Using alternative development environments: You may consider using a virtual machine (VM) or a physical system specifically designated for dummy driver development and testing. This enables you to isolate the environment and bypass the aggressive antivirus, allowing you to create the drivers without any obstructions. However, this can demand extra resources and setup time. 4. Selecting a different antivirus: Another solution is to switch to antivirus software that is less prone to flagging dummy drivers. Many antivirus programs have different levels of sensitivity and options that can be adjusted so that the software adequately protects your system while not impeding your development process. 5. Collaborating with your security team: If you are working in an organization with a dedicated security team, consider discussing the problem with them.

Please answer a question about the following article about Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic: On January 25, 1918 the third meeting of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets renamed the unrecognized state the Soviet Russian Republic. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed on March 3, 1918, giving away much of the land of the former Russian Empire to Germany in exchange for peace during the rest of World War I. On July 10, 1918, the Russian Constitution of 1918 renamed the country the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic. By 1918, during the Russian Civil War, several states within the former Russian Empire seceded, reducing the size of the country even more. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk ceded land to what state?","output":"The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, signed on March 3, 1918, ceded much of the land of the former Russian Empire to Germany in exchange for peace during the rest of World War I. This treaty was a crucial event in the early years of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, which was seeking to end its participation in the war in order to focus on establishing control over its internal affairs and addressing the consequences of the ongoing Russian Civil War. The surrendered territories included regions such as present-day Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania), as well as parts of Poland and other areas that were then under the control of the Russian Empire. The loss of these lands had significant political, economic, and social impacts on the newly-formed Russian SFSR. Ultimately, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was annulled by the Treaty of Versailles (signed in June 1919), which ended World War I. In the aftermath, many of the territories that were ceded to Germany in the Brest-Litovsk treaty regained independence or were redistributed to other countries according to the terms of the Versailles treaty and other post-war agreements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jan Joosten van Lodensteijn (1556?–1623?), a Dutch colleague of Adams' on their ill-fated voyage to Japan in the ship De Liefde, was also given similar privileges by Tokugawa Ieyasu. It appears Joosten became a samurai[citation needed] and was given a residence within Ieyasu's castle at Edo. Today, this area at the east exit of Tokyo Station is known as Yaesu (八重洲). Yaesu is a corruption of the Dutchman's Japanese name, Yayousu (耶楊子). Also in common with Adam's, Joostens was given a Red Seal Ship (朱印船) allowing him to trade between Japan and Indo-China.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a set of context paragraph and some supporting facts to answer a question. Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts. Problem:Context_1 : Thespesia is a genus of 18 floweringshrubs and trees in the \\"Hibiscus\\" family, Malvaceae, although within the family they are more closely related to cotton plants (\\"Gossypium\\"). The genus is distributed from the South Pacific through Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. Context_2 : An institutional investor is an entity which pools money to purchase securities, real property, and other investment assets or originate loans. Institutional investors include banks, insurance companies, pensions, hedge funds, REITs, investment advisors, endowments, and mutual funds. Operating companies which invest excess capital in these types of assets may also be included in the term. Activist institutional investors may also influence corporate governance by exercising voting rights in their investments. Although institutional investors appear to be more sophisticated than retail investors, it remains unclear if professional active investment managers can reliably enhance risk adjusted returns by an amount that exceeds fees and expenses of investment management. Context_3 : A commodity pool is an investment structure where many individual investors combine their moneys and trade in futures contracts as a single entity in order to gain leverage. They are analogous to mutual funds wherein a fund is similarly set up expressly for trading in equity, except that mutual funds are open to public subscription whereas commodity pools and hedge funds are private. Context_4 : A business entity is an entity that is formed and administered as per corporate law in order to engage in business activities, charitable work, or other activities allowable. Most often, business entities are formed to sell a product or a service. There are many types of business entities defined in the legal systems of various countries. These include corporations, cooperatives, partnerships, sole traders, limited liability company and other specifically permitted and labelled types of entities. The specific rules vary by country and by state or province. Some of these types are listed below, by country. For guidance, approximate equivalents in the company law of English-speaking countries are given in most cases, Context_5 : In computer programming, a declaration is a language construct that specifies properties of an identifier: it declares what a word (identifier) \\"means:.\\" Declarations are most commonly used for functions, variables, constants, and classes, but can also be used for other entities such as enumerations and type definitions. Beyond the name (the identifier itself) and the kind of entity (function, variable, etc.), declarations typically specify the data type (for variables and constants), or the type signature (for functions); types may also include dimensions, such as for arrays. A declaration is used to announce the existence of the entity to the compiler; this is important in those strongly typed languages that require functions, variables, and constants, and their types to be specified with a declaration before use, and is used in forward declaration. The term \\"declaration\\" is frequently contrasted with the term \\"definition\\", but meaning and usage varies significantly between languages; see below. Context_6 : In the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), an entity is a primitive data type, which associates a string with either a unique alias (such as a user-specified name) or an SGML reserved word (such as codice_1). Entities are foundational to the organizational structure and definition of SGML documents. The SGML specification defines numerous entity types, which are distinguished by keyword qualifiers and context. An entity string value may variously consist of plain text, SGML tags, and/or references to previously-defined entities. Certain entity types may also invoke external documents. Entities are called by reference. Context_7 : In mathematics and computer science, mutual recursion is a form of recursion where two mathematical or computational objects, such as functions or data types, are defined in terms of each other. Mutual recursion is very common in functional programming and in some problem domains, such as recursive descent parsers, where the data types are naturally mutually recursive, but is uncommon in other domains. Context_8 : Thespesia populnea, commonly known as the Indian tulip tree, Pacific rosewood, or Portia tree , is species of flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is a small tree or arborescent shrub that has a pantropical distribution, found on coasts around the world. However, the Portia tree is probably native only to the Old World, and may have originated in India. Nowadays, its wood is mainly used in making furniture because of its good ability to undergo carving. The wood from the tree was used by early Tamil people to make instruments in ancient Tamilakam. It is possibly indigenous to the Hawaiian Islands and elsewhere in the Pacific, but may have been spread by early Polynesians for its useful wood and bast fibres. The Portia tree reaches a height of 6 - tall and a trunk diameter of 20 - . It grows at elevations from sea level to 275 m in areas that receive 500 - of annual rainfall. The Portia tree is able to grow in the wide range of soil types that may be present in coastal environments, including soils derived from quartz (sand), limestone, and basalt; it favours neutral soils (pH of 6–7.4). Context_9 : Spathiphyllum is a genus of about 40 species of monocotyledonous flowering plants in the family Araceae, native to tropical regions of the Americas and southeastern Asia. Certain species of \\"Spathiphyllum\\" are commonly known as Spath or peace lilies. Context_10 : An entity–relationship model (ER model) describes inter-related things of interest in a specific domain of knowledge. An ER model is composed of entity types (which classify the things of interest) and specifies relationships that can exist between instances of those entity types. fact_1 : Spathiphyllum is a genus of about 40 species of monocotyledonous flowering plants in the family Araceae, native to tropical regions of the Americas and southeastern Asia. fact_2 : Thespesia is a genus of 18 floweringshrubs and trees in the \\"Hibiscus\\" family, Malvaceae, although within the family they are more closely related to cotton plants (\\"Gossypium\\"). Question: Spathiphyllum and Thespesia, are types of which mutual entity? Solution:","output":"The task is asking you to find the mutual entity that both Spathiphyllum and Thespesia belong to.

Answer based on context: The Mexican Empire was quickly overthrown under the Plan of Casa Mata, the provinces of the empire became independent states. The first Republic of Yucatán, declared on May 29, 1823, joined the Federal Republic of the United Mexican States as the Federated Republic of Yucatán on December 23, 1823. The second Republic of Yucatán emerged when the federal pact signed by Yucatán and endorsed in the Constitution of Yucatán of 1825 was broken by the centralist government of Mexico since 1835. In 1841 the state of Tabasco decreed its separation from Mexico and Miguel Barbachano, then governor of Yucatán, sent a commission headed by Justo Sierra O'Reilly to meet with Tabasco authorities to propose the creation of an independent federal republic from Mexico formed by the two states. The idea failed when Tabasco rejoined Mexico in 1842. On August 22, 1846, Mexican interim president José Mariano Salas restored the 1824 constitution and the federalism. Two years later, during the government of president José Joaquín de Herrera, Miguel Barbachano ordered the reinstatement of Yucatán to Mexico under the Constitution of Yucatán of 1825. A decisive factor for the reinstatement was the Caste War, which forced Yucatán to seek outside help. In 1852 due to internal struggles between opposing political factions, was created the Territory of Campeche. On April 29, 1863, during the government of Benito Juárez, Campeche gained its current status as an independent state.

The film then cuts to Cairo, Egypt in 1949, where the young Father Lankester Merrin (played by SkarsgÃ¥rd, who played the same part in Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist) has taken a sabbatical from the Church and devoted himself to history and archaeology as he struggles with his shattered faith. He is haunted especially by an incident in a small village in the occupied Netherlands during World War II, where he served as parish priest: near the end of the war, a sadistic Nazi SS commander, in retaliation for the murder of a German trooper, forces Merrin to participate in arbitrary executions in order to save a full village from slaughter. After World War II, Merrin is an archaeologist in Cairo, when he is approached by a collector of antiquities named Semelier who asks him to come to a British excavation in a valley called Derati the Turkana region of Kenya. This dig is excavating a Christian Byzantine church built circa 500 A.D. â long before Christianity had reached that region of Africa.

Answer the following question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question. Questions: Sally loved the color of fallen leaves in autumn. She often took long walks in September.  Where might she walk? Options: - roof - tree - ground - forest - fall season Answer:","output":"Sally, being an admirer of the beautiful colors of fallen leaves in autumn, would most likely choose to take her long walks in a forest during September. The forest is the most logical and fitting choice, as it provides an environment where Sally can fully embrace and appreciate the autumn scenery.  Forests, particularly during autumn, showcase an abundance of fallen leaves exhibiting vibrant shades of reds, oranges, and yellows. Taking long walks through forest trails allows for a more intimate and immersive experience, as she would be surrounded by the very foliage that she loves. Additionally, September is the perfect time to witness this spectacular display of natural beauty, as it marks the beginning of fall and the transition of colors in many temperate regions. The other options provided do not align with common sense or the context of the question. Walking on the roof or tree is not only impractical, but also dangerous, as both surfaces are not intended for walking. Furthermore, the \\"ground\\" option is too broad and lacks the contextual relevance to enjoying fallen leaves. Lastly, \\"fall season\\" is not a location where someone can walk but rather a period of time when autumn occurs, which was already established in the question. In conclusion, to fully enjoy the color of fallen leaves in autumn, Sally would most likely choose to take her long walks through a forest during the month of September. This setting offers her a serene and picturesque environment, where she can truly appreciate the beauty of nature during this magical season."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She also reminds David about her promise to call her mother whenever she travels. Therefore, the intention of her call is to let her mother know of their safe arrival.  Step 3: Evaluating the options A) tell her mother some bad news - This is incorrect. The text does not suggest any bad news Linda needs to share. B) say that she and David have arrived safely - This is correct. The context of the call is that Linda has just arrived in Sydney and is calling to let her mother know of their safe arrival.

Today we're going to talk about a big company called News International. This company has many newspapers, and in the past, they did some things they shouldn't have. They listened to people's private telephone conversations by secretly hacking into their phones! That's like someone secretly looking at your diary without your permission, which is not a nice thing to do. Recently, News International said they agreed to settle, or fix a problem with people who were unhappy with them. But they didn't tell us any more information about the settlements. Imagine you had a disagreement with a friend about taking their toy, and you two decided to make peace with each other, that's called settling. One of the people who was upset with News International is a famous actor named Jude Law. He got £130,000 (a lot of money!) in damages, which means this is what they gave him to fix the problem caused by listening to his private phone calls. Jude Law said that the behavior of one of the newspapers, called News of the World, was appalling. That's a big word meaning very bad and shocking. But Jude Law wasn't the only one whose phone was hacked. Even a journalist who worked for other newspapers from News International had his phone hacked too. In our world, it's important to treat everybody nicely, and that includes people like journalists who write news stories for us to read. The lawyers (people who help others in the court) for the unhappy people said that News International tried to destroy evidence. Evidence is something that shows a fact or helps to prove something happened. So, they are saying that News International tried to get rid of or hide the proof that they did something wrong. That's the end of our story for today. We learned that News International has acknowledged their mistakes and settled with the people they hurt. It's a big reminder for all of us to always be kind, honest, and respect other people's privacy.

It occurs between particles or objects. It causes them to attract or repel each other. They do not even have to touch. This is unlike the typical push or pull you may be familiar with. All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge. An electron has a negative electric charge. Forces on Charged Objects Most atoms are balanced electrically. They have the same number of positive and negative charges. Therefore, the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Neutrons do not matter as they have no charge. When an object loses some electrons, it becomes positively charged. There are now more protons than electrons inside the atom.

May 20, 2014, 11:42 PM GMT / Updated May 21, 2014, 12:00 AM GMT      Five men were convicted Tuesday in Moscow in the 2006 execution-style murder of Russian investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya, Russian state media reported.      Politkovskaya, a crusading reporter for the liberal newspaper Novaya Gazeta who worked almost full-time on documenting allegations of human rights violations in the breakaway province of Chechnya, was 48 when she was gunned down in the elevator of her apartment building in October 2006.      The murder raised worldwide questions about freedom of speech and of the press under Russian President Vladimir Putin — especially after three of the defendants were initially acquitted in 2009. The Supreme Court overturned those acquittals and ordered a new trial. ||||| People hold portraits of slain journalist Anna Politkovskaya on the sixth anniversary of her death, next to her block of flats in central Moscow October 7, 2012.      MOSCOW (Reuters) - Five men were convicted on Tuesday of murdering 2006 of investigative journalist and Kremlin critic Anna Politkovskaya, including three defendants who had been acquitted in a previous trial.      Politkovskaya's killing drew attention to the risks faced by Russians who challenge the authorities and deepened Western concerns for the rule of law under President Vladimir Putin, who was then serving his second term.      Another jury's 2009 acquittal of three of the men who were found guilty of murder on Tuesday embarrassed Russian prosecutors and was later thrown out by the Supreme Court, which ordered a new trial.      The defendants were three Chechen brothers, one of whom was accused of shooting Politkovskaya in the lobby of her Moscow apartment building on October 7, 2006, as well as their uncle and a former police officer.      The convictions are a victory for Russian prosecutors and the state, but rights activists and relatives of Politkovskaya say that justice will not be done until those who ordered her contract-style killing are identified and convicted.      \\"The murder will only be solved when the name of the person who ordered it is known,\\" a lawyer for Politkovskaya's family, Anna Stavitskaya, was quoted as saying by RIA news agency.      She welcomed the jury's verdict but said the men found guilty \\"are only a few of the people who should be brought to justice\\", RIA reported.      A spokesman for the federal Investigative Committee, Vladimir Markin, said the authorities were doing all they can to identify and track down the person behind the killing, Russian news agencies reported.      Kremlin critics say they doubt that will ever happen because of suspicions the trail could lead too close to the government.      Politkovskaya, a reporter for Novaya Gazeta who was 48 when she was shot dead while returning home after shopping for groceries, was best known for her dogged reporting on human rights violations in the North Caucasus province of Chechnya.      Lawyers for the defendants - Rustam Makhmudov, his brothers Ibragim and Dzhabrail, their uncle Lom-Ali Gaitukayev, and former Moscow police officer Sergei Khadzhikurbanov - said they would appeal.      Investigators say Gaitukayev organised the logistics of the killing while in jail for another matter, while Khadzhikurbanov was in charge of preparing for the slaying and Ibragim and Dzhabrail Makhmudov helped track her.      Ibragim and Dzhabrail Makhmudov and Khadzhikurbanov were previously acquitted.      The five men will be sentenced by a judge at a later date and could face life in prison. Prosecutors will recommend sentences at a court session on Wednesday, RIA reported.

One man was found guilty of the shooting and the other four of organising the killing. Three of the men were brothers from Chechnya.      Ms Politkovskaya, a 48-year-old investigative reporter and vocal critic of Russia's war in Chechnya, was shot in a lift in her block of flats.      Three of the men had been acquitted of the murder in a 2009 trial.      The initial verdict was overturned by Russia's supreme court, which ordered their retrial.      One of the brothers, Rustam Makhmudov, was found guilty of pulling the trigger. His brothers were found guilty of acting as getaway drivers.      The brothers' uncle and a retired policeman were also found guilty of organising the killing.      Ms Politkovskaya's reporting for Novaya Gazeta newspaper won international renown for her dogged investigation of Russian abuses in Chechnya.      But her pieces, which were highly critical of President Vladimir Putin, then serving his second term, and the Chechen leadership, angered many in authority.      The five men, who face possible life terms, will be sentenced on Wednesday morning.      A committee set up to investigate the shooting said it was still looking for the person who ordered the operation.      Her family welcomed the verdict but also expressed disappointment that the mastermind of the killing had not yet been found.      Last year a former police officer, Dmitry Pavlyuchenkov, was sentenced to 11 years in prison for supplying the murder weapon.      Magnitsky sanctions      In a separate development, the US announced on Tuesday that it was imposing sanctions on a further 12 Russians believed to be involved in the death of a Moscow lawyer in 2009.      Sergei Magnitsky found evidence of a 230m tax-refund fraud      Sergei Magnitsky died in prison, allegedly because of torture and neglect, after accusing Russian officials of tax fraud.      Following his death, the US passed the Magnitsky Act, aimed at punishing officials involved in his death, and last year published a list of 18 individuals banned from entering the country.      Among the names added to the list on Tuesday are three doctors alleged to have withheld treatment from Magnitsky while he was in custody.      One of them, Larisa Litvinova, was chief physician at Butyrka maximum security jail where Magnitksy died while another, Dmitry Kratov, was its deputy director.      A judge involved in a posthumous prosecution of Magnitsky for tax fraud has also been added to the sanctions list.      The US says the sanctions are \\"independent of Russia's actions in Ukraine\\". ||||| Summary:","output":"Five men were convicted in 2014 for the 2006 murder of Russian investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya.

She needed another heart transplant  . But the doctors couldn't find a proper heart so soon. Then they came up with an idea -- they would use two machines to keep her blood _ in her body. After waiting for about four months, D' Zhana had another heart transplant. It was very successful. When doctors use a man-made heart to keep a patient's life, they usually leave the patient's own heart in the body. \\"She, we believe, is possibly one of the youngest that had the machines without her own heart,\\" one of D' Zhana Simmons' doctors said. Living without a heart for 118 days -- that's great. When a heart transplant doesn't work, doctors have no time to waste. If they don't get a new heart or some machines to help the patient, he or she will die. The patient's life is in their hands.

The goal is to identify all elements from the list 'A' that occur before the last 'i' elements. Here's a step-by-step explanation: Step 1: Understand the inputs. - You are given two inputs: 'i' and 'A'. 'i' is an integer and 'A' is a list. You can think of 'A' as a row of items and 'i' as a certain number of items from the end of the row. Step 2: Look at the specific problem. - In our specific problem, 'i' is 3 and 'A' is ['Q', '2261', 'm', '1869', '6817', '3611', '529', 'L', '369', 's']. - So, these are the last 3 numbers: '369', 'L' & 's'. All other elements are preceding these 3 last elements.  Step 3: Implement the task. - List everything else in 'A' excluding the last 'i' elements. - This means all elements of the list 'A' until the third element from the end. Step 4: Find the Solution. - The elements of 'A' preceding the last 3 elements are: ['Q', '2261', 'm', '1869', '6817', '3611', '529']. This is your answer.

Summarize the following: Commercially-made chocolate or vanilla almond milk is usually fairly high in sugar content, containing more than 20 g (1.7 tbsp.) of sugar per serving. Stir in 1 tbsp. (12 g or 14.8 ml) of the sweetener for every 4 cups (0.95 l) of unsweetened almond milk. Stir very well, until the granules dissolve. Add more, if desired.

The store-bought chocolate and vanilla almond milk have a lot of sugar - it's like eating more than a spoonful of sugar in each glass. But don't worry! You can make it at home and it's very easy. Once you have unsweetened almond milk, you add a spoonful of sweetener like sugar or agave syrup for every 4 cups - that's about as much milk as in a large jug. Stir it until you can't see the sweetener anymore - be sure to stir very well! Now the fun part, adding flavors! To make it taste like vanilla, add a teaspoon of vanilla extract for every 4 cups of milk. If you really love vanilla, you can add more! Just don't forget to mix it well. If you want a more almond flavor, put a little bit of almond extract too. For chocolate almond milk, you add a spoonful of sugar or agave syrup and 2 spoonfuls of cocoa powder to your milk. You also add a tiny bit of salt, and mix it until everything has disappeared. If you are using already sweetened almond milk, no need to add more sugar. To make chai almond milk, add the sugar or agave syrup, plus a little bit of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Mix it very well.

You finish drinking the tea. Now, what do you do with the box? Do you drop it on the ground? Or, do you do the right thing and drop it in a trash can? Hopefully, you drop it in the trash can because, besides harming the environment, littering is also very impolite. Recently, a magazine published a list of the most polite cities in the world. They looked three things: did people litter, did shop clerks say thank you and did people hold the door open for the person behind them? The top three politest cities were New York, USA, Zurich, Switzerland, and Toronto, Canada. Hong Kong, China was number 35. Shanghai wasn't even on the list. Does that mean that Shanghai is not a polite city? Well, maybe. There are different ways to judge  politeness but the survey was looking at how a visitor to a city would feel when walking around its public places. Visitors don't like to step over empty tea boxes as they walk down the street. They don't like it when they buy something and the shop clerk doesn't say thank you or even give them a smile. They also don't like it when someone lets a door slam  into them instead of holding it open. Shanghai is a nice city but it is not always the most polite city. I don't think this is intentional . I think it's just a lack of awareness . China is becoming a popular place for tourists to visit. When they come to Shanghai they will find a friendly city: it would be nice if they also found a polite one. And, remember, being polite makes you feel good, too. It's nice to be nice.

They were highly advanced in technology and science, which they used to make their lives better. However, their hunger for resources soon led them to the brink of destruction. Krypton's core, being rich in a precious element, attracted the attention of miners who exploited it without considering the consequences. It was not long before the relentless mining began to destabilize the planet's core, leading to catastrophic tectonic events and an impending apocalyptic scenario. Amidst this crisis, the planet's council convened an urgent assembly to discuss possible solutions. Many brilliant minds proposed various strategies, but none seemed to hold the key to the salvation of Krypton. It was during this chaotic time that a highly respected scientist named Jor-El emerged as a voice of reason. His research had long predicted the danger of mining Krypton's core, and he had been hard at work attempting to devise a suitable plan of action. In light of the rapidly deteriorating situation, the council decided to entrust Jor-El with the control of the genetics codex, which held the entire biological knowledge and heritage of the Kryptonian race. Jor-El worked tirelessly to find a way to save his people. However, he soon discovered that Krypton's core was beyond salvation, and that the destruction of their planet was imminent. Desperate to preserve the Kryptonian legacy, Jor-El conceived a bold plan to entrust the future of his race to his infant son, Kal-El. He devised a preprogrammed spacecraft that would carry the young child to safety on a distant, habitable planet. When the time came, the selfless Jor-El prepared to say goodbye to his beloved wife and son. He knew that staying behind meant sacrificing his life, but his love for his people and hopes for his son steeled his resolve. Before parting, he placed the genetic codex into his son’s escape vessel, ensuring that the essence of Krypton would live on in the blood of his child. As the planet's destruction drew near, Jor-El launched the spacecraft carrying his precious cargo into the vast reaches of space. Following Jor-El's meticulously calculated coordinates, the spacecraft journeyed across the cosmos and arrived on a small, blue-green planet called Earth. It crash-landed, as designed, near a small Kansas town called Smallville. Here, a kind couple named Jonathan and Martha Kent, who were unable to have children of their own, discovered the infant Kal-El. They loved and raised him as their own, and named him Clark. As Clark grew up, he realized that he was unlike other humans. Burdened by the knowledge of the fate that had befallen his true home, and feeling immense guilt for being the sole survivor of Krypton, he decided that he needed to find a new purpose in life. He knew that he possessed extraordinary abilities given to him by his Kryptonian heritage, and he wanted to use these powers to help others. Thus, Clark set out on a journey around the world. He learned about different cultures, discovered new ways of thinking, and was inspired by the resilience and ingenuity of humankind. During his travels, he realized that he could use his great power to protect Earth, the planet that had taken him in and given him a second chance at life. And so, the once lost and guilt-ridden young man from a distant world embraced his destiny and became Earth's greatest protector, the iconic superhero known as Superman."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What type of building sits on the land that Charles Barclay wants to develop?  Sisters Fiona, Evelyn, and Susie Gaylord, are orphaned when first their mother goes down with the Lusitania and then their wealthy father, Major Penn Gaylord, is killed in France in World War I. Before Penn left for France, he told Fiona, the eldest, that the Gaylords have never sold the land they have acquired. However, their half billion dollar inheritance is held up in probate for decades; Fiona complains that they have practically grown up in court. Though they have a New York City Fifth Avenue mansion, the sisters have had to borrow money to live. A French charity claims that Penn made a later will before he died, leaving 10% of the Gaylord estate to it. Though the Gaylords are now willing to give up the 10%, their real antagonist, Charles Barclay, who wants their mansion, and the choice land on which it sits too, so he can tear it down as part of his real estate development, Barclay Square. Fiona is determined not to give in to this. Meanwhile, Evelyn has married an English nobleman, now fighting in the RAF, while Susie is in love with painter Gig Young, despite being married herself. Susanna only stayed with her husband for a few hours, but he refuses to grant her an annulment unless she pays him a great deal of money, to which of course she does not have access. When Evelyn returns home from England, she becomes attracted to Gig herself and tries to steal him away. Answer:","output":"The type of building that sits on the land that Charles Barclay wants to develop is a New York City Fifth Avenue mansion. The mansion belongs to the Gaylord sisters, orphaned daughters of the late Major Penn Gaylord. Barclay wants it, along with the choice land on which it sits, for his real estate development, Barclay Square."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: Today, I want to share why I think you should interview real estate agents before hiring one. Why You Should Interview Real Estate Agents Truth be told, I have only purchased one house and I’m in the process of selling it. My husband and I thought long and hard about whether we would try to sell our property on our own or hire someone to represent us. In the end, we chose the latter. If you have ever shared with friends or family that you’re looking for a home or thinking of selling your own, most everyone says something along the lines of, “Oh! I know a realtor I can recommend!” Many of you may know a real estate agent personally as well. I still think it makes sense to interview any prospective agents because they are being paid by you. When you hire someone to do work on your home, you get estimates and gather information about how and when the work will be done. When you are looking for babysitters, you meet them and see how they’ll interact with your child. When you’re an employer, you interview any potential employees. Don’t Take The Easy Route with Previous Agents and Friends Just because a friend is a realtor, doesn’t mean they’ll be the best real estate agent for you. Just because a friend recommends their realtor to you, doesn’t mean you have to hire him/her. It’s business and nobody should take it personally. Interviewing real estate agents just makes sense. Oftentimes, people don’t. Why not just use the realtor that sold you the house you’re currently in? Well, you can. But do you know how that realtor handles business when they are the listing agent versus the buyer’s agent? Do you know if they’ll want to pursue the option to be a dual agent (and double their commission)? Why not interview them while interviewing others? It won’t hurt. Question: The author will most likely Options: - sell their house on their own - not enough information - interview realtors - list the house in the paper The answer is:","output":"interview realtors"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Когда речь заходит о качестве звука музыки на iPhone, стоит отметить, что оно находится на одном уровне с нашим опытом использования пятого поколения iPod. Это касается как общего восприятия звука, так и его характеристик. Прежде всего, оба устройства имеют хорошую детализацию звука, которая не теряется даже при высокой громкости. Благодаря этому, слушать музыку на таких устройствах становится комфортным, и нет никаких искажений или неприятных помех. Вторым важным параметром является баланс тембра, и здесь iPhone также не уступает iPod. Все частоты звукового диапазона хорошо сбалансированы, что позволяет наслаждаться широким спектром музыкальных композиций. Басы глубокие и мощные, без перегруза и гула, а средние и высокие частоты яркие и чистые. Еще одним преимуществом iPhone является поддержка множества аудиоформатов, таких как MP3, WAV, AIFF, Apple Lossless и других. Это позволяет слушать любимые композиции в любом удобном формате и наслаждаться оптимальным качеством звука. Также стоит отметить, что iPhone, как и iPod, имеет встроенный эквалайзер, который позволяет настроить звук под персональные предпочтения слушателя. С его помощью можно придать музыке больше глубины и яркости, а также компенсировать возможные недостатки прослушивания на разных моделях наушников или акустики. В целом, iPhone отлично справляется с воспроизведением музыки и обеспечивает высокое качество звука, которое уравновешено, продумано и приятно для слуха.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which ruler that Richard Hopkins opposed was overthrown by the Revolution of 1688? A:","output":"To answer this question, we need to break it down into smaller parts. We can identify three essential components in the question statement: 1. Richard Hopkins 2. A ruler he opposed 3. The Revolution of 1688 Step 1: Identify Richard Hopkins' role First, we need to establish who Richard Hopkins is and his significance in history. Richard Hopkins was a noted politician in 17th-century England. Step 2: Determine rulers Richard Hopkins opposed Now, we need to find out which rulers Richard Hopkins opposed during his political career. Research reveals that Hopkins was a supporter of the Whig party in England, which implies that he would have likely opposed rulers backed by the opposing Tory party. Step 3: Investigate the Revolution of 1688 The Revolution of 1688, also known as the Glorious Revolution, refers to the events that led to the overthrow of King James II of England (James VII of Scotland and James II of Ireland). He was replaced by his daughter Mary II and her husband William III. The revolution marked an essential milestone in the development of a constitutional monarchy in Britain. Step 4: Identify the overthrown ruler As we already know, the ruler overthrown by the Revolution of 1688 is King James II. Step 5: Verify the relationship between Hopkins and the ruler Now, we have to verify whether Richard Hopkins had an opposing stance against King James II. Since Hopkins was a Whig supporter, he would have likely opposed the reign of James II, given that James II was favored by the Tories. Considering all the steps above, the ruler that Richard Hopkins opposed, who was overthrown by the Revolution of 1688, is: A: King James II."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The idea for the film was to bring many filmmakers, illustrious in their own country, to make short films, eleven of them, all in one film, concentrating on just one subject: September 11. From wacthing this movie I could tell why these filmmakers were great in their country because it had all elements of a great film. The movie starts off with a film from Iran in which a teacher struggles to teach the students about what had happened with September 11 which they fail to realize until later. The Second Film from France involves a deaf women who writes a letter to her lover angrily while she is unaware of what is going as the T.V plays. The next film from Egypt involves the filmmaker himself talking with a dead soldier about recent events not only about terrorists of 9/11 but bombings in other places.

It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics.  - Warbringer is an American thrash metal band formed in 2004. Century Media Records signed Warbringer after seeing them at a local show in LA. Originally, a Century Media rep was at the show to see another LA thrash metal band but decided to sign Warbringer instead. Warbringer's second album \\"Waking into Nightmares\\" was released on May 19, 2009. The album reached No. 14 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. Despite numerous line-up changes Warbinger has released 4 full-length albums on Century Media Records.  - Century Media Records is a heavy metal record label with offices in the United States, Germany and London. In August 2015, Century Media was acquired by Sony Music Entertainment for US 17 million.  - Daniel Seagrave (born 1970) is a British artist, who created many record covers for death metal bands especially in the early 1990s. He currently lives in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He grew up in Ravenshead, near Nottingham.  - Waking into Nightmares is the second album by the American thrash metal band Warbringer , released on May 19 , 2009 in the U.S. and May 25 , 2009 in Europe . It was produced by Gary Holt , founding guitarist of thrash metal band Exodus . Artwork done by Dan Seagrave . A video for the song Severed Reality was produced . Walking into Nightmares sold around 2,000 copies in its first week of release in the U.S.  - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.  - Thrash metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its fast tempo and overall aggression. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work. The lyrics often deal with social issues and reproach for The Establishment, using direct and denunciatory language, an approach borrowed from hardcore punk.  - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.

Karen Welsh, pictured, was strangled in her home by paranoid schizophrenic John Constantine. A damning investigation into the killing of a nurse by a paranoid schizophrenic has revealed a series of blunders by the NHS, police and probation service. Karen Welsh, 52, was strangled at home by John Constantine, 33, who had been discharged from a psychiatric hospital. Constantine beat Mrs Welsh and cut her wrists in March 2010 – while he had already breached the conditions of a suspended prison sentence. Mrs Welsh, a nurse, had let Constantine, stay in her Cardiff home as he was homeless after being let out. At the time he was only receiving treatment for depression. But a report into her death by Healthcare Inspectorate Wales has said that he was misdiagnosed by doctors, and should also have been arrested by police years earlier. It said that his hospital treatment was ‘inadequate’, and that he was only properly diagnosed as a ‘floridly psychotic’ paranoid schizophrenic after killing Mrs Welsh. Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, which initially assessed Constantine, was criticised for underestimating the risks he posed. The report said: ‘Had there been a more assertive and less fragmented attempt to gain a better understanding of the risks that he posed, it is possible the killing may have been preventable.’ It also revealed that police and probation officers repeatedly failed to arrest Constantine - who breached the conditions of his suspended sentence for a hammer attack, burglary and car theft in 2008. Karen Welsh, pictured right with her daughter Joanne, left, might not have died if police and doctors had acted properly, a report said. It said: ‘On more than one occasion opportunities were missed to apprehend him and bring him back under the supervision of the probation service or the courts.’ Her daughter Joanne Welsh described her heartbreak on finding out that her mother’s death was preventable. She said: ‘It is extremely upsetting to hear the conclusions. ‘My mother could still be alive had it not been for misdiagnosis, failures in communication between the relevant agencies and a lack of mental health awareness. ‘These failings meant that a very dangerous and unwell man was let down and allowed to commit such a devastating crime.’ When Constantine was tried in court for Mrs Welsh’s murder, it emerged that he was a paranoid schizophrenic who had been fit and well until suffering a mental breakdown in 2008. He denied murder but admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility and was sent indefinitely to a maximum security hospital. The court heard that he had changed his name from Kevin Astley to John Constantine after a Keanu Reeves character. Reeves played the occult detective in Constantine, a 2005 occult thriller in which his character can talk to demons. Ruth Walker, head of nursing at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said: ‘It is clear that communication between statutory agencies fell short of expectation. ‘Both patients were let down by that failure, with tragic consequences.’ Dr Ruth Hussey, chief medical officer for Wales, said: ‘In this complex case, there were several key findings of concern. ‘The Welsh Government expects the local health board involved to work with other partners to take the appropriate actions and learn from this tragic case. ‘On behalf of the NHS in Wales, I would like to apologise sincerely to everyone affected by this tragedy.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"So, this story is about a sad event that happened to a lady named Karen Welsh. She was a nurse who let a man named John Constantine stay in her home because he didn't have a place to live. John had some problems with his mind, and the doctors didn't understand how bad his problems were. They thought he was just very sad, but he actually had a more serious condition called paranoid schizophrenia. Unfortunately, John hurt Karen very badly, and she passed away. After this happened, people looked into what went wrong and found out that the hospital, police, and probation service made mistakes in taking care of John. They should have known that he had a very serious mental problem and needed help, but they didn't. Karen's daughter is very sad because she found out that if the people taking care of John had done a better job, her mother might still be alive. Now the people in charge are saying sorry and they want to learn from this mistake so it doesn't happen again."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

(Photo: T-Mobile)      NEW YORK—Your cellphone coverage is pretty good in the neighborhoods where you live and work, but securing a decent signal inside your house has proved to be a challenge.      On Monday, T-Mobile announced T-Mobile 4G LTE CellSpot, an 8.5-inch tall and 8.5-inch wide box which plugs into your Internet router and which the company claims can provide an average of 3,000 square feet of full-bar LTE coverage indoors. Based on \\"femtocell\\" or \\"small cell\\" technology, T-Mobile says this is the first-ever 4G LTE mini-tower available from a U.S. wireless provider.      LTE (Long Term Evolution) is the prevailing 4th generation of speedy wireless. T-Mobile's solution is like putting a tiny cell phone tower in the home to improve coverage in the basement or other areas where network coverage might be shaky.      T-Mobile is giving CellSpot to its post-paid customers for free, though you'll have to leave a refundable 25 deposit, and remain a T-Mobile customer. Post-paid refers to the lucrative segment of customers who pay their wireless bills each month.      The low-power box becomes available on Wednesday. If you're a qualifying customer, you can request CellSpot in a T-Mobile store but the company won't have them in stock and is instead shipping out units.      T-Mobile is also pushing the benefit to its small business customers, since the 4G LTE CellSpot supports up to 16 calls at one time and works with any 3G, 4G or LTE device that is compatible with T-Mobile's network. But you'll need a T-Mobile phone to tap into the signal.      It's a \\"huge feat of engineering,\\" T-Mobile CEO John Legere said in a statement.      Under Legere, T-Mobile has been building out and bolstering its 4G LTE network coverage, while attempting to also improve the company's reputation. Its 4G network now reaches more than 300 million people in the U.S., which T-Mobile claims puts the carrier on par with Verizon Wireless and AT&T. Still, the 4G LTE CellSpot could help provide coverage to consumers in less populated areas , where T-Mobile's coverage may not be as strong as its rivals.      This isn't the first time T-Mobile has tried to bolster indoor coverage.      In September of last year, T-Mobile unveiled a CellSpot Wi-Fi router that lets customers make Wi-Fi calls and text in areas beyond cell coverage. More than 1 million of the routers are currently in circulation; T-Mobile customers are making more than 11 million Wi-Fi calls daily, the company says. T-Mobile also offers customers a 4G LTE CellSpot Signal Booster.      That raises the question of where the new 4G LTE CellSpot box fits in, especially if you can already use a router to make Wi-Fi calls.      T-Mobile says that LTE is often faster and more reliable than Wi-Fi, and that the new box is compatible with the latest network technologies, including HD Calling, VoLTE (Voice over LTE), advanced messaging, and video calling. And once installed, T-Mobile's chief operating officer Mike Sievert said in an interview that \\"customers have to do absolutely nothing to make it work.\\"      Today's announcement comes ahead of T-Mobile's next big \\"Un-carrier\\" promotional event, scheduled to take place in Los Angeles on Nov 10. Though T-Mobile hasn't said what next week will bring, the speculation is that the company might let you use popular streaming video services--perhaps, HBO, Hulu, Netflix, and so on—without having it count against your monthly data usage. T-Mobile already does this with many popular music services. Sievert wouldn't spill the beans ahead of time.      Email: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY personal tech columnist @edbaig on Twitter      Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1Mtc0yJ |||||       Customers browse in a T-Mobile store in Budapest on Monday. (Akos Stiller/Bloomberg)      T-Mobile has begun giving out miniature cell towers to customers in an attempt to create little hotspots of LTE where the carrier's network is weak or nonexistent. The devices, which cost little more than a 25 refundable deposit, are being promoted to homes and small businesses and can connect any T-Mobile customer's smartphone to mobile data, including 3G and 4G. The company says they can cover a range of 3,000 square feet.      So should you get one? In some individual circumstances, maybe, but for the vast majority of consumers, you might be better off using plain, old, boring WiFi. Here's why.      T-Mobile's CellSpot doesn't provide an Internet connection all by itself. It has to be plugged into an existing wired broadband connection, the kind of service you might buy from Comcast or Verizon. That requirement ultimately makes the CellSpot impractical for many consumers.      Think about your current home Internet provider. Chances are, the company included a WiFi router with your installation, and if it didn't, you likely went out and bought your own. Not only does the CellSpot effectively duplicate an Internet access technology already present in many people's homes — it comes with other drawbacks. The CellSpot's data speeds are only as fast as your fixed broadband connection, so it's not as though you can plug the device into a 10 Mbps service and suddenly be surfing at 60 Mbps.      \\"Imagine putting a race car in rush hour traffic in the scenario you describe,\\" said Joel Rushing, a T-Mobile spokesperson.      What's more, using the CellSpot drains your T-Mobile data plan, whereas surfing on WiFi is completely free (except in places where wired Internet providers have implemented data caps themselves).      If any other T-Mobile customers happen to be nearby, their devices can link to the CellSpot, too. Giving out access to T-Mobile's network might be nice when you've invited guests over. But then again, why not just give them access to your home WiFi network?      If you're not interested in broadcasting LTE beyond your apartment or other small space, Rushing said, the T-Mobile Personal CellSpot Router might be a better choice. It's basically a regular WiFi router that happens to be optimized to handle T-Mobile's WiFi calling features.      But again, with that choice you'd be going back to WiFi.      Any households that might be thinking of getting an LTE CellSpot from T-Mobile will need to consider a few things: Does being on T-Mobile's network matter more to you than being on WiFi? Compared to the LTE CellSpot, WiFi costs nothing to surf, supports faster speeds, and you have more control over it (through your router's settings, whereas you can't set a password on the LTE CellSpot). ||||| What is a summary?","output":"The T-Mobile 4G LTE CellSpot is a small box that you can plug into your Internet router at home or in your office. It helps make your cellphone signal stronger inside your house, especially in places where the signal might not be very good. It is like having a mini cellphone tower inside your home. T-Mobile gives these CellSpots to some of their customers for free, but you have to leave a 25 deposit and stay as their customer. This can help people who live in areas where T-Mobile's signal isn't as strong as other cellphone companies. However, it uses your T-Mobile data plan, so using it instead of Wi-Fi could use up your monthly data allowance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person that released the standalone Christmas single \\"December Will Be Magic Again?, using the article: Released in September 1980, Never for Ever saw Bush's second foray into production, co-producing with Jon Kelly. Her first experience as a producer was on her Live on Stage EP, released after her tour the previous year. The first two albums had resulted in a definitive sound evident in every track, with orchestral arrangements supporting the live band sound. The range of styles on Never for Ever is much more diverse, veering from the straightforward rocker \\"Violin\\" to the wistful waltz of hit single \\"Army Dreamers\\". Never for Ever was her first album to feature synthesisers and drum machines, in particular the Fairlight CMI, to which she was introduced when providing backing vocals on Peter Gabriel's eponymous third album in early 1980. It was her first record to reach the top position in the UK album charts, also making her the first female British artist to achieve that status, and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at the top. The top-selling single from the album was \\"Babooshka\\", which reached number five in the UK singles chart. In November 1980, she released the standalone Christmas single \\"December Will Be Magic Again\\", which reached number 29 in the UK charts. September 1982 saw the release of The Dreaming, the first album Bush produced by herself. With her new-found freedom, she experimented with production techniques, creating an album that features a diverse blend of musical styles and is known for its near-exhaustive use of the Fairlight CMI. The Dreaming received a mixed reception in the UK, and critics were baffled by the dense soundscapes Bush had created to become \\"less accessible\\". In a 1993 interview with Q (magazine), Bush stated: \\"That was my 'She's gone mad' album.\\" However, the album became her first to enter the US Billboard 200 chart, albeit only reaching number 157. The album entered the UK album chart at number-three, but is to date her lowest-selling album, garnering only a silver disc.\\"Sat in Your Lap\\" was the first single from the album to be released.

Movie plot title: The Bourne Identity Movie plot: In the Mediterranean Sea, Italian fishermen rescue an unconscious American (Matt Damon) floating adrift with two gunshot wounds in his back. They tend to his wounds, and when the man wakes, they find he suffers from dissociative amnesia. He has no memory of his own identity, while he retains his speech and finds himself capable of advanced combat skills and fluency in several languages. The skipper finds a tiny laser projector under the man's hip that, when activated, gives a number of a safe deposit box in ZÃ¼rich. Upon landing, the man heads to investigate the box. Arriving at the bank, the man finds the box contains a large sum of money in various currencies, numerous passports and identity cards with his picture on all of them, and a handgun. The man takes everything but the gun, and leaves, opting to use the name on the American passport, Jason Bourne. After Bourne's departure, a bank employee contacts Operation Treadstone, a CIA black ops program. Treadstone's head, Alexander Conklin (Chris Cooper), activates three agents to take down Bourne: Castel (Nicky Naude), Manheim (Russell Levy), and the Professor (Clive Owen), while also issuing alerts to local police to capture Bourne. Meanwhile, CIA Deputy Director Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) contacts Conklin about a failed assassination attempt against exiled African dictator Nykwana Wombosi (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). Conklin promises Abbott that he will deal with the Treadstone agent who failed. Bourne attempts to evade the Swiss police by using his U.S. passport to enter the American consulate, but he is discovered by guards.

Question: This article: Phillip Bellamy, a leading barrister, tells his wife, psychiatrist Anne Dyson, about his most recent case defending a young man, Harry Jukes, who has apparently shot a policeman on a country road and been found by police still holding the gun. Bellamy is convinced of his guilt but Anne is less sure. Much of her practice is with troubled young people and she feels there is more to the story than the police evidence. Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her. Harry's story is that he took a Bentley Continental car to impress a girl but when she went off with another boy decided to take the car for a spin before dumping it. Swerving to avoid another car he burst a tyre but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help. He flagged down a lorry to ask to borrow a jack. The lorry stopped but the passenger immediately produced a gun and shot the policeman. Harry managed to grab the gun off the killer as the lorry drove away. Shortly after, a police car arrived and Harry was arrested. Anne believes Harry's story and tries to persuade Bellamy of Harry's innocence. She interviews Harry several times and begins to follow up some aspects of his story. She visits the gang that Harry hung out with in a café in Battersea and they agree to help her by trying to find the couple in the parked car. She also visits Taplow, the man whose car was stolen, several times and finds his account unconvincing. One of the boys from the cafe agrees to take a job at Taplow's frozen food depot to do some investigating there. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who feels there is more to the story than the police evidence?, what is it ?

Q: What was once believed to be the smallest of all particles, as dalton's theory proposed?    Choices:  - nucleus  - molecule  - neutron  - atom  A:","output":"A: Atom John Dalton, an English chemist, physicist, and meteorologist, proposed the atomic theory in the early 19th century. This theory was based on the idea that all matter is composed of indivisible, fundamental particles called atoms—from the Greek word \\"atomos,\\" meaning \\"indivisible,\\" or \\"uncut.\\" Dalton's atomic theory was a significant development in the history of chemistry and laid the foundation for our modern understanding of matter. Before Dalton, ancient philosophers like Democritus and Leucippus had also proposed the idea of atoms. However, their work was more philosophical in nature and did not have significant experimental evidence to support their claims. Dalton's theory, on the other hand, combined experimental results with philosophical interpretations, ultimately leading to a more accurate and scientific understanding of matter. According to Dalton's atomic theory: 1. All matter is made up of tiny, indivisible particles called atoms. 2. Atoms of the same element are identical in mass and chemical properties, while atoms of different elements have different masses and distinct chemical properties. 3. Atoms cannot be created or destroyed during a chemical reaction. They can only be rearranged to form new compounds. 4. Compounds are formed when atoms of different elements combine in fixed, whole-number ratios. At that time in history, it was believed that atoms were the smallest particles of matter. The discovery of subatomic particles like protons, neutrons, and electrons in the late 19th and early 20th centuries showed that atoms could be further divided into smaller, constituent particles, ultimately disproving the idea that atoms were the smallest possible unit of matter. Through various experiments, scientists discovered the nature and structure of these subatomic particles. The nucleus, a central, positively charged core within the atom, was found to be composed of protons (positive charge) and neutrons (no charge). Electrons, which are negatively charged particles, orbit around the nucleus in specific energy levels. Despite these discoveries, Dalton's atomic theory still remains a vital foundation for our current understanding of chemistry and the world around us."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},Y={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],j={key:0},R={key:1};function N(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",Y,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",H,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
