We'll start with the base case ( n = 3 ).     **For ( n = 3 )**: Let the three people be denoted as A, B, and C. Consider the triangular formation they make.     - In a non-isosceles triangle triangle ABC, without loss of generality, assume that segment AB is the shortest. Consequently:         - A will target B.         - B will target A.         - Since C is not the target of A or B and does not have a closer neighboring target (as AC > AB and BC > AB), C will remain untouched by water streams.     - Hence, C is the person who remains dry under these circumstances.     Therefore, the base case holds true that among 3 people, at least one person does not get wet. 2. **Inductive Step**:     Assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary odd integer n, i.e., among n people, there is always at least one person who does not get wet.     Now, we will prove the statement for ( n+2 ) people (also an odd number).     **For ( n + 2 ) people**: Consider the scenario including n + 2 people. Induction hypothesis is assumed to be true for n people.     - Identify two people A and B such that the distance between them is minimal.          - Since the problem mentions that each person targets their closest neighbor uniquely, it follows firmly that:             - A will aim at B.             - B will aim at A.     - If these people A and B are targeting each other, both receive water streams.     - Apply the inductive hypothesis on the remaining (n) people:         - At least one person among these n individuals will remain dry by the hypothesis.     - Now consider if anyone else in the group of n + 2 can target either A or B:         - If another person among these n people targets A or B, they duplicate the shot towards A or B.         - Because there are n + 2 shots from n + 2 individuals, at least one person must remain without being targeted by any water stream at all.         Thus, the step proceeds to prove that out of n + 2 people, some person will necessarily remain not targeted and hence not wet. 3. **Conclusion**:          By mathematical induction, we have established that for any odd number of people ( n geq 3 ), there exists at least one person who is not wet when each person targets their closest neighbor.

Mathematically, if a vertex ( V ) has angles (theta_1, theta_2, ldots, theta_n) adjacent to it, then its curvature (or angle deficit) (k(V)) is:    [    k(V) = 2 pi - (theta_1 + theta_2 + cdots + theta_n).    ] 2. **Summing Up Curvatures for All Vertices:** Consider a polyhedron with (V) vertices, (E) edges, and (F) faces.

Thus, f(x) has a minimum at x=1, and there is no maximum value in its domain.

We start by noting that ((x, y, z, t)) are integer solutions to the equation (2^y + 2^z cdot 5^t - 5^x = 1). 2. First, we consider (2^y pmod{5} ). By Fermat's Little Theorem, ( 2^4 equiv 1 pmod{5} ).

In both cases, for any two vertices X and Y, the induction configuration guarantees:     - If neither vertices coincide: connectivity via existing graph maintained.     - If one coincides with C: new edges provide the needed path.

Now, consider the original problem which requires us to find the difference (|a+b|^2 - |a-b|^2). 6. Substituting the expansions for (|a+b|^2) and (|a-b|^2), we get:     [     |a+b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 + (abar{b} + bar{a}b)     ]     [     |a-b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 - (abar{b} + bar{a}b)     ] 7. Therefore, the difference is:     [     |a+b|^2 - |a-b|^2 = left(|a|^2 + |b|^2 + (abar{b} + bar{a}b)right) - left(|a|^2 + |b|^2 - (abar{b} + bar{a}b)right)     ] 8.

Let ( f(x) ) be a polynomial with integer coefficients, and there exists an integer ( k > 1 ) such that ( f(1), f(2), ldots, f(k) ) are not multiples of ( k ). 2. We'll use congruences to understand this property better. If two integers ( a ) and ( b ) have the same remainder when divided by ( k ), we denote ( a equiv b pmod{k} ). 3. First, observe that for any positive integer ( n ), ( a^n equiv b^n pmod{k} ) if ( a equiv b pmod{k} ). This follows by repeated application of the property of congruences under multiplication (i.e., if ( a equiv b pmod{k} ) and ( c equiv d pmod{k} ), then ( ac equiv bd pmod{k} )). 4. Additionally, for any integer ( c ), ( c a^n equiv c b^n pmod{k} ) holds. 5. Moreover, suppose ( a equiv b pmod{k} ) and ( a_1 equiv b_1 pmod{k} ). Then ( a pm a_1 equiv b pm b_1 pmod{k} ). 6. Given this, if ( a equiv b pmod{k} ), then it follows that ( f(a) equiv f(b) pmod{k} ). 7. Now, consider any integer ( a ). When ( a ) is divided by ( k ), its remainder can be one of ( 0, 1, 2, ldots, k-1 ). By the analysis above, ( f(a) equiv f(1), f(2), ldots, f(k) pmod{k} ). 8. Due to the problem’s conditions stating ( f(1), f(2), ldots, f(k) ) are not multiples of ( k ), we conclude ( f(a) ) is not a multiple of ( k ), as it must be congruent to one of ( f(1), f(2), ldots, f(k) ). 9. Therefore, ( f(a) neq 0 pmod{k} ) for all integers ( a ). Since ( a ) was arbitrary, ( f(x) ) cannot have any integer zeroes. 10. For the specific case where ( k = 2 ), if ( f(1) ) and ( f(2) ) are both odd (which means they are not multiples of 2), then ( f(x) ) cannot have any integer zeroes because any integer zero of ( f(x) ) would lead to ( f(a) ) being even, which contradicts the given odd outputs. 11. Assume for contradiction ( f(x) ) has an integer zero, say ( r ), then ( f(r) = 0 ). 12. In this case, ( f(x) ) can be factored as ( f(x) = (x - r) g(x) ). 13. Here ( g(x) ) is also a polynomial with integer coefficients. Since ( r ) is an integer, ( r ) can be written as ( r = p + kq ) for some integers ( p ) and ( q ), where ( 1 leq p leq k ). 14. Hence, ( f(p) = (p - r) g(p) = -kq g(p) ). 15. This implies ( f(p) ) is a multiple of ( k ), which contradicts the original condition that ( f(1), f(2), ldots, f(k) ) are not multiples of ( k ). 16.

This is because an exterior angle is formed by extending one side of the polygon. As you go around the polygon, extending each side to form an exterior angle and adding these angles together, the total will always be a full circle, which is 360^{circ}. Therefore, the sum of exterior angles does not increase with the number of sides.

The goal is to find out how much water, in cubic meters (m^3), was used by a resident who paid 60 yuan in a particular month. **Step 1: Analyze the first tier**   For the first tier, up to 12m^3 of water is priced at 3 yuan/m^3. Therefore, if a resident uses x cubic meters of water where x leqslant 12, the total cost would be 3x yuan. However, since the total bill is 60 yuan, which exceeds the maximum possible bill of 36 yuan (12m^3 times 3 yuan/m^3) in this tier, the usage must be in a higher tier. **Step 2: Analyze the second tier**   For water usage over 12m^3 but not exceeding 18m^3, the price is 6 yuan/m^3.

We need to demonstrate that it's possible to place 8 white pawns and 8 black pawns on these squares such that each row and each column contains exactly one white pawn and one black pawn. 1. **Model as a Bipartite Graph:**    - Consider two sets of vertices: ( R = {r_1, r_2, ..., r_8} ) representing the rows and ( C = {c_1, c_2, ..., c_8} ) representing the columns.    - Draw an edge between ( r_i in R ) and ( c_j in C ) if the square at the intersection of row ( i ) and column ( j ) is in the set ( S ). 2. **Graph Properties:**    - Since each row and column in ( S ) has exactly 2 squares, every vertex in this graph has degree exactly 2.     - In graph theory, a connected graph where each vertex has degree 2 is a cycle. Hence, our graph can be decomposed into a disjoint union of cycles. 3. **Cycle Decomposition:**    - Begin at any vertex ( v ). Follow an edge to another vertex and continue to follow edges until you revisit a vertex. This will form a cycle.    - If ( v neq r_i ), ( v ) is a row vertex and the path must return to a different column than the one it started in.    - Since no vertex can have a degree higher than 2, all cycles must be disjoint (i.e., they do not share any vertices).     4. **Even Numbered Cycles:**    - These cycles must have even lengths. To demonstrate, consider any cycle starting from ( r_i ):      (r_i rightarrow c_j rightarrow r_k rightarrow c_l rightarrow dots rightarrow r_i).    - As you can see, every alternate vertex alternates between rows and columns (( R ) and ( C )) ensuring the cycle length is even. 5. **Color the Edges Alternately:**    - To assign pawns, color edges of the cycles alternately (e.g., black and white).    - Let's say we start with the edge ( r_i - c_j ) colored black. The next edge, ( c_j - r_k ), will be white, and so on. 6. **Pawn Placement:**    - Place a black pawn on ( (r_i, c_j) ) if the edge ( r_i - c_j ) is colored black.    - Place a white pawn on ( (r_i, c_j) ) if the edge ( r_i - c_j ) is colored white.    - Each row ( r_i ) will contain exactly one white and one black edge since each row is part of only one cycle and edges are colored alternately.    - Analogously, each column ( c_j ) will contain exactly one white and one black edge. Therefore, by using this coloring method on the disjoint cycles, it is ensured that each row and column will have exactly one white and one black pawn.

If Ria's number was ( 1 ), then she would have immediately known Sylvie's number to be ( 2 ). Therefore, ( R neq 1 ). 3. **Analyzing Sylvie's Statement:**    - Sylvie also does not know Ria's number. This means Sylvie's number ( S ) cannot be ( 2 ). If Sylvie's number was ( 2 ), she would have known Ria's number to be ( 3 ) because of the consecutive integer rule. 4. **Ria’s Conclusion:**    - Finally, Ria says that she now knows Sylvie's number, which reveals crucial information.

So, 7/8 * 24 = 21 males arrived on time. - This means 24 - 21 = 3 males did not arrive on time. For the females: - Since 3/5 of the attendees were males, 2/5 of the attendees were females.

Thus, we have: [ a^2 < 0 ] However, this is a contradiction since the square of any real number (a^2) must be non-negative ((a^2 geq 0)). This contradiction implies our initial assumption must be incorrect under these specific conditions:  If none of the x_i are 0 or pm 1, the equation a^2 < 0 would not hold because a^2 must be non-negative.

What is the radius of the circumcircle of triangle ( ABC )?","output":"1. Let the centers of the circles be denoted as (X), (Y), and (Z) according to Figure 1. The circles intersect at point (P) with further intersection points being (A), (B), and (C). 2. Consider the quadrilateral (PXAY). Since (PX) and (PA) are radii of the circles centered at (X) and (Y) respectively, both are of unit length. Similarly, (PY) and (AY) are also of unit length. 3. Therefore, the quadrilateral (PXAY) is a rhombus because all of its sides are equal in length. Similarly, the quadrilaterals (PXBZ) and (PYCZ) are also rhombuses. 4. In a rhombus, opposite sides are parallel. Therefore, in the rhombus (PXAY), the segments (XA) and (PY) are parallel. Also, in the rhombus (PXBZ), the segments (XB) and (PZ) are parallel. 5. As a result, (XACZ) forms a parallelogram due to the parallel nature of (XA) and (ZC) and equality in length. Hence, (AC=ZX). Using similar reasoning, we deduce that (YABZ) is a parallelogram and (AB=ZY), and (XBCY) is a parallelogram implying (BC=XY). 6. We observe that (ZXY) forms a triangle, where sides (ZX), (ZY), and (XY) correspond to sides (AC), (AB), and (BC) of triangle (ABC). Hence, triangles (ABC) and (ZXY) are congruent. 7. Since the circumradius of triangle (ZXY) is equal to the common radius of the original circles (unit radius), the circumradius of triangle (ABC) must also be unit length, as the congruent triangles (ABC) and (ZXY) share the same circumradius. 8. Therefore, the radius of the circumcircle of (triangle ABC) is:    [    boxed{1}    ]  Second Proof: 1. Re-using the notations from the first solution, we perform a homothety (scaling transformation) on (triangle ABC) centered at point (P) with scale factor (frac{1}{2}). 2. Because two congruent circles intersect each other, their common chord and the line connecting the centers represent a symmetry axis for the resulting shape. 3. Under this homothety, the points (A), (B), and (C) get mapped to the midpoints of the segments (XY), (XZ), and (YZ), respectively. 4. The midpoints of the sides of a triangle form a triangle similar to the original triangle ((triangle X'Y'Z') in this case), with a similarity ratio of (frac{1}{2}). 5. The similarity of (triangle X'Y'Z') to (triangle XYZ) implies that their circumcircles have the same radius. Since the circumradius of (triangle XYZ) is 1 (radius of the original circles centered at (P)), the circumradius of (triangle ABC) is also 1. 6.

Note that no number that is already on the board can be rewritten. 3. **Euclid's Algorithm for GCD**: According to Euclid's algorithm, repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger (which is essentially what taking the absolute difference repeatedly does) will eventually yield the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial numbers. Here, the GCD of (25) and (36) is calculated as follows:    [    gcd(25, 36) = 1    ]    This is because (25) and (36) are relatively prime. 4. **Progression of Numbers**: As the game progresses, new numbers will be added to the board, starting from ( |36 - 25| = 11 ). We can visualize subsequent steps as follows:    - Numbers (25, 36, 11) are now on the board.    - Next, ( |25 - 11| = 14 ), so the board has (25, 36, 11, 14).    - Continuing this way, we add ( |36 - 11| = 25 ) (which is already present), so we cannot add (25) again. In simpler terms, continue adding:    - ( |25 - 36|, |25 - 11|, |25 - 14|, |36 - 25|, |36 - 14|, ldots, |36 - 1| ). 5. **Reach 1 and Beyond**: Eventually, through this iterative subtraction method, 1 will appear on the board. Once (1) is on the board, the absolute difference operation ensures that all integers between 1 and 36 will eventually appear on the board. For instance, subtracting (1) from any other number produces a sequence leading towards all integers from (1) to (36). 6. **Game Termination**:    - The game will thus progress systematically, bringing all integers from 1 to 36 onto the board step-by-step.    - Since there are (36) unique integers, there will be (36 - 2 = 34) moves from the starting numbers until the board is full. 7. **Win Condition**:    - The second player will always make the last move in a sequential alternation incorporating 1 move for player 1 and 1 for player 2, totaling 34.    - Hence, the second player makes the 34th move, ensuring that there are no available new numbers to introduce after their final move.

The deviation of the frequency from the probability is given by ( delta = frac{m}{n} - 0.5 ). 4. The absolute deviation is ( lvert delta rvert = lvert frac{m}{n} - 0.5 rvert ). Now, let us consider two scenarios: tossing the coin 10 times and tossing it 100 times.  Scenario 1: Coin tossed 10 times 1. Let the number of heads in 10 trials be ( m ). The deviation is calculated as    [    alpha = frac{m}{10} - 0.5    ]    Thus, the absolute deviation is ( lvert alpha rvert ).  Scenario 2: Coin tossed 100 times 1. We can break the 100 tosses into 10 sequences of 10 tosses each. Assume each sequence has its deviation ( alpha_i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, 10 ). 2. The overall deviation ( beta ) can be represented as the average of these 10 deviations:    [    beta = frac{sum_{i=1}^{10} 10 alpha_i + 50}{100} = frac{sum_{i=1}^{10} alpha_i}{10}    ] 3. Hence, the absolute deviation for 100 tosses is given by:    [    lvert beta rvert = 0.1 left| sum_{i=1}^{10} alpha_i right| leq 0.1 left( sum_{i=1}^{10} lvert alpha_i rvert right)    ]  Comparison of Expected Absolute Deviations 1. Let ( X ) be the random variable defined as:    [    X = sum_{i=1}^{10} lvert alpha_i rvert - 10 lvert beta rvert    ]    Since ( X geq 0 ), ( mathrm{E}[X] > 0 ). 2. Therefore, the expectation can be set up as:    [    mathrm{E}[X] = mathrm{E} left[ sum_{i=1}^{10} lvert alpha_i rvert right] - 10 mathrm{E}[ lvert beta rvert ] = 10( mathrm{E}[lvert alpha rvert] - mathrm{E}[ lvert beta rvert ] )    ]    As ( mathrm{E}[X] > 0 ), it implies ( mathrm{E}[lvert alpha rvert] > mathrm{E}[lvert beta rvert] ). # Conclusion The expected absolute deviation of the frequency of heads from the probability is greater in the series of 10 tosses.

Since the train and the man are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds to find the relative speed: Relative speed = Speed of train + Speed of man Relative speed = 60 kmph + 6 kmph Relative speed = 66 kmph Now, we need to convert this relative speed from kmph to m/s because the time given is in seconds. To convert kmph to m/s, we multiply by (1000 m / 1 km) and divide by (3600 s / 1 hour): Relative speed in m/s = 66 kmph * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 hour) Relative speed in m/s = 66 * 1000 / 3600 Relative speed in m/s = 66000 / 3600 Relative speed in m/s = 18.333... m/s (approximately) Now that we have the relative speed in m/s, we can use the time it takes for the train to pass the man to find the length of the train: Length of train = Relative speed * Time Length of train = 18.333... m/s * 5.999520038396929 s Length of train ≈ 110 m Therefore, the length of the train is approximately boxed{110}  meters."},{"instruction":"f 6 daps are equivalent to 5 dops, and 3 dops are equivalent to 10 dips, how many daps are equivalent to 60 dips?","output":"Step 1: Establish the relationship between daps and dops.

The equation frac{x^2}{k-3} - frac{y^2}{k}=1 will represent a hyperbola if and only if both k - 3 and k are positive, which ensures that the denominators are both real and nonzero. The conditions we then have are: 1. k - 3 > 0, which gives us k > 3, 2. k > 0. Condition 1 is what we're given in the problem statement. It ensures that the coefficient of x^2 is positive, which is one of the conditions for the equation to represent a hyperbola. Condition 2 is required to make sure that the coefficient of y^2 is negative since -frac{y^2}{k} must be negative for a standard hyperbola, which means k also has to be positive. Therefore, \\"k > 3\\" is a sufficient condition because if it is true, then the equation frac{x^2}{k-3} - frac{y^2}{k}=1 has a positive x^2 coefficient, which is part of what's needed for it to represent a hyperbola.

Divisibility by 17: We need to check when: [ 20^n + 16^n - 3^n - 1 equiv 0 pmod{17} ] First, reduce the bases modulo 17: [ 20 equiv 3 pmod{17} quad text{and} quad 16 equiv -1 pmod{17} ] Therefore, the expression can be rewritten as: [ 3^n + (-1)^n - 3^n - 1 pmod{17} ] Simplifying, we get: [ 3^n + (-1)^n - 3^n - 1 equiv 0 pmod{17} ] [ ((-1)^n - 1) equiv 0 pmod{17} ] This simplifies to: [ (-1)^n equiv 1 pmod{17} ] Since ( (-1)^n ) is 1 if ( n ) is even and -1 if ( n ) is odd, ( (-1)^n equiv 1 ) implies that ( n ) must be even.  Divisibility by 19: Similarly, we need to check when: [ 20^n + 16^n - 3^n - 1 equiv 0 pmod{19} ] Reduce the bases modulo 19: [ 20 equiv 1 pmod{19} quad text{and} quad 16 equiv -3 pmod{19} ] Thus, the expression becomes: [ 1^n + (-3)^n - 3^n - 1 pmod{19} ] Simplifying, we get: [ 1 + (-3)^n - 3^n - 1 equiv 0 pmod{19} ] [ ((-3)^n - 3^n) equiv 0 pmod{19} ] This simplifies to: [ (-3)^n equiv 3^n pmod{19} ] Since ( (-3)^n = 3^n (-1)^n ), it follows that: [ 3^n (-1)^n equiv 3^n pmod{19} ] [ (-1)^n equiv 1 pmod{19} ] This implies that ((-1)^n equiv 1) which again means that ( n ) must be even. # Conclusion: Since ( n ) must be even for both conditions to be satisfied, we conclude the solution as follows: [ boxed{text{При чётных } n} ]"},{"instruction":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n} whose sum of the first n terms is S_n, if S_4  S_1 = 3, what is a_3?

Let's evaluate f(2005) + f(2006) + f(2007) step by step: First, using the periodicity property, we can simplify each term by reducing the argument modulo 4: 1. For f(2005):     Because 2005 equiv 1 pmod{4}, we have f(2005) = f(1). 2. For f(2006):     Since 2006 equiv 2 pmod{4}, it follows that f(2006) = f(2). 3. For f(2007):     Given 2007 equiv 3 pmod{4}, we get f(2007) = f(3).     Now, let's use the odd function property to simplify further: 1. We already have f(2005) = f(1). 2. We have f(2006) = f(2). 3. For f(2007) = f(3), since f(x) is odd, we know that f(3)= -f(-3), but since the function is periodic with a period of 4, f(-3) = f(-3 + 4) = f(1). Therefore, f(2007) = -f(1). Combining these insights, we can evaluate the sum:  f(2005) + f(2006) + f(2007) = f(1) + f(2) - f(1).  The f(1) and -f(1) terms cancel each other out, leaving us with:  f(2005) + f(2006) + f(2007) = f(2).

This means every alternate node is colored black or white (similar to a chessboard).    - Since each broken line segment is along the sides of the cells, it will connect nodes of different colors. 2. **Analyzing endpoints of the broken lines:**    - Each unit segment of a broken line connects two differently colored nodes.    - Therefore, a broken line with endpoints of the same color contains an odd number of nodes.    - Conversely, a broken line with endpoints of different colors contains an even number of nodes. 3. **Considering nodes on the boundary:**    - Let's assume (for contradiction) that each non-corner boundary node is an endpoint of a broken line.    - If we denote the number of white boundary nodes (excluding corners) by (4m) and the number of black boundary nodes (excluding corners) by (4n) (since the length of each side is even, boundary nodes excluding corners are in multiples of 4). 4. **Counting lines with endpoints of the same color:**    - Let (k) be the number of broken lines with both endpoints being white.    - The number of broken lines with different colored endpoints would then be (4m - 2k), since each of these lines takes away one white and one black node.    - Similarly, the number of broken lines with both endpoints being black would be (frac{4n - (4m - 2k)}{2} = 2(n - m) + k). 5. **Total broken lines:**    - Adding up the lines with same color endpoints:     [    k + 2(n - m) + k = 2(n - m + k)    ]    - This is an even number. 6. **Total number of nodes:**    - Note that the (100 times 100) grid contains ((100+1) times (100+1) = 101 times 101) nodes.    - This grid has an odd number of nodes (101 x 101 = 10201). 7. **Conclusion:**    - Since each broken line contributes an even number of nodes and the total number of nodes is odd, it implies not all nodes are part of broken lines.    - Therefore, there must be at least one node that is not part of any broken line besides the vertices of the square.

Therefore, the minimum point of the original graph is (-1, -4). 2. **Apply the translations**:    - Translate three units to the right: x-coordinate shifts from -1 to -1 + 3 = 2.    - Translate four units up: y-coordinate shifts from -4 to -4 + 4 = 0. 3. **Calculate the new minimum point**:    After applying the transformations, the new minimum point of the graph is (2, 0).

If it is sold at 40 yuan per kilogram, they can sell 20 kilograms per day. Market research shows that if the selling price of this fruit is reduced by 1 yuan per kilogram, the daily sales volume will increase by 2 kilograms.<br/>(1) If the daily profit from selling this fruit remains the same, by how many yuan should the selling price per kilogram be reduced?<br/>(2) By reducing the selling price, can the daily profit from selling this fruit reach 460 yuan? If yes, by how many yuan should the selling price be reduced? If not, please explain why.","output":"# Solution:  Part (1): Let's denote the reduction in selling price per kilogram as x yuan. Therefore, the new selling price becomes (40 - x) yuan per kilogram. The cost price remains unchanged at 20 yuan per kilogram, so the profit per kilogram is now (40 - x - 20) yuan. With the reduction in price, the daily sales volume increases to (20 + 2x) kilograms. The original daily profit was calculated at the initial selling price of 40 yuan per kilogram, which is (40 - 20) times 20 = 400 yuan. To keep the daily profit unchanged, we set up the equation: [ (40 - x - 20)(20 + 2x) = 400 ] Simplifying this equation: [ 20x - x^2 = 400 - 400 ] [ x^2 - 20x + 400 - 400 = 0 ] [ x^2 - 20x = 0 ] [ x(x - 20) = 0 ] Solving for x, we find x_1 = 0 and x_2 = 20. Since reducing the price by 0 yuan does not change anything, we discard this solution. Therefore, the selling price should be reduced by x = 20 yuan per kilogram to keep the daily profit unchanged. The correct answer is boxed{10} yuan per kilogram.  Part (2): Assuming the selling price is reduced by y yuan to increase the daily profit to 460 yuan, the profit per kilogram becomes (40 - y - 20) yuan, and the daily sales volume becomes (20 + 2y) kilograms. Setting up the equation for the desired profit: [ (40 - y - 20)(20 + 2y) = 460 ] Simplifying: [ 20y - y^2 = 460 - 400 ] [ y^2 - 20y + 60 = 0 ] To determine the feasibility of this equation, we calculate the discriminant Delta: [ Delta = (-20)^2 - 4 times 1 times 60 = 400 - 240 = 160 ] Since Delta = 160 > 0, the equation has real roots, indicating that it is possible to adjust the selling price to achieve a daily profit of 460 yuan. However, there was a mistake in the calculation of the discriminant in the original solution. The correct calculation should lead to a different conclusion about the feasibility of achieving a 460 yuan daily profit. Upon reevaluation, the correct approach for part (2) should involve correctly solving the quadratic equation or reassessing the feasibility based on the correct discriminant calculation. The mistake in the discriminant calculation in the original solution led to an incorrect conclusion.  Given the error in the original solution's calculation, let's correct the process for determining the feasibility of achieving a 460 yuan profit: The correct equation for part (2) should be: [ y^2 - 10y + 30 = 0 ] And the discriminant Delta is correctly calculated as: [ Delta = (-10)^2 - 4 times 1 times 30 = 100 - 120 = -20 ] Since Delta = -20 < 0, the equation indeed has no real roots, confirming that it is not possible to achieve a daily profit of 460 yuan by reducing the selling price. Therefore, the corrected conclusion for part (2) is boxed{text{No, the daily profit cannot reach 460 yuan by reducing the selling price.}}"},{"instruction":"Let function f(x) = aln x + bx (a > 0), and let g(x) = x^2.

(2) Suppose G(x) = g(x)  f(x) + 2 has two zeros x_1 and x_2, and x_1, x_0, x_2 are in arithmetic progression. Let G'(x) be the derivative of G(x). Prove that G'(x_0) > 0.","output":"(1) The derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = frac{a}{x} + b. Using the conditions f(1) = g(1) and f'(1) = g'(1), we get the following system of equations: begin{cases} a + b = 2  frac{a}{1} + b = 2 end{cases} Solving this system yields a = b = 1. Therefore, f(x) = ln x + x. Since f(x) and g(x) share a common point (1, 1), the equation of the tangent line to g(x) = x^2 at point (1, 1) is y = 2x - 1. Now we verify that both f(x) leq 2x - 1 and g(x) geq 2x - 1 hold. Let h(x) = ln x + x - (2x - 1) = ln x - x + 1. The derivative of h(x) is h'(x) = frac{1}{x} - 1 = frac{1 - x}{x}. When x in (0, 1), h'(x) > 0. When x in (1, +infty), h'(x) < 0. Thus, at x = 1, h(x) reaches its maximum value h(1) = 0. Therefore, ln x + x leq 2x - 1 always holds, which implies f(x) leq 2x - 1. Similarly, since x^2 - 2x + 1 geq 0, we have x^2 geq 2x - 1, from which it follows that g(x) geq 2x - 1 always holds. Thus, such k and m do exist, and we have k = 2 and m = -1. boxed{k = 2, m = -1} (2) Since G(x) = g(x) - f(x) + 2 = x^2 - aln x - bx + 2, and there are two zeros x_1 and x_2, we have: begin{cases} x_{2}^{2} - aln x_{2} - bx_{2} + 2 = 0  x_{1}^{2} - aln x_{1} - bx_{1} + 2 = 0 end{cases} Subtracting the two equations yields: x_{2}^{2} - x_{1}^{2} - a(ln x_{2} - ln x_{1}) - b(x_{2} - x_{1}) = 0 Thus, (x_1 + x_2) - b = frac{a(ln x_{2} - ln x_{1})}{x_{2} - x_{1}}. Since x_1 + x_2 = 2x_0, we find: G'(x_{0}) = 2x_{0} - frac{a}{x_{0}} - b = frac{a(ln x_{2} - ln x_{1})}{x_{2} - x_{1}} - frac{2a}{x_{1} + x_{2}} = frac{a}{x_{2} - x_{1}}left[ln frac{x_{2}}{x_{1}} - frac{2(x_{2} - x_{1})}{x_{2} + x_{1}}right] Consider the following two cases: (i) When 0 < x_1 < x_2, let t = frac{x_{2}}{x_{1}} (hence t > 1), and we get: G'(x_{0}) = frac{a}{x_{2} - x_{1}}left[ln t - frac{2(t - 1)}{1 + t}right] Define mu(t) = ln t - frac{2(t - 1)}{1 + t}, then its derivative is:  mu'(t) = frac{1}{t} - frac{4}{(1 + t)^2} = frac{(1 - t)^2}{t(1 + t)^2} > 0  This means mu(t) is an increasing function on (1, +infty), and since mu(1) = 0, we have mu(t) > 0. Thus:  ln t - frac{2(t - 1)}{1 + t} > 0  Given that a > 0 and x_2 - x_1 > 0, we conclude that G'(x_{0}) > 0. (ii) When 0 < x_2 < x_1, by an analogous reasoning, G'(x_{0}) > 0 is also true.

This results in (m) blue chips, each in different rows (since they are placed in different columns). 5. **Inequality Analysis**      Since there are (n) red chips and each must be in a different column, but there are only (m) columns, it follows that (m geq n). Similarly, since there are (m) blue chips and each must be in a different row, it implies (n geq m). Thus:    [    n leq m quad text{and} quad m leq n implies n = m    ] 6. **Conclusion from Inequalities**      With (n = m), the board is an (n times n) square where every row contains exactly one red chip and every column contains exactly one blue chip. Since the placement rule requires different columns for red chips and different rows for blue chips, each position on the board must be uniquely accounted by the grid size. 7. **Common Cell with Red and Blue Chips**      Consider the top row, which must contain a blue chip (since it's placed in a unique row and column). This blue chip in the top row’s column indicates a black cell. 8. **Middle Cell Analysis**      In any column, the black cell where the blue chip is placed should, by problem condition, also be the middle black cell for that row (containing the red chip).     Hence, the cells defined as mid-point black cells per row inherently overlap as row-wise mid-points for columns, leading to:    [    text{Red chip's position} = text{Blue chip's position}    ] 9. **Conclusion**      Thus, there must exist at least one cell where both a red chip and a blue chip coincide, meaning that this cell is both the mid-point for its row and column’s black cells.

This implies continuity of the first derivative of the position with respect to time at the junction point.     3. **Tangency Condition:**    - At the point of transition, the straight line must match the direction of the circular arc's tangent.     - In other words, the straight line should be tangent to the circular arc at the point where the transition occurs.     4. **Visual Representation:**    - Imagine a point moving counterclockwise along a circular path. If the point must transition smoothly onto a straight path, then at the exact transition point, the straight path must align perfectly with the tangent of the circular path at that point.     5. **Mathematical Formulation:**    - Let the point of transition be at ((x_0, y_0)).    - The slope ( m ) of the tangent to the arc, and hence the line, at this point can be derived from the derivative of the function describing the arc.    - The straight line equation that is tangent to the circle at point ((x_0, y_0)) can be expressed as:      [      y - y_0 = m(x - x_0)      ]      where ( m ) is the slope of the tangent to the arc at ((x_0, y_0)). 6. **Ensure Smoothness:**    - The radial line to the circle at ((x_0, y_0)) is perpendicular to the tangent line.    - Thus, the angle between the path of the point on the arc and the straight line is zero, ensuring no sudden change in direction or velocity.     # Conclusion: For the smooth transition to occur without any jolt, the straight line should be tangent to the curve at the point of transition.

These sets are pairwise disjoint, and their union is the set of all positive integers, (mathbf{N}^*).      2. **Key Lemma**:     We first establish a lemma regarding irreducible polynomials with integer coefficients:     > **Lemma**: Suppose (f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 x + a_0) is a polynomial with integer coefficients. If (a_0 = p) is a prime number and (p > |a_1| + |a_2| + cdots + |a_n|), then (f) is irreducible over the integers.     3. **Proof of the Lemma**:          a. Suppose, for contradiction, that (f(x)) can be factored as (f(x) = g(x) h(x)), where (g(x)) and (h(x)) are polynomials with integer coefficients.          b. Considering the constant term, let (g(x) = g_n x^n + cdots + g_1 x + g_0) and (h(x) = h_m x^m + cdots + h_1 x + h_0). Consequently, (g(0) h(0) = p).          c. Since (p) is a prime, one of (|g(0)|) or (|h(0)|) must be 1. Assume without loss of generality that (|g(0)| = 1). Thus, (g(0)) is either 1 or -1.          d. Now, consider any root (alpha) of (g(x)). Since (g(x)) and (h(x)) have integer coefficients, and (|g(0)| = 1), (|alpha|) must satisfy (|alpha| leq 1).          e. Plugging (alpha) as a root back into (f(x)),     [     |f(alpha)| = left| sum_{i=1}^n a_i alpha^i + p right|.     ]     Using the triangle inequality, we get:     [     |f(alpha)| geq p - left| sum_{i=1}^n a_i alpha^i right| geq p - sum_{i=1}^n |a_i| > 0.     ]          f. This result indicates that (|f(alpha)| > 0), which is a contradiction since (alpha) was presumed to be a root of (f(x)). Hence, (f(x)) is irreducible. This completes the proof of the lemma.     (blacksquare) 4. **Application of the Lemma**:     Given the set (A_i) contains infinitely many prime numbers, we can construct infinitely many polynomials of the form (f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 x + a_0) with (a_0) being a prime number from (A_i) and ensuring that (a_0 > |a_1| + |a_2| + cdots + |a_n|). Each such polynomial will be irreducible due to the lemma. 5. **Conclusion**:     For some (i in {1, 2, cdots, k}), there exist infinitely many irreducible (n)-th degree polynomials with coefficients in (A_i) where all coefficients are distinct.

By the property of the power of a point, since the point ( M ) has equal power with respect to all three circles, it must lie on the radical axes (common chords) of the pairs of circles.    - Specifically, the radical axis (line consisting of points that have equal power with respect to two circles) of any two circles is the line joining their common chords.    - For instance, the common chord of the circles with diameters ( AA_1 ) and ( BB_1 ) intersects the circle with diameter ( CC_1 ) at point ( M ). 5. **Conclusion**:    - Therefore, the common chords of these circles, corresponding to the sides of the cyclic quadrilaterals, intersect each other at the orthocenter ( M ).    Hence, it is proven that the common chords of the circles drawn with the altitudes of a triangle as diameters intersect at the orthocenter of the triangle:    [    boxed{}    ]"},{"instruction":"f the infinite arithmetic sequence {a_{n}} has a first term a_{1} gt 0 and a common difference d lt 0, and the sum of the first n terms of the sequence is S_{n}, then which of the following is true?

This means that each subsequent term is less than the previous one. 3. **Behavior of the Sequence**: Initially, as we add positive terms, S_{n} increases. However, once the terms become negative (which they will, because the sequence is decreasing and infinite), adding more terms will start to decrease the total sum. 4. **Conclusion on S_{n}**: Given this behavior, S_{n} first increases as positive terms are added, reaches a maximum when the sum of positive terms is maximized just before adding negative terms starts to decrease the sum, and then decreases as more and more negative terms are added.

Each subsequent word in the sequence is formed by inserting a letter into the previous word. 2. **Counting the Sequences:**    To form the word \\"CCAMT\\", we start with one letter and add one letter at a time until we have all five letters. The order in which we add the letters matters, but the position within the word can vary. 3. **Permutations with Repetition:**    The word \\"CCAMT\\" contains 5 letters where 'C' appears twice. The number of distinct permutations of the letters in \\"CCAMT\\" is given by the formula for permutations of a multiset:    [    frac{n!}{n_1! cdot n_2! cdot ldots cdot n_k!}    ]    where ( n ) is the total number of items to arrange, and ( n_1, n_2, ldots, n_k ) are the frequencies of the distinct items. 4. **Applying the Formula:**    Here, ( n = 5 ) (total letters), and the frequencies are ( 2 ) for 'C' and ( 1 ) for 'A', 'M', and 'T'. Thus, the number of distinct sequences is:    [    frac{5!}{2! cdot 1! cdot 1! cdot 1!} = frac{120}{2} = 60    ] 5. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, the number of sequences of words that can be formed under the given conditions is 60.

Thus, (mathcal{F}_1 = 1).    - For ( n = 2 ): There are two ways to pave the strip:      1. Two vertical bricks of size ( 2 times 1 )      2. One horizontal brick of size ( 1 times 2 ) arranged side by side      Thus, (mathcal{F}_2 = 2). 2. **Recursive Formula:**    We observe that the number of ways to pave a strip of length ( n ) can be related to previously computed values. Specifically, for ( n geq 3 ):        - **Case 1:** The last brick placed is vertical (size ( 2 times 1 )). The remaining strip to be paved is then of size ( 2 times (n - 1) ). The number of ways to pave this strip is (mathcal{F}_{n-1}).    - **Case 2:** The last brick placed is horizontal (size ( 1 times 2 )). In this case, there must be another horizontal brick directly above it to fill the 2 units height. The remaining strip to be paved is then of size ( 2 times (n - 2) ).

That is, assume it is true for ( n = k ) and ( n = k-1 ). 5. **Induction Step:**    We need to show the formula also holds for ( n = k+1 ):    [    mathcal{F}_{k+1} = mathcal{F}_k + mathcal{F}_{k-1}    ]    This follows directly from the relationship established in the recursive formula in step 2. 6. **Conclusion:**    By the principle of mathematical induction, the number of ways to pave a ( 2 times n ) strip with bricks of size ( 1 times 2 ) or ( 2 times 1 ) is given by the ( n )-th term of the Fibonacci sequence defined as:    [    mathcal{F}_0 = 1, quad mathcal{F}_1 = 1, quad text{and for } n geq 2, quad mathcal{F}_n = mathcal{F}_{n-1} + mathcal{F}_{n-2}    ] Thus, the number of ways to pave the ( 2 times n ) strip is [ boxed{mathcal{F}_n} ]"},{"instruction":"is known that (frac{7}{13} + sin varphi = cos varphi) for some real (varphi).

We need to prove that there are at least two equal integers in the grid. 2. **Applying the Principle**:    Let's denote the minimum integer in the grid as ( a ). Due to the condition given (each pair of neighboring integers differ by at most 5), the maximum integer in the grid cannot exceed ( a + 95 ). 3. **Calculating the Range**:    The grid is (10 times 10), which contains 100 cells. Given that each integer in the grid is within the range from ( a ) to ( a + 95 ), the number of possible distinct integer values is:    [    a, a + 1, a + 2, ldots, a + 95    ]    Hence, the total number of distinct possible values is:    [    95 - 0 + 1 = 96    ] 4. **Application of the Pigeonhole Principle**:    Since there are 100 cells but only 96 possible distinct values, by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least two cells that contain the same integer.

This means T is directly opposite Q on the line extending through R perpendicular to PR.  The length of ST can be calculated by recognizing that triangle PRT is isosceles with PT = RT = 10 and PR = 10. Thus, ST is the altitude from P to TR, and since PRT is also a right triangle, ST is half of TR. Since PT = RT, the length of TR is same as PR, which is 10, and hence ST = 5.

Since a_n=2cdot(frac{1}{2})^{n-1}=2^{2-n} and b_n=3-log_2 a_n=2n-1, the sequence {b_n} is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 1 and the common difference 2. Therefore, a_n=2^{2-n} and b_n=2n-1. (II) Since c_n=frac{a_n}{b_n}=(2n-1)cdot 2^{n-2}, we have T_n=frac{1}{2}times 1+1times 3+2times 5+dots+2^{n-2}times(2n-1).

This means that after a finite number of steps, the continued fraction will repeat. 6. **Application of ( f )**: By applying ( f ) repeatedly, we can shift the continued fraction representation to the left. Since the continued fraction is eventually periodic, there will be a point where the sequence repeats. 7. **Conclusion**: Since the continued fraction representation of ( x_1 ) is eventually periodic, there exist positive integers ( k ) and ( ell ) such that ( x_k = x_ell ). This is because the periodicity ensures that the sequence of values ( x_n ) will eventually repeat. [ boxed{text{True}} ]"},{"instruction":"is now between 9:00 and 10:00 o'clock.

This is equivalent to forming a happy polynomial. 11. **Conclusion on number of happy polynomials:**    The mapping ( f(x) mapsto h(x) ) provides a bijection between:    - Happy polynomials of degree ( leq n ) with ( n )-th degree coefficient ( frac{c}{n!} ).    - Happy polynomials of degree ( leq n-1 ).        Since ( c ) has ( n! ) possible values, we conclude that there are ( n! ) times as many happy polynomials of degree ( leq n ) as of degree ( leq n-1 ).

The condition for f(x) to be monotonically increasing is f'(x) geq 0 for all x in mathbb{R}. 2. Calculating the derivative, we get f'(x) = 2 - 2(a+1)e^{x} + 2ae^{2x}. 3. Letting t = e^{x} (since e^{x} > 0 for all x), we rewrite the inequality as at^{2} - (a+1)t + 1 geq 0 for all t > 0. 4. Define g(t) = at^{2} - (a+1)t + 1. Noting that g(1) = 0, we analyze the conditions for g(t) geq 0. 5. For g(t) geq 0 to hold for all t > 0, we require a > 0 and the discriminant Delta = (a+1)^{2} - 4a leq 0. 6.

The derivative h'(x) = frac{1-x}{{e}^{x}} indicates h(x) is increasing for x < 1. 3. Since h(x) increases on (-infty, 1) and decreases on (1, +infty), we have x_{1} < 1 < x_{2}. 4. Define H(x) = h(x) - h(2-x) for x < 1. The derivative H'(x) = h'(x) + h'(2-x) simplifies to e^{x-2}(x-1)(1-e^{2-2x}) > 0 for x < 1. 5. Since H(x) is increasing on (-infty, 1), we have H(x) < H(1), implying h(x) < h(2-x). 6. Therefore, h(x_{1}) < h(2-x_{1}) leads to x_{2} > 2-x_{1}, which implies x_{1} + x_{2} > 2.

This confirms that it is indeed a straight line. Thus, statement A is correct. B: Since the slope m = -5 < 0, as x increases, y will decrease because the slope is negative. This means that for every unit increase in x, y decreases by 5 units. Therefore, statement B is correct. C: The function passes through the origin (0,0) because when x = 0, y = -5(0) = 0. This confirms that the graph intersects the origin, making statement C correct. D: For the graph to pass through the first and third quadrants, the function would need to have both positive and negative values for y when x is positive and negative, respectively. However, since y = -5x, for x > 0 (first quadrant), y is negative, and for x < 0 (third quadrant), y is positive. This means the graph actually passes through the second (x < 0, y > 0) and fourth quadrants (x > 0, y < 0), not the first and third.

The clock has 12 hours, divided into 12 sections, each representing an hour. 4. We translate the problem into selecting the initial position of the minute hand such that, 20 minutes later, it has swept past exactly two positions.

(i) When a = 0, f'(x) = -e^-x (x - 1). Let f'(x) > 0, we get x < 1; f'(x) < 0, we get x > 1. Therefore, f(x) is monotonically increasing in (-∞, 1) and monotonically decreasing in (1, +∞).

Specifically, we observe how these operations affect the entries modulo ( n-1 ). 2. **Modulo ( n-1 ) Analysis:**        - **Subtracting ( n ) from a column:** This operation does not change the entries modulo ( n-1 ). If an entry is ( x ), then its new value is ( x - n ). However:      [      x - n equiv x - (n-1 + 1) equiv x - 1 pmod{n-1}      ]      Given ( -1 equiv n-1 pmod{n-1} ), this transformation doesn't change the remainder modulo ( n-1 ).    - **Multiplying a row by ( n ):** If an entry is ( x ), then its new value is ( x cdot n ). Considering that ( n equiv 1 pmod{n-1} ), we have:      [      x cdot n equiv x cdot 1 = x pmod{n-1}      ]    Thus, both operations leave the entries unchanged modulo ( n-1 ). 3. **Implications when ( n > 2 ):**    For ( n > 2 ), any entry that is not initially a multiple of ( n-1 ) cannot be made zero, because the value modulo ( n-1 ) remains constant. Therefore, zeroing the entire table is impossible unless every entry was a multiple of ( n-1 ) initially, which isn't guaranteed. 4. **Special Cases ( n = 1 ) and ( n = 2 ):**    - **For ( n = 1 ):**      - Subtracting 1 from a column repeatedly will achieve zeroes. However, multiplication by 1 does not change entries.      - If there are at least two rows and a column where not all elements are initially the same, we cannot achieve all zeros efficiently, as the row operation (multiplication by 1) is ineffective. Thus, ( n = 1 ) cannot guarantee the desired outcome.    - **For ( n = 2 ):**      - Subtraction of 2 reduces all entries by 2.      - Multiplying by 2 doubles all entries in a row, but does not create any non-integer values if we're starting with positive integers. 5. **Strategy to Zero the Table when ( n = 2 ):**    Assume any starting configuration of the table:        a. **Ensure all entries in a row are even:**       - Iterate through rows. For each row, if it contains any odd number (i.e., not divisible by 2), multiply that row by 2 so that all entries become even numbers.    b. **Zero Out Columns Step-by-Step:**       - Choose a column. All entries in this column are even. Let the largest entry in this column be ( 2m ).       - Subtract 2 from all elements in that column until the maximal entry reaches zero. This reduction step-by-step will still keep the column numbers even.       - If required, treat any ( 2k ) as ( k times 2 ), and if some entries turn into 4 or higher, use subtraction steps repeatedly to reduce them back to regular evens. 6. **Repeating the Process:**        Repeat the above process for each column until all columns are zero. Since each iteration reduces the table and no odd numbers remain at any step (ensuring that all numbers involved are managed to be reduced by a factor), we can systematically zero out the entire table. # Conclusion: The only value of ( n ) for which we can always reduce the table to all zeros, irrespective of the size or content of the starting table, is ( n = 2 ).

(2) Discuss the positional relationship between the line y=kx+1 and the parabola, and find the range of values for k that correspond to this relationship.","output":"From the information provided, we can let the equation of the parabola be y^2=2px (with p>0). Since the parabola passes through the point (3, 6), we have:  6^2 = 2 cdot p cdot 3  Solving for p, we get p=6. Therefore, the equation of the parabola is: y^2 = 12x. Let's denote the intersection points of the line y=2x-6 and the parabola as A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2).  From the system of equations: begin{cases} y^2=12x  y=2x-6 end{cases} we can substitute y^2 from the second equation into the first to get:  (2x-6)^2 = 12x  Simplifying the above equation gives us:  x^2 - 9x + 9 = 0  By Vieta's formulas, we have x_1 + x_2 = 9 and x_1 cdot x_2 = 9. Now, the length of the chord |AB| is found using the distance formula:  |AB| = sqrt{1+k^2} cdot sqrt{(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2}  Since k from y=2x-6 is 2, we have:  |AB| = sqrt{1+2^2} cdot sqrt{9^2 - 4 cdot 9} = sqrt{5} cdot sqrt{81 - 36} = sqrt{5} cdot sqrt{45} = 15  So, the length of the chord formed by the intersection of the parabola with the line y=2x-6 is boxed{15}. For part (2), when k=0, the line y=1 intersects the parabola at one point. When k neq 0, from the system of equations: begin{cases} y = kx+1  y^2 = 12x end{cases} we substitute y^2 from the first equation into the second to obtain:  (kx+1)^2 = 12x  Simplifying, we find the quadratic equation:  k^2x^2 + 2(k-6)x + 1 = 0  For the discriminant Delta, when Delta = 4(k-6)^2 - 4k^2 > 0, we find by solving that k < 3. Therefore, the line and the parabola intersect at two points when k < 3. When Delta = 4(k-6)^2 - 4k^2 < 0, we find by solving that k > 3. This means the line and the parabola do not intersect, hence they are separate when k > 3. When Delta = 4(k-6)^2 - 4k^2 = 0, which occurs when k = 3, the line is tangent to the parabola and they have one point of intersection. Summarizing: - When k > 3, the line y=kx+1 and the parabola do not intersect. - When k = 3, the line is tangent to the parabola. - When k < 3 and k neq 0, the line and the parabola intersect at two points. - When k = 0, the line and the parabola intersect at one point. Therefore, the range of k for different positional relationships is: - k > 3: Line and parabola are separate. - k = 3: Line is tangent to the parabola. - k < 3: Line intersects the parabola at two points (except when k = 0, where it intersects at one point)."},{"instruction":"The solution set of the inequality log_{2}(1 frac {1}{x}) > 1 is (　　)   A: {x|x < 0}   B: {x|x < 1}   C: {x|x > 1}   D: {x|1 < x < 0}","output":"From log_{2}(1- frac {1}{x}) > 1, we get log_{2}(1- frac {1}{x}) > log_{2}2,   which implies 1- frac {1}{x} > 2, leading to frac {x+1}{x} < 0.

To find the maximum value of Pi, consider the derivative Pi' = 0: [ Pi' = S left( -sin varphi + sin left( frac{3pi}{4} - varphi right) right) ] Setting this derivative to zero: [ left( -sin varphi + sin left( frac{3pi}{4} - varphi right) right) = 0 ] Solving for varphi: [ -sin varphi + sin left( frac{3pi}{4} - varphi right) = 0 ] [ sin left( frac{3pi}{4} - varphi right) = sin varphi ] The solution occurs when: [ varphi = frac{3pi}{8} ] At this angle, the area Pi reaches its maximum in the given range, confirming: [ Pi = S ] 6. Lastly, for rotation angles 90^circ < varphi < 135^circ, the projection area is given by: [ Pi = S cos left( frac{pi}{2} - varphi right) = S sin varphi < S ] At an angle varphi = frac{3pi}{4}, the projection area: [ Pi = S ] # Conclusion: The greatest projection area of the rotating tetrahedron on a plane containing the common edge of the two faces is: [ boxed{Pi = S = frac{sqrt{3}}{4}} ]"},{"instruction":"Suppose all four of the numbers [3  sqrt{2},; 5 + sqrt{3},; 8  2sqrt{7},; 2sqrt{2}] are roots of the same nonzero polynomial with rational coefficients.

Squaring both sides, we get:    [    (a + b)^2 leq left( sqrt{frac{p-1}{2}} + sqrt{frac{p+1}{2}} right)^2    ] 6.

There are two cases: when the slope exists and when it does not. When the slope exists, let the slope of the line be k. Use the coordinates of P to write the equation of the line. Use the formula for the distance from a point to a line to express the distance d from the center of the circle to the line. Set d equal to the calculated chordal distance to derive an equation in terms of k. Solving this equation will yield the value of k, determining the equation of the line. When the slope does not exist, since the distance from the center of the circle to the line x=-3 is equal to the chordal distance 3, it is clear that the line x=-3 meets the requirements. Thus, the equations of the two lines that meet the requirements are obtained.   This problem tests students' mastery of the perpendicular diameter theorem and the Pythagorean theorem, the flexible application of the formula for the distance from a point to a line to simplify and solve, and examines the mathematical thinking of discussing cases, making it a medium-difficulty problem. Students may overlook the case where the slope does not exist. **Solution** Given the equation of the circle x^2+y^2=25, we find the center of the circle at (0,0) with a radius r=5.   Since the chord length intersected by the circle is 8, according to the perpendicular diameter theorem, the distance from the center of the circle to the line, which is the chordal distance, is sqrt{5^2-4^2}=3.   When the slope of the desired line exists, let the equation of the line be: y+frac{3}{2}=k(x+3), which simplifies to kx-y+3k-frac{3}{2}=0.   Thus, the distance from the center of the circle to the line d=frac{|3k-frac{3}{2}|}{sqrt{1+k^2}}=3.   Simplifying gives: 9k=frac{9}{4}-9, which means k=-frac{3}{4}. Therefore, the equation of the desired line is: 3x+4y+15=0.   When the slope of the desired line does not exist, it is clear that the equation of the line is: x=-3.

For 126 and m to share exactly three positive divisors ( {1, p, p^2} ), where ( p ) is a prime factor, m must also have 3 as a prime factor and be of the form 3^2 times some other factors that do not introduce new squares or higher powers of primes into its prime factorization.

Notice that k!(p-k)! is the product of k and p-k consecutive integers, respectively. Since 1 leq k leq p-1, neither k nor p-k equals p.

Given that we have 6 moles of aluminum and 12 moles of sulfur, we can calculate how much aluminum sulfide each reactant could produce if it were completely consumed. For aluminum: [ 6 text{ moles Al} times frac{1 text{ mole Al2S3}}{2 text{ moles Al}} = 3 text{ moles Al2S3} ] For sulfur: [ 12 text{ moles S} times frac{1 text{ mole Al2S3}}{3 text{ moles S}} = 4 text{ moles Al2S3} ] Since aluminum can only produce 3 moles of Al2S3 and sulfur can produce 4 moles, aluminum is the limiting reactant because it will be completely consumed first. Now, we know that 3.5 moles of Al2S3 are produced, but this is not possible with the given amounts of reactants because aluminum can only produce 3 moles of Al2S3. Therefore, the actual amount of Al2S3 produced is 3 moles. To calculate the mass of aluminum sulfide produced, we need the molar mass of Al2S3. The molar mass of Al2S3 is calculated as follows: [ text{Molar mass of Al2S3} = 2 times text{Molar mass of Al} + 3 times text{Molar mass of S} ] [ text{Molar mass of Al2S3} = 2 times 26.98 text{ g/mol} + 3 times 32.07 text{ g/mol} ] [ text{Molar mass of Al2S3} = 53.96 text{ g/mol} + 96.21 text{ g/mol} ] [ text{Molar mass of Al2S3} = 150.17 text{ g/mol} ] Now, we can calculate the mass of 3 moles of Al2S3: [ text{Mass of Al2S3} = 3 text{ moles} times 150.17 text{ g/mol} ] [ text{Mass of Al2S3} = 450.51 text{ g} ] Therefore, the mass of aluminum sulfide actually produced is boxed{450.51}  grams."},{"instruction":"A boy is travelling from his home to school at 6 km/hr and reached a certain number of minutes late.

From the second turn onward, each player cannot take more than twice the number of matches taken in the previous turn. The player to take the last match wins. In what situation does the first player (Player A) have a winning strategy? We denote the Fibonacci sequence {F_n} by: [  F_0 = 1, quad F_1 = 1, quad F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n-1} quad text{for}  n = 1, 2, ldots   ]  Proof of (1): If n = F_k  (k geq 2), then Player B has a winning strategy. Moreover, the number of matches Player B takes on their last turn is leq F_{k-1}. We will use mathematical induction for the proof. 1. **Base cases:**    - For n = F_2 = 2:       [      text{Player A takes 1 match, and Player B takes 1 match, winning the game.}      ]    - For n = F_3 = 3:       [      text{Player A takes 1 match, and Player B takes 2 matches, winning the game.}      ] 2. **Inductive step:**    Suppose the hypothesis holds for n = F_m and n = F_{m-1} for m geq 3. We need to show it holds for n = F_{m+1}.    If Player A takes r geq F_{m-1} matches on their turn, then the remaining number of matches is:    [    F_{m+1} - r leq F_{m+1} - F_{m-1} = F_m = F_{m-1} + F_{m-2} < 2F_{m-1}    ]    So, Player B can take all remaining matches and win the game.    If Player A takes r < F_{m-1} matches, we note:    [    F_{m+1} = F_m + F_{m-1}    ]    We can assume the initial pile of F_{m+1} matches is split into two piles: one with F_m and the other with F_{m-1}. Player A takes r matches from the smaller pile of F_{m-1}. By our inductive hypothesis, Player B can assure themselves the last match from the F_{m-1} pile, leaving the other pile with F_m. Using the same reasoning and applying the hypothesis repeatedly, Player B wins by ensuring they can always take the last match from each successive pile. This completes the induction step and proves (1).  Proof of (2): If n > 1 is not any term of {F_k}, then Player A has a winning strategy. - When n = 4, it's straightforward to verify that Player A wins by taking 1 stick and following optimal moves. Suppose n geq 6 is not a Fibonacci number. There exists a Fibonacci number F_{k_0} such that: [  F_{k_0} < n < F_{k_0+1}  ] and thus we have: [  n - F_{k_0} < F_{k_0+1} - F_{k_0} = F_{k_0-1}  ] If n - F_{k_0} is a Fibonacci number F_{k_1}: [  n = F_{k_0} + F_{k_1}, quad text{where}  k_0 - k_1 geq 2  ] If n - F_{k_0} is not a Fibonacci number, then there exists a smaller Fibonacci number F_{k_1} such that: [  F_{k_1} < n - F_{k_0} < F_{k_1+1}  ] leading to: [  n - F_{k_0} - F_{k_1} < F_{k_1+1} - F_{k_1} = F_{k1-1}  ] Repeating the same logic, we can express n in the form of: [  n = F_{k_0} + F_{k_1} + F_{k_2} + cdots + F_{k_i}, quad text{where}  k_{i-1} - k_i geq 2, quad i = 0, 1, ldots, t-1 quad text{and}  t geq 1  ] Player A starts by taking F_{k_t} matches: [  2F_{k_t} < F_{k_t} + F_{k_t+1} = F_{k_t+2} leq F_{k_{t-1}}  ] Hence, Player B cannot avoid the strategy where Player A eventually takes the last match in each successive split, securing that Player A wins the game.

(Provide your answer as a number)","output":"To find the coefficient of x^2 in the expansion of (1+x)^3 + (1+x)^4 + ldots + (1+x)^{12}, we use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem tells us that in the expansion of (1+x)^n, the coefficient of x^k is given by {C}_{n}^{k}. Therefore, for each term in our given series, the coefficient of x^2 can be found using {C}_{n}^{2} where n ranges from 3 to 12. Let's calculate this step by step: 1.

First, let's find the prime factorization of each divisor: - 9 = 3^2 - 35 = 5 x 7 - 25 = 5^2 - 21 = 3 x 7 Now, we find the LCM by taking the highest powers of all prime factors present: - The highest power of 3 present is 3^2 (from 9). - The highest power of 5 present is 5^2 (from 25). - The highest power of 7 present is 7 (from 35 and 21). The LCM is therefore 3^2 x 5^2 x 7 = 9 x 25 x 7 = 1575. Now, we subtract 3 from the LCM to find the smallest number that satisfies the condition: 1575 - 3 = 1572.

AI (Intelligence Artificielle) est un terme générique qui désigne toute machine capable d'accomplir des tâches qui, normalement, nécessiteraient l'intelligence humaine. Il existe des AIs spécialisées pour accomplir certaines tâches, comme le traitement de la langue naturelle ou le jeu d'échecs, mais en général, elles ne sont pas capables de comprendre ou de créer de nouvelles tâches par elles-mêmes. 2. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence ou Intelligence Artificielle Générale) est un type d'AI qui possède la capacité de comprendre, apprendre ou créer dans n'importe quel domaine intellectuel à un niveau égal ou supérieur à un humain. Cela signifierait qu'une AGI pourrait, en théorie, créer un jeu vidéo si elle avait accès aux bonnes ressources et connaissances. 3. ASI (Artificial Superintelligence ou Superintelligence Artificielle) désigne un stade hypothétique d'AI qui non seulement reproduit l'intelligence humaine générale, mais la dépasse de loin. Une ASI serait capable de surpasser les meilleurs esprits humains dans toutes les disciplines, y compris la création artistique et technique. Maintenant, en ce qui concerne le temps nécessaire pour créer un jeu: - Une AI actuelle, comme celle utilisée aujourd'hui pour certains processus de développement de jeux vidéo, pourrait aider dans des aspects spécifiques du développement, tels que la génération de graphismes, la composition de la musique ou le test du jeu. Cependant, elle ne pourrait pas créer un jeu. - Une AGI, si elle existait, pourrait potentiellement créer un jeu vidéo de la complexité de \\"Pokémon Version Noire\\" de manière autonome. Le temps nécessaire dépendrait de nombreux facteurs, y compris la complexité du jeu, les ressources disponibles, et l'efficacité de l'AGI elle-même. Cela pourrait prendre de quelques jours à plusieurs mois, car même avec une intelligence égale ou supérieure à celle de l'homme, la création d'un jeu complet et riche nécessite beaucoup de travail, notamment pour la création de scénarios, le design, la programmation, le test et le débogage. - Une ASI pourrait révolutionner le processus de développement de jeux en accomplissant ce travail bien plus rapidement grâce à sa capacité d'apprendre et d'optimiser des tâches de manière exponentielle. L'ASI pourrait théoriquement compléter le développement d'un jeu complexe en un temps incroyablement court, peut-être en quelques heures ou jours, grâce à sa capacité à paralléliser les tâches, à comprendre et à améliorer instantanément les techniques de développement, et à inventer de nouveaux outils pour accélérer encore le processus. Il est important de souligner que les AGI et les ASI ne sont pour l'instant que théoriques et ne sont pas encore une réalité à l'heure actuelle. Les délais mentionnés ci-dessus sont donc purement spéculatifs et basés sur l'hypothèse que ces intelligences surpasseraient significativement les capacités actuelles de l'intelligence humaine dans le domaine de la création de jeux vidéo."},{"instruction":"Write interesting, riveting, lengthy, dialogue-filled, martial arts action packed, gunplay filled, dramatic encounter/revelation scene + fight scence for a crossover fanfic between High School DxD, Majikoi, the World Only God Knows, RWBY, IS: Infinite Stratos, Hokou Kishin Demonbane and Robotics; Notes, in which the protagonist of High School DxD, the brown-haired, amber-eyed, kind and understanding but also reserved, nerdy and self-doubting fake pervert Hyoudou Issei, takes the place of the protagonist of the World Only God Knows, the analytical and genius but also reserved, delusional and cocky gamer known as the \\"God of Games\\" the brown-haired and brown-eyed glasses wearing Katsuragi Keima, the protagonist [Keima] of the World Only God Knows, the highly intelligent, mature and confident but sly, somewhat nihilistic, secretly lecherous and deceptive Naoe Yamato, the protagonist [Yamato] of Majikoi and the lazy, very unmotivated, relaxed, blunt and sarcastic but also very smart, robotics loving, caring and considerate, brown-haired and brown-eyed Yashio Kaito, the protagonist [Kaito] of Robotics; Notes [Issei taking the place of Keima, Yamato and Kaito] with \\"Naoe Yamato\\" being a name [\\"Naoe Yamato\\"] he [Issei] used while [Issei] in his [Issei's] hometown of Kamakura and \\"Keima Katsuragi\\" being a corruption of Yashio Kaito, his [Issei's] true name [Yashio Kaito] that found its way into the records, which he [Issei] uses to get out of sticky situations. Issei in this story has canon Keima's analytical and genius nature along with his [canon Keima's] skill at gaming and mechanics along with his [canon Keima's] arrogance and [canon Keima's] view of the world as a video game to be exploited, canon Yamato's genius brain, academic brilliance and skill at strategy and canon Kaito's lazy, very unmotivated, relaxed, blunt and sarcastic personality aspects as well as his [canon Kaito's] genius and [canon Kaito's] love for robotics, along with his [Issei's] own unique personality and powers in this scene. The events of Majikoi happened before the events of Robotics; Notes, which [the events of Robotics; Notes] occurred when Issei was [Issei] on vacation in Okinawa. The events of the World Only God Knows happened at around the same time of the first two seasons - first few books of High School DxD. Issei also replaces the blonde-haired, blue-eyed Jaune Arc, the male protagonist [Jaune] of RWBY, [Issei] having Jaune's signature sword [Crocea Mors] and [Jaune's] limitless Aura and [Jaune's] Semblance of Aura Amp [the ability |Aura Amp| to amplify his |Jaune's| own Aura and that of others, effectively increasing the effects of Aura], but Issei doesn't become a Huntsman, despite [Issei] having skill in weaponry, martial arts and swordplay [unlike Jaune], [Issei] fearing for his [Issei's] life after the incident at the MF Anemone. The scene begins when Issei, who [Issei] is thinking about finishing off the latest eroge game in his [Issei's] collection while [Issei] being [Issei] dead to the world, as he [Issei] makes his [Issei's] way home from school, [Issei] is [Issei] confronted by a group of White Fang thugs, who [the White Fang thugs] want to kidnap and kill him [Issei] due to his [Issei's] paternal connection to the Arc Family of the Kingdom of Vale from RWBY, which [Vale] is a still-existing and strong British Empire. Of course refusing, Issei shows why he [Issei] was [Issei] one of the strongest youths of Kamakura [Yamato] despite him [Issei] thinking of himself [Kaito] as weak. his [Kaito's] skills in tode [karate], especially the old-fashioned tode with throws, grappling moves and joint locks, swordplay and jujutsu shown themselves and soon, all the thugs are on the ground writing in pain as he [Issei] gets up and [Issei] walks away, only for him [Issei] to [Issei] run right into the tomboyish, tough-going and confident, spend-thrift, battle loving, martial arts prodigy, the black-haired, red-eyed, tall, curvaceous and rather buxom Kawakami Momoyo, who [Momoyo] is [who Momoyo is] one of the main heroines of Majikoi and [Momoyo] is [Momoyo] Issei's distant cousin [Momoyo] in the story this scence takes place, along with [Momoyo] replacing [whom Momoyo replaces] Raven Branwen from RWBY, [Momoyo] having Raven's semblance and Raven's weapons, in and [who else from Kamakura Issei runs into] Momoyo's adoptive little sister, the cheerful, competitive, determined, perseverant but academically disinterested and somewhat ignorant and naive, brown-haired, amber-eyed, short and petite but secretly buxom ookami [wolf] yokai [monster |yokai|] Kawakami Kazuko, who [Kazuko] is [Kazuko] also a major heroine [Kazuko] in Majikoi and [Kazuko] is in fact [Kazuko's true identity in this story] the hot-blooded, quick to act, upbeat and cheerful but also very clingy and naive, brown haired, and brown eyed, short and petite but also somewhat buxom Senomiya Akiho, who [Akiho] is [who Akiho is] one of Robotics; Notes' main heroines [Akiho] and [Akiho/Kazuko] is [Akiho/Kazuko] Kaito's/Issei's half sister [Akiho/Kazuko] in this story, along with [Kazuko] replacing [whom Kazuko replaces in this story] the hyperactive, weapons geek, martial arts prodigy, open and honest but battle eager, naive and somewhat clueless, red-black haired, gray-eyed, short, slender and petite Ruby Rose, the male female protagonist [Ruby] of RWBY, Kazuko having [what Kazuko has] Ruby's mechanical skills, tactical intelligence and [Ruby's] amateur Huntswoman training, along with her [Ruby's] mechashift weapon,the sniper rifle-scythe combination Cresent Rose, the two [Issei/Kaito and Akiho/Kazuko] being [Issei/Kaito and Akiho/Kazuko] seperated [Issei/Kaito and Akiho/Kazuko] after an accident [the MF Anemone Incident] on a cruise ship that left her [Akiho's/Kazuko's] mother dead was [the accident] discovered to be a attempted assasination by rouge elements of both the US and Russian government by the Japanese government, the two [Kaito and Akiho] only reuniting upon her [Akiho's] adoption by Momoyo's family as Kazuko and [Kaito as Yamato] introducing her [Akiho as Kazuko] as his [Kaito's as Yamato's] 'childhood friend' to his [Kaito's as Yamato's] friends, [Momoyo and Kazuko noticing Issei] with Kazuko noticing how much her [Kazuko's] beloved onii-chan [older brother |older brother (onii-chan)|] Kaito, whom [Kaito] she [Kazuko] has no idea is [Kaito] under a different identity [Hyoudou Issei] after the events of Robotics; Notes, [Issei running into Momoyo and Kazuko] who [Momoyo and Kazuko] were [Momoyo and Kazuko] searching for him [Yamato] in Japan's old capital [Kyoto], Kazuko having [what Kazuko did] beaten up quite a few gangs as she [Kazuko] tried to find her [Akiho's] beloved onii-chan [Kaito], [Kazuko] running up to him [Issei] and embracing him [Issei] passionately, her [Kazuko's] rather large bust pressing up against his [Kaito's] arms and body as he [Issei] attempts to run away and her [Kazuko's] wolf ears and tail begining to show, which draws a crowd. When Kazuko is finished hugging Issei, she [Kazuko] lets go and pouts at him [Issei] for not calling home [Kamakura] as he [Kaito] was taken in by agents of the Japanese government and [Kaito] later abruptly moved after the events of Robotics; Notes, to which he [Issei] explains that he [Issei] became a state witness under the witness protection program after the near-apocalypse that they [Akiho and Kaito] prevented. Powerful factions in the European and African criminal underworld aligned with each other had created the conditions for said aritificial world end and were enraged that it didn't happen, paying off the compromised KGB, CIA and Mossad to wipe the siblings [Kaito and Akiho] out which of course failed as Akiho, was simply too strong for them [the assasins] and in her [Kazuko's] naivety, viewed her decimation of said hitmen as simply training to get stronger. Some perceptive Kuoh students also notice that the strange girl [Kazuko] keeps on calling the school pervert [Issei] onii-chan and also note her [Kazuko's] great resemblance to him [Issei], also recognizing the rather infamous female banchou [delinquent leader] of Kawakami [Momoyo] beside her [Kazuko], [Momoyo] acting as a sort of bodyguard to her [Kazuko], along with the hopeful, happy looks in her [Kazuko's] eyes at the sight of him [Issei]. As Issei finishes explaining everything to his [Issei's] beloved little sister [Kazuko], drawing a crowd as he [Issei] does so, he [Issei] notices the drama in the crowd and [Issei] looks around him [Issei] seeing another batch of thugs making their [the thugs'] way towards them [Momoyo, Kazuko and Issei], [Issei] attempting to flee as soon as he [Issei] finishes, [Issei] not wanting his [Issei's] master, the seductive, sly, cunning and brilliant but also kind and considerate, scarlet-haired, blue-eyed, tall and buxom devil princess Rias Gremory, who [Rias] is [what Rias is] also his [Issei's] English teacher, to find out about his [Issei's] true self [Kaito]. But this fails as Kazuko's sensitive nose picks up the thugs' arrival and she [Kazuko] rushes towards them [Kazuko] dodging bullets as her [Kazuko's] skills in Wing Chun, Tai Chi [the real <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> with kickboxing and grappling, not the old people art] Xingyiquan, karate, jujustsu, kendo, yarijutsu, and yokai magic show as the bodies start dropping and she [Kazuko] stats using her [Kazuko's] sniper scythe [Cresent Rose] and her [Kazuko's] Semblance, causing her [Kazuko's] adoptive big sis [Momoyo] to reluctantly join in, marking the begining of a life of hospital bills and chronic debt [for the poor thugs anyways]. As he [Issei] attempts to escape from Momoyo and Kazuko, [Issei] not wanting to answer any questions at the moment, he [Issei] stumbles into [the person whom Issei stumbles upon] the calm, reserved, and soft-spoken pale-skinned, gray-haired, yellow-eyed, tall and slender but also buxom and curvaceous Japanese noble heiress Kuki Ageha, who [Ageha] is [Ageha] a major supporting character [Ageha] in Majikoi and [Ageha] is [Ageha] Momoyo's major rival [Aghea], who [Ageha] is [Aghea] the current head [Aghea] of [the organization Aghea heads] the world-spanning, electronics, manufacturing and financial giant of the Kuki Zaibatsu [Kuki Megacorp |Kuki Zaibatsu|] and [Aghea] replaces [the character Aghea replaces] Winter Schnee from RWBY, [Aghea] having [Winter's] Semblance and [Winter's] abilities in addition to her [Aghea's] own formidable martial arts skills and [the other person whom Issei stumbles into apart from Ageha] her [Aghea's] younger sister, the gray-haired, pink-eyed, short, petite and slender, secretly buxom refined, mature and highly intellectual but also shy, reserved and childish Kuki Monshiro, who [Monshiro] goes by the public alias of [the public identity Monshiro uses in this scence] Yukifune Airi, a petite girl [Airi] with [Airi's chararistics] light skin, long, grey hair tied with a black bow with [Airi's personality] cheerful, playful and innocent but also sad and lonely, who [Airi] plays a major role in the events of Robotics; Notes, [Monshiro] also [what Monshiro also does] replacing [the character Monshiro replaces] Weiss Schnee from RWBY, [Monshiro] having [what Monshiro has] Weiss' Semblance and Weiss' weapon in addition to pieces of Weiss' arrogant and cocky personality. The Kuki's are Kaito's distant paternal relatives in the story the scene comes in, [Kaito] receiving a quite extravagant allowance from the Kuki sisters' [Monshiro's and Aghea's] father, which [the allowance] he [Kaito] mostly saves and invests, [Kaito's financial wisdom] making him [Kaito] quite rich himself although he [Kaito] is [Kaito] clueless about this, along with the crush both sisters [Aghea and Monshiro] have on him [Kaito], which [Aghea's and Monshiro's shared crush on Kaito] results on the older Kuki sister [Aghea] shoving his [Issei's] head into her [Aghea's] quite large breasts as Monshiro clings to him [Issei], causing Momoyo and Kazuko to [Momoyo and Kazuko] get jealous. Aghea eventually releases him [Issei] from her [Aghea's] grasp, causing him [Issei] to blush, although Monshiro soon also [Monshiro] clings to him [Issei] before [Monshiro] also letting him [Issei] go, which allows him [Issei] to [Issei] finally breath. As the Kuki sisters let go of him [Issei], he [Issei] thinks back to the events of Robotics; Notes, where his [Kaito's] beloved little sisters' [Akiho's] supposedly insane plans of creating a fully functional, anime and video game style humanoid mecha [Super GunBuild-1] ended up actually being working out in the end, with the mech [Super GunBuild-1] being useful in the fight against the traitorous, white haired, blue-eyed, tall and slender megalomanical Okinawan mad scientist Kimijima Kō and his [Kō's] elite mafia group masters, the Commitee of 300, which resulted in him [Kaito] learning a strange, hidden truth about the Kukis - the youngest daughter of the family [the Kukis] is imprinited with the magical and technical knowledge accumulated by the clan [the Kukis] throught the long centuries, which was the basis of the infamous Necromonion from Lovecraft's works. The current \\"Necromonion\\" is Monshiro, who [Monshiro] awakened her [Monshiro's] abilities [as the current \\"Necromonion\\"] when [Monshiro] was [Monshiro] almost possesed by [Kō's] AI ghost, which failed and instead Monshiro ended up being able to split her [Monshiro's] conciousness between the real and the virtual world, her [Monshiro's] power transforming Super GunBuild-1 into a fully functional Gundam style mecha that [Super GunBuild-1] was [Super GunBuild-1] able to take on the horde of Commitee of 300 operatives and [Commitee of 300] mafia and rouge intelligence agency contractors descending upon Okinawa's space station to start the apocalypse as he [Kaito] used his [Kaito's] skills in playing Gun-Ballad to pilot it [Super GunBuild-1] while Akiho was [Akiho] pressed up against his [Kaito's] body with Monshiro, who [Monshiro] was [Monshiro] acting as the unit's [Super GunBuild-1's] guilding AI at the time, pouted in jealousy. This moment is interrupted by the arrival of a entire battalion of what later turn out to be Mafia/ the Commitee of 300 thugs, intent on killing the world's savior [Kaito] for stopping the apocalypse. Which turns out to be a bad idea as Aghea has her [Ageha's] twin sabers hidden within a walking stick and [Ageha] is wearing power armor under her [Aghea's] dress and Monshiro has her [Monshiro's] Myrtenaster with both Kuki sisters [Aghea and Monshiro] carrying specially made sidearms, which essentially dooms the thugs before they [the thugs] can [the thugs] fire off a single shot at either girls' [Aghea's or Monshiro's head]. Inside Issei's head, the Red Dragon Emperor inside his [Issei's] Boosted Gear, Ddraig can't stop laughing, [Ddraig] having the most fun he [Ddraig] has [Ddraig] had in centuries as the bodies [of the thugs] fly and the White Fang and the Commitee of 300 are [the White Fang and the Commitee of 300] publicly humilated [the White Fang and the Commitee of 300] in front of the cameras of the smartphones of hundreds of viewers for the world to see via social media. Anti-mafia revolutions in the USA, Russia and Isreal against organized crime erupt when the video of the fight reaches European social media, with the European governments being forced to covertly eliminate the White Fang and the Commitee of 300 presence in Europe. As the Kamakura girls [Momoyo, Kazuko, Aghea and Monshiro] prepare to face off over his [Kaito's] love after the last thug drops, the blonde-haired, green-eyed, anti-social, blatantly perverted and obsessive but focused and determined half-Deutsche [German] Frau [Lady] Kōjirō Adelheild, who [Adelheild] is a rather famous and outspoken tall, slender and buxom noble heiress of good Japanese and Deutsche bloodlines and [Adelheild] has [Adelheild] gathered controversy for her [Adelheild] eccentric, strange personality, and [Adelheild] is [Adelheild] secretly a skilled and rather good programmer and gray hat hacker who [Adelheild] created the rather infamous mecha fighting game Kill-Ballad that Kaito is [Kaito] addicted to [Killballad], [Adelheild] having come from her [Adelheild's] current home in Okinawa to [Adelheild] check up on her [Adelheild's] one true love [Kaito], [Adelheild] decides to join in on the fun, [Adelheild] causing even more surprise from the crowd of Kuoh students and older and younger residents as she [Adelheild] reminds him [Issei] that they [Adelheild and Issei] haven't done it [have baby making sex] yet, as she [Adelheild] effortlessly sends a surviving Mafia thug flying with a single punch before [Adelheild] passionately kissing him [Issei], causing some of the viewers to wonder if they are dreaming. Before anything else can happen, the sound of boots slamming on the pavement alert them to what's happening and Issei sees a few hired guns hired by the Russian Jewish mafia to wipe his [Issei's] gaming persona [Keima] out due to him [Keima] essentially shutting down the Russian mafia's entire operation of illegal cracked games. Without even thinking, Issei quickly rushes in and sends them [the thugs] flying with his [Issei's] formidable martial arts skills as Monshiro effortlessly takes out a rouge CIA sniper about to take him [Issei] out with her [Monshiro's] pistol. Momoyo and Kazuko finish off the rest and the girls of Kawakami [Momoyo, Kazuko, Aghea and Monshiro] start clinging to him [Issei] rather tightly. [Adelheild] seeing the fight about to start between the girls of Kawakami [Momoyo, Kazuko, Aghea and Monshiro] over him [Issei] decides to end the whole debate by suggesting that all of them [Adelheild, Momoyo, Kazuko, Aghea and Monshiro] share him [Issei] as his [Issei's] wives, which [Adelheild's suggestion of a harem] causes gasps of shock and some of disgust, wolf-whistles from some of the more perverted guys and plenty of videolight from the high-priced cellphones of the Kuoh students along with the occasional faint of shock as the girls of Kawakami [Momoyo, Kazuko, Aghea and Monshiro] calm down and [Momoyo, Kazuko, Aghea and Monshiro] along with Adelheild, carry him [Issei] away for a combined date with all five of them [Adelheild, Momoyo, Kazuko, Aghea and Monshiro] and also to find out why he [Kaito] is now in Kyoto, the students of Kuoh being silent as they [Momoyo, Kazuko, Aghea and Monshiro along with Adelheild] carry him [Issei] away, with one student commenting later that this whole things feels like something out of a eroge dating sim visual novel or a perverted harem anime. Meanwhile, the black-haired, red-eyed pale-skinned, tall and slender Orimura Ichika, who [Ichika] never discovered that he [Ichika] could pilot an IS and [Ichika] was raised by his [Ichika's] relatives in rural Jamaica instead of his [Ichika's] older sister Chifuyu, [Ichika] looks at the situation [the girls leaving with Issei] from the scope of a sniper rifle from a hidden location, [Ichika] having [what happens to Ichika] become a militant fascist revolutionary [Ichika] fighting against corrupt corporations, greedy communists and expansive government officials while [Ichika] posing as a rather popular and controversal dancehall artiste named Alkaline, who [Alkaline] is [Alkaline] known for his [Alkaline's] sexually explict, raunchy, gang violence and action supporting, hardcore ghetto supporting music and [Alkaline] is [Alkaline] infamous for wearing a Guy Fawkes Mask during his [Alkaline's] performances, [Alkaline] having a rather strong gang/fanbase called the Vendetta Crew that [the Vendetta Crew] has [the Vendetta Crew] essentially seized control of the Jamaican underworld from local terrrorist and drug cartel factions in Jamaica, [Ichika] laughing to himself [Ichika] and [Ichika] muttering that the time for 'justice' [launching a terror attack on the Kukis during the date with Issei] is right before [Ichika] leaving in order to [Ichika] summon a few of his [Ichika's] Vendetta Crew minions, putting on a Guy Fawkes mask as he [Ichika] does so. Masking their [Alkaline's and the Vendetta Crew's] attack on the Kukis as a hit on a rival Jamaican terrorist, the crew of mayhem [Alkaline and the Vendetta Crew] are almost successful, managing to take out the protection detail due to the huge amount of heavy weaponry they [Alkaline and the Vendetta Crew] managed to slip into the country [Japan], but [Alkaline and the Vendetta Crew] ultimately failing due to Rias and the rest of her [Rias'] peerage arriving at the same place they [Alkaline and the Vendetta Crew] attack and [Rias and the Gremory peerage] decimating the terrorists, Alkaline barely escaping and the Vendetta Crew minions being slaughtered as their guns prove worthless against the peerage's supernatural powers. Issei finds himself [Issei] smothered by the girls from Okinawa and Kawakami, [Issei] unable to get away. Rias, upon seeing this, [Rias] comments that she [Rias] now understands why he [Issei] is [Issei] afraid to go any further in the relationship he [Issei] has with her [Rias'] and the other girls of the Occult Research Club, but she [Rias] is his [Issei's] first wife whom [Rias] he [Issei] must be the first to impregnate during the honeymoon and that he [Issei] must explain everything to her [Rias] in the privacy of the ORC clubhouse.","output":"As the afternoon sun began to cast long shadows across the winding streets of Kyoto, Issei Hyoudou ambled along with the absent-minded gait of someone whose thoughts were elsewhere, deep within a digital world, his fingers itching to conquer his latest gaming obsession. Unfortunately for him, the real world had a way of pulling him back in. \\"Yo, pretty boy! Are you the one they call the Arc scion?\\" An abrasive voice cut through Issei's daydreams like a jagged knife. Startled, Issei looked up to see a group of burly men adorned with White Fang insignias. His heart rate picked up, a cocktail of anticipation and adrenaline swimming through his veins. The gaming strategies and mechanical know-how borrowed from various facets of his life consolidated, as if preparing him for an impending boss fight. \\"N-no, I believe you’re mistaken,\\" Issei stuttered, trying to feign ignorance despite the recognition in his attackers' eyes. A thug with a grim sneer inched closer, cracking his knuckles, \\"We don't make mistakes, kid. Time to say goodnight!\\" Issei wasn't given a chance to protest further before the thugs lunged at him. His nerdy exterior belied his lethal proficiency – a spin, a swift low sweep, and the first assailant collapsed, his breath rushing out. The combat skills of Naoe Yamato echoed in every controlled movement as Issei dispatched thug after thug with an elegance that was almost academic. He stood amid the groaning figures, their bodies testament to the disconnect between his perceived weakness and his true capability. Yet, even as the adrenaline ebbed, the encounter left a bitter taste – he loathed violence, or rather, he loathed that his life necessitated it. A voice interrupted his internal conflict, \\"Ya know, I didn’t expect to find you by following a trail of beaten-up punks. Not your style, Kaito.\\" Issei’s breath hitched as he turned to the new arrivals. There stood Kawakami Momoyo, imposing and sure, and beside her, Kawakami Kazuko, whose disarming smile brightened her features. \\"Kaito...\\" Kazuko bounded forward, her embrace fierce, her brother's identity hanging between them like an unspoken truth. Embarrassment and blossoming warmth clashed within Issei – the familial bond was real, but the name was not. \\"Oh, Kazuko. It's been a while, hasn't it? I've been under... protection, as an important witness,\\" Issei explained hastily, a practical part of his mind noting her yokai traits peeking through as gazes began to converge on them. Students murmured and speculated as Momoyo’s protective stance and Kazuko’s adoring gaze solidified a perception far from the school’s 'pervert'. Issei's explanation was cut short as the wind carried the scent of danger. Kazuko’s eyes flashed with excitement as she plunged toward new threats. Her semblance kicked in at full tilt, paired with an elegant barrage of martial moves reminiscent of the RWBY’s hyperactive protagonist, Ruby Rose. Momoyo joined reluctantly; her every strike, though regretful, had the weight of finality behind it. Their overwhelming might drew a crowd, and Issei, despite wishing it otherwise, was the central spectacle. His escape attempt led him straight into the arms of the Kuki sisters, Ageha, and Monshiro, dressed in quaint aristocracy but hiding formidable strength. Their familial affection paralyzed Issei, their crushes clear and unwavering – much to the discomfiture of Kazuko and Momoyo. Monshiro's rare abilities, a gift from the lineage trump card, the Necronomicon of the Kuki family, settled heavily within her gaze as she released Issei from her grasp to allow him a breath. The past few years ran through Issei's mind – moments where despite his uncertainty, his fake personas had saved not just his life but those of others; Robotics; Notes' mecha battle against world-ending plots; and the secrets of true names, magic, a legacy dating back to Lovecraft. The abrupt arrival of mob forces, out for blood and vengeance against the hero who'd thwarted their maniacal plans, was a reminder that his battle was far from over. Aghea and Monshiro prepared for battle; noble and refined but deadly accurate with their concealed weapons, they displayed a prowess overshadowing RWBY's own skilled Schnee family. Ddraig, the Red Dragon Emperor resting within the Boosted Gear upon Issei's arm, let out a guffaw that resonated within Issei's soul, entertained by the chaos that swirled around them. He hadn't felt this alive in centuries. The ensuing battle, live-streamed to the world, sparked a wave of anti-mafia sentiment across various nations, challenging the status quo. As the dust settled and the myriad of women vying for Issei's attention closed in, Frau Kōjirō Adelheild flounced forward, declaring her intentions with a punch that sent a gangster flying and a kiss that seared through Issei's confusion. Amid the uproar her proposition caused, the unspoken harem agreement among the Kamakura women became a signed treaty, and the ensuing date promised an evening of explanations and shared moments. Unbeknownst to most, this idyllic resolution was under threat by Orimura Ichika – Alkaline – watching from the shadows, preparing a coup d'état that would ignite chaos in service of his violent version of justice. His plan nearly succeeded; the violence and shock of the Vendetta Crew's onslaught a stark contrast to the serenity of the date. But they hadn't counted on Rias Gremory and her peerage, who, with supernatural skill, annihilated the vendetta-fueled interlopers. Issei found himself drowning not in danger, but in the affections of his unconventional family and the hint of competition from the supernatural charm of the ORC girls. The end of the day arrived with revelations still pending and relationships as complicated as ever. But as he looked upon the motley crew surrounding him, Issei couldn't help but think this twisted game board they played on wasn't entirely devoid of affection and camaraderie. Rias's determined words – a decree of firsts, love, understanding, and quite the hint at a honeymoon – seemed to hover over the group. The truth would unravel in due course, yet for Issei, who marched through life as Kaito, Yamato, Keima, and finally himself, each persona bore threads of truth braided into the singular complexity of his existence. And in this unconventional mishmash of characters and tales, Issei knew one thing for certain – Kyoto, the ancient capital, would never witness a more extraordinary convocation of gamers, yokai, nobles, martial artists, and supernatural beings again."},{"instruction":"In a recent court case it was found that during a period of 11 years 887 people were selected for grand jury duty and 39​% of them were from the same ethnicity.

This means we are looking for the under-representation of the ethnicity (less than 78.3%). The correct hypotheses are: H0: p=0.783 (The proportion of grand jury members of this ethnicity is equal to the proportion in the eligible population.) H1: p<0.783 (The proportion of grand jury members of this ethnicity is less than the proportion in the eligible population.) So the correct choice is E. Part 2: The test statistic, given as z = -28.37, suggests an extremely significant difference between the observed proportion and the population proportion. The value of -28.37 is very far into the tail of the normal distribution. Part 3: The P-value is an indicator of the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis. A P-value of 0.0001 is extremely low, much lower than the significance level of 0.01 (1%). Part 4: In this case, because the P-value (0.0001) is less than the significance level (0.01), we reject the null hypothesis. The correct conclusion about the null hypothesis is: Reject the null hypothesis because the P-value is less than or equal to the significance level, α. Thus, the final conclusion is that there is statistically significant evidence to support the claim that the selection process is biased against allowing this ethnicity to sit on the grand jury."},{"instruction":"Une AI prendrai combien de temps pour créer un jeu de Switch Une AGI prendrai combien de temps pour créer un jeu de Switch Une ASI prendrai combien de temps pour créer un jeu de Switch dit une valeur approximative et ex de jeux est Pokémon écarlate et voilet","output":"La création d'un jeu vidéo comme \\"Pokémon Écarlate et Violet\\" pour la Nintendo Switch est un processus complexe impliquant une équipe multidisciplinaire de développeurs, concepteurs, artistes, scénaristes, testeurs, et plus encore. Le temps nécessaire pour développer un tel jeu peut varier, en général, de quelques années à plusieurs années, en fonction de l'envergure et des ressources disponibles. AI (Intelligence Artificielle), AGI (Intelligence Générale Artificielle) et ASI (Intelligence Surhumaine Artificielle) sont des concepts avec des capacités et des implications différentes: 1. AI (Intelligence Artificielle traditionnelle): Actuellement, une IA spécialisée pourrait aider à automatiser certaines tâches du développement, comme l'animation, la génération de certains éléments de jeu (comme les textures, les niveaux, ou la musique), mais elle ne pourrait pas créer un jeu complet sans intervention humaine. 2. AGI (Intelligence Générale Artificielle): Il s'agit d'une IA hypothétique capable de comprendre, d'apprendre et d'appliquer son intelligence à n'importe quel problème intellectuel, de la même manière qu'un être humain. Si une AGI était réalisée, elle pourrait potentiellement créer un jeu comme \\"Pokémon Écarlate et Violet\\" en un temps beaucoup plus court, peut-être en quelques jours ou semaines, car elle serait capable de réaliser toutes les tâches qu'un humain peut faire mais avec une efficacité bien supérieure. 3. ASI (Intelligence Surhumaine Artificielle): C'est un niveau encore plus avancé d'IA qui dépasse de loin les capacités cognitives humaines. Une ASI pourrait théoriquement concevoir et développer un jeu complexe en un temps extrêmement court, peut-être en quelques heures ou moins, en fonction de la complexité du jeu. Elle serait capable de créer des graphismes, de la musique, du gameplay, et des histoires à un niveau de détail et de richesse difficilement concevable pour l'intelligence humaine. Il est important de noter que ces deux dernières catégories (AGI et ASI) demeurent, au moment où cette réponse a été formulée, théoriques et font l'objet de recherches en cours. Nous n'avons pas encore atteint ces niveaux d'intelligence artificielle et ne pouvons donc que spéculer sur leurs capacités réelles et le temps qu'elles prendraient pour réaliser des tâches complexes telles que le développement de jeux vidéo. Il convient également de rappeler qu'au-delà de la simple programmation et conception, le développement de jeux vidéo est aussi une forme d'art qui bénéficie de l'expérience humaine, de la créativité et de la culture. Même avec une AGI ou une ASI, l'aspect créatif et l'intuition humaine pourraient encore avoir une valeur inestimable dans la création d'expériences de jeu captivantes."},{"instruction":"Тест-63 Вариант 1. 1.

The events of Majikoi happened before the events of Robotics; Notes, which [the events of Robotics; Notes] occurred when Issei was [Issei] on vacation in Okinawa. The events of the World Only God Knows happened at around the same time of the first two seasons - first few books of High School DxD.

When Kazuko is finished hugging Issei, she [Kazuko] lets go and pouts at him [Issei] for not calling home [Kamakura] as he [Kaito] was taken in by agents of the Japanese government and [Kaito] later abruptly moved after the events of Robotics; Notes, to which he [Issei] explains that he [Issei] became a state witness under the witness protection program after the near-apocalypse that they [Akiho and Kaito] prevented. Powerful factions in the European and African criminal underworld aligned with each other had created the conditions for said aritificial world end and were enraged that it didn't happen, paying off the compromised KGB, CIA and Mossad to wipe the siblings [Kaito and Akiho] out which of course failed as Akiho, was simply too strong for them [the assasins] and in her [Kazuko's] naivety, viewed her decimation of said hitmen as simply training to get stronger. Some perceptive Kuoh students also notice that the strange girl [Kazuko] keeps on calling the school pervert [Issei] onii-chan and also note her [Kazuko's] great resemblance to him [Issei], also recognizing the rather infamous female banchou [delinquent leader] of Kawakami [Momoyo] beside her [Kazuko], [Momoyo] acting as a sort of bodyguard to her [Kazuko], along with the hopeful, happy looks in her [Kazuko's] eyes at the sight of him [Issei]. As Issei finishes explaining everything to his [Issei's] beloved little sister [Kazuko], drawing a crowd as he [Issei] does so, he [Issei] notices the drama in the crowd and [Issei] looks around him [Issei] seeing another batch of thugs making their [the thugs'] way towards them [Momoyo, Kazuko and Issei], [Issei] attempting to flee as soon as he [Issei] finishes, [Issei] not wanting his [Issei's] master, the seductive, sly, cunning and brilliant but also kind and considerate, scarlet-haired, blue-eyed, tall and buxom devil princess Rias Gremory, who [Rias] is [what Rias is] also his [Issei's] English teacher, to find out about his [Issei's] true self [Kaito]. But this fails as Kazuko's sensitive nose picks up the thugs' arrival and she [Kazuko] rushes towards them [Kazuko] dodging bullets as her [Kazuko's] skills in Wing Chun, Tai Chi [the real <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> with kickboxing and grappling, not the old people art] Xingyiquan, karate, jujustsu, kendo, yarijutsu, and yokai magic show as the bodies start dropping and she [Kazuko] stats using her [Kazuko's] sniper scythe [Cresent Rose] and her [Kazuko's] Semblance, causing her [Kazuko's] adoptive big sis [Momoyo] to reluctantly join in, marking the begining of a life of hospital bills and chronic debt [for the poor thugs anyways]. As he [Issei] attempts to escape from Momoyo and Kazuko, [Issei] not wanting to answer any questions at the moment, he [Issei] stumbles into [the person whom Issei stumbles upon] the calm, reserved, and soft-spoken pale-skinned, gray-haired, yellow-eyed, tall and slender but also buxom and curvaceous Japanese noble heiress Kuki Ageha, who [Ageha] is [Ageha] a major supporting character [Ageha] in Majikoi and [Ageha] is [Ageha] Momoyo's major rival [Aghea], who [Ageha] is [Aghea] the current head [Aghea] of [the organization Aghea heads] the world-spanning, electronics, manufacturing and financial giant of the Kuki Zaibatsu [Kuki Megacorp |Kuki Zaibatsu|] and [Aghea] replaces [the character Aghea replaces] Winter Schnee from RWBY, [Aghea] having [Winter's] Semblance and [Winter's] abilities in addition to her [Aghea's] own formidable martial arts skills and [the other person whom Issei stumbles into apart from Ageha] her [Aghea's] younger sister, the gray-haired, pink-eyed, short, petite and slender, secretly buxom refined, mature and highly intellectual but also shy, reserved and childish Kuki Monshiro, who [Monshiro] goes by the public alias of [the public identity Monshiro uses in this scence] Yukifune Airi, a petite girl [Airi] with [Airi's chararistics] light skin, long, grey hair tied with a black bow with [Airi's personality] cheerful, playful and innocent but also sad and lonely, who [Airi] plays a major role in the events of Robotics; Notes, [Monshiro] also [what Monshiro also does] replacing [the character Monshiro replaces] Weiss Schnee from RWBY, [Monshiro] having [what Monshiro has] Weiss' Semblance and Weiss' weapon in addition to pieces of Weiss' arrogant and cocky personality. The Kuki's are Kaito's distant paternal relatives in the story the scene comes in, [Kaito] receiving a quite extravagant allowance from the Kuki sisters' [Monshiro's and Aghea's] father, which [the allowance] he [Kaito] mostly saves and invests, [Kaito's financial wisdom] making him [Kaito] quite rich himself although he [Kaito] is [Kaito] clueless about this, along with the crush both sisters [Aghea and Monshiro] have on him [Kaito], which [Aghea's and Monshiro's shared crush on Kaito] results on the older Kuki sister [Aghea] shoving his [Issei's] head into her [Aghea's] quite large breasts as Monshiro clings to him [Issei], causing Momoyo and Kazuko to [Momoyo and Kazuko] get jealous. Aghea eventually releases him [Issei] from her [Aghea's] grasp, causing him [Issei] to blush, although Monshiro soon also [Monshiro] clings to him [Issei] before [Monshiro] also letting him [Issei] go, which allows him [Issei] to [Issei] finally breath. As the Kuki sisters let go of him [Issei], he [Issei] thinks back to the events of Robotics; Notes, where his [Kaito's] beloved little sisters' [Akiho's] supposedly insane plans of creating a fully functional, anime and video game style humanoid mecha [Super GunBuild-1] ended up actually being working out in the end, with the mech [Super GunBuild-1] being useful in the fight against the traitorous, white haired, blue-eyed, tall and slender megalomanical Okinawan mad scientist Kimijima Kō and his [Kō's] elite mafia group masters, the Commitee of 300, which resulted in him [Kaito] learning a strange, hidden truth about the Kukis - the youngest daughter of the family [the Kukis] is imprinited with the magical and technical knowledge accumulated by the clan [the Kukis] throught the long centuries, which was the basis of the infamous Necromonion from Lovecraft's works. The current \\"Necromonion\\" is Monshiro, who [Monshiro] awakened her [Monshiro's] abilities [as the current \\"Necromonion\\"] when [Monshiro] was [Monshiro] almost possesed by [Kō's] AI ghost, which failed and instead Monshiro ended up being able to split her [Monshiro's] conciousness between the real and the virtual world, her [Monshiro's] power transforming Super GunBuild-1 into a fully functional Gundam style mecha that [Super GunBuild-1] was [Super GunBuild-1] able to take on the horde of Commitee of 300 operatives and [Commitee of 300] mafia and rouge intelligence agency contractors descending upon Okinawa's space station to start the apocalypse as he [Kaito] used his [Kaito's] skills in playing Gun-Ballad to pilot it [Super GunBuild-1] while Akiho was [Akiho] pressed up against his [Kaito's] body with Monshiro, who [Monshiro] was [Monshiro] acting as the unit's [Super GunBuild-1's] guilding AI at the time, pouted in jealousy. This moment is interrupted by the arrival of a entire battalion of what later turn out to be Mafia/ the Commitee of 300 thugs, intent on killing the world's savior [Kaito] for stopping the apocalypse. Which turns out to be a bad idea as Aghea has her [Ageha's] twin sabers hidden within a walking stick and [Ageha] is wearing power armor under her [Aghea's] dress and Monshiro has her [Monshiro's] Myrtenaster with both Kuki sisters [Aghea and Monshiro] carrying specially made sidearms, which essentially dooms the thugs before they [the thugs] can [the thugs] fire off a single shot at either girls' [Aghea's or Monshiro's head]. Inside Issei's head, the Red Dragon Emperor inside his [Issei's] Boosted Gear, Ddraig can't stop laughing, [Ddraig] having the most fun he [Ddraig] has [Ddraig] had in centuries as the bodies [of the thugs] fly and the White Fang and the Commitee of 300 are [the White Fang and the Commitee of 300] publicly humilated [the White Fang and the Commitee of 300] in front of the cameras of the smartphones of hundreds of viewers for the world to see via social media. Anti-mafia revolutions in the USA, Russia and Isreal against organized crime erupt when the video of the fight reaches European social media, with the European governments being forced to covertly eliminate the White Fang and the Commitee of 300 presence in Europe. As the Kamakura girls [Momoyo, Kazuko, Aghea and Monshiro] prepare to face off over his [Kaito's] love after the last thug drops, the blonde-haired, green-eyed, anti-social, blatantly perverted and obsessive but focused and determined half-Deutsche [German] Frau [Lady] Kōjirō Adelheild, who [Adelheild] is a rather famous and outspoken tall, slender and buxom noble heiress of good Japanese and Deutsche bloodlines and [Adelheild] has [Adelheild] gathered controversy for her [Adelheild] eccentric, strange personality, and [Adelheild] is [Adelheild] secretly a skilled and rather good programmer and gray hat hacker who [Adelheild] created the rather infamous mecha fighting game Kill-Ballad that Kaito is [Kaito] addicted to [Killballad], [Adelheild] having come from her [Adelheild's] current home in Okinawa to [Adelheild] check up on her [Adelheild's] one true love [Kaito], [Adelheild] decides to join in on the fun, [Adelheild] causing even more surprise from the crowd of Kuoh students and older and younger residents as she [Adelheild] reminds him [Issei] that they [Adelheild and Issei] haven't done it [have baby making sex] yet, as she [Adelheild] effortlessly sends a surviving Mafia thug flying with a single punch before [Adelheild] passionately kissing him [Issei], causing some of the viewers to wonder if they are dreaming. Before anything else can happen, the sound of boots slamming on the pavement alert them to what's happening and Issei sees a few hired guns hired by the Russian Jewish mafia to wipe his [Issei's] gaming persona [Keima] out due to him [Keima] essentially shutting down the Russian mafia's entire operation of illegal cracked games. Without even thinking, Issei quickly rushes in and sends them [the thugs] flying with his [Issei's] formidable martial arts skills as Monshiro effortlessly takes out a rouge CIA sniper about to take him [Issei] out with her [Monshiro's] pistol. Momoyo and Kazuko finish off the rest and the girls of Kawakami [Momoyo, Kazuko, Aghea and Monshiro] start clinging to him [Issei] rather tightly. [Adelheild] seeing the fight about to start between the girls of Kawakami [Momoyo, Kazuko, Aghea and Monshiro] over him [Issei] decides to end the whole debate by suggesting that all of them [Adelheild, Momoyo, Kazuko, Aghea and Monshiro] share him [Issei] as his [Issei's] wives, which [Adelheild's suggestion of a harem] causes gasps of shock and some of disgust, wolf-whistles from some of the more perverted guys and plenty of videolight from the high-priced cellphones of the Kuoh students along with the occasional faint of shock as the girls of Kawakami [Momoyo, Kazuko, Aghea and Monshiro] calm down and [Momoyo, Kazuko, Aghea and Monshiro] along with Adelheild, carry him [Issei] away for a combined date with all five of them [Adelheild, Momoyo, Kazuko, Aghea and Monshiro] and also to find out why he [Kaito] is now in Kyoto, the students of Kuoh being silent as they [Momoyo, Kazuko, Aghea and Monshiro along with Adelheild] carry him [Issei] away, with one student commenting later that this whole things feels like something out of a eroge dating sim visual novel or a perverted harem anime. Meanwhile, the black-haired, red-eyed pale-skinned, tall and slender Orimura Ichika, who [Ichika] never discovered that he [Ichika] could pilot an IS and [Ichika] was raised by his [Ichika's] relatives in rural Jamaica instead of his [Ichika's] older sister Chifuyu, [Ichika] looks at the situation [the girls leaving with Issei] from the scope of a sniper rifle from a hidden location, [Ichika] having [what happens to Ichika] become a militant fascist revolutionary [Ichika] fighting against corrupt corporations, greedy communists and expansive government officials while [Ichika] posing as a rather popular and controversal dancehall artiste named Alkaline, who [Alkaline] is [Alkaline] known for his [Alkaline's] sexually explict, raunchy, gang violence and action supporting, hardcore ghetto supporting music and [Alkaline] is [Alkaline] infamous for wearing a Guy Fawkes Mask during his [Alkaline's] performances, [Alkaline] having a rather strong gang/fanbase called the Vendetta Crew that [the Vendetta Crew] has [the Vendetta Crew] essentially seized control of the Jamaican underworld from local terrrorist and drug cartel factions in Jamaica, [Ichika] laughing to himself [Ichika] and [Ichika] muttering that the time for 'justice' [launching a terror attack on the Kukis during the date with Issei] is right before [Ichika] leaving in order to [Ichika] summon a few of his [Ichika's] Vendetta Crew minions, putting on a Guy Fawkes mask as he [Ichika] does so. Masking their [Alkaline's and the Vendetta Crew's] attack on the Kukis as a hit on a rival Jamaican terrorist, the crew of mayhem [Alkaline and the Vendetta Crew] are almost successful, managing to take out the protection detail due to the huge amount of heavy weaponry they [Alkaline and the Vendetta Crew] managed to slip into the country [Japan], but [Alkaline and the Vendetta Crew] ultimately failing due to Rias and the rest of her [Rias'] peerage arriving at the same place they [Alkaline and the Vendetta Crew] attack and [Rias and the Gremory peerage] decimating the terrorists, Alkaline barely escaping and the Vendetta Crew minions being slaughtered as their guns prove worthless against the peerage's supernatural powers. Issei finds himself [Issei] smothered by the girls from Okinawa and Kawakami, [Issei] unable to get away. Rias, upon seeing this, [Rias] comments that she [Rias] now understands why he [Issei] is [Issei] afraid to go any further in the relationship he [Issei] has with her [Rias'] and the other girls of the Occult Research Club, but she [Rias] is his [Issei's] first wife whom [Rias] he [Issei] must be the first to impregnate during the honeymoon and that he [Issei] must explain everything to her [Rias] in the privacy of the ORC clubhouse.","output":"The intricate web of worlds converged into one seamless reality, where Issei's mind was a storm of thoughts, ranging from game strategies to the dire reality unfolding around him. The uncertainty of whether he'd even live to see another eroge ending was abruptly disrupted by the arrival of White Fang thugs, their malice was tangible in the thick Kyoto air. \\"You've got the wrong guy,\\" Issei smirked, adjusting his glasses with a nonchalance that belied his intentions. \\"But if it's a fight you want, it's a fight you'll get.\\" With fluid, practiced motions, he dispatched his attackers, an elegant symphony of martial arts prowess. Each thug crumpled to the ground, their groans a chorus to Issei's silent victory. No sooner had the last one fallen did the distant shouts of an all-too-familiar voice catch his ear—Kawakami Momoyo. \\"Issei-kun! There you are!\\" her voice boomed through the alleyways, and Issei turned to see the towering figure of strength joined by the bubbly Kazuko, her wolf ears betraying her excitement. \\"Kazuko, I—\\" Issei began, but her arms were already around him, her embrace as fierce as her spirit. \\"You never call, Onii-chan!\\" Kazuko chided, her pout as devastating as her martial skills. But their reunion was cut short as new enemies encroached upon them, drawn to Issei's notorious lineage like moths to a flame. Wasting no time, Kazuko lunged into the fray, her weapons and semblance—a snarling whirlwind, cutting bullets from the air. Momoyo, always the protector, joined the dance of combat, her semblance casting shadows that disoriented their foes. Issei tried to slip away, his feet carrying him towards the freedom of anonymity. But fate, it seemed, had other plans. Colliding with the noble Kuki sisters, Ageha's demanding grip yanked him from his flight, while Monshiro's shy embrace coiled around him tenderly. \\"Don't even think about running, Kaito,\\" Ageha's voice was steel velvet, as even the most formidable mafia agents felt her presence chill their spines. Memories of Okinawa, of Gundam-sized heroics and semi-mythical knowledges roared back to life in Issei's mind. The virtual and real intermingled in Monshiro's defiant gaze as Super GunBuild-1's revival marked the dawn of a new reality. Even as Issei's mind wove through past and present, an onslaught of Mafia and Commitee of 300 thugs descended upon them. Yet the Kuki sisters were a fortress of blades and spells, their graces lethally deceptive. Laughter, deep and resonant, echoed within Issei's Boosted Gear. Ddraig, the dragon, was reveling in the chaos—as the world witnessed the humbling of terror. The dust settled, leaving a silence ripe with the promise of love's rivalries. But the arrival of fiercely independent Frau Kōjirō upended the scene, her brazen claim on Issei's heart a catalyst for an audacious proposal—one that sculpted a harem destiny beneath the relentless smartphone flashes. As the girls spirited him away, a solitary figure lurked in the shadows, the dancehall artiste Alkaline, plotting a vendetta cloaked in \\"justice.\\" His move against the Kukis was decisive—until the Gremory peerage's arrival shattered his meticulous plans. Engulfed in a sea of affection, Issei fought for breath—the sights and sounds of battle, familial bonds, and unintended paramours wove a reality stranger than fiction. Rias Gremory's knowing glance promised a future reshaped - a harem king bound in intrigue and devotion, where every cherished bond was a thread in a grander tapestry, weaving together a narrative no

房颤，即心房纤颤，是一种心房电活动异常快速且无规律的心律失常形式。在失血性休克中，心电图可能出现房颤倾向的原因包括： 1. 交感神经兴奋：失血会引起身体交感神经系统的兴奋，这可能导致心脏的电生理特性发生变化。心房是心律失常发生的常见部位，交感兴奋可能导致心房电活动异常增加，引起房颤。 2. 氧气供应不足：失血带来的低血容量可减少血液向器官，包括心脏的供应。这可能导致心肌缺氧，进而诱发房颤。 3. 电解质紊乱：大量失血及其后续液体治疗可能导致体内电解质的紊乱，特别是钾和钙离子的水平。电解质水平的改变会影响心脏细胞的去极化和复极化过程，增加房颤的风险。 4. 内分泌和代谢变化：应激状态下身体会产生各种激素，如肾上腺素和皮质醇，它们可以影响心脏的电生理性质并增加心律失常的风险。 5. 炎症反应：失血和休克可能会引发全身性炎症反应，这也可能会影响心脏电生理并增加房颤的发生几率。 值得注意的是，房颤并不是失血性休克的特异性心电图表现，而是在患者出现重度应激、心脏异常负担或其他影响心脏电活动的因素叠加作用下，房颤可能作为一种并发症出现。 由于失血性休克是一个紧急且严重的医疗状况，需要迅速地予以识别和处理。治疗的主要目标是停止失血，并通过输血和液体复苏来恢复循环血量，同时密切监测心脏功能和纠正任何可能的心律失常。"},{"instruction":"失血性休克后动脉血PH值下降的原因","output":"失血性休克时，动脉血pH值下降通常是由于代谢性酸中毒所致，尤其是乳酸酸中毒。这是因为失血性休克会导致组织灌注不足，细胞缺氧，从而影响细胞内部的正常代谢活动。下面是详细原因： 1. 组织缺氧：失血导致循环血量减少，进而引起机体组织灌注不足。当组织无法获得足够的氧气时，氧气依赖的有氧代谢受限，导致无氧代谢活动增强（即糖酵解过程）。 2. 增加的乳酸生成：由于缺氧，细胞会更多地依赖无氧代谢（糖酵解）来产生能量，而糖酵解的最终产物是乳酸。随着乳酸的积累，血液中的酸性物质增加，pH值降低，导致酸中毒。 3. 功能性肾衰竭：在失血性休克的情况下，肾脏的血液供应减少可能会损害其排除体内代谢废物（包括酸性代谢产物）的能力，进一步导致体内酸性物质的积累。 4. 代谢过程改变：随着休克的发展，患者可能还会出现其他形式的代谢酸中毒。例如，休克状态可能会导致细胞膜的通透性改变，进而导致胞内外离子的平衡紊乱。 总的来说，失血性休克导致的代谢性酸中毒主要是由乳酸积累引起的，且失血性休克患者的酸中毒可能非常严重，甚至是危及生命的，需要及时的医疗干预来恢复血容量，提高组织灌注，及时矫正酸碱失衡等。"},{"instruction":"失血性休克导致低钾加重的原因","output":"失血性休克本身并不直接导致低钾血症（低血钾）。相反，钾是细胞内主要的阳离子，当体内发生大量失血时，一开始可能不会直接影响血液中的钾水平。 低钾血症通常与以下几个与失血性休克相关的因素有关： 1. 液体替代治疗：治疗失血性休克时，常常需要大量输注无钾液体（如晶体液或胶体液），以迅速恢复血容量。这些液体中缺乏钾离子，可能稀释血液中原有的钾含量，导致低钾血症。 2. 代谢性碱中毒：大量输液还可能导致碱中毒，特别是当使用含碳酸氢钠（俗称小苏打）的液体时。代谢性碱中毒会导致氢离子（H+）从体液转移到细胞内，而钾离子（K+）从细胞内向外移动来保持电荷平衡，从而引起血液中钾浓度下降。 3. 肾脏功能障碍：休克可引起肾血流量减少，导致急性肾脏功能障碍。在正常情况下，肾脏会调节体内钾的平衡，但当肾功能受损时，钾的排泄和再吸收可能会受到影响，如果伴有过量排尿或肾上腺皮质激素异常分泌，可能导致体外钾的丢失。 4. 治疗过程中使用的药物：有时为了治疗休克或休克引起的并发症，可能会使用某些药物，如利尿剂或激素。这些药物可以增加尿中钾的排泄，从而导致低钾血症。 低钾血症是一种严重的电解质平衡紊乱，可能对心脏和神经肌肉功能产生不利影响，需及时识别和纠正。在处理失血性休克时，除了立即止血和液体复苏外，还应持续监测电解质，特别是钾的水平，并在需要时进行适当的补充。"},{"instruction":"血容量减少会导致血钾浓度降低吗","output":"血容量减少本身并不直接导致血钾浓度降低（低钾血症）。相反，血容量的减少往往会引起身体各种补偿机制的启动，其中包括钠和水的保留，钾的排泄可能也会受到影响。 然而，在治疗失血性休克时可能会发生低钾血症，原因通常与以下几个方面有关： 1. 稀释效应：为了恢复失血时的血容量减少，通常需要大量快速输注含钠的血液替代液体（无论是晶体液还是胶体液）。如果这些输血液体中不含钾或含钾很少，可能会导致血液中的钾离子相对其他离子而言变得更稀释，从而产生低钾血症。 2. 利尿反应：体内为了维持血液中钠和水的平衡，可能会因为大量液体输入而产生利尿效应，而一些利尿类药物也会促进肾脏排泄钾。 3. 肾上腺皮质激素分泌增加：失血休克时，身体会分泌更多的肾上腺皮质激素来应对压力，这些激素（特别是醛固酮）会促进肾脏重吸收钠并排泄钾，从而导致血钾浓度下降。 4. 细胞内外钾离子的转移：当身体中的pH平衡发生改变时（例如在输液时出现代谢性碱中毒的情况下），钾离子可能会从血浆中转移进细胞内，以维持血液中的电荷平衡，导致血浆中钾浓度下降。 因此，虽然血容量减少本身不直接导致血钾浓度降低，但是相关的生理反应、治疗措施和可能发生的电解质失衡都可能影响到血钾浓度。在管理失血性休克的过程中，应密切监测患者的电解质水平，并在必要时进行及时调整和补充。"},{"instruction":"救治失血性休克衰竭期的先后顺序","output":"救治失血性休克（尤其是在衰竭期）是一个紧急的医疗情况，需要迅速采取一系列的步骤来稳定患者状况。以下是常规的处理流程和先后顺序： 1. 确保通气：首先要确保患者的气道通畅，并根据需要给予氧气治疗。如果患者意识模糊或不能维持自主呼吸，可能需要气管插管和机械通气。 2. 快速评估：评估患者的意识水平、生命体征（心率、血压、呼吸频率、体温）、皮肤状况（颜色、湿度、温度）、外周循环等。 3. 立即止血：对于外在失血，需要迅速找到出血源并实施止血措施，包括使用加压绷带、止血夹、止血带、外部伤口的直接压迫或手术干预。 4. 建立静脉通路：尽快建立至少两条静脉通路，最好是大径静脉导管，以便迅速输液和给药。 5. 快速血容量复苏：用晶体液（如正常生理盐水或乳酸林格液）或胶体液迅速静脉输液。在严重失血的情况下，可能需要输血（使用红细胞、血浆和/或血小板）。 6. 持续监测和评估：监测患者的心电图（ECG）、血压、心率、氧饱和度和尿量，以评估输液治疗的效果和生命体征的稳定性。 7. 支持治疗：如有需要，使用血管活性药物（如多巴胺、去甲肾上腺素）以提高血压和改善组织灌注，但应先确保已充分补充血容量。 8. 纠正并发症：密切监测和纠正电解质失衡、凝血功能障碍、酸碱平衡等问题。 9. 进行辅助检查：进行必要的辅助检查（如血常规、血型和交叉配血、凝血功能、电解质、血气分析等），以评估患者的总体情况和指导后续治疗。 10. 专科抢救及术后护理：如果有必要，需要外科、麻醉科和重症医学科等专业团队介入，和/或进行必要的外科手术治疗。 11. 防治休克后并发症：休克复苏以后，需要监测潜在的并发症，如急性肾损伤、多器官功能不全综合征（MODS）等。 需要注意的是，上面的步骤和顺序可能因临床环境、患者状况和资源的可用性而略有不同。在救治失血性休克时，各项措施通常是同时并行快速进行的，而不是依次单独执行。而且这些步骤频繁地需要评估和调整，以确保最佳治疗效果。"},{"instruction":"失血性休克救治中，扩血管药物怎样改善微循环","output":"在救治失血性休克过程中，通常首选的治疗措施是补充血容量以维持足够的灌注压力和改善微循环。然而，在某些情况下，医生可能会考虑使用扩血管药物来辅助改善微血管循环。 扩血管药物主要通过以下机制来改善微循环： 1. **减少血管阻力**：扩血管药物可以直接作用于血管平滑肌，导致它们放松，从而减少血管的外周阻力，增加血流量，并使血液能够更容易到达细小的血管床。 2. **再分配血流**：在休克状态下，体内较大的血管为了维持核心器官（如心脏和大脑）的血流，可能会对血液进行重新分配，以牺牲皮肤、肠道和肾脏等器官的血液供应。扩血管药物可能有助于重分配血流，使血液能够更均匀地流向这些周边组织。 3. **减少微血管渗透性**：扩血管药物还可以减少微血管的渗透性，有助于减少组织水肿和维持更好的微血管功能。 4. **抗炎作用**：某些扩血管药物具有抗炎效果，可以减少休克状态下局部和系统性炎症反应，改善微血管环境。 重要的是要明确，扩血管药物在失血性休克的应用是基于综合评估和患者具体状况的，因为扩血管可能会进一步降低血压，对于血容量未得到充分复苏的患者可能并不合适。因而，在使用扩血管药物之前，医生会先行评估是否有足够的血容量复苏，确保血压不会因血管扩张而危及患者生命。 总的来说，扩血管药物在失血性休克的治疗中使用并不是一线治疗，通常是在补充了足够血容量并且需要改善微血管循环时作为辅助治疗用药。使用时需谨慎，并在严格监控下进行。"},{"instruction":"正常血压的波动如何产生的？心脏搏动与血压的关系如何从描记曲线上分析","output":"正常血压的波动与心脏的搏动活动密切相关，涉及到心脏的收缩（心室收缩期或者称为收缩期）与舒张（心室舒张期或者称为舒张期）过程。 血压通常用两个数字表示，例如120/80 mmHg。这两个数字分别代表收缩压和舒张压： 1. **收缩压（Systolic Blood Pressure）**：当心脏收缩时，血液被挤压进入体循环，在此过程中血管中的压力升高，造成的最高压力点即为收缩压。在心电图（ECG）上的R波后不久在动脉压力曲线上可以看到一个压力峰值，这就反映了收缩压。 2. **舒张压（Diastolic Blood Pressure）**：当心脏舒张，心室腔内血液减少，血液压力下降，血管中的压力随之降至最低点，这个最低点即为舒张压。在动脉压力曲线上，这通常出现在心搏动周期的后半段。 在描记曲线（如动脉压力波形图）上，血压的波动反映了每次心脏搏动时血压的变化，呈现为一系列的峰谷曲线。以下是几个重要的点： - 收缩峰（Systolic Peak）：描记曲线上的最高点，代表了收缩压。 - 舒张谷（Diastolic Valley）：描记曲线上的最低点，代表了舒张压。 - 峰谷差（Pulse Pressure）：收缩峰和舒张谷的差值，反映了每次心脏搏动导致的压力波动。 - 冲击波（Dicrotic Notch）：在描记曲线上，收缩峰下降的一部分会出现一个小小的波谷，然后是一个小峰，通常表示了主动脉瓣关闭时产生的波动。 这些波动的分析可以帮助医生评估心脏和血管的功能状况。例如，脉压（收缩压与舒张压之差）过大可能表明动脉硬化或者心脏瓣膜疾病；而脉压过小则可能指向心脏输出量减少或是外周血管过度扩张等情况。 总的来说，心脏的搏动直接影响血压的产生，而正常血压的波动正是心脏收缩和舒张所造成的动脉内压力的周期性变化。通过详细分析动脉压力曲线上的特征，可以获得心脏和血管功能的重要信息。"},{"instruction":"4.失血性休克的抢救措施及原则是什么？","output":"失血性休克是由大量失血造成的急性循环失衡和组织灌注不足，此时，急救的首要任务是迅速补充血容量和控制出血。下面是失血性休克抢救措施和原则的总结：

Cependant, leur pratique de la magie leur attire méfiance et intrigue de la part des autres clans. 5. **Clan Nosferatu**: Le Gardien Wilhelm von Graff ainsi que le Primogène Lysander possèdent la connaissance des secrets de la ville et contrôlent les sous-terrains. Le clan est indispensable pour les informations qu'ils collectent, mais leur apparence et leur méthodes souvent peu orthodoxes suscitent la défiance. 6. **Clan Malkavian**: Le Primogène Gideon Krieger apporte une perspective unique, souvent incompréhensible aux autres clans. Les Malkavian sont essentiels pour leur intuition, mais leurs actions imprévisibles peuvent causer des tensions et des troubles. 7. **Clan Lasombra**: Isabella Marquez et son clan, nouvellement admis dans la Camarilla, cherchent à établir leur réputation. Leur influence croissante inquiète les clans établis, car ils sont connus pour leur ambition et leur habileté à manipuler les ombres. **Intrigues en cours:** - **Intrigue de pouvoir**: Il y a une lutte souterraine pour le pouvoir entre les Ventrue et les Banu Haqim qui s'efforcent d'étendre leurs domaines économiques et sociaux, chacun offrant différents avantages à la Comtesse pour gagner en faveur et influence. - **Intrigue mystique**: Les Tremere sont impliqués dans une série d'incidents mystérieux au sein du domaine universitaire, attirant l'attention indésirable d'acteurs surnaturels et entraînant une surveillance accrue de la part du clan Nosferatu. - **Intrigue de la Masquerade**: Des brèches récentes dans la Masquerade ont mis en émoi les clans, chacun blâmant l'autre pour ces failles potentiellement cataclysmiques. Le Gardien des égouts et le clan Toreador sont à couteaux tirés, se disputant la responsabilité de ces incidents. - **Intrigue de fidélités et trahisons**: L'arrivée des Lasombra dans la Camarilla a semé le doute parmi les membres plus conservateurs de la cour. Certains craignent un coup d'état de ce clan ambitieux qui pourrait vouloir renverser l'ordre établi. - **Intrigue Sang Clair**: Nathalie Leclair, bien qu'affiliée au clan Toreador, travaille à favoriser une coopération entre les vampires et les humains. Cette initiative radicale crée des tensions, certains la voyant comme une menace à la Masquerade, tandis que d'autres y voient une évolution nécessaire de leur société. Dans cette atmosphère de vigilance et de conspirations, tous les dirigeants et membres de la cour doivent naviguer avec prudence, sachant que chaque action peut déclencher une réaction en chaîne aux conséquences imprévisibles."},{"instruction":"Isabella n’est pas officiellement primogènes et ne siège donc pas au conseil. Sont statu officiel est celui de « représentante du clan Lasombra ».","output":"D'accord, prenons en compte cette mise à jour : Isabella Marquez occupe donc le rôle de « représentante du clan Lasombra » au sein de la cour de Toulouse. Elle n'est pas un Primogène officiel et ne siège pas formellement au conseil des Primogènes. Sa présence symbolise l'effort récent d'intégration des Lasombra au sein de la Camarilla, suite à la fissure dans le Sabbat et le mouvement de certains Lasombra vers la Camarilla pendant la soi-disant Guerre Civile Lasombra. Isabella tente de se frayer un chemin dans la structure de pouvoir dominée par des clans de longue date comme les Toreador, les Ventrue et les Tremere. Sa tâche consiste à gagner la confiance de la cour et à montrer que les Lasombra peuvent être des alliés précieux, malgré leur réputation antérieure de manipulateurs et de traîtres au sein du Sabbat. Elle doit exercer sa diplomatie et son influence tout en restant en dehors des mécanismes de prise de décision réservés aux Primogènes, ce qui nécessite une habileté politique considérable et, souvent, des manoeuvres en coulisses. Ce positionnement atypique d'Isabella Marquez ajoute une complexité supplémentaire aux dynamiques politiques de Toulouse et peut alimenter des intrigues portant sur l'acceptation et l'intégration des Lasombra au sein de la Camarilla, leur lutte pour la reconnaissance et le pouvoir, ainsi que les tensions inhérentes à leur transition des ténèbres du Sabbat à la lumière de la Camarilla."},{"instruction":"Quel est la place et le poids politique réel de Nathalie Leclair à la cours.","output":"Nathalie Leclair occupe une position unique au sein de la cour Camariste de Toulouse en tant que représentante du Sang Clair, affiliée au clan Toreador. Bien que son titre officiel ne soit pas aussi éminemment reconnu que celui de Primogène ou de membre de la hiérarchie traditionnelle, son poids politique réel ne doit pas être sous-estimé pour autant. En tant que Sang Clair, Nathalie Leclair est susceptible de jouir d'une certaine fascination ou curiosité de la part des autres vampires. Les Sang Clair sont souvent vus comme un pont entre les Kindred (vampires) et les Kine (humains) en raison de leur position hybride ou de leur attitude plus souple envers les humains. Voici quelques aspects qui pourraient influencer le poids politique réel de Nathalie Leclair : 1. **Conseillère Informelle**: Elle pourrait servir de conseillère informelle sur les questions concernant les relations avec les humains, la Masquerade et l'utilisation des réseaux humains pour les avantages des vampires. 2. **Médiatrice**: Nathalie Leclair pourrait également jouer un rôle de médiatrice lors de conflits impliquant les intérêts humains, exploitant son statut pour naviguer entre les mondes. 3. **Innovatrice**: Sa vision unique pourrait l'amener à proposer des stratégies et des politiques innovantes pour la survie à long terme de la cour, notamment dans le contexte de la modernité et de la technologie croissantes. 4. **Influence Culturelle et Sociale**: Son domaine dans le quartier Compans-Caffarelli, avec ses parcs, résidences et centre commercial, lui donne une influence certaine sur les aspects culturels et sociaux qui sont chers aux Toreadors et importants pour l'image de la cour. 5. **Alliances**: En fonction de ses alliances et du soutien qu'elle peut recevoir de vampires influents ou même de la Comtesse elle-même, sa position pourrait être renforcée considérablement. Ses liens avec le clan Toreador pourraient être particulièrement utiles à cet égard. 6. **Voix de la Progression**: Nathalie peut devenir une voix puissante pour la progression et l'adaptation au sein de la communauté vampire, surtout si elle gagne des partisans parmi ceux qui croient que les Kindred doivent innover pour survivre. 7. **Synergie avec les Intérêts Humains**: Si elle parvient à démontrer que les intérêts des vampires peuvent être avancés en harmonie avec ceux des humains (ou bien en utilisant subtilement les ressources humaines), elle pourrait accroître son influence notablement. Il est essentiel de noter que le poids politique de Nathalie Leclair dépendra fortement de la réceptivité des autres acteurs influents à sa vision et de la manière dont elle manœuvre dans le réseau complexe des agendas et des rivalités de la cour. En dépit de ne pas avoir un rôle officiel élevé, elle a le potentiel d'exercer une influence significative à travers le dialogue, la collaboration et peut-être même l'innovation sociale et politique au sein de la cour Camariste de Toulouse."},{"instruction":"Correction, Nathalie Leclair est Primogène. Elle représente les sang clair au conseil et au sein de la Camarilla. Après avoir intégré cet élément, répond a nouveau à la question.","output":"En tant que Primogène représentant les Sang Clair au sein de la cour Camariste de Toulouse, Nathalie Leclair est investie d'un poids politique significatif et jouit d'une place de choix au sein du conseil des Primogènes. Sa fonction lui confère plusieurs rôles clés et un pouvoir influent : 1. **Autorité Politique**: En tant que Primogène, Nathalie Leclair est une figure officielle dans les décisions politiques de la cour et participe directement à la prise de décision et à l'élaboration des stratégies de la Camarilla locale. 2. **Représentation des Sans-Clan et Affiliés**: Elle sert d'intermédiaire entre les vampires sans clan ou affiliés à des lignées mineures et la cour, permettant à ces individus souvent marginalisés d'avoir une voix au sein de la Camarilla. Ceci comprend les Sang Clair, ce qui leur donne une représentation et un pouvoir qu'ils n'ont pas traditionnellement. 3. **Influence sur le Conseil**: En tant que membre du conseil des Primogènes, Nathalie Leclair peut influencer les autres clans et défendre les intérêts et perspectives uniques du Sang Clair. Cela peut impliquer des stratégies pour intégrer de manière plus harmonieuse les intérêts des humains avec ceux de la société vampirique. 4. **Partisane de la Modernisation**: Elle pourrait prôner pour l'adaptation des traditions de la Camarilla aux réalités modernes, encourageant une modernisation des approches notamment en termes de technologie, de relations avec les humains et de la Masquerade. 5. **Défense de la Masquerade**: Nathalie Leclair peut jouer un rôle crucial dans la défense de la Masquerade, proposant des moyens innovants pour intégrer les humains de manière plus subtile et moins dangereuse, réduisant le risque de brèches. 6. **Avocate des Marginalisés**: Avec son statut élevé, elle peut également apporter une attention particulière aux problèmes des vampires qui sont souvent négligés, utilisant sa position pour plaider en leur faveur et potentiellement réformer les politiques qui les affectent. 7. **Canalisation des Ressources et Talents**: Le domaine de Nathalie dans le quartier Compans-Caffarelli lui permet d'accéder à une variété de ressources et talents qu'elle peut mobiliser à l'avantage de la cour, renforçant ainsi sa position et sa légitimité. En qualité de Primogène du Sang Clair, Nathalie Leclair détient une importance stratégique et est capable d'agir comme une passerelle cruciale entre la Camarilla et les aspects de la société humaine qui peuvent être exploités pour le bénéfice des vampires. Sa légitimité au sein du conseil des Primogènes lui permet de plaider en faveur d'initiatives qui peuvent à la fois protéger et avancer les intérêts des vampires de Toulouse, rendant sa place et son poids politique très considérables."},{"instruction":"Comment les autres membre de la cours perçoive le fait que les Toréador possède presque deux siège au conseil ?","output":"Le fait que les Toreadors semblent détenir un quasi-double représentant au conseil des Primogènes de Toulouse, avec la Comtesse Alexandra Devereaux dirigeant la cour et Nathalie Leclair agissant en tant que Primogène pour le Sang Clair affilié aux Toreadors, est une source de tension et de jugements mitigés au sein de la cour Camariste : 1. **Resentiment et Jalousie**: Certains membres de la cour pourraient ressentir un certain ressentiment ou jalousie envers le clan Toreador, percevant cette situation comme une accumulation excessive de pouvoir dans les mains d'un seul clan, ce qui contrecarre le système traditionnellement équilibré de représentation et de contre-pouvoirs. 2. **Questions de Légitimité**: D'autres pourraient questionner la légitimité de la représentation des Sang Clair au conseil si cette dernière est trop étroitement alignée avec les intérêts des Toreadors. Ce serait particulièrement le cas chez les clans qui valorisent une structure de pouvoir égalitaire ou qui ont eux-mêmes des désirs d'ascension politique. 3. **Crainte de Favoritisme**: Des craintes pourraient être soulevées concernant un favoritisme potentiel à l'égard des Toreadors dans la prise de décisions ou l’allocation de ressources, sachant que les décisions pourraient être influencées par une vision du monde et une idéologie dominée par les Toreadors. 4. **Stratégies de Contrepoids**: En réponse, autres Primogènes et clans puissants pourraient chercher à former des alliances ou blocs de contre-pouvoir pour s'assurer que leurs propres intérêts et visions sont représentés et pris en compte au conseil. 5. **Demande de Représentation**: Les autres clans peuvent exiger une meilleure représentation ou une voix supplémentaire au conseil pour les Sans-Clan ou les affiliés à d'autres lignées qui ne sont pas étroitement liés aux Toreadors, afin de rééquilibrer la balance du pouvoir. 6. **Reconnaissance du Rôle Unique des Sang Clair**: Quelques membres peuvent reconnaître la nécessité d'avoir une voix au conseil qui tient compte des perspectives uniques des Sang Clair, indépendamment de leur affiliation clanique. 7. **Évaluation des Mérites de Nathalie Leclair**: À un niveau personnel, certains membres pourraient juger Nathalie Leclair sur ses mérites en tant que Primogène, tels que son efficacité, sa diplomatie et ses contributions à la cour, plutôt que d'être préoccupés par son affiliation avec les Toreadors. Le sentiment général à l'égard de cette situation de \\"double siège\\" dépend essentiellement de la manière dont la Comtesse Devereaux et Nathalie Leclair naviguent dans leurs rôles respectifs, des efforts qu'elles font pour maintenir l'équilibre du pouvoir et des alliances qu'elles tissent avec les autres acteurs importants de la cour.

The specific option \`-Xms\` sets the initial Java heap size. The heap is the portion of memory where Java objects are stored. When SQL Developer starts, the JVM will allocate this initial heap size. Setting an appropriate value for \`-Xms\` can help improve performance by reducing the number of times the JVM has to increase the heap size during runtime. For example, this line in the \`sqldeveloper.conf\` file: \`\`\` AddVMOption -Xms256m \`\`\` would set the initial heap size to 256 megabytes. It tells the JVM to start with 256 MB of memory allocated for the heap right when SQL Developer is launched, rather than starting with a smaller amount and growing the heap dynamically as needed, which can be less efficient. The counterpart to \`-Xms\` is \`-Xmx\`, which sets the maximum heap size, defining the upper limit the JVM is allowed to allocate to the heap. It's common to set both values with \`-Xms\` being lower than \`-Xmx\` to allow for heap growth as needed by the application up to the maximum limit. It’s important to note that the values you set for \`-Xms\` and \`-Xmx\` should be within your system's available memory resources. Setting them too high could cause other applications to run out of memory or even the system itself to become unresponsive if it's unable to allocate more memory for vital processes."},{"instruction":"Hello there!","output":"Hello! How can I assist you today?

Baby Face is a Stand featured in the fifth part of the JoJo series, \\"Golden Wind.\\" Stands in the JoJo universe are physical manifestations of a person's fighting spirit and have various supernatural abilities. Baby Face is a unique, computer-based Stand that can materialize a secondary humanoid Stand known as Baby Face Junior by converting humans into a cube that serves as its material. Integrating Baby Face into the gameplay of \\"Overwatch\\" would require a creative mashup of mechanics. Here's a fictional interpretation of how Baby Face could be adapted as a new hero in \\"Overwatch\\": 1. **Name and Role**: Baby Face would likely be a damage or support hero, given its unconventional abilities. 2. **Basic Attacks**: - *Primary Fire*: Baby Face could dispatch Baby Face Junior to perform slashing melee attacks against close-range opponents. - *Secondary Fire*: Baby Face could shoot energy blasts with a short-range cooldown as a ranged attack option. 3. **Abilities**: - *Ability 1 (Melting Cube)*: This ability could temporarily transform an enemy into a weakened state, reducing their movement speed or damage output. - *Ability 2 (Materialize)*: Baby Face could create a temporary structure or barrier by converting environmental objects, providing cover or blocking enemy lines of sight. 4. **Ultimate Ability (Homunculus Army)**: For Baby Face's Ultimate, Baby Face Junior could split into multiple homunculus minions that automatically attack enemies or perform specific tasks, like healing allies or disrupting enemy positions. 5. **Defensive Mechanism**: As a nod to Baby Face's ability to learn and adapt quickly in the JoJo series, the hero could have a passive ability that allows it to reduce the cooldown of its abilities after avoiding damage for a certain period, simulating the learning process. 6. **Appearance**: The hero could visually mimic the Stand's aesthetic, fitting into the \\"Overwatch\\" art style yet remaining faithful to the original design from \\"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.\\" 7. **Lore Integration**: Overwatch has a rich lore that could be expanded to include an explanation for Baby Face's existence. Perhaps it could tie to the mysterious and otherworldly forces at play in certain aspects of Overwatch's history. This speculative design melds the distinctiveness of Baby Face with the gameplay requirements and balance considerations of \\"Overwatch.\\" Of course, this integration is purely hypothetical, as the intellectual property rights of \\"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure\\" belong to Hirohiko Araki and the related manga and anime production companies, while \\"Overwatch\\" is owned by Blizzard Entertainment. Therefore, an official crossover is unlikely without collaboration between these entities."},{"instruction":"baby face from jojo’s bizarre adventure in to aut","output":"I will assume by \\"AUT\\" you are referring to \\"A Universal Time,\\" which is a Roblox game inspired by various anime, manga, and popular culture, including \\"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.\\" In \\"A Universal Time\\" (AUT), players can get abilities known as \\"Stands\\" based on those from the \\"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure\\" series. If Baby Face from \\"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure\\" were to be implemented into AUT, its abilities would need to be adapted for the game environment while retaining the essence of the Stand's capabilities as seen in the manga and anime. Here's an interpretation of how the stand might be integrated into the Roblox game: 1. **Acquisition**: To obtain Baby Face in AUT, there may be a special quest or a set of conditions that players must meet, potentially involving puzzles or combat challenges that are in line with the Stand’s unique characteristics. 2. **Abilities**: - **Basic Attack**: Baby Face could deploy miniaturized versions of Baby Face Junior to attack opponents at close range, similar to a melee Stand function. - **Cube Creation**: Mimicking the Stand's power from the manga, this could allow players to temporarily turn objects or even opponents into material they could use for other abilities. - **Homunculus Summon**: As a special move, the player can summon Baby Face Junior to fight alongside them temporarily, much like other Stand abilities in AUT. - **Environment Manipulation**: Aligning with the Stand's creative ability to use objects in its environment, Baby Face could have a move that changes nearby objects into traps or defensive structures. 3. **Ultimate Ability**: - **Homunculus Horde**: For its ultimate ability, Baby Face could unleash a swarm of homunculi, overwhelming opponents with sheer numbers for a short time. 4. **Stand Progression**: Considering Baby Face's learning aspect in the original material, users might improve their Stand's abilities or unlock new moves as they use Baby Face more frequently in the game. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, Baby Face is not an official part of AUT. Any inclusion of the Stand would be up to the developers of the game, who would also need to consider the balance and integration with the rest of the AUT gameplay mechanics. And of course, they would need to have the rights or permission to use the \\"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure\\" intellectual property for compliance with copyright laws."},{"instruction":"baby face from jojo’s bizarre adventure in to yba","output":"As of my last update, \\"Your Bizarre Adventure\\" (YBA) is a popular Roblox game that, much like \\"A Universal Time,\\" is inspired by \\"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.\\" Players in YBA can obtain and use various Stands with different abilities, some of which are true to the Stands seen in the manga and anime series. If Baby Face were to be included in YBA, the developers would have to consider how to translate Baby Face's unique abilities into game mechanics that fit within YBA's system. Below are some hypothetical abilities and features that Baby Face could have if it were added to YBA: 1. **Acquiring Baby Face**: To keep with the game's current mechanics of acquiring Stands, maybe players could get Baby Face through a Stand Arrow or a unique in-game event that aligns with the Stand's capabilities. 2. **Stand Abilities**: - **Primary Ability (Materialization)**: Baby Face could turn in-game objects into usable material for its abilities, perhaps creating blocks or barriers. - **Secondary Ability (Melting Love)**: Temporarily turn an enemy into a vulnerable state where they take more damage or cannot use their abilities for a few seconds, a reference to Baby Face's power in the series. - **Summon Baby Face Junior**: Much like other summoning Stands in YBA, Baby Face could create a small, controllable Stand (Baby Face Junior) that attacks opponents directly. 3. **Ultimate Move (Homunculus Creation)**: - As Baby Face's ultimate move, the player could summon a group of homunculi to swarm and attack opponents, or perhaps to chase and distract enemies over a brief period. 4. **Passives**: - **Learning AI**: Baby Face could have a passive ability where the player gains increased experience or faster skill cooldowns as they continue to engage in combat, reflecting the Stand's ability to learn and adapt in the anime. Similarly to other games, adding Baby Face to YBA would require careful balancing to ensure it fits with the existing gameplay without being too weak or overpowering other Stands. Additionally, as with any use of copyrighted content, YBA's developers would need to ensure they have the appropriate rights or permissions to use the Baby Face Stand from \\"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.\\" Please note that as of my last update, Baby Face is not a Stand that players can obtain in YBA, and any potential addition would be at the discretion of the game's developers and the relevant copyright holders."},{"instruction":"Je souhaite que tu te places dans le contexte de Vampire la mascarade V5.

En tant que Brujah antitribu, Henri est un guerrier passionné et obstiné. Il se nourrit de la rébellion et utilise ses anciens contacts dans la société Anarch pour semer le doute et la discorde entre les factions. Mais sous cette façade de rebelle se cache un individu profondément loyal au Sabbat et à ses idéaux. Infiltré en tant qu’ancien Anarch, Henri garde des contacts étroits avec des membres des Rebelles Brujah et des Radicaux Libres. Il se présente comme un défenseur des droits des vampires et un agitateur social, cherchant à semer la discorde en manipulant les Anarchs et en créant des tensions entre eux, la Camarilla et d’autres factions.

Ayant tous deux une certaine distance par rapport à Raskol et Morgana, ils pourraient se trouver des affinités, partager des stratégies ou même des informations qui ne passeraient pas forcément par la chaîne de commandement sabbatique. Henri voit en Adriana une alliée précieuse sur le terrain et Adriana trouve en Henri un compagnon d’armes utile et pragmatique. Avec le temps cette dépendance mutuelle les a rapprochées. Morgana Ces deux-là entretiennent une fascination réciproque. Morgana est intriguée par la nature rebelle d’Henri et son désir de perturber l’ordre établi. Henri est quand à lui, à la fois alarmé et captivé par les talents macabres de Morgana en vicissitude. Ils entretiennent une prudence mutuelle compte tenu de leurs capacités à manipuler et perturber tout en respectant les talents de l’autre. Raskol Bien que Raskol soit le leader et qu’Henri soit sous son commandement direct, leur relation peut être légèrement tendue. Raskol voie en Henri une utilité certaine pour ses contacts et son influence parmi les Anarchs, mais se méfie également de son passé. Henri, quant à lui, admire l’autorité de Raskol tout en étant frustré par la rigidité de son approche.","output":"Henri est donc solidement ancré comme un acteur majeur de la Coterie Sabbatique de Toulouse, porteur de l'esprit rebelle des Brujah antitribu.

Aghea eventually releases him [Issei] from her [Aghea's] grasp, causing him [Issei] to blush, although Monshiro soon also [Monshiro] clings to him [Issei] before [Monshiro] also letting him [Issei] go, which allows him [Issei] to [Issei] finally breath. As the Kuki sisters let go of him [Issei], he [Issei] thinks back to the events of Robotics; Notes, where his [Kaito's] beloved little sisters' [Akiho's] supposedly insane plans of creating a fully functional, anime and video game style humanoid mecha [Super GunBuild-1] ended up actually being working out in the end, with the mech [Super GunBuild-1] being useful in the fight against the traitorous, white haired, blue-eyed, tall and slender megalomanical Okinawan mad scientist Kimijima Kō and his [Kō's] elite mafia group masters, the Commitee of 300, which resulted in him [Kaito] learning a strange, hidden truth about the Kukis - the youngest daughter of the family [the Kukis] is imprinited with the magical and technical knowledge accumulated by the clan [the Kukis] throught the long centuries, which was the basis of the infamous Necromonion from Lovecraft's works. The current \\"Necromonion\\" is Monshiro, who [Monshiro] awakened her [Monshiro's] abilities [as the current \\"Necromonion\\"] when [Monshiro] was [Monshiro] almost possesed by [Kō's] AI ghost, which failed and instead Monshiro ended up being able to split her [Monshiro's] conciousness between the real and the virtual world, her [Monshiro's] power transforming Super GunBuild-1 into a fully functional Gundam style mecha that [Super GunBuild-1] was [Super GunBuild-1] able to take on the horde of Commitee of 300 operatives and [Commitee of 300] mafia and rouge intelligence agency contractors descending upon Okinawa's space station to start the apocalypse as he [Kaito] used his [Kaito's] skills in playing Gun-Ballad to pilot it [Super GunBuild-1] while Akiho was [Akiho] pressed up against his [Kaito's] body with Monshiro, who [Monshiro] was [Monshiro] acting as the unit's [Super GunBuild-1's] guilding AI at the time, pouted in jealousy. This moment is interrupted by the arrival of a entire battalion of what later turn out to be Mafia/ the Commitee of 300 thugs, intent on killing the world's savior [Kaito] for stopping the apocalypse. Which turns out to be a bad idea as Aghea has her [Ageha's] twin sabers hidden within a walking stick and [Ageha] is wearing power armor under her [Aghea's] dress and Monshiro has her [Monshiro's] Myrtenaster with both Kuki sisters [Aghea and Monshiro] carrying specially made sidearms, which essentially dooms the thugs before they [the thugs] can [the thugs] fire off a single shot at either girls' [Aghea's or Monshiro's head]. Inside Issei's head, the Red Dragon Emperor inside his [Issei's] Boosted Gear, Ddraig can't stop laughing, [Ddraig] having the most fun he [Ddraig] has [Ddraig] had in centuries as the bodies [of the thugs] fly and the White Fang and the Commitee of 300 are [the White Fang and the Commitee of 300] publicly humilated [the White Fang and the Commitee of 300] in front of the cameras of the smartphones of hundreds of viewers for the world to see via social media. Anti-mafia revolutions in the USA, Russia and Isreal against organized crime erupt when the video of the fight reaches European social media, with the European governments being forced to covertly eliminate the White Fang and the Commitee of 300 presence in Europe. As the Kamakura girls [Momoyo, Kazuko, Aghea and Monshiro] prepare to face off over his [Kaito's] love after the last thug drops, the blonde-haired, green-eyed, anti-social, blatantly perverted and obsessive but focused and determined half-Deutsche [German] Frau [Lady] Kōjirō Adelheild, who [Adelheild] is a rather famous and outspoken tall, slender and buxom noble heiress of good Japanese and Deutsche bloodlines and [Adelheild] has [Adelheild] gathered controversy for her [Adelheild] eccentric, strange personality, and [Adelheild] is [Adelheild] secretly a skilled and rather good programmer and gray hat hacker who [Adelheild] created the rather infamous mecha fighting game Kill-Ballad that Kaito is [Kaito] addicted to [Killballad], [Adelheild] having come from her [Adelheild's] current home in Okinawa to [Adelheild] check up on her [Adelheild's] one true love [Kaito], [Adelheild] decides to join in on the fun, [Adelheild] causing even more surprise from the crowd of Kuoh students and older and younger residents as she [Adelheild] reminds him [Issei] that they [Adelheild and Issei] haven't done it [have baby making sex] yet, as she [Adelheild] effortlessly sends a surviving Mafia thug flying with a single punch before [Adelheild] passionately kissing him [Issei], causing some of the viewers to wonder if they are dreaming. Before anything else can happen, the sound of boots slamming on the pavement alert them to what's happening and Issei sees a few hired guns hired by the Russian Jewish mafia to wipe his [Issei's] gaming persona [Keima] out due to him [Keima] essentially shutting down the Russian mafia's entire operation of illegal cracked games. Without even thinking, Issei quickly rushes in and sends them [the thugs] flying with his [Issei's] formidable martial arts skills as Monshiro effortlessly takes out a rouge CIA sniper about to take him [Issei] out with her [Monshiro's] pistol. Momoyo and Kazuko finish off the rest and the girls of Kawakami [Momoyo, Kazuko, Aghea and Monshiro] start clinging to him [Issei] rather tightly. [Adelheild] seeing the fight about to start between the girls of Kawakami [Momoyo, Kazuko, Aghea and Monshiro] over him [Issei] decides to end the whole debate by suggesting that all of them [Adelheild, Momoyo, Kazuko, Aghea and Monshiro] share him [Issei] as his [Issei's] wives, which [Adelheild's suggestion of a harem] causes gasps of shock and some of disgust, wolf-whistles from some of the more perverted guys and plenty of videolight from the high-priced cellphones of the Kuoh students along with the occasional faint of shock as the girls of Kawakami [Momoyo, Kazuko, Aghea and Monshiro] calm down and [Momoyo, Kazuko, Aghea and Monshiro] along with Adelheild, carry him [Issei] away for a combined date with all five of them [Adelheild, Momoyo, Kazuko, Aghea and Monshiro] and also to find out why he [Kaito] is now in Kyoto, the students of Kuoh being silent as they [Momoyo, Kazuko, Aghea and Monshiro along with Adelheild] carry him [Issei] away, with one student commenting later that this whole things feels like something out of a eroge dating sim visual novel or a perverted harem anime. Meanwhile, the black-haired, red-eyed pale-skinned, tall and slender Orimura Ichika, who [Ichika] never discovered that he [Ichika] could pilot an IS and [Ichika] was raised by his [Ichika's] relatives in rural Jamaica instead of his [Ichika's] older sister Chifuyu, [Ichika] looks at the situation [the girls leaving with Issei] from the scope of a sniper rifle from a hidden location, [Ichika] having [what happens to Ichika] become a militant fascist revolutionary [Ichika] fighting against corrupt corporations, greedy communists and expansive government officials while [Ichika] posing as a rather popular and controversal dancehall artiste named Alkaline, who [Alkaline] is [Alkaline] known for his [Alkaline's] sexually explict, raunchy, gang violence and action supporting, hardcore ghetto supporting music and [Alkaline] is [Alkaline] infamous for wearing a Guy Fawkes Mask during his [Alkaline's] performances, [Alkaline] having a rather strong gang/fanbase called the Vendetta Crew that [the Vendetta Crew] has [the Vendetta Crew] essentially seized control of the Jamaican underworld from local terrrorist and drug cartel factions in Jamaica, [Ichika] laughing to himself [Ichika] and [Ichika] muttering that the time for 'justice' [launching a terror attack on the Kukis during the date with Issei] is right before [Ichika] leaving in order to [Ichika] summon a few of his [Ichika's] Vendetta Crew minions, putting on a Guy Fawkes mask as he [Ichika] does so. Masking their [Alkaline's and the Vendetta Crew's] attack on the Kukis as a hit on a rival Jamaican terrorist, the crew of mayhem [Alkaline and the Vendetta Crew] are almost successful, managing to take out the protection detail due to the huge amount of heavy weaponry they [Alkaline and the Vendetta Crew] managed to slip into the country [Japan], but [Alkaline and the Vendetta Crew] ultimately failing due to Rias and the rest of her [Rias'] peerage arriving at the same place they [Alkaline and the Vendetta Crew] attack and [Rias and the Gremory peerage] decimating the terrorists, Alkaline barely escaping and the Vendetta Crew minions being slaughtered as their guns prove worthless against the peerage's supernatural powers. Issei finds himself [Issei] smothered by the girls from Okinawa and Kawakami, [Issei] unable to get away. Rias, upon seeing this, [Rias] comments that she [Rias] now understands why he [Issei] is [Issei] afraid to go any further in the relationship he [Issei] has with her [Rias'] and the other girls of the Occult Research Club, but she [Rias] is his [Issei's] first wife whom [Rias] he [Issei] must be the first to impregnate during the honeymoon and that he [Issei] must explain everything to her [Rias] in the privacy of the ORC clubhouse.","output":"**A Clash of Worldviews and Powers: The Battle of Identities** *Scene opens to the streets of Kyoto, with Issei walking down a secluded sidewalk, engrossed in thought about his gaming and mecha pursuits, looking forward to finishing the latest eroge game in his collection.* Issei: *(murmuring to himself)* \\"Just a few more levels, and that true ending will be mine.

Advances in neurological research can help organizations operationalize diversity of thought and eventually change how they define and harness human capital. Executive Summary UP to now, diversity initiatives have focused primarily on fairness for legally protected populations. But organizations now have an opportunity to harness a more powerful and nuanced kind of diversity: diversity of thought. Advances in neurological research that are untangling how each of us thinks and solves problems can help organizations, including governments, operationalize diversity of thought and eventually change how they define and harness human capital. Diversity of thought can bring an organization the following benefits: It helps guard against groupthink and expert overconfidence. Diversity of thought can help organizations make better decisions and complete tasks more successfully because it triggers more careful and creative information processing than typically occurs in homogeneous groups. It helps increase the scale of new insights. Generating a great idea quickly often requires connecting multiple tasks and ideas together in a new way. Technological advances are enabling new ways, such as crowdsourcing and gamification, to bring the diversity of human thinking to bear on challenging problems. It helps organizations identify the right employees who can best tackle their most pressing problems. Advances in neuroscience mean that matching people to specific jobs based on more rigorous cognitive analysis is within reach. Organizations that can operationalize faster ideation can begin to purposely align individuals to certain teams and jobs simply because of the way they think. To increase diversity of thought among their workforce, governments can: Hire differently. The job description and interview process should contain competencies and questions designed to help identify and select a cognitively diverse organization. Organizations also need to recruit top talent—even if it means shaking up the status quo with opinionated employees. Manage differently. Instead of seeking consensus as an end goal, managers should encourage task-focused conflict that can push their teams to new levels of creativity and productivity. The aim is to foster an environment where all feel comfortable sharing their views and their authentic selves. Promote differently. One way government organizations can retain and advance cognitively diverse talent is to enact sponsorship programs directed at individuals who represent different thinking styles. Moving to a team-based performance evaluation framework can allow an organization to create and foster a culture of inclusion that empowers its people, spurs collaboration, and inspires more innovation. A more nuanced approach to diversity It’s time to rethink diversity. Up to now, diversity initiatives focused primarily on fairness for legally protected populations—historically underrepresented in the American workforce.1 Today we are living through the demographic transformation of the US labor market, which will make ethnic diversity a permanent fixture of the future workplace.2 This demographic reality provides the opportunity to reexamine diversity policies and ask what workplace diversity really should mean in the 21st century. Of course, the growing natural diversity of the American workforce does not mean that the representation of historically underrepresented individuals will equalize throughout all levels of an organization. For example, diversity programs will still need to focus on promoting participation of women and ethnic minorities at executive levels in organizations. The shifting demographics do provide government leaders, however, with the opportunity to refresh the business case for diversity and take advantages of significant advances in how to think about the optimum level of diversity in the workplace. Smart organizations will realize that they now have an opportunity to introduce more powerful and nuanced approaches to operationalize the full range of human diversity: Namely, they can begin to harness diversity of thought.3 Diversity of thought is the next frontier. Diversity of thought refers to a concept that all of us know intuitively and experience throughout our lives. Each human being has a unique blend of identities, cultures, and experiences that inform how he or she thinks, interprets, negotiates, and accomplishes a task. Diversity of thought goes beyond the affirmation of equality—simply recognizing differences and responding to them. Instead, the focus is on realizing the full potential of people, and in turn the organization, by acknowledging and appreciating the potential promise of each person’s unique perspective and different way of thinking. The implication of this new frontier in diversity is that leaders and organizations must let go of the idea that there is “one right way” and instead focus on creating a learning culture where people feel accepted, are comfortable contributing ideas, and actively seek to learn from each other.4 What is new today and is only likely to grow in the next few years are the unprecedented advances in neurological research that are untangling how each of us thinks and solves problems. These insights can help organizations operationalize diversity of thought and can eventually change how they define and harness human capital. In the not-too-distant future, managers adept at leading a diverse work team will be sensitive not only to factors of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and ability, but also to the new research and enabling technologies that will help organizations understand how people think. Managers will also need to understand how to use emergent technologies to help employees evaluate their unique thinking strengths and identify their optimum contributions to the mission. Technology, of course, is not a panacea. Leaders will also need to learn how to adjust their management styles and tactics to better encourage the connections between individuals and their ideas to improve problem solving, learning, cooperation, and innovation in their organizations. Leaders and managers will thus face the need to take increasing ownership of creating an inclusive culture. Hiring practices will also need to evolve to ensure organizations have the necessary diversity of thought in their workforce. Hiring for a diversity of backgrounds may not necessarily yield different perspectives, as physical diversity is not a sufficient proxy for diversity of thought. And once an individual is hired, organizations will need to adjust their approaches to managing and advancing the individual’s career. This report describes the benefits diversity of thought can bring to an organization, and also shows examples of how organizations can apply diversity of thought to transform the way they recruit and retain a diverse and inclusive workforce. We discuss: Benefits of diversity of thought to organizations Helps guard against groupthink and expert overconfidence Increases the scale of new insights Helps organizations identify the right employees who can best tackle their most pressing problems What you can do today to increase diversity of thought Hire differently Manage differently Promote differently Benefits of diversity of thought to organizations Over the last 10 years, cognitive scientists and neurologists have made progress in understanding how the mind works. For example, many of us—even those who aren’t scientists—are familiar with the distinction between left- and right-brained thinking and its impact on work performance.5 Although this taxonomy is overly simplistic, neurological research does show that individuals have differing cognitive styles. Tests show that most individuals have particular thinking strengths: Some are inclined to be better at math, others at pattern recognition or creativity. Experts agree that this research has identified a significant new aspect of diversity that existing diversity policies do not adequately address. We have long understood that legacy diversity and experiential diversity (see sidebar, “Three kinds of diversity”) illuminate how people will likely behave in various circumstances.6 Thought diversity offers a new layer of insight that organizations can use to maximize the collective potential of their employees. Leaders that explore this new frontier of diversity can blend the cacophony of ideas in their workplace to spark innovation and creativity. Even the slightest nuance of one worker’s thinking, if appropriately harnessed, could bring value to the organization. The confluence of science, technology, and management theory regarding human thought is opening up an opportunity for government agencies and other organizations that are willing to embrace diversity of thought as an organizational priority. Investing in diversity of thought can help organizations notice three key benefits and a significant competitive advantage. 1. Diverse thinkers help guard against groupthink and expert overconfidence Research demonstrates that thought diversity can help organizations make better decisions because it triggers more creative information processing, often absent in homogenous groups.7 Moreover, while homogenous groups are typically more confident in their performance, diverse groups are oftentimes more successful in completing tasks. This is because diverse team","output":"It appears that the text you've submitted is an extensive narrative advocating for a more nuanced understanding and application of diversity within organizations, emphasizing the concept of diversity of thought. The article discusses the benefits of diversity of thought, such as guarding against groupthink, increasing the scale of new insights, and aiding in identifying employees best suited for pressing problems. The text then offers insights into how governments and organizations can adapt their hiring, managing, and promotion strategies to support cognitive diversity. The report argues that a diverse workforce can be more creative and innovative. It also notes that technological advances and research in neurology and cognitive science are shedding light on how individuals think and solve problems differently. This understanding can help organizations tailor their approach to maximizing the collective potential of their employees. Key points mentioned in the text include: - Hiring differently by focusing on cognitive diversity and recruiting exceptional talent that may challenge the status quo. - Managing differently to encourage creative, task-focused conflict, and comfortable sharing of ideas. - Promoting differently by supporting individuals with different thinking styles and shifting to team-based performance evaluations. The text finally suggests that as we gain more understanding of cognitive differences through neurological research, managers and organizations need to adopt this knowledge to create an inclusive culture that encourages the melding of diverse ideas and enhances problem-solving and innovation. This is an insightful and forward-thinking perspective on diversity, pushing beyond traditional definitions focused on demographic characteristics into the realm of cognitive and thought diversity to achieve competitive organizational advantages.

IARPA’s Aggregative Contingent Estimation (ACE) program aims “to dramatically enhance the accuracy, precision, and timeliness of forecasts for a broad range of event types, through the development of advanced techniques that elicit, weight, and combine the judgments of many intelligence analysts.” Print Figure 1. Elevating the diversity discussion Philip Tetlock, a professor of management and psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, leads an ACE program research team. Tetlock, whose book Expert Political Judgment examined the frequent overconfidence of substantive experts, has assembled a group of laypeople with diverse backgrounds to predict the future likelihood of certain events.9 This eclectic ACE team has replicated the results Tetlock first published in his book by handily beating the recognized experts in their ability to forecast future events. Both the studies in ACE and in Tetlock’s original research illustrate the potential that organizations have to “fully understand the causes of successful collective performance and to improve their outcomes by assembling teams of more diverse thinkers to complement their more traditional experts.”10 Robert Epstein, in Psychology Today, further notes that organizations that employ thought diversity increase the opportunity for innovation and mitigate the risk of groupthink.11 Without a commitment to thought diversity, employees generally are not willing to share their ideas and solutions. To that end, Willfully Blind author and CEO Margaret Heffernan writes: “[I]n this context, diversity isn’t a form of political correctness, but an insurance policy against internally generated blindness that leaves institutions exposed and out of touch.”12 2. Diverse thinkers help increase the scale of new insights When time is of the essence, organizations often resort to gathering a group of experts and specialists, the premise being that subject-matter knowledge and skills are more likely to quickly generate a quality solution to whatever issue faces the organization. However, emerging technologies are creating options rendering the congregation of experts less useful.13 Instead, generating a great idea quickly requires the ability to connect multiple tasks and ideas together in a new way.14 Crowdsourcing and gamification techniques are unique ways to channel the diversity of human thinking through their use of diverse online crowds to solve challenging issues. The crowdsourcing game Foldit, sponsored by the University of Washington’s Departments of Computer Science and Engineering and Biochemistry, uses the puzzle-solving intuitions of volunteer gamers to help scientists better understand the function of human protein enzymes.15 In one puzzle, scientists asked the community to remodel one of four amino acid loops on a particular enzyme. They received over 70,000 design submissions, the top five of which came from players who had not taken any science beyond high school chemistry. What the players did have in common were spatial reasoning skills, intuition, agility, collaboration, self-organization, and competition.16 These skills, when multiplied by the number of players in Foldit, quickly pointed the scientists to a solution that would have taken the recognized experts much longer to complete. Stephen Lutz, a researcher at Emory University, says: “Using the Foldit players allows the researchers to use human intuition at a scale that is unprecedented.”17 Though most organizations cannot give all their problems to the “crowd” to solve, they can promote a broader range of thinking in the workplace to help them achieve the same benefits of speed and scale afforded by crowdsourcing techniques. Temple Grandin, a noted doctor of animal science and autism advocate, argues that Silicon Valley is a breeding ground for innovative products and ideas, and is powered by different types of thinking. She has recently, and somewhat notoriously, claimed that half of the innovators in Silicon Valley have Asperger’s syndrome, citing that the ability to program for long hours of time could be indicative of a person who is on the autism spectrum. “To create something like Google, people had to sit still for hundreds of hours to learn how to program . . . It’s ironic that the thing that they text on has to be made by someone who is not distracted and is looking at information in whole bits for long periods of time.”18 3. Diverse thinkers help organizations identify individuals who can best tackle their most pressing problems Organizations that can operationalize faster ideation can begin to purposely align individuals to certain teams and jobs simply because of the way they think. Some of this can already be accomplished with testing, but advances in neuroscience mean that matching people to specific jobs based on more rigorous cognitive analysis is within reach. Emotiv Lifesciences, a neurobiology company, has created a brainwave reading rig designed to measure how well a person can concentrate on a given activity. Using sensors similar to an EEG machine, Emotiv has found a way to connect cognitive mental activity and the control of a device like a computer, offering real-time analysis of cognitive activity.19 These and other techniques being developed reveal not just the symphony of neural activity, but the notes behind it. 2_big Figure 2. Emotiv Lifesciences’ brainwave reading rig (Photo: Emotiv) Today, matching cognitive talents to the particular demands of a job or mission is largely done by trial and error. Until recently, the closest organizations could get to understanding the hardwiring of people’s thoughts, and predict their success in any given job, was to give them a personality test. These tests, including Myers-Briggs, Enneagrams, and others, introduced the concept that people may react differently in a given work environment. As new technologies reveal individual strengths more quickly and more precisely, organizations will be able to match more people with the tasks they can do best. The applications and acceptance of these new technologies can be challenging and will likely take organizations into uncharted territories. But if properly incorporated into work processes, they can help identify individuals who can best tackle an organization’s most pressing problems. These new capabilities will empower organizations not to read minds, but to understand how a mind might react and how best to match it with others to achieve mission success. Organizations that learn to do this well will likely have an immediate competitive advantage. What you can do today to increase diversity of thought The intersections between neuroscience, psychology, and technology are creating new opportunities for organizations to better understand how people think and how to translate these cutting-edge findings into practice. Armed with this additional information, government agencies can better align different blends of employees to a particular challenge and unleash diversity of thought within their organization to achieve mission success. What follows are three steps government agencies can take to begin developing a strategy to foster diversity of thought. 1. Hire differently Find strategic skill gaps Governments can realize the benefits of diversity of thought today by evolving their hiring practices. In The Difference, Scott Page, an economist at the University of Michigan, illustrates a unique way to hire people with an eye toward maximizing the diversity of thought within an organization. In the study, three candidates interviewed for two vacant positions on a research team. All candidates were asked the same 10 questions. Jeff correctly answered 7 of 10, Rose 6 of 10, and Spencer 5 of 10 (figure 3). Fig.2_DUP426 Figure 3. Job candidate test results Many organizations would have hired Jeff and Rose for two reasons. First, these two candidates garnered the highest cumulative score. Second, HR managers tend to hire candidates like Jeff and Rose because they “spend a lot of time and money making sure that their people all think the same. They’re squadrons, flying in tight formations, valuing consistency and efficiency over individual flair.”20 However, Page reveals an important nuance. If a recruiter spends the time to examine what questions each candidate answered correctly, he or she will notice that the lowest overall scorer (Spencer) correctly answered every question that the highest scorer (Jeff) incorrectly answered. As such, Spencer presumably brings a different way of thinking to the organization.21 Sunday Morning ComicsFigure 4. Hiring for cognitive diversity With an eye for diversity of thought, managers and HR representatives can select people who think differently while still maintaining alignment with the mission and bottom line. To get a","output":"The text continues to elaborate on the advantages of diverse thinking within organizations. It provides examples where diverse thinking produces superior outcomes to homogeneous expertise, particularly in reference to the work of IARPA and Philip Tetlock's ACE program, as well as breakthroughs from crowdsourced initiatives such as the Foldit project at the University of Washington. Key takeaways from this section include: 1. **Diverse Thinkers and Group Dynamics**: Diverse thinkers challenge conventional wisdom and bring new perspectives that can protect against groupthink and expert overconfidence, leading to more effective problem-solving. 2. **Scaling New Insights**: Diversity of thought can accelerate innovation and enhance the ability to generate ideas. Techniques like crowdsourcing and gamification can tap into diverse cognitive skills, as seen with the Foldit project. 3. **Identifying Problem Solvers**: Technological advances, like those made by Emotiv Lifesciences, will further enable organizations to match individuals to roles based on cognitive strengths, potentially through real-time brain activity monitoring, moving beyond traditional personality tests. The text then shifts to practical measures that can be adopted right now: 1. **Hiring Differently**: It involves finding strategic skill gaps and selecting employees who offer different cognitive strengths and problem-solving abilities, as exemplified by Scott Page's \\"The Difference\\" study, which suggests that hiring a person who complements the skills of the highest scorer may bring more overall value to a team than hiring the two top individual performers. 2. **Managing Differently**: This approach encourages inviting different perspectives and fostering an environment where unique ideas are valued and task-focused conflict is seen as a path to creativity and productivity. 3. **Promoting Differently**: Includes sponsorship programs for different thinking styles and team-based performance evaluation frameworks to create an inclusive culture of empowerment and innovation. The conclusion emphasizes the transformational potential held by integrating insights from neuroscience and psychology with emerging technologies to build a strategy that fosters diversity of thought in organizations, especially within government agencies. By understanding and leveraging cognitive diversity, organizations can achieve greater adeptness at navigating complex challenges and fostering innovation. It's clear that the text is proposing a cultural and procedural shift within organizations, advocating for inclusivity in thought patterns and cognitive approaches with an aim to better innovation, productivity, and decision-making efficacy.

A German software firm is taking this idea of selecting for cognitive diversity a step further by actively recruiting for a particular strand of cognitive ability that has historically been branded a disability. SAP AG recently announced its plans to recruit people with autism to make use of this population’s ability to process information. People diagnosed with autism have difficulties communicating and suffer from emotional detachment, yet those with mild autism diagnoses often can perform complex tasks that require high levels of concentration—typically much better than the average population. Beyond their advanced mathematical skills, autistic people also frequently exhibit a particularly potent ability to find patterns and make connections. SAP AG’s willingness to seek out unique cognitive skill sets where other organizations may see prohibitive deficits injects new complexity into their talent management, but can be well worth the effort.22 SAP AG noted that “SAP sees a potential competitive advantage to leveraging the unique talents of people with autism, while also helping them to secure meaningful employment.”23 Get away from the status quo and hire with debate in mind One of the most important projects in US history benefited from a similar unorthodox approach to assembling a team. During World War II, the Manhattan Project was led by Colonel Dick Groves (US Army) and physicist Dr. Robert Oppenheimer. It was, first and foremost, a military operation, and would come to represent the beginning of the military-industrial complex—a hybrid of public, private, and academic brain power.24 Groves and Oppenheimer brought together several thousand physicists and engineers, 20 of whom were Nobel laureates.25 Oppenheimer, in particular, summoned scientists with contrasting theoretical points of view, knowing that if these men could collectively work through their differences, they would be able to accomplish one of the greatest scientific feats of the 20th century.26 Had they not hired with this in mind, the opportunity to generate and take advantage of innovative ideas may have been squandered. Although Groves and Oppenheimer did not open the floodgates to all types of diversity (women, for example, were not included), they did hire widely within the field of science and the military to combine two distinct worlds in a moment of crisis, creating a weapon of intense power, but setting the precedent for how diverse talents can achieve difficult tasks in a short period of time. A key lesson from history is that organizations need to recruit top talent—even if it means shaking up the status quo with opinionated employees. Oppenheimer intentionally gathered dissenting, great minds in an effort to harness their conflicts. He knew that the series of solutions they worked toward would never have sprung forth from a chorus of agreement, no matter how collectively brilliant. Oppenheimer’s true genius was in his ability to gather and manage talent. These principles could work for many more organizations whose cognitively diverse workforces need to engage constructively to test their differences of opinion. 2. Manage differently Facilitate diversity tension One of Oppenheimer’s management strengths with the Manhattan Project was being comfortable with the uncomfortable. In their book Virtuoso Teams, Andrew Boynton and Bill Fischer, professors and experts in business management, observed: “The endless struggle between idea flow and organizational complexity is a leitmotif that runs through the Manhattan Project story. Clearly the need for more ideas was in direct contradiction to the need for project secrecy. In addition, there was the question of how to generate novel ideas when so many true and opinionated experts were part of the team.”27 Oppenheimer created an environment where all the scientists could come together and debate their various ideas during weekly meetings; even the ethical implications of the Manhattan Project were a topic of discussion.28It was no easy feat leading these differing points of view, which often resulted in what today is referred to as diversity tension. One of the challenges associated with diversity is that it introduces greater complexity. The successful organizations will be the ones that can overcome challenges such as misunderstandings and increased conflict, which can happen when diversity is not successfully managed. Even the best-intentioned manager can send off subconscious signals of discomfort when confronted with diversity tension on their team. A research team in Denmark recently studied city government officials to identify reasons why their organization experienced high levels of negativity. They observed the local government officials, using videos to record typical actions and interactions during the workday. When looking back through the tapes, the researchers noticed that whenever a government executive was challenged or asked a tough question by his or her employees, he or she would make a slight variation in their head movement. Working with psychologists, the researchers determined that this slight head nod was the same tic observed in nature when an individual comes into contact with a wild animal, namely a tiger.29 The office may not have a pet tiger, but managers and employees still face the instinctual urge to avoid conflict. It is simply easier for them to agree than to be confrontational. Part of being comfortable with conflict is abandoning the idea that consensus is an end in and of itself. In a well-run diverse team, substantive disagreements do not need to become personal—ideas either have merit and points of connection or they do not. Diversity of thought challenges managers to rethink conflict itself, shifting their perspective away from mitigating conflict’s negative effects and toward designing conflict that can push their teams to new levels of creativity and productivity. Leaders and managers who create the necessary space for disagreements will find richer solutions and the buy-in of naysayers who are at least able to voice their ideas. IDEO, an industrial design firm, manages this tension by purposely hiring people from diverse backgrounds.30 The company hires to inject different perspectives and then fosters a collaborative and participative culture where people have to advocate for their ideas. IDEO’s approach is born out of careful hiring practices and ability to facilitate controlled conflict, the subject of IDEO general manager Tom Kelly’s book The Ten Faces of Innovation. Since these non-traditional teams are formed with experiential conflict in mind, individuals are required to be advocates for their ideas and respect the ideas of those around them. Furthermore, IDEO has a resourcing approach that gets people with great facilitation skills, not years of service, to drive the design process and manage the project to get the most value of the unique experts. Kelly insists that while there is no formula for who should contribute when, the key is for all people to be encouraged to bring multiple ideas to a problem set. They also should not have competing ideologies (like the many scientists and military men of the Manhattan project); rather, they should have unique subject-matter expertise that, when brought together, sparks innovation. Give permission Government agencies aiming for a more diverse workforce need to adopt specific practices so that employees believe they have permission to bring their entire selves to the workplace.31 In that sense, organizations that strive for inclusion attempt to appreciate their employees’ differences and foster an environment where all feel comfortable sharing their views and their authentic selves. Employees should feel comfortable disagreeing and holding opinions different from those of management. One of the hardest things for managers to do is to let employees disagree with them and to allow them to explore their ideas—even if that exploration leads to failure. To relieve the pressure on employees, managers can use behavioral nudges to prompt conversation and depersonalize debate around even the manager’s own personal ideas.32 In a recent interview, a manager in an intelligence agency described how she often has to write long analyses bringing together various pieces of literature into a seamless document. The documents contain content that is of the utmost strategic importance. One way she has found to ensure that her team members provide honest and necessary insight is to give them the permission to give harsh, constructive feedback. Instead of asking reviewers, “Does this make sense?” or “Is this OK?,” she instead asks, “What is wrong with my logic?” or “What points am I missing?” Such questions provoke more contrarian analysis that ultimately helps her create a better final product.33 Employees often complain that managers today stifle important conversations. Such difficult discussions will only increase as organizations begin to design work teams to capitalize on diversity of thought. Organizations need to make it a priority to equip their managers with new techniques to effectively manage and embrace diversity of thought. 3. Advance differently Drive career sponsorship Once cognitively diverse individuals are hired within a workplace, managers and leaders will want to retain and advance that talent. One way government organizations can do so is to enact sponsorship programs directed at individuals who represent different thinking styles. As human beings we are naturally inclined to associate with “like” people, yet a thought-diverse workforce needs to connect across thinking styles.34 Aligning sponsors based on shared attributes may not be the best way to help diverse individuals learn how to communicate their oppositional ideas in the most constructive fashion. Sponsors could help cognitively diverse thinkers find the appropriate application of their unique thinking styles, thus helping them to advance in their new career track. A sponsor trained in the tenets of cognitive diversity would also be able to translate and promote the otherwise hidden attributes of individuals new to an organization. For example, military veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have skills, certifications, and cognitive styles that organizations can use, including the ability to think quickly, manage well under pressure, and improvise. And yet their careers can be rocky when they are asked to adjust to a culture different from the military tribe they’re used to.35 Sponsors that can facilitate these types of transitions are key to an organization’s ability to incorporate cognitive diversity. Individuals with diverse thinking styles can also act as a mentor to other people within their organizations. For example, in today’s digital age, many Millennials are reverse mentoring more senior colleagues in social media and networks.36 Cisco has implemented a reverse mentorship program designed to “understand where the mentor can provide the executive with a perspective on how comments and decisions might be interpreted by diverse employees as well as valuable feedback on how well s/he encourages inclusion and diversity in his/her own team and also in his/her own business practices.”37 Reverse mentorship programs tell employees that their different ideas are valued and, in fact, need to be incorporated more often in the more senior levels of the organization. The confidence individuals gain in reverse mentorship programs can help them achieve more in their official duties as well. Shift to team-based evaluation To the extent that diversity of thought is about identifying and managing potential, it is helpful to recall what the late Peter Drucker, management consultant, educator, and author said: “You can only manage what you can measure.”38 Leaders willing to harness the power of thought diversity may want to measure behaviors such as openness to constructive conflict to push their teams toward more robust results, however much this practice may challenge existing management norms. It’s time to shift the conversation from managing individual performance to nurturing the collective, authentic team. The US Office of Personnel Management has provided team evaluation guidance that highlights that individual performance can be linked to a team’s cooperative behavior.39 By focusing on the team’s outputs, public sector organizations can continue to drive toward results while holding the collective accountable to attributes such as motivation, intellectual breadth, emotional intelligence, and risk tolerance. Critically, these elements are aligned with the larger goals and values of the organization and can help create an environment where people can bring their authentic selves. Any evaluation framework must reflect the complexities that make up the authentic self, and by pivoting evaluations toward the team, the appraisal becomes about shared performance and how each individual can enable the larger group to drive toward excellence. By moving to a team evaluation framework, organizations can create and foster a culture of inclusion that empowers its people, spurs collaboration, and inspires more innovation. Harnessing diversity of thought Throughout the course of history, many great ideas would not have emerged without the right combination of technology, necessity, and opportunity. Diversity of thought is not a novel or radical idea, but rather the inevitable result of increased pluralism and connectivity in the 21st century. In ways that a few decades ago were unimaginable, people and organizations can now optimize the opportunities found in the intersections among cultures, values, and perspectives. The practices and regulations of today need to be reimagined and rewritten to allow for the emergence and full development of a more powerful diversity strategy. As MIT research scientist Andrew McAfee writes, “Expertise—for problem solving, innovation, etc.—is emergent. It’s out there in large quantities, and in hard-to-predict places. A problem-solving approach that lets pockets of enthusiasm and expertise manifest themselves and find each other can yield surprisingly large rewards, even in the unlikeliest places.”40 Diversity policies designed to hire, facilitate, and encourage diversity of thought can help organizations find that expertise. But not all will rest on management. As tools and techniques emerge to allow individuals to explore their own personal cognitive makeup, job seekers could very well begin judging potential employers in the public and private sectors based on their ability to provide a good cognitive fit. Employees may develop the self-awareness to understand their own unique ability to contribute to an organization’s mission and to maximize the expression of their own talents and passions. Government agencies that fail to manage for cognitive diversity eventually may find themselves at a competitive disadvantage in the future as the best talent will seek situations that can fully leverage their cognitive capabilities.","output":"In the final part of the text, the focus shifts to how organizations can practically incorporate diversity of thought into their recruiting, management, and advancement processes. The discussion offers a number of interesting strategies and examples, emphasizing that harnessing cognitive diversity can offer substantial benefits. 1. **Hiring Differently**: The text encourages looking beyond traditional qualifications, pointing to the example of SAP AG recruiting individuals with autism, who may possess exceptional analytical and information processing skills. Historical examples, such as the recruitment strategies used in the Manhattan Project, are cited to show the value of hiring individuals who can bring a diversity of perspectives and challenge the status quo. 2. **Managing Differently**: Robert Oppenheimer's approach to managing the Manhattan Project is highlighted, noting his comfort with diversity tension and debate. The text suggests that instead of avoiding conflict, managers should embrace it to foster creativity and innovation. The Danish study on government officials further illustrates the typical discomfort with conflict and how it can be overcome by allowing and encouraging open, constructive disagreement. 3. **Advancing Differently**: This section suggests implementing sponsorship programs for individuals with differing cognitive styles and utilizing reverse mentorship, where less experienced employees can share their insights with more seasoned colleagues. It also recommends shifting to team-based evaluations to focus on collective performance rather than just individual achievements, aligning with a culture of inclusion that values diverse contributions. The text concludes by acknowledging the historical context of diverse thought as an asset, with the potential for even greater opportunity in the digital age. Organizations that fail to adapt to this new perspective on diversity may risk losing out on top talent who seek environments where their cognitive skills are recognized and valued. The text seems to aim at broadening the conversation on diversity beyond the conventional demographics and towards a richer understanding of how different cognitive approaches can benefit an organization. It makes a compelling case for the need to evolve hiring, management, and promotion strategies to fully leverage individuals' varied thinking styles and cognitive strengths.

While those things certainly explain a component of diversity, it’s only part of what diversity in the workplace includes. Realistically speaking, physical and social aspects only make up about half of diversity. The remainder lies in diversity of thought. Not long ago, Denise Young Smith, Apple’s vice president for diversity and inclusion, received criticism for making remarks about white men that many considered to be controversial. She said, ”12 white, blue-eyed, blonde men could be diverse.” Despite the way she framed her statement, Smith may have been on to something. The point she seemed to be making was that you can have 12 different ethnicities of various ages with an equal number of males and females, yet you may not be fully maximizing the opportunities to drive diversity if you are not also considering diversity of thought. What good is promoting diversity if everyone thinks the same way? The key to successfully implementing diversity is to have a staff with diverse backgrounds and diverse thought. Only then will true innovation and growth be possible. Diversity and Hiring When hiring, it is important to distinguish potential employee’s whose values align with the company’s core values. Once a core value connection is established, another important consideration is diversity. The key to successfully implementing diversity is to have a staff with diverse backgrounds and diverse thought. Different backgrounds and thought processes bring unique viewpoints to the organization that help tackle problems for optimal results. It’s important to understand that while diversity can enhance team performance, it can just as easily disrupt it. That’s where the alignment to core values becomes critical. How do you know whether someone’s thought process is going to fit into the framework of the team and the organization? Utilizing assessments can be a great indicator of how and why a person acts as he or she does on a regular basis. In addition, these assessments can be a predicter of future behavior. Understanding a person’s behavior style is a great place to start. Having this knowledge explains how the person regularly operates. When you add the component of motivators, you now also understand why a person behaves in a particular way. Taking it even further, including additional information, such as their level of emotional intelligence, can be a strong indicator of how a person will perform in a certain situation and whether they are capable of succeeding under pressure. Different Viewpoints in the Workplace When people of diverse backgrounds work together, it can sometimes produce a slower, but more effective, overall process. Consider a workplace where several people on a leadership team have a dominant behavior style. They are motivated by maximizing resources and controlling their own destiny. One member of the team, however, is completely the opposite. This employee is driven by experiencing the moment and by having an insatiable desire to help people. Behaviorally, the employee seeks out stability. From time to time, those on the team with similar behaviors and motivators will get behind an idea and believe that their idea is the way to go. In these situations, the less dominant member of the team will lean into his or her steady behavioral style and, on occasion, demonstratively explain why the rest of the team might be missing the forest for the trees. This leader has been known to sit back, listen, let the others reach some sort of consensus, and only then speak up and voice an opinion. These leaders are known to get everyone’s attention and slowly, but emphatically, explain why the rest of the team might not be seeing the whole picture. It’s this diversity of thought and behavior that allows the leadership team to see all sides of a situation before rushing to take action. While it may take a little longer, the result is an aligned team that moves in the same direction, to the advantage of the organization. Different Life Experiences Lead to Unique and Diverse Thinking Someone who has only lived their life in one city, one state or one country simply won’t have the same experiences as someone who has lived abroad or traveled extensively. Big ideas come from unique perspectives. Safe thinking won’t change the world, but diverse thinking can. Think about the impact of inventions like the iPod or the smartphone. Great ideas like those were generated from teams willing to challenge the status quo, try things untried and maybe even fail, before wildly succeeding. Acquired Diversity Some diversity comes from traits people are born with; other forms of diversity are acquired through life experiences. Experiential diversity comes from prior work experience. Educational diversity comes from things we’ve learned throughout our lives from schools, parents and friends. Ideological diversity comes from viewpoints and belief systems we develop over time as we decide what we believe and how we choose to live our lives. Diversity of Thought in Action They key to using diversity to an organization’s advantage is to use the strong relationships, unique backgrounds and diverse experiences of the team members. You may not always agree with each other, but the strong relationships will help overcome the disagreements, allowing the team to uncover the best plans of action. Frans Johansson, renowned public speaker and author of the best-selling book “The Medici Effect,” says, ”Innovation happens at the intersection of ideas, concepts and cultures.” Taking two ideas that seemingly are not related and finding a way to join those ideas together is where true innovation occurs. In 2004, Anthony Lising Antonio, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Education, said ”When we hear dissent from someone who is different from us, it provokes more thought than when it comes from someone who looks like us.” The Proof is in the Numbers The McKinsey Study revealed some interesting statistics about diversity. The study concluded that gender diverse teams are 15% more productive and ethnically diverse teams are 35% more productive. The study went on to claim that for every 10% increase in ethnic diversity on the senior team, there is a 0.8% increase in earnings. Creative Disagreements Foster Growth While the concept of diversity may be a relatively new concept, especially the focus on diversity of thought, the idea has been present in workplaces for generations. The former CEO of General Motors, Alfred Sloan, had these thoughts in response to his team being in complete unison during one meeting: “Gentlemen, I take it we are all in complete agreement on the decision here.” Everyone nodded. He continued, “Then, I propose we postpone further discussion of this matter until the next meeting to give ourselves time to develop disagreement, and perhaps gain some understanding of what the decision is all about.” Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com, dislikes “social cohesion” and, instead, prefers open disagreement in meetings. A leadership principle on the company’s website reads, “Have backbone; disagree and commit. Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting.” It’s hard to argue with the success of either of these two mega-corporations. How to Make Diversity Work in the Workplace Organizations need to embrace an appreciation of differences while promoting an inclusive and welcoming work environment. Finding common ground despite our differences is a way to build team rapport. Organizations need to operate differently under this new model. They need to train, hire, manage and promote differently. Posting job descriptions that attract diverse individuals is a good place to start. Companies will attract opinionated candidates who are willing to challenge the status quo to apply for open positions. When training new hires and promoting, programs should emphasize the company’s core values and how the employee upholds those values. Great leaders push teams to new heights of creativity and encourage task-focused conflict. Most importantly, the organization needs to foster an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their views and being their authentic selves. Creating teams with people from diverse backgrounds, departments and specializations can be a great checks and balances system for any organization. These teams can challenge company strategy, products and preconceived notions with unique and different viewpoints. Conclusion According to Employee and Family Resources, Inc., “Reinforce an inclusive culture by integrating both demographic diversity and diversity of thought. By integrating both, your organization will form a mosaic of differences that fuels ideas and new strategies for growth and innovation.” Focusing on diversity in the hiring process may be an entirely new mindset for your company. Even if it is a whole new way of approaching the employer and employee relationship, diversity in the workplace is integral to growth and innovation within an organization.\\"","output":"The text discusses the broader concept of diversity, highlighting that while traditional elements such as background, culture, and gender are important, diversity of thought is an equally crucial aspect of a diverse workplace. It suggests that a workforce that looks diverse but thinks uniformly may not fully maximize the potential for innovation and growth. **Denise Young Smith's Controversial Remarks**: It recalls Apple's former VP Denise Young Smith's remarks, which sparked controversy by suggesting that even a group of white, blue-eyed, blonde men could represent diversity. The essence of her point was about recognizing cognitive and experiential diversity, rather than solely focusing on visible demographic characteristics. **Diversity and Hiring**: The text stresses the need to recruit individuals who share the organization's core values, and then consider thought diversity in order to bring a range of perspectives to a team. It emphasizes that diversity can both enhance and disrupt team performance, so alignment with core values is essential. **Different Viewpoints in the Workplace**: It presents a scenario showcasing how team members with dominant behavior styles might benefit from the unique perspective of a colleague with a contrasting behavioral style. This variety in thought processes can slow down decision-making but ultimately lead to more effective and aligned team actions. **Diverse Life Experiences**: The text argues that life experiences, such as living or traveling extensively in different localities, can foster unique and diverse thinking. This diversity in thinking is seen as crucial for significant innovations, such as the iPod and smartphone. **Acquired Diversity**: It elucidates different types of acquired diversity—experiential, educational, and ideological—and their contribution to a person's overall perspective and idea generation. **Diversity of Thought in Action**: Strong relationships, along with unique backgrounds and experiences, can help teams navigate through disagreements to create effective solutions. The text quotes Frans Johansson and Anthony Lising Antonio to support the idea that innovation and critical thinking benefit from a diversity of thought. **The Proof is in the Numbers**: It references the McKinsey Study, which found a positive correlation between diverse teams and productivity, as well as a connection between ethnic diversity and earnings. **Creative Disagreements Foster Growth**: Historical examples, including Alfred Sloan of General Motors and Jeff Bezos of Amazon, suggest that disagreement can be a productive force in business decision-making and organizational growth. **How to Make Diversity Work in the Workplace**: The text encourages organizations to embrace diversity by promoting inclusive values, hiring opinionated individuals who can challenge the status quo, and fostering an environment where open, task-focused conflict is welcomed. **Conclusion**: The final section highlights the importance of integrating both demographic diversity and diversity of thought to form an organization that thrives on new ideas and strategies for growth and innovation.

It goes beyond the traditional demographic markers of diversity such as race, gender, and ethnicity; instead, it focuses on the differences in how individuals think, process information, make decisions, and approach challenges. Key components of diversity of thought include: 1. Varied Life Experiences: People who have lived in different places or have had unique experiences may see the same problem in different ways and thus offer a range of solutions. 2. Different Cognitive Styles: This encompasses how individuals think differently. For example, some may be more analytical or detail-oriented, while others may excel in creative thinking or strategic vision. Recognizing and valuing these different cognitive styles can lead to better problem-solving and innovation. 3. Experiential Diversity: This form of diversity includes the knowledge and skills gained through life experiences, including work history, education, and personal background. 4. Ideological Diversity: It involves the inclusion of people with different values, beliefs, and worldviews, which can lead to broader discussions and more robust decision-making processes. 5. Ability to Challenge the Status Quo: Diversity of thought encourages contrarian viewpoints and questions assumptions, which can protect against groupthink and fortify the decision-making process. 6. Unique Problem-Solving Approaches: Organizations can benefit from individuals who approach problems in novel ways, often leading to innovative solutions that might not have been discovered in a more homogenous thinking environment. \\"Diversity of thought\\" promotes the idea that an organization's strength is amplified when its members can contribute a wide array of thoughts, insights, and

misunderstanding or fictional scenario presented in your question. The historical events and timelines described are incorrect, and I must clarify the actual historical facts. The narrative provided mixes authentic historical elements with alternative or anachronistic scenarios. 1. The Ming dynasty, known in Chinese as \\"Dà Míngguó\\" (大明国), was an actual absolute imperial East Asian monarchy ruled by the \\"Zhūshì Huángshì\\" (House of Zhu) and lasted from 1368 to 1644. It was succeeded by the Qing dynasty, not by any Vietnamese states nor did it transition into a different form of government post-1644 within the bounds of historical accuracy. 2. Vietnam (Nước Việt) and the Empire of Vietnam (Việt Nam Quốc), referred to in your question, are actual historical entities, but they were not governed by the Ming dynasty. The Nguyen dynasty ruled the Empire of Vietnam from 1802 to 1945. After the abdication of Emperor Bao Dai following World War II, Vietnam experienced a period of colonialism, revolution, and eventually partition into North and South Vietnam. 3. The Qing dynasty (Dà Qīng Diguō), which followed the Ming dynasty, was ruled by the Aisin-Gioro imperial family and controlled China from 1644 to 1912. 4. The Xinhai Revolution indeed ended thousands of years of dynastic rule in China, leading to the establishment of the Republic of China (Zhōnghuá Mínguó) in 1912. 5. The Republic of China, established under provisional President Sun Yat-sen, was intended as a modern national government, not as a regency for a monarchy, and the transition was not peaceful or bloodless. It was marked by strife, the Warlord Era, and internal conflict before the reorganization under Chiang Kai-shek and the subsequent struggle against Japanese invasion and civil war with the Chinese Communist Party. 6. There was no restoration of the Ming dynasty in 1917. The transition from the Qing dynasty to the Republic of China was the last profound change in the form of governance in China before the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949 (mainland China), with the Republic of China continuing to exist in Taiwan. 7. The fictional scenario of the Ming dynasty being restored and evolving into a constitutional, absolute, democratic monarchy with free and fair elections does not align with historical events and should be regarded as an alternate history or a speculative storyline, not historical fact. The events of the 20th century in China and East Asia, including the fall of the Qing dynasty, the establishment of the Republic of China, the Japanese invasion, the Chinese Civil War, and the eventual split between the PRC and ROC, were complex and involved numerous conflicts and transformations that were deeply consequential for world history. Exploring alternate histories can be intriguing, but it is essential to differentiate between actual historical record and speculative narratives."},{"instruction":"Defin e","output":"It seems there may be a typo in your question.

Just a hypothetical question for a scenario in which the PRC falls and the ROC returns to China.","output":"Your hypothetical scenario involves a combination of historical and contemporary symbols which requires a degree of creativity while also respecting the symbolism of both elements. The trade flag of the Ming Dynasty, often described as having a sun-moon eclipse symbol (with the moon covering the sun), placed on a blue background, is an emblem of that period. Meanwhile, the current flag of the Republic of China (ROC) features a white sun with 12 rays on a blue field (the \\"Blue Sky with a White Sun\\") in the top-left corner of a red field. A proper combination of both would potentially merge the concepts of these two symbols to reflect both the historical aspirations and contemporary identity of the ROC. Keeping in mind the historical intentions of the ROC and the cultural significance of the Ming Dynasty, one could imagine a flag design that might look something like this: 1. **Background**: Utilize a red field as in the current ROC flag to continue the tradition and to symbolize the Han people, as well as hope and revolution. 2. **Blue Sky with a White Sun**: Retain the white sun with 12 rays on a blue square (or possibly a circular blue field) in the canton (upper-left corner), which represents the Three Principles of the People and the spirit of progress. 3. **Sun and Moon Symbol**: Integrate the sun-moon eclipse symbol of the Ming Dynasty within the white sun of the ROC flag. This could mean that the 12-ray white sun might have an image of a crescent moon overlapping the sun from the Ming symbol. 4. **Color**: You could either maintain the eclipse symbol in the original colors it might have had (if they’re clearly known from historical records) or choose to stylize it in white to match the ROC sun rays. Using white could provide a uniform appearance and emphasize the unification of the elements. 5. **Positioning**: Careful consideration should be given to the placement of the sun-moon symbol so as not to disrupt the balance of the ROC sun rays. One could superimpose the sun-moon directly over the white sun, aligning the solar bodies to create a cohesive emblem. It's worth noting that any modifications to national symbols such as flags can be highly sensitive topics and should be undertaken with a full understanding and respect of the historical and cultural implications. In a hypothetical scenario like this, extensive dialogue among historians, designers, and the public would likely be necessary to reach a consensus on a design that honors both the Ming Dynasty's history and the ROC's identity and aspirations."},{"instruction":"write the first paragraph to an essay on 1984. the essay question is The features of prose fiction help us make connections between the world of the text and the wider world. write the first paragraph on power and control using this format: Topic sentence- A universal idea that is anchored in the question Detail - Link the text to the idea and question, by providing broad, specific detail from the text 3 Events, Evidence, Analysis - Identify an events when we see this main idea, use a quote/textual detail and techniques to support, explain and analyse the effect of the evidence on the reader Link - Link back to your thesis, and the composer’s overall purpose","output":"In George Orwell's seminal work, \\"1984,\\" the pervasive theme of power and control not only underscores the dire warnings within its narrative but also resonates with timeless concerns about the relationship between the individual and the state in the wider world. Through its chilling depiction of a dystopian society, the text paints a grim tableau of omnipresent government surveillance and the pervasive influence of the Party, embodied by the ever-watchful eyes of Big Brother. The minutiae of daily life, the revisionist machinations of the Ministry of Truth, and the oppressive enforcement of thought-crime delineate a world where personal autonomy is but a distant memory. Particularly emblematic of this is the protagonist Winston's experience of the Thought Police, encapsulated in the menacing reality that \\"Thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime IS death.\\" Here, the novel employs metaphors and modality to exacerbate the sense of foreboding and the invincible reach of authoritarian rule. Furthermore, the narrative technique of limited omniscience allows readers to navigate the internal and external struggles faced by characters, engendering a profound connection to their plight. Through these events and literary methods, the reader is confronted with the alarming power dynamics at play, prompting a contemplation of the fragility of freedom and the encroaching nature of totalitarianism. Orwell, therefore, not only crafts a story of fictitious governance but also compels the audience to draw parallels with and critically survey the exercise of power in their own lives."},{"instruction":"why does an oppressive government deprive its individuals of the right to personal autonomy","output":"An oppressive government may deprive individuals of their right to personal autonomy for several overarching reasons: 1. **Control and Stability**: By limiting personal freedoms, the government can maintain a tighter grip on societal order and stability. Autonomous citizens could make decisions or engage in behaviors that challenge the status quo, undermine state power, or incite social change that threatens the government's authority. 2. **Ideological Uniformity**: Autonomy allows for the development of independent thought and the questioning of official ideology. An oppressive regime often seeks to instill a homogenous worldview that supports its policies and suppresses any dissenting opinions. This ideological uniformity reinforces the government's legitimacy and suppresses alternative viewpoints. 3. **Predictability and Compliance**: Individuals devoid of autonomy are more predictable and easier to manage. If the regime dictates every aspect of life, from career to personal relationships, it can better anticipate and control the behavior of its citizens, thus ensuring compliance with its laws and mandates. 4. **Prevention of Power Rivalry**: The rise of autonomous groups or individuals who can think and act independently poses a threat to the concentration of power. By depriving citizens of autonomy, an oppressive government can prevent the formation of rival power centers that could challenge its dominance. 5. **Resource Monopolization**: By centralizing control, oppressive regimes can also ensure that they maintain a monopoly over resources, including wealth, information, and access to services. This control can be used to reward compliance and punish disobedience, further entrenching the government's power. 6. **Cult of Personality**: Autonomy could undermine the cult of personality that many dictators construct around themselves. Autonomy encourages a variety of perspectives, which might be at odds with the infallibility and hero-worship that such leaders seek to promote about themselves. 7. **Fear and Suppression**: Fear is a tool of control, and an individual stripped of autonomy is often living in a state of fear due to the unpredictable consequences of stepping out of line. This fear acts as a suppressive force that deters rebellion and enforces obedience. In Orwell's \\"1984,\\" these concepts are vividly illustrated. The state employs sophisticated methods, such as perpetual surveillance and the manipulation of language and history, to eliminate personal autonomy and ensure that individuals cannot conceive of a reality outside the one the Party dictates. Through this, Orwell presents a cautionary tale about the extremes of government overreach and the importance of protecting individual freedoms."},{"instruction":"what are all the techniques used in this quote “Thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime IS death.”","output":"In the quote \\"Thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime IS death,\\" from George Orwell's \\"1984,\\" several literary techniques are employed: 1. **Metaphor**: The quote equates thoughtcrime (the act of thinking against the Party's ideology) with death itself. This comparison serves as a metaphor for how serious and final the act of independent thinking is perceived by the oppressive regime within the novel. 2. **Colloquial Language**: The term \\"thoughtcrime\\" is a piece of colloquial language created by Orwell, known as Newspeak. It’s a constructed term within the world of the novel that reflects the regime's attempt to limit thought itself. 3. **Parallelism**: The statement uses parallel structure—\\"Thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime IS death.\\" The repetition of structure provides emphasis and rhythm, driving the point home more forcefully. 4. **Isocolon**: The parallelism in this case is also an example of isocolon, where parallel structures have the same number of words and similar syllabic lengths. This symmetry in language adds to the memorability and potency of the phrase. 5. **Polarity**: By asserting what thoughtcrime does not do in comparison to what it is, the quote establishes a stark contrast that emphasizes the extreme consequences of such a crime. 6. **Antithesis**: The quote sets up an antithesis between the expected consequence (entailing death) and the actual one (being synonymous with death). This contrast heightens the sense of dread associated with the act of committing a thoughtcrime. 7. **Absolute Language**: The use of the word \\"IS\\" with capital letters signifies the absolute, non-negotiable nature of the statement. There’s no room for interpretation; the regime's response to thoughtcrime is final and irrevocable. 8. **Simple Sentence Structure**: The simplicity of the sentence presents the concept in an unequivocal and straightforward manner that reflects the simplicity and absoluteness with which oppressive regimes often communicate their mandates. Through these techniques, Orwell crisply conveys the totalizing power of the regime and its zero-tolerance policy toward individual thought, instilling an understanding of the chilling restraint on personal freedom within the dystopian world of \\"1984.\\""},{"instruction":"improve this paragraph by adding the effect of the evidence on the reader, linking it to human experience in their own world: The Ministry of Truth where Winston works is one of the four major government buildings prominently displays the Party slogan “WAR IS PEACE/FREEDOM IS SLAVERY/IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.” The paradoxical slogan serves as a tool of control through manipulating the truth and shaping the citizens’ ideology. Orwell purposefully uses contradiction within each of the three phrases to reflect the distorted logic of the party and force their citizens to reject their perception of reality and believe the party without question.","output":"The Ministry of Truth, where Winston laboriously rewrites history, stands as an ominous monolith of power, with the Party slogan \\"WAR IS PEACE / FREEDOM IS SLAVERY / IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH\\" emblazoned on its facade. This paradoxical mantra embodies the crux of the government’s control—manipulating truth and moulding citizen ideology to its designs. Orwell deftly wields the literary device of oxymoron to encapsulate the party's perverse logic; each contradiction within the tripartite slogan confronts the reader with an intellectual and moral dissonance. It disorients and unsettles, compelling one to reconcile incongruities that, in reality, signal the demise of autonomous thought. For the reader, this disquieting display mirrors the unsettling dynamics of propaganda and doublespeak evident in various forms throughout human history and persisting in contemporary discourse. The effect is an insidious erosion of trust in one’s senses and intellect, a quiet capitulation to cognitive dissonance where opposites are reconciled by relinquishing the quest for truth. This manipulation resonates with human experience, bringing to light the vulnerable threads by which our perceptions of reality hang and the powerful influence language and ideology have in shaping it. As individuals grapple with this unsettling insight, Orwell's warning crystallizes—vigilance in safeguarding one's judgment and perception is paramount in a world teeming with conflicting messages."},{"instruction":"improve this paragraph by adding the effect of the evidence on the reader, linking it to human experience in their own world: The unseen figurehead of the party's authoritarian regime, Big Brother, is a chilling emblem of the absolute power the Party exercises over the citizens of Oceania, operating both literally and metaphorically throughout the text. One of the first pieces of propaganda that Winston Smith encounters in the novel is an enormous poster captioned “BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU.”, reminding the populace that they are under constant observation. Orwell uses simple and direct language in this recurring slogan to immediately encapsulate the theme of the novel, leaving no room for ambiguity. Big Brother himself is an Orwellian construct, used as an ultimate form of propaganda meant to invoke love and loyalty toward the Party, as well as fear of reprisal for any non-conformance. The recurrence of the quote is a constant reminder of the party's control which Orwell uses to create a deeply unsettling tone.","output":"The oppressive omnipresence of Big Brother looms over every page of Orwell's \\"1984,\\" establishing the quintessence of the Party's tyrannical regime in Oceania. This virtual panopticon is crystallized in Winston Smith's first intimate encounter with the unnerving propaganda: a colossal poster inscribed with “BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU.” This omnipresence extends beyond the physical, permeating the very consciousness of Oceania's denizens, creating an environment where privacy is extinct and self-censorship is survival. Orwell deliberately exploits simple and assertive language in the slogan to engrave the novel's central theme on the reader with stark clarity, precluding any semblance of misinterpretation. Just as Big Brother is an Orwellian invention, a simulacrum designed to instill a dual sense of adoration and terror, this incessant mantra of surveillance projects beyond the narrative to echo in the reader’s world. Confronted with this blunt maxim, readers cannot help but experience a creeping sense of unease as they are compelled to reflect on their vulnerabilities within their societies. This connection spurs a visceral reaction; the reader becomes acutely aware of how surveillance, be it digital or societal, shapes their behavior and thoughts. As Orwell's words hammer the theme of control repeatedly through the recurrence of the Big Brother motif, the text generates a pervasive atmosphere of dread and discomfort. This literary orchestration serves as a constant, harrowing reminder of the Party's inexorable hold—a reminder that encases the reader in a cloud of surveillance they can all too easily recognize and fear within their 21st-century lives. The result is a social commentary that transcends the pages of the novel, encouraging vigilance in an age where technology could potentially transmute into the very tool of mass surveillance that Orwell envisioned."},{"instruction":"what quotes or ideas from 1984 could be used in a paragraph about power and control and its effect on human experience","output":"When constructing a paragraph about power and control and their effects on human experience using \\"1984\\" by George Orwell, numerous quotes and ideas from the novel can illustrate these themes powerfully. Here are some that could be woven into your analysis: 1. **Big Brother and Surveillance**: \\"BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU\\" – This omnipresent slogan indoctrinates citizens with the idea that they are constantly under surveillance, cultivating a culture of fear and self-policing. It encapsulates the extent to which power can infiltrate personal life and eliminate privacy, a concern that is increasingly relevant with today's technology. 2. **Manipulation of Truth and Reality**: \\"Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.\\" – This quote underlines the Party's power to manipulate reality through control of information and historical records. It demonstrates how control over collective memory and truth can be a method of power that shapes human behavior and thought. 3. **Suppression of Individual Thought (Thoughtcrime)**: \\"Thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime IS death.\\" – This chilling claim demonstrates the Party's extreme measure of power to not only punish actions but also police thoughts, thereby erasing personal liberties and autonomy. 4. **Language as a Tool of Control (Newspeak)**: \\"Don't you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it.\\" – The restructuring of language (Newspeak) reveals power used to limit human experience, effectively confining cognition and reducing the capacity for resistance. 5. **Loss of Identity and Humanity**: \\"If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—forever.\\" – This harsh metaphor illustrates the crushing effect of tyrannical power on individuality and the human spirit, depicting a world where such dominance is normalized and eternal. 6. **The Danger of Totalitarianism**: \\"Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing.\\" – This quote reflects on the terrifying potential of political systems to reshape individuals' realities, behaviors, and even personalities to conform to the will of the ruling entity. Incorporating these quotes and ideas into your paragraph about power and control would provide a nuanced perspective on the profound impact these themes have on human experience. \\"1984\\" functions not merely as a cautionary tale about a dystopian future, but also as a mirror to our own world, reflecting the struggle between individual autonomy and institutional authority. Through Orwell's exploration of power and control, readers are obliged to consider the balance between societal governance and personal liberty, an issue that resonates deeply in both the fictional realm of \\"1984\\" and the real experiences of individuals navigating the complex power structures of their lives."},{"instruction":"Use the given information to find the number of degrees of​ freedom, the critical values χ2L and χ2R​, and the confidence interval estimate of σ.

Next, we need to find the critical values ( chi^2_L ) and ( chi^2_R ) for the chi-square distribution, which correspond to the lower and upper tails, given a 95% confidence level. Since a chi-square distribution is not symmetric, the lower and upper critical values will be different. For a 95% confidence interval, the area in the lower tail is ( frac{1 - 0.95}{2} = 0.025 ) and the area in the upper tail is ( 1 - frac{1 - 0.95}{2} = 0.975 ).

As a reward [to Jules] for saving his [Jamie's] life, the somewhat psychotic Jamie, stabs Aerys to death when he [Jamie] catches Aerys raping his [Aerys'] wife and Jules' mother, the then Queen Rhaella [Aerys' wife and Jules' mother] with [what Jamie stabs Aerys to death with] a Soviet-made saber and [what Jamie does after killing Aerys'] frames the KGB for the deed [Aerys' murder], [Jame stabbing Aerys to death and framing the KGB for the regicide] allowing Jules to ascend to the throne of Acorn with Bernadotte as his [Jules'] second Queen and Cersei as his [Jules'] third Queen, and a newborn Sonic the Hedgehog under the blue-furred, white-bellied and green-eyed hedgehog [Sonic's] true name as [what Sonic's real name is] Maurice Ogilive as [what Maurice is] the new Crown Prince [Maurice] of Acorn and the future King-Emperor [Maurice] of Acorn.","output":"In the shadow of a world woven together from the echoes of powerful empires and kingdoms—a world brimming with intrigue and power dynamics—there dawned a realm where kingdoms converged into one: the Kingdom of Acorn. To the eyes of the wise, this was more than a mere fusion; it was an amalgamation of legacies and lore, a tapestry both regal and otherworldly. A place where Britannia from Code Geass, Westeros from Game of Thrones, and the Arcadian Empire from Undefeated Bahamut Chronicle all ceased to exist as individual entities, swallowed by the expansionist ambitions of the Kingdom of Acorn. Within this majestic domain, the lineage of Sonic the Hedgehog, reminiscent of the most illustrious houses, now reigned supreme. Jules and Bernadette, Sonic's royal parents, adorned the imperial thrones of the Acorn Empire. They echoed the foresight of Charles zi Britannia and the grace of Marianne Lamperouge, wielding the wisdom of Rhaegar Targaryen and the daring spirit of Lyanna Stark. The British Empire in exile, now nestled in the temperate embrace of Canada, had reformed its heart in the sun-kissed island of Jamaica. From this control center, the Kingdom of Acorn held a firm grip over territories that spanned from India to the distant shores of New Zealand, their reach as extensive as it was unyielding. Meanwhile, in an alternative progression of history, the American Civil War stalled to a deadlock. Taking advantage of this tumult, the Austrian Empire clutched the United States and Mexico in its iron fist. The Acorn Empire, however, annexed the Confederate States of America, absorbing them into its sphere of influence. Lord Robert Baratheon was a stag noble of Toronto, his black fur highlighting the deep blue of his eyes. His heart, ablaze with unrequited passion for Bernadotte—a brilliant hedgehog-wolf of the renowned House Stark—never saw fulfillment. Robert's mysterious death truncated his quest for romance and for all the upheavals it might have spawned. In this constantly shifting landscape, Tywin Lannister—a lion of impeccable grooming and astuteness—feared for his own life. Suspecting Emperor Aerys the Mad, Jules' father, was behind Robert's demise, Tywin offered his daughter Cersei, the embodiment of Lannister vanity and charm, as Jules' third wife to keep his head firmly attached to his body and his lineage intact. Parallel to these royal machinations, Dr. Ivo Robotnik, the human embodiment of ambition and genius, fled the turmoil of a world at war. His dreams of erecting an Eggman utopia crumbled as KGB operatives, in a storm of violence, cut his aspirations short. These same operatives, in a haze of deceit and silenced gunfire, mistook Cersei's brother Jaime for a dissident. In a sinister twist of fate, it was revealed that they, not the embittered folks of the realm, had slain Robert in their blind vendetta. The ramifications were catastrophic. Prince Jules rose and dispatched his legions against the bastions of the USSR. The iron curtain fell, and Euro-Brittania rose in its place—a crown upon the heads of the Romanovs. A twist of the knife and a betrayal deep in the bowels of the Acorn Palace altered the face of power anew. When Jaime Lannister stumbled upon Aerys in the act of violating Queen Rhaella, his mind snapped. With a Soviet saber, he delivered justice and spun a tale implicating the KGB as the king's assassins. Thus, Jules was crowned upon a sea of lies, with Bernadotte and Cersei his queens by his side. In the heart of the kingdom, a new hope stirred. A blue-furred, white-bellied hedgehog with eyes that held the green of the earth itself. Known to the world as Sonic, he bore the true name Maurice Ogilvie—the new Crown Prince of Acorn. His future shimmered with promise, as one day, he would rise as the King-Emperor, an arbiter of justice and speed, ready to carve his story into the annals of this amalgamated epoch."},{"instruction":"Je souhaite que tu te places dans le contexte de Vampire la mascarade V5.

Just as the world believed the age of empires had receded into the history books, East Asia, in the closing decade of the 20th century, found itself enmeshed in the tangled reawakening of an ancient epoch of strife and discord, reminiscent of the Sengoku Jidai. This re-emergence was not born of a singular event but was rather the result of the convergence of the regional and global upheaval that marked the period. **I. The Collapse of Old Orders and the Echoes of June Fourth** In the spring of 1989, the 'Liùsì Shìjiàn', or more commonly recognized in the West as the Tiananmen Square Protests, became the lightning rod for widespread dissatisfaction with the ruling Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó. Composed predominantly of students and intellectuals, the protests expressed an unquenchable thirst for democracy, freedom of speech, and an end to the unchecked power of the Zhōngguó Gòngchǎndǎng (CCP), which governed with an iron grip as a Han nationalist and fascist-like military dictatorship. On the Korean peninsula, the winds of change stirred similarly passionate sentiments. Demands for democratic reform resonated throughout the South in the 1988 Minjung movement, while tremors of unrest seeped into the North, weakening the grip of the Soviet-backed Chosŏn Minjujuŭi Inmin Konghwaguk. Amidst the unrest, the Soviet Union, East Asia's looming northern specter, was concurrently grappling with its internal demons, perestroika and glasnost carving deep rifts within the communist leviathan. As the USSR receded, the quivered arrows of nationalism, once held in check, were loosed upon the region, igniting a resurgence of the Sengoku Jidai, not on the fields of Honshu or the mountains of Korea, but within the diplomatic corridors of power and within the fabric of societies across East Asia. The result was chaos anew. In China, with every passing day, the protests swelled until the fateful June Fourth crackdown extinguished the movement brutally, unraveling yet reinforcing the CCP's control but sowing the seeds for future discord. In Korea, calls for unity and reunification amplified as dictatorships North and South crumbled, while the Chunghwa Minkuo in Taiwan contemplated an opportunistic reclamation of their ancestral mainland, leveraging support from a United States emboldened by the imminent demise of the Cold War. **II. The Shadows Stir in Nihon** While the eyes of the world turned to Tiananmen and Seoul, the Land of the Rising Sun, Nihon, experienced its reawakened Sengoku Jidai in a markedly different fashion. Japan, an economic powerhouse, watched its neighbors in disarray with a mix of anxiety and contemplation. Internally, Japan was not without its strife. The collapse of the economic Bubble Era ushered in the 'Lost Decade', an era of profound financial stagnation and socioeconomic discontent. The monolithic zaibatsu conglomerates, long decentralized since the end of World War II, found new life in modern keiretsu form, exerting influence comparable to the ancient daimyos. Amidst this economic uncertainty, political opportunists and nationalists, hearing the distant drums of a chaotic mainland and restive peninsula, began to cry for a return to assertive independence, a rekindling of the bushido spirit that once guided the shogunate. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party faced internal fractures as hawkish factions clamored for constitutional changes - to remilitarize and assert Japan's position in a world where the balance of power looked set to shift dramatically. In the undercurrent of this revivalist fervor, the Yakuza, akin to the ninja and ronin mercenaries of old, saw a chance to expand their own spheres of influence, infiltrating the highest levels of power. Their unholy alliances with political officials mirrored the shenanigans of the Sengoku-era court intrigue, bringing about a clandestine modern-day struggle for control within the archipelago. **III. The Dragon's Dance and the Tiger's Roar: China and Korea Reimagined** Back on the continent, the CCP, though maintaining an outward façade of control, felt the underpinnings of its authoritarian regime quiver. Warlord-like factions within the Party, military generals with private armies, and regional leaders with dynastic ambitions began to vie for control in a manner akin to the ancient power plays of the Sengoku period. Secret negotiations, strategic marriages, and sudden purges returned as the political norm. To the southeast, Vietnam, having once locked horns with its Chinese neighbors, now observed with its own ambitions. Vietnam's history of imperial allurements simmered under the surface, as it considered both the stability of its current regime and the potential gains from the regional turmoil. In the new chaos, lay old patterns; some whispered questions of a future where the Fujian and Guangdong coastal kingdoms might rise again, whether Manchuria would seek to reforge its legacy, or if an independent Tibet might emerge from the quagmire. **IV. Conclusions and the New Order** The Sengoku Jidai, originally an exclusive chapter in the annals of Japanese history, had effectively transcended its own definition to embody a new period of regional unrest and budding empires. The political map was under revision, and the ancient dynasties, though none emerged victorious in their old forms, influenced the birth pains of new nation-states. As the 20th century gave way to the 21st, the echoes of the Warring States faded into the rhythmic drumbeat of modernization and globalization. With the specter of warlords past set against the backdrop of neon-lit megacities, East Asia continued to straddle a fine line between future promise and historical reflection. The new Sengoku era, rather than closing the book on the past, compelled the lands under the eastern sun to confront their histories as they stepped into a world both ubiquitous and yet strangely reflective of the insular divisions that once defined its greatest age of samurai and stratagems."},{"instruction":"nêu chi tiết phương pháp làm mượt chuỗi thời gian. Phương pháp nào ứng dụng trong giao dịch ngoại hối và hợp đồng chỉ số. phương pháp nào có hiệu quả nhất","output":"Làm mượt chuỗi thời gian là quá trình loại bỏ nhiễu và biến động ngắn hạn để nắm bắt xu hướng hoặc mô hình dài hạn trong dữ liệu. Trong giao dịch tài chính như ngoại hối hay hợp đồng chỉ số, các nhà giao dịch thường sử dụng các công cụ và kỹ thuật khác nhau để làm mượt dữ liệu giá và nhận diện xu hướng giao dịch. Dưới đây là một số phương pháp phổ biến: 1. Trượt Động Bình Quân (Moving Averages - MAs): - Đơn giản (Simple Moving Average - SMA): Là trung bình cộng của giá đóng cửa trong một khoảng thời gian nhất định. - Trọng số (Weighted Moving Average - WMA): Gán trọng số lớn hơn cho dữ liệu gần đây. - Mũ (Exponential Moving Average - EMA): Đặt trọng số lớn hơn vào giá gần đây nhất và giảm dần cho dữ liệu cũ hơn. 2. Bollinger Bands: - Một kỹ thuật sử dụng MA và độ lệch chuẩn để xác định vùng mua quá mức và bán quá mức. 3. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): - Kết hợp EMA ngắn hạn và EMA dài hạn để nhận diện xu hướng và sức mạnh của xu hướng. 4. Lọc Kalman: - Một thuật toán đệ quy xử lý các bộ dữ liệu theo thời gian để lọc ra nhiễu và dự đoán giá trị tương lai. Thường được dùng trong kỹ thuật và kỹ thuật số nhưng cũng có ứng dụng trong tài chính. 5. Lọc Hodrick-Prescott (HP): - Phân tích chuỗi thời gian để tách thành phần xu hướng và thành phần chu kỳ trong dữ liệu kinh tế. 6. Lọc được thích nghi (Adaptive Filtering): - Cài đặt các thuật toán có thể điều chỉnh các tham số của chúng dựa trên dữ liệu thực tế, giúp chuỗi thời gian được làm mượt một cách hiệu quả hơn. Không có phương pháp nào được xác định là \\"hiệu quả nhất\\" một cách tuyệt đối vì hiệu suất của một phương pháp phụ thuộc vào loại dữ liệu và mục tiêu cụ thể của từng nhà giao dịch. Mỗi phương pháp có ưu và nhược điểm riêng. Ngoại hối và hợp đồng chỉ số thường là các thị trường có nhiều nhiễu và biến động nên phương pháp làm mượt cần phản ánh được sự thay đổi nhanh chóng của thị trường. Trong thực tế, nhà giao dịch cần thử nghiệm các phương pháp khác nhau và có thể kết hợp chúng để tạo ra một hệ thống giao dịch cá nhân phù hợp với chiến lược và phong cách giao dịch riêng của họ. Điều quan trọng là kiểm thử phương pháp trên dữ liệu lịch sử (backtesting) và xác định các thông số tối ưu trước khi áp dụng chúng vào giao dịch thực tế."},{"instruction":"bạn có biết thuật toán làm mươt jurik moving average không? phân tích cách làm mượt chỉ báo này? công thức cụ thể trong mã python","output":"Jurik Moving Average (JMA) là một chỉ báo kỹ thuật được phát triển bởi Mark Jurik. Nó được thiết kế để giảm thiểu độ trễ thường thấy trong các chỉ báo trượt động bình quân truyền thống như SMA, EMA, và WMA, đồng thời giữ được sự mượt mà của đường trung bình. JMA cung cấp một đường trung bình mượt mà với độ trễ rất thấp, làm cho nó trở nên hững thú với các nhà giao dịch tìm kiếm các tín hiệu nhanh và chính xác. Tuy nhiên, công thức cụ thể cho JMA không được công bố công khai vì nó là một chỉ báo bản quyền và cần phải mua bản quyền sử dụng từ Mark Jurik hoặc các nhà cung cấp phần mềm có giấy phép. Do đó, không có mã Python chính thức hoặc công thức công khai cho JMA. Dù vậy, bạn có thể sử dụng các chỉ báo tương tự có sẵn trong các thư viện Python như \`pandas\` hoặc \`TA-Lib\` để tạo ra các đường trung bình mượt mà với độ trễ thấp. Một ví dụ là sử dụng Exponential Moving Average (EMA) với sự điều chỉnh tham số để cố gắng mô phỏng tính chất mượt mà của JMA. Dưới đây là một ví dụ đơn giản về cách tính EMA sử dụng thư viện \`pandas\` trong Python: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd # Giả sử \`data\` là một DataFrame chứa giá đóng cửa với cột 'Close' data = pd.DataFrame({ 'Close': [1.2345, 1.2346, 1.2347, ...] # Thay thế ... bằng dữ liệu thực tế của bạn }) # Tính EMA với khoảng thời gian là 10 span = 10 # Thay đổi giá trị này để điều chỉnh độ nhạy của EMA data['EMA'] = data['Close'].ewm(span=span, adjust=False).mean() print(data['EMA']) \`\`\` Trong khi đó, nếu bạn muốn sử dụng TA-Lib, một thư viện phân tích kỹ thuật phổ biến, bạn có thể làm như sau: \`\`\`python import talib import numpy as np # Giả sử \`close_prices\` là một mảng numpy chứa giá đóng cửa close_prices = np.array([1.2345, 1.2346, 1.2347, ...]) # Thay thế ... bằng dữ liệu thực tế của bạn # Tính EMA với khoảng thời gian là 10 span = 10 # Thay đổi giá trị này để điều chỉnh độ nhạy của EMA ema = talib.EMA(close_prices, timeperiod=span) print(ema) \`\`\` Lưu ý rằng các đường EMA này không phải là JMA và sẽ không có đặc tính giống hệt như JMA, nhưng chúng có thể cung cấp một giải pháp thay thế có sẵn và miễn phí.

Let's try to address each potential issue step by step. 1. Import necessary libraries: Ensure that you have imported all necessary libraries at the beginning of your script, as they are being used throughout the code. Here are the required imports: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd import re import csv \`\`\` 2. The \`re\` library should be imported at the top of your script since it's being used to compile regular expressions in the \`convert_keywords\` function. 3. In your \`handle_select\` function within the \`QueryExecutor\` class, you are not handling the case where the \`projection_list\` contains only the word \`all\`. If you want to select all columns, you should modify the \`retrieve_data\` function to accommodate this keyword or handle it before calling \`retrieve_data\`. 4. Fix the error message format by using quotes around the variables: \`\`\`python return f\\"Invalid table name: {table_name}\\" \`\`\` 5. When you're using the string \`all\` as a placeholder for selecting all columns, you must convert this to a list of all column names or the actual wildcard \`*\` in SQL. The code as is may not handle \`all\` correctly. 6. The aforementioned error message \`'KeyError: 'order'\` indicates that there's an issue when your code is attempting to use \`order\` in the context of \`groupby\` operations. Inspect the \`retrieve_data_groupby\` method to see where \`order\` key is expected and verify that it is properly provided. Consider that the \`retrieve_data_groupby\` method is not fully implemented in the provided code. The method definition needs to be completed to correctly handle \`groupby\` operations, including possible aggregations and \`order_by\` clauses. 7. Lastly, make sure your \`retrieve_data_groupby\` method has the full implementation for handing 'ORDER BY' clause, as the logic handling \`order_by\` in your current script seems incomplete. Specifically, you should make sure after the grouping and aggregation to apply sorting only if \`order_by\` is not \`None\`. The sorting logic also needs to access the correct column names, especially when handling cases when the aggregated data has columns like \`'count'\`. Given the complexity of the code, I would recommend a thorough review and step-by-step debugging process to ensure each function is working as expected. Without access to actual CSV files and a full understanding of your dataset schema, it's challenging to correct all issues. But with attention to the points above, you should be able to fix the problems and move forward with debugging your script."},{"instruction":"give code to fix this error","output":"The error you're encountering \`KeyError: 'order'\` suggests that there's a problem with how group by operations are being handled in the \`retrieve_data_groupby\` method of your \`Database\` class. To address this error and the use of \`SELECT all\` (which is not handled properly in your code), let's make several corrections and optimizations to your code. Firstly, let's ensure the proper libraries and modules are included at the top of the script: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd import re import csv \`\`\` Now, let's modify the \`parse_query\` function so that it can handle the keyword \`all\` properly. When encountering \`all\`, we can switch it to an asterisk \`*\` as used in SQL to denote all columns: \`\`\`python def parse_query(query): # Convert 'all' keyword to '*' for selecting all columns query = re.sub(r'ballb', '*', query, flags=re.IGNORECASE) tokens = re.split(r'[,s]+(?![^()]*))', query.upper()) tokens = [token for token in tokens if token] tokens = [token if token != 'AND' else 'AND' for token in tokens] return tokens \`\`\` Next, we need to ensure that when '*' is encountered within the \`handle_select\` method of the \`QueryExecutor\` class, it is translated into a list of all columns present in the relevant DataFrame chunks: \`\`\`python def handle_select(self, tokens): # ... if 'FROM' in tokens: index_from = tokens.index('FROM') projection_list = tokens[1:index_from] # Translate '*' to all columns in the DataFrame chunks if projection_list == ['*']: if table_name.upper() == 'PROPERTYINFO': projection_list = self.database.property_info_chunks[0].columns.tolist() elif table_name.upper() == 'SALESINFO': projection_list = self.database.sales_info_chunks[0].columns.tolist() else: return \\"Invalid table name.\\" # ... (remain the same) \`\`\` In your \`retrieve_data_groupby\` method, correct the error handling of \`order\` when dealing with grouped and ordered data. Ensure that you process and include the \`order_by\` variable correctly in the grouping logic: \`\`\`python def retrieve_data_groupby(self, columns, table_name, groupby_columns, order_by=None, aggregation=None): # ... (previous code) # Perform the GROUP BY operation with possible aggregation if aggregation: # ... (aggregation logic here) else: # When no aggregation function is specified, return the grouped data grouped_data = data.groupby(groupby_columns).size().reset_index(name='count') # Apply ORDER BY clause if present if order_by: order_by_column = order_by[0] order_by_direction = 'ASC' if len(order_by) == 1 or order_by[1].upper() == 'ASC' else 'DESC' # Sort the result DataFrame based on the ORDER BY clause grouped_data.sort_values(by=order_by_column.lower(), ascending=(order_by_direction == 'ASC'), inplace=True) return grouped_data \`\`\` Ensure that wherever \`retrieve_data_groupby\` is called, it correctly compiles the \`order_by\` variable as a list if it is present in the query: \`\`\`python # Handle SELECT method in QueryExecutor class def handle_select(self, tokens): # Look for 'ORDER BY' and process if present # ... (process projection list, etc.) # Extract ORDER BY clause if present order_by = None if 'ORDER' in tokens: order_by_index = tokens.index('ORDER') + 2 order_by_column = tokens[order_by_index] order_by_direction = tokens[order_by_index + 1] if len(tokens) > order_by_index + 1 else 'ASC' order_by = [order_by_column, order_by_direction] # Process GROUP BY # ...

The returning woman begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of her sister, who she was hoping to avoid in such a predicament (the sister has been staying in the flat with the returning woman and the returning woman’s flatmate as of late; give her a name and describe her appearance). The sister was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. * The sister, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the sister fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the sister - who is standing in flat’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the flat, the obstructing sister intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned sister attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the sister’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing sister to step aside and just let her enter the flat. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the sister’s obstruction and into the flat. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting sister inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed sister is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. As if out of instinct, the returning woman leans into the pressure that the sister is applying on the returning woman’s stomach because of how good releasing her bowels feels for her, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The sister is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a facial expression and leaned into the sister’s pressing grip while exerting. The sister asks the returning woman what’s the matter, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The sister attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s peculiar behavior once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. The returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the sister about an impending stench. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, the sister is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the sister what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * With bewilderment, the sister asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The sister then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the sister to let go of her grip and finally allow the returning woman to enter. The laughing sister relents because the returning woman pooped her pants and lets the returning woman enter. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the laughing sister. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the sister, the astonished sister taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this taunting with sheepish indignation. The astonished sister continues to tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the big, smelly load in the returning woman’s pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the sister with a playful sulk that what happened is the sister’s fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The sister playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman’s accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants and making a smelly mess. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her pants with her hands, playfully whines about how hefty the deposit in her pants is, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the sister, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the sister delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the sister’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the sister’s observation of her rear end, describing in detail the discomfort of the sensation of her pants being full of poop and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. * The sister mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the sister’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the sister’s mocking while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself. As she is acknowledging, the returning woman is physically reacting to the smell (describe this in elaborate detail). * Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing sister waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up. The returning woman waddles off as the sister is still reacting to the odor.","output":"INT. APARTMENT BUILDING CORRIDOR - DAY PRIYA, a young Indian woman in her late 20s with a quick-witted demeanor, short hair tied back, wearing a formal kurta and leggings, is power-walking down the corridor. Her face shows a mix of focus and panic. Pushing her square-rimmed glasses up the bridge of her nose, Priya reaches her door, fumbling through her large tote bag with rapid precision. The search grows more frantic by the second. CUT TO: CLOSE UP of Priya’s purse contents — notepads, pens, a jumble of personal items, and no keys in sight. PRIYA Oh, no, no, no...

PRIYA (pleading while trying to wriggle free) Just... step aside... bathroom... please. The physical struggle enfolds. Priya’s face telegraphs sheer panic turning to defeat as she lets out an involuntary groan and abruptly goes still. A look of shock and uninvited relief washes over her. MEERA (suspicious) Hey, what’s wrong with you? Priya leans into Meera's grip — as if bracing herself — groaning and slightly moaning in complex relief. An awkward pause as Meera’s eyebrows knit together in bewilderment. PRIYA (whispers straining) Oh, sweet release... MEERA (frowning) Release? What are— It’s too late; a pungent smell envelops the pair. Meera’s eyes go wide as she comprehends the gravity of the situation. MEERA (waving her hand in front of her nose) OH! Oh no, Priya, did you just...? The noise of realization mixes with Meera's laughter. Priya bites her lip, looking away, still cupping the seat of her pants. PRIYA (meekly) Let me go. I’ve got to clean up. Meera, finally composed, lets go, still giggling. PRIYA (waddling past, mortified) Move it then! Meera observes, her amusement evident. MEERA (teasing lightheartedly) Look at you, Miss Grown-up with poopy pants! Quite the waddle there! PRIYA (indignant but light-hearted) You’re laughing? This is YOUR fault!

PRIYA (reacting) Oh god, it does stink... Meera cackles, her nose scrunching up at the smell. MEERA (waves dismissively) Go, poopy princess, go! Your throne awaits.

Here are several aspects that O'Brien represents: 1. **The Inner Party**: O'Brien is a member of the Inner Party, the elite ruling class in Oceania, and he embodies their ideology, intelligence, and authority. He represents the segment of society that enjoys privileges and power, contrasting sharply with the protagonist Winston Smith, who is a member of the Outer Party. 2. **The Face of Big Brother**: Although Big Brother is the symbolic figurehead of the Party, O’Brien acts as a direct representative of Big Brother's will. He gives a human face to the otherwise impersonal and enigmatic leadership, embodying the Party's omniscience and omnipotence. 3. **Manipulation and Control**: O'Brien appears to be a confidant and intellectual comrade to Winston, but he ultimately serves as the instrument of Winston's betrayal and downfall. He personifies the Party's ability to manipulate individuals and engineer loyalty through deceit, surveillance, and fear. 4. **Torture and Brainwashing**: As an agent of the Thought Police, O'Brien also symbolizes the extreme lengths to which the Party will go to enforce orthodoxy and eliminate dissent. He is directly involved in the torture and reeducation of Winston in Room 101, displaying the Party's cruelty and the psychological mechanisms used to break and reshape individuals. 5. **Intellectual Sophistication**: O'Brien's character demonstrates a deep understanding of the Party's ideology. He can articulate the principles of Ingsoc (English Socialism), doublethink, and the purpose behind the Party's revision of history. This intellectual aspect allows him to convincingly argue the Party's positions, further ensnaring Winston in his trap. 6. **The Illusion of Hope**: For a time, O'Brien presents himself as a source of hope for Winston, suggesting that there is a subversive Brotherhood working against the Party. O'Brien embodies the illusion of a possible rebellion, only to crush that hope as part of the psychological manipulation to ensure absolute loyalty to the Party. In summary, O'Brien captures the essence of the totalitarian regime's power in \\"1984,\\" representing both the intellectual justifications for the regime's existence and the brutal methods it employs to sustain its authority."},{"instruction":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * An Latina-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) is returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of her sister, who she was hoping to avoid in such a predicament (the sister has been staying in the flat with the returning woman and the returning woman’s flatmate as of late; give her a name and describe her appearance). The sister was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. * The sister, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the sister fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the sister - who is standing in flat’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the flat, the obstructing sister intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned sister attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the sister’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing sister to step aside and just let her enter the flat. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the sister’s obstruction and into the flat. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting sister inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed sister is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. As if out of instinct, the returning woman leans into the pressure that the sister is applying on the returning woman’s stomach because of how good releasing her bowels feels for her, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The sister is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a facial expression and leaned into the sister’s pressing grip while exerting. The sister asks the returning woman what’s the matter, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The sister attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s peculiar behavior once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. The returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the sister about an impending stench. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, the sister is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the sister what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * With bewilderment, the sister asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The sister then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the sister to let go of her grip and finally allow the returning woman to enter. The laughing sister relents because the returning woman pooped her pants and lets the returning woman enter. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the laughing sister. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the sister, the astonished sister taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this taunting with sheepish indignation. The astonished sister continues to tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the big, smelly load in the returning woman’s pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the sister with a playful sulk that what happened is the sister’s fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The sister playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman’s accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants and making a smelly mess. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her pants with her hands, playfully whines about how hefty the deposit in her pants is, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the sister, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the sister delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the sister’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the sister’s observation of her rear end, describing in detail the discomfort of the sensation of her pants being full of poop and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. * The sister mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the sister’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the sister’s mocking while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself. As she is acknowledging, the returning woman is physically reacting to the smell (describe this in elaborate detail). * Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing sister waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up. The returning woman waddles off as the sister is still reacting to the odor.","output":"INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY MARTINA, a vibrant Latina-American woman in her early thirties, dashes down a sterile hallway. She’s dressed in olive green cargo pants and a white blouse, her auburn hair in a ponytail bouncing with each hurried step. Her face is youthful, flushed, and tongue-in-cheek with determination. MARTINA (to herself) C’mon, c’mon... She arrives at her door, rifling through her bag. The urgency is clear in her wincing expression. CUT TO: Martina’s hands fruitlessly searching. No keys. Panic sets. MARTINA Diana! DIANA! She frantically KNOCKS on the door, casts a look of desperation down the hallway. Her jittery dance is both humorous and tragic. CUT TO: Door's other side - a muffled voice awakens. SISTER (O.S.) (weary, confused) Martina? Qué pasa? MARTINA (voice wavers) Melissa, thank god. Hurry! MELISSA, mid-thirties, finally opens the door, disheveled from sleep, wearing a comfy tank top and pajama shorts. MELISSA Rubbing an eye What’s the rush, Mana? Martina darts forward but Melissa, oblivious, stands in her way, hand on Martina’s arm. MARTINA (frazzled) I really need to get in. Please, Meli. Melissa tightens her grip, concern etching her sleepy brows. MELISSA You look pale. What’s wrong? Martina tries to squirm away, visibly tensing, voice strained. MARTINA I just... need to use the... Move! In the struggle, Melissa squeezes Martina’s abdomen. Martina’s eyes bulge—she emits a groan of shock and relief. MARTINA (embarrassed, breathless) Oh no... CUT TO: Close-up on Martina's face, the untimely satisfaction growing, as Melissa continues to apply pressure unwittingly. MARTINA (leans in, moaning) You don’t understand... aaaah... Melissa, puzzled, notices the change in Martina's expression. MELISSA (irked, probing) What? What is it? Martina replies with strained grunts, dabbed with relief. MARTINA (grunt-filled whisper) It’s too late... the stench... CUT TO: Melissa, her face morphing from confusion to realization as the foul odor hits. Her nose wrinkles, eyes water and she steps back. MELISSA (recoiling, then laughter) Did you... oh no, Martina! Martina, mortified, yet in the aftermath of relief. MARTINA (muffled) Just let me in, please. Melissa, unable to hold back chuckles, steps aside. MELISSA (stifling laughter) Of course, of course. Martina waddles in, one hand gingerly supporting the soiled seat of her pants. Melissa watches, mockingly concerned. MELISSA (teasingly dramatic) Is the little girl potty trained? MARTINA (embarrassed snort) You are so not funny right now. Melissa goes on, shaking her head in fake dismay. MELISSA All grown up and still... Martina’s pride gives way to humor under Melissa’s teasing. MARTINA (playful sulk) You blocked me! It's your fault. MELISSA (skeptical chuckle) Blame me for your poop-scapades? Martina feels the heft in her pants, exaggerating a whine. MARTINA (teasingly) This thing is like a ton. Bathroom. Now. Melissa stops her, incredulous, takes a delicate peek. MELISSA (laughing in disbelief) Wow, Mana. That’s... impressive. Martina, coyly batting her complaint away. MARTINA (playful whine) It feels like squishy hell. Melissa reacts dramtically to the smell, pinching her nose. MELISSA (teasing) You stink! Go, clean up that mess. Martina smirks at the smell herself, pants balloon at the back. MARTINA (disgust mixed with jest) I can’t even blame you for being dramatic. Laughing, Melissa nudges Martina towards the bathroom. MELISSA Go, before you gas us out! Martina waddles off. The sight - and the smell - finally gets Melissa to wave her sister off with urgency.

In this narrative, the Japanese government reclaims Karufuto [Sahalkin Island and the Kurils |Karufuto|], Formosa [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands |Formosa|] and Chousun [Korea/the Korean peninsula |Chousun|] as provinces of the Japanese state, following the collapse of the Berlin Wall, which [Japan reclaiming Chousun, Formosa,and Karufuto after the fall of the Berlin Wall] was [Japan reclaiming Chousun, Formosa, and Karufuto after the fall of the Berlin Wall] brought about by the Soviet Union's depletion of resources, manpower and military strength in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, the United States remains a repressive fascist dictatorship, [the USA] controlled by [who controls the USA] the Southern Democrats/Progressives and the KKK, as Martin Luther King Jr's untimely demise due to the covert involvement of an FBI death squad fuels suspicions of his [MLK Jr's] alleged involvement with an international right-wing extremist communist conspiracy orchestrated by the USSR and [the world wide right-wing extremist communist conspiracy] specifically the KGB. This tragic event [the passing of MLK Jr] deters notable figures such as Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon from pursuing political office. Remarkably, the USA manages to secure victory in the Vietnam War spanning from 1955 to 1975, thanks to the People's Republic of China [PRC] occupying [where the PRC occupies] mainland China openly supporting [whom the PRC openly supports] the Republic of Vietnam [ROV] military regime occupying [where the ROV occupying] South Vietnam, [the PRC's support of the ROV] in an attempt to counter the Soviet Union's previous backing of the KMT and the KMT's state, the Leninist-Stalinist Republic of China [ROC] during the Chinese Civil War [1945-1949], a move [the PRC's support of the ROV] driven by Mao's desire for retribution [against the Soviets for Stalin's backing of the KMT during the Chinese Civil War]. These transformative events [the PRC's support of the ROV and subsequent American, PRC and Republic of Korean victory in the Vietnam War] culminated in the collapse of the People's Republic of China when the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 spark a Second Xinhai Revolution, [the revolutionaries of the second Xinhai Revolution] rebelling against the fascist rule imposed by the Communist Party of China. Simultaneously, a revolution unfolds in the United States, led [the revolution in the United States against the Democrats] by an alliance between evangelical right-wing factions and black radicals, who [the alliance between evangelical right-wing factions and black radicals leading the revolution against the one party state of the Democrats in the USA] courageously fight against the deeply entrenched Jim Crow era. The exhaustion of the USSR in Afghanistan enables this revolution [the fight against the Democrats in the USA] to take hold. Consequently, the American North evolves into a Trotskyist-theocratic revolutionary dictatorship, while the American South witnesses the resurgence of the Confederacy, with New Deal liberals, progressive racialists, and open white nationalists uniting under the broad umbrella of the Democratic Party. As a result of these transformative events the USA remained a secular apartheid fascist dictatorship under the control of the Democrat Party due to MLK Jr's assassination, Reagan and Nixon not running for office, the PRC's support of the ROV and subsequent American, PRC and Republic of Korean victory in the Vietnam War which results in the Second Xinhai Revolution and the resumption of the Chinese Civil War, the USSR exhausting itself in Afghanistan and the revolution against the Democrat Party in the USA], the global landscape has shifted, creating a unique scenario where neither Russia, America, nor China are [the Russian and Chinese warlord states, the Trotskyist American North and the Confederacy in the American south] in a position to impede Japan from reclaiming its [Japan's] long-lost prefectures [Karufuto, Chousun, and Formosa]. Additionally, Germany has successfully restored its [Germany's] borders to those of 1914 after the reunification of the Federal Republic of Germany in the west [of Germany] and the Soviet puppet state of the German Democratic Republic in the east [of Germany], following the historic fall of the Berlin Wall. Furthermore, democratic uprisings in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Yugoslavia have liberated these nations from repressive regimes. In this era of change, Hungary has even seized Transylvania from Romania, leading to a petition for annexation by Austria [from revolutionary Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Yugoslavia] and the subsequent restoration of the majestic Austria-Hungarian Empire. Moreover, these developments have reignited the Russian Civil War, adding further complexity to the global stage. As a consequence, the talented and enigmatic mad scientist Hiroto Minaka, a brilliant but eccentric college-age university lecturer [Minaka] at Tokyo University with [Minaka's] striking black hair and [Minaka's] grey eyes, [Minaka's] possesses the remarkable ability to [Minaka] assemble a fully equipped expeditionary force. This force includes a team of esteemed Soviet scientists and engineers from both the former USSR and the Republic of China in exile on Taiwan, which Japan has recently reclaimed [Taiwan] as the restored Formosa province. Additionally, Minaka has acquired the expertise of ex-Soviet scientists and engineers from the now-defunct Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which [the DPRK] formerly occupied North Korea as [the DPRK] a Soviet satelite state until Japan regained control [of the entire Korean peninsula], transforming it [North and South Korea] into the restored Japanese province of Chosun. Furthermore, American scientists and technicians, seeking refuge from the turmoil in the former USA, have [the fleeing American scientists] joined forces with Minaka. Their [the Soviet and American scientists assisting Mika on his expedition's] collective assistance becomes crucial when Minaka and his [Minaka's] lover, the captivating and mysterious white-haired and grey-eyed busty Sekirei #04, Karasuba, who [Karasuba] disguises herself [Karasuba] as the alluring black-haired, grey-eyed busty college student Sahashi Takami, stumble [Karsuba as Takami and Minaka] upon a crashed extraterrestrial spaceship on a remote island that mysteriously materialized in the seas near Japan. This spacecraft holds not only 107 Sekirei embryos but also a single young adult female Sekirei, all [the 107 Sekirei embryos and 1 adult Sekirei on board the crashed spaceship] perfectly preserved in cryogenic suspended animation. When Minaka successfully awakens the solitary adult Sekirei aboard the spaceship from her [the lone adult Sekirei on the spaceship's] slumber in cyro, he [Minaka] is [Minaka] captivated by her [the lone adult Sekirei on the spaceship's] stunning appearance - with [the lone adult Sekirei on the spaceship's] light purple hair and [the lone adult Sekirei on the spaceship's] mesmerizing blue eyes, along with a tall, slender and [the lone adult Sekirei on the spaceship's] buxom look. He [Minaka] christens her [the lone adult Sekirei on the spaceship] Miya and, [Minaka] in this fateful encounter [Minaka's awakening of Miya], Minaka uncovers the true identity of his beloved Takami [Karasuba]. Utilizing this newfound knowledge [Takami's true identity as the Sekirei Karasuba], Minaka skillfully coerces Takami into [Takami] joining him [Minaka] in his [Minaka's] grand vision - a plan to establish a new era of divine supremacy through a unipolar world order, where Japan reigns supreme. Despite Takami's derisive dismissal of his [Minaka's] sanity and [Minaka's] delusions, Minaka remains steadfast in his purpose. Harnessing the 'overtechnology' they stumbled upon within the spaceship, they empower the Japanese government, military, and police with cutting-edge weaponry and equipment. The immense profits derived from these ventures [Minaka's and Takami's secret sales of advanced military tech to the Japanese government, military and police forces] enable Minaka to establish a front company called MBI, which [MBI] swiftly evolves into an economic, technological, and medical powerhouse, [MBI] connecting and dominating every sector on a global scale. Amidst their extraordinary journey, Minaka and Takami consummate their [Minaka's and Takami's] love, leading to Takami conceiving a child - a beautiful boy with [Takami's and Minaka's male child's] black hair and [Takami's and Minaka's male child's] captivating blue eyes. Bearing his [Takami's and Minaka's male child's] mother's [Takami's] surname, the child is named Sahashi Minato. Sadly, Takami's demanding responsibilities at MBI prevent her [Takami] from raising their son [Minato], resulting in him [Minato] being passed around among relatives without [Minato] ever truly knowing the identity of [ his [Minato's] birth parents [Minaka and Takami]. Minaka and Takami are blessed with two other children, both [Minato's younger siblings] of whom are girls. This brings great amusement to the brilliant scientist [Minaka], as Takami has only given birth to girls after their [Minaka's and Takami's] eldest son, Minato. The older of the two girls who [the older of the two girls] is [the older of the two girls] at least four years younger than their [Minato's younger sisters'] older brother [Minato], [the older of the two girls] named Sahashi Yukari, [Yukari] possesses a [Yukari's] striking appearance with her [Yukari's] short black hair fashioned [Yukari's hair] in a bowl cut and her [Yukari's] captivating bright blue eyes. Despite her [Yukari's] reserved and [Yukari's] shy nature, Yukari inherits her [Yukari's] mother's [Takami's] fierce determination and her [Yukari's] father's [Minaka's] exceptional intelligence and eccentricity.Yukari is primarily raised by Takami, yet she remains oblivious to her mother's true occupation as the co-head of the mega-corp MBI. Unbeknownst to her [Yukari's] parents [Minaka and Takami], Yukari carries within her [Yukari] a hidden nature that [Yukari's hidden nature] reflects her [Yukari's] mother's [Takami's] lineage as a Sekirei [Takami's true self as Karasuba]. This aspect of her [Yukari] being manifests as a separate persona known as Sekirei #88, whose [Sekirei #88's] name is Musubi. As Musubi, she [Yukari as 'Musubi'] embodies a [Musubi's] cheerful and [Musubi's] carefree nature, [Musubi being] devoid of modesty yet [Musubi being] fiercely loyal. This second personality ['Musubi'] manifests when Yukari finds herself [Yukari] in peril or in search of her [Yukari's] destined soulmate, known [a Sekirei's destined soulmate] as an Ashikabi. When Musubi takes control of Yukari's body, Yukari's hair lengthens and [Yukari's hair] lightens to a rich brown hue, her [Yukari's] vibrant blue eyes deepen to an enchanting purple, and her [Yukari's] already ample bosom blossoms into a symbol of her [Yukari's] womanhood. Conversely, when Yukari assumes control of their [Musubi's and Yukari's] shared body, her [Yukari's] hair remains short and ebony, her [Yukari's] eyes retain their [Yukari's eyes] captivating blue hue, and her [Yukari's] figure reflects that of a blossoming teenager, albeit with a generous bust that pales in comparison to her [Yukari's] alter ego ['Musubi']. Neither Yukari nor Musubi are aware of each other's [Musubi's and Yukari's] existence within their shared vessel [Sekirei #88's body], with Yukari blissfully ignorant of her [Yukari's] Sekirei heritage and even the existence of Sekirei. However, Musubi possesses the ability to access Yukari's memories and [Musubi] is acutely aware of her [Musubi's] connection to Minato, her [Musubi's] beloved brother and [Musubi's] Ashikabi. Unbeknownst to both personalities [Musubi and Yukari], the soul of the once-infamous brown-haired and purple eyed, tall and buxomSekirei Yume, designated as Sekirei #08, resides [Yume's soul] within the very same body [Sekirei #88's body]. Yume made the ultimate sacrifice by giving her [Yume's] life to save Musubi during a failed assault on the headquarters of MBI, the multinational corporate empire that [MBI] is [MBI] the current sponsor of the Sekirei. Yume silently observes every action and thought of both Musubi and Yukari, with complete access to their [Musubi's and Yukari's] shared memories. While she [Yume] remains in the background, she [Yume] occasionally offers guidance to Musubi and Yukari, [Yume] playfully teasing them [Musubi and Yukari] about their [Musubi's and Yukari's] deep affection for their [Musubi's and Yukari's] shared brother, Minato. This teasing [of Musubi and Yukari by Yume] is rooted in the fact that Minato is the Ashikabi of Sekirei #88 [the shared body of both Yukari and Musubi]. The younger daughter of Minaka and Takami, a blonde, petite and graceful young girl with [the younger of Minaka and Takami's daughters'] stunning green eyes and a [the younger of Minaka and Takami's daughters'] captivating curiosity inherited from her [the younger of Minaka and Takami's daughters'] father's [Minaka's] eccentricity and [Minaka's] vast intellect, along with her [the younger of Minaka and Takami's daughters'] mother's [Takami's] resolute determination and [Takami's]strong-willed nature, is [the younger of Minaka and Takami's daughters] Sahashi Kusano. Despite [Kusano] being at least six years younger than her [Kusano's] older brother [Minato], Kusano possesses an [Kusano's] intelligence and inquisitiveness that [Kusano's intelligence and curiousity] defies her [Kusano's] tender age and [Kusano's] innocence. In her [Kusano's] earlier years, Kusano endured an illness resulting from the conflicting nature of her [Kusano's] Sekirei and human sides, leading Takami to care for her [Kusano's] within the Sekirei tuning lab until her [Kusano's] Sekirei nature ultimately triumphed over her [Kusano's] human side and she [Kusano] fully recovered. Unlike her [Kusano's] older sister [Yukari], who Yukari] displays the ability to manipulate water and [Yukari] transform it [the water Yukari manipulaties] into ice, as well as [Yukari] exhibiting exceptional strength, lightning-fast speed, and extraordinary dexterity in close combat as [Yukari's alter ego] Musubi, Kusano possesses the remarkable power of Chlorokinesis/Phytokinesis. This incredible ability [Chlorokinesis/Phytokinesis] allows her [Kusano] to exercise control and manipulation over wood, rocks, soil, roots, fruits, flowers, and even moss found in natural habitats. Minato knows of Yukari's existence and that she [Yukari] is [Yukari] his [Minato's] younger sister of course, but [Minato] has no idea that he [Minato] has another little sister [Kusano] who [Kusano] is younger than both him [Minato] and Yukari. On a serene day in the enchanting Akihabara district of Tokyo, as Minato made his [Minato's] way to a charming café to ease his [Minato's] mind following the news of his [Minato's] acceptance as a lecturer at Tokyo U, destiny intervened. 'Musubi', unexpectedly crossed his [Minato's] path, seeking solace from her ['Musubi''s] relentless pursuers, the captivating twin sisters and fellow Sekirei, Hibiki and Hikari. These striking sisters [Hibiki and Hikari] possessed not only mesmerizing looks, with their [Hibiki and Hikari's] long black hair, [Hibiki and Hikari's] piercing blue eyes, and [Hibiki and Hikari's] dominatrix-like attire, but also [Hibiki and Hikari's] formidable electrical powers, in stark contrast to Sekirei #88 [Yukari/'Musubi''s] exceptional strength, lightning-fast speed, and remarkable dexterity as a close combat specialist. These attributes were further complemented by the radiant light-based abilities she [Sekirei #88's/Yukari/'Musubi''s] inherited from Yume. Unbeknownst to her [Musubi], Hibiki and Hikari, also drawn to Minato's presence, [Hibiki and Hikari] were [Hibiki and Hikari] hot on her ['Musubi''s] heels, their [Hibiki's and Hikari's] intention being to prevent her from being bonded with him. In a thrilling sequence of rooftop escapades, Yukari as 'Musubi''s pursuit of {her Ashikabi} while [Musubi] evading Hibiki and Hikari took an unexpected turn. Unfortunately, Yukari as \\"Musubi' stumbled and fell while [Musubi] dashing onto the sidewalk from an adjacent alley, [Musubi] inadvertently landing atop Minato. In this momentary chaos, her ['Musubi''s] ample bosom threatened [Musubi's ample bosom] to engulf him [Minato] as he [Minato] struggled to comprehend the unfolding events. Regaining her [Musubi's] composure, Musubi's embarrassment was palpable as she [Musubi] realized the near-tragic accident she [Musub] had caused. Profusely apologizing, she [Musubi] contemplated leaving, but an instinctive realization coursed through her [Musubi's] being. The person she [Musubi] had fallen upon was none other than her ['Musubi'] destined Ashikabi [Minato]. Swiftly pulling him [Minato] into the shelter of the alley, Musubi locked eyes with him [Minato], her ['Musubi's] blushing and [Musubi's] somewhat embarrassed gaze brimming with determination. Uttering her Norito, a sacred incantation, \\"Fist of my contract! Break the unhappiness of my Ashikabi,\\" she [Musubi] summoned forth the power of their [Musubi's and Minato's] contract, breaking the chains of unhappiness that bound Minato. And with an ardent kiss, their [Musubi's and Minato's] souls intertwined, igniting a passionate and transformative bond. As if touched by ethereal magic, delicate wings gracefully emerged from Yukari as 'Musubi''s back, signifying their [Musubi's and Minato's] profound connection. At last, she [Musubi] was [Musubi] fully winged [bound as the eternal spouse] by her ['Musubi''s] beloved Ashikabi [Minato]. As the wings on 'Musubi''s back slowly fade away after her [Musubi's] winging to Minato, all Minato can think about is the fact that this strange brown-haired girl [Musubi] looks a lot like an older version of his precious little sister [Yukari] with a different hair and eye color and that he [Minato] has [Minato] no idea what is going on. Just as this extraordinary union [Minato winging Musubi] reached its [Minato winging Musubi's] pinnacle, Hibiki and Hikari, [Hibiki and Hikari] exhausted from their [Hibiki and Hikari's] relentless pursuit [of Musubi], finally arrived, [Hibiki and Hikari] desperate to capture 'Musubi' and [Hibiki and Hikari] end her [Musubi's] interference once and for all. Before Hibiki and Hikari could act, Hibiki noticed that Yukari as 'Musubi', had [Musubi] already been chosen [winged] by Minato. Hikari sighed in response. The twins [Hibiki and Hikari] approached Minato and recited their [Hibiki's and Hikari's] shared Norito, proclaiming themselves [Hibiki and Hikari] as the guardians [Hibiki and Hikari] against any misfortune that may befall their [Hibiki's and Hikari's] Ashikabi [Minato]. As they [Hibiki and Hikari] embraced Minato, ethereal wings gracefully emerged from their [Hibiki's and Hikari's] backs, symbolizing their [Hibiki's and Hikari's] bond with him [Minato]. After the wings on their [Hibiki's and Hikari's] faded away after their [Hibiki's and Hikari's] winging by Minato, Hibiki and Hikari turned their [Hibiki's and Hikari's] attention to the astonished 'Musubi'. They [Hibiki and Hikari] informed her [Yukari as 'Musubi'] that, although they [Hibiki and Hikari] would [Hibiki and Hikari] reluctantly share Minato as co-wives, they [Hibiki and Hikari] requested to [Hibiki and Hikari] be present during her ['Musubi's] first intimate experience with Minato on their [Musubi's and Minato's] official honeymoon. {I wonder what exactly happened as Musubi [what Musubi did] pulled Minato into the alleyway and [Musubi after |Musubi| pulling Minato into the alleyway] had [what Musubi allowed to happen] him [Minato] wing her [Musubi]....what exactly was going through his [Minato's] head as she [Musubi] dragged him [Minato] into [where Musubi dragged Minato to] the alleyway and [Musubi after |Musubi| pulling Minato into the alleyway] had [what Musubi allowed to happen] him [Minato] wing her [Musubi] and what exactly did he [Minato] say as she [Musubi] dragged him [Minato] into [where Musubi dragged Minato to] the alleyway, with [Musubi after |Musubi| pulling Minato into the alleyway] having [what Musubi allowed to happen] him [Minato] wing her [Musubi] and what exactly did she [Musubi] think and say as this [Musubi dragging Minato into the alleyway and having him |Minato| wing her]? Did Yume say anything inside Sekirei #88's head? What exactly happened when the twins [Hibiki and Hikari] were [Hibiki and Hikari] winged [Hibiki and Hikari] by [who winged Hibiki and Hikari] Minato? What exactly did they [Hibiki and Hikari] think, feel and say as their [Hibiki's and Hikari's] winging to [who winged Hibiki and Hikari] Minato and what exactly did he [Minato] feel, think and say about this as it [his |Minato's| winging of Hibiki and Hikari] occurred and what exactly did they [Hibiki and Hikari] say to Musubi when they [Hibiki and Hikari] reluctantly [what Hibiki and Hikari reluctantly did] share [whom Hibiki and Hikari reluctantly shared] Minato with [whom Hibiki and Hikari reluctantly shared Minato with] her [Musubi] as co-wives in exchange for them [Hibiki and Hikari] getting to accompany them [Minato and Musubi] on their [Minato's and Musubi's] honeymoon, and [Hibiki and Hikari] sleeping with [having sex with] him [Minato] at that time [Minato and Musubi's honeymoon]. As the three girls [Musubi, Hibiki and Hikari] faced their [Musubi's, Hibiki's and Hikari's] shared Ashikabi [Minato], they [Musubi, Hibiki and Hikari] realized that the peculiar circumstances [Minato's winging of Musubi, Hibiki and Hikari] had [Minato's winging of Musubi, Hibiki and Hikari] overwhelmed him [Minato], [Minato's winging of Musubi, Hibiki and Hikari overwhelming him |Minato|] causing him [Minato] to lose consciousness. With a sigh, Hibiki and Hikari observed as 'Musubi' effortlessly picked up Minato's unconscious form, [Musubi] intending to seek refuge in a nearby hotel she [Musubi] had seen in Yukari's memories. Reluctantly, the twins [Hibiki and Hikari] followed her [Y'Musubi'], [Hibki and Hikari] realizing with embarrassment that they [Hibiki and Hikari] had forgotten to bring a change of clothes. They [Hibiki and Hikari] were now stuck wearing their [Hibiki's and Hikari's] skintight purple bodysuits, which [Hibiki's and Hikari's skintight purple bodysuits] accentuated their [Hibiki's and Hikari's] enticing figures. Blushing, the twins [Hibiki and Hikari] found solace in the thought that Minato's physical attributes appeared to be quite impressive, as they [Hibiki's and Hikari's] could sense through his [Minato's] clothing during their [Hibiki's, Hikari's and Minato's] bonding ritual [Minato winging Hibiki and Hikari]. As the three girls [Musubi, Hibiki and Hikari] decide to rest beside their [Musubi's, Hibiki's and Hikari's] shared Ashikabi [Minato] and [Musubi's, Hibiki's and Hikari's] future husband in the comfort of the hotel room, Kusano gets lost while [Kusano] sneaking out [Kusano] of [where Kusano sneaks out of] the Sekirei tuning room for [why Kusano sneaks out of the Sekirei tuning room] a look at the outside world and [Kusano] gets lost while [Kusano] on her [Kusano's] expedition, causing her [Kusano] to be scared and frightened as the young, blonde green-eyed girl [Kusano] navigates the big city [Tokyo]. Due to her [Kusano's] sheltered upbringing and [Kusano's] ignorance of the outside world, she [Kusano] wraps her [Kusano's] already generous bosom with a sarashi in keeping with her [Kusano's] Sengoku Jidal {warring states period} [the era of Japanese history before the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate] ideals and norms of what a good little girl and young noblewoman in training should be, and [Kusano] poses as a boy while [Kusano] trying to figure her [Kusano's] way in the strange new environment [Tokyo] she [Kusano] has found herself [Kusano] in. In order to get money for sustenance and shelter, the chlorokinetic green-eyed blonde [Kusano] decides to target small-time criminal groups, Yakuza and Triad cells embedded in Tokyo as well as the somewhat easy pickings of local toughs and delinquents, while [Kusano] remaining disguised as a young boy. Meanwhile she [Kusano] dreams of her [Kusano's] Ashikabi [Minato], [Kusano] having vague memories of seeing her mother [Takami] holding a picture of her [Kusano's] older siblings [Minato and Yukari] when she [Takami] was watching them [Minato and Yukari], and [Kusano] wishing that she [Kusano] could know where her [Kusano's] destined one [Minato] is so that she [Kusano] can bond [be winged] with him [Minato]. As her [Kusano's] victims [the criminals Kusano targets while she is disguised as a boy for money for food and shelter] never see her [Kusano's] face when she [Kusano] attacks and defeats them [the criminals Kusano targets while she is disguised as a boy for money for food and shelter], Kusano's male alias receives the name Kiiroi Senkō [Yellow Flash |Kiiroi Senkō|] due to 'his' [Kusano's male alias'] immense speed and quick, effective takedown of his [Kusano's male alias'] victims [the criminals Kusano targets while she is disguised as a boy for money for food and shelter]. One day, while [Kusano] walking down the clean, packed and tech-filled streets of the big city, [Tokyo], the green-eyed, plant-manipulating blonde young girl [Kusano] stumbles into a rather tall, attractive and somewhat seductive young woman whose [the young woman who Kusano stumbles into] age hovers somewhere between the end of young adulthood and middle age, with [the young woman who Kusano stumbles into's] long black hair, [the young woman who Kusano stumbles into's] sharp, observant purple eyes and [the young woman who Kusano stumbles into's] well-developed figure, [the young woman who Kusano stumbles into] wearing a very short hanfu [traditional Han Chinese outfit |hanfu|] which [the young woman who Kusano stumbles into's hanfu] shows her [the young woman who Kusano stumbles into's] cleavage and [the young woman who Kusano stumbles into's] belly button. The young woman [who Kusano stumbles into] introduces herself [the young woman who Kusano stumbles into] as Kazehana and [Kazehana] takes a deep sniff before [Kazehana] commenting that the mean streets of a big city [Tokyo] are [Tokyo's mean streets] no place for a young princess [Kusano], and [Kazehana's continued commentary] that a young lady [Kusano] shouldn't be afraid to express her [Kusano's] true self, which shocks the disguised girl [Kusano]. Kazehana shakes her [Kazehana's] head before picking up the disguised green-eyed blonde [Kusano] with ease and Kazehana leaping away with the young girl [Kusano] in hand, implying that she [Kazehana] is [what Kazehana is] a Sekirei whose [Kazehana's] Ashikabi is [whom Kazehana's Sekirei is] Minato, like Kusano, Musubi, Hibiki and Hikari. As Kusano tries to get used to her [Kusano's] life at Izumo-sou [Izumo Inn |Izumo-sou|, a massive, extravagant traditional Japanese mansion |Izumo-sou| that |Izumo-sou| also doubles |Izumo-sou| as a guest house, where Kazehana |what Kazehana does at Izumo-sou| now resides |Kazehana| as a tenant] while [Kusano] failing [what Kusano fails to do] to hide [what Kusano fails to hide] her [Kusano's] wet dreams of her [Kusano's] and her [Kusano's] new guardian's [Karasuba's] shared Ashikabi [Minato], taking [having sex with] her [Kusano] on their [Minato's and Kusano's] wedding night, from [whom Kusano fails to hide her |Kusano's| wet dreams from] the amused busty, black-haired drunkard temptress [Karasuba], who [Karasuba] decides to tease her [Karasuba's] unofficial ward [Kusano] so that she [Kusano] will be able to handle him [Minato] when she [Kusano] truly becomes one of his [Minato's] many wives [Minato's Sekirei], Minato, Musubi, Hibiki and Hikari all get used to each other [Minato, Musubi, Hibiki and Hikari] as the happy go lucky, somewhat naive and immodest fist-type Sekirei [Musubi] beats up criminals to [why Musubi beats up criminals] get money for their [Minato's, Musubi's, Hibiki's and Hikari's] sustenance and the twins [Hibiki and Hikari] continue their [Hibiki's and Hikari's] legitimate jobs as maids at a local cafe, which [Hibiki and Hikari working as maids] suprises the wandering, black-haired and blue eyed genius ronin [Minato]. Things come to a head when the inevitable meeting with Hibiki's and Hikari's adoptive father, the tall, black-haired, black-eyed, somewhat perverted but also streetwise grizzled mercenary and former ROKAF [Republic of Korea Armed Forces |ROKAF|] special forces commando Seo [Hibiki's and Hikari's adoptive father], occurs, with Seo being shocked at how clueless his [Seo's] daughters' [Hibiki's and Hikari's] future husband [Minato] is about the Sekirei Plan [a secret battle royale |the Sekirei Plan| which |Sekirei Plan| consists of Sekirei fighting for the right to wield a Jinki that |the Jinki| grants |what the Jinki gives| a single wish, |the Sekirei Plan| sponsored by Minaka and MBI] but Seo reluctantly giving his [Seo's] approval to marry his [Seo's] daughters [Hibiki and Hikari] to the black-haired young man [Minato]. I wonder what Kusano's life at Izumo-sou is [Kusano's life at Izumo-sou] like...does she [Kusano] try to [what Kusano may or may not try to do] help out around the guest house [Izumo-sou] in the mornings before she [Kusano] heads off to school and in the evenings when she [Kusano] returns? I wonder what her [Kusano's] relationship with her [Kusano's] current guardian [Kazehana] is [Kusano's relationship with Kazehana] like...what do they [Kazehana and Kusano] say [Kazehana and Kusano] to each other [Kazehana and Kusano] and does the seductive temptress [Kazehana] know that her [Kazehana's] ward [Kusano] is her [Kazehana's] boss' [Minaka's] daughter [Kusano] and her [Kazehana's] future husband's [Minato's] younger sister [Kusano]?","output":"**The Neon Dawn Over Tokyo** In the twisted corridors of history, the world has taken an unparalleled route that heralded not the familiar order of nations, but a patchwork of fiefdoms, reclaimed territories, and fractured republics. It was an age of upheaval, a canvas painted in the chaotic hues of revolution and a newfound Japanese dominion. As Tokyo basked in the neon embrace of its own urban glory, Hiroto Minaka—one part genius, another part madman and the most enigmatic lecturer Tokyo University had ever seen—formed a covert alliance safeguarding a miraculous discovery: a spaceship housing the mysterious Sekirei, beings of extraordinary power and potential. Karasuba, the snow-haired enigma masquerading as the raven-haired university student Takami, had bound herself to Minaka's side. Their tangled affair—a fusion of intellect and allure—spawned a son named Sahashi Minato and two daughters, Yukari, and Kusano, whose fates were as intertwined with the Sekirei Plan as the stars to the cosmos. In the midst of Minaka's delirious dream—the Sekirei Plan—unfolded a tale most bizarre. Sahashi Minato, a fledgling lecturer with innocuous charm, collided with destiny in the form of 'Musubi'—a spirited young woman with a concealed alter-ego, Sekirei #88. The innocence of their meeting, the unexpected bonding, attracted the demure but deadly twins, Hibiki and Hikari, Sekirei shrouded in the duality of storm and spark. The breathtaking encounter left Minato reeling, thoughts muddled as he found himself bound to not one but three Sekirei—his heart now a vessel for their shared destiny. Oblivious to his winged bevy of Sekirei, Minato’s life pirouetted on the edge of the bizarre. Managing a peculiar household with Musubi’s brawns and the twins' serviceable skills, they navigated a life pieced together by willpower and affection. Hibiki, with her tempest's touch, and Hikari, with lightning in her veins, complimented Musubi’s sunlight spirit. Together, they bore the battle-maid aura that now defined Minato's everyday existence, forging an unspoken strength that bound them ever more sincerely to their Ashikabi. Meanwhile, Kusano, a fugitive from her own closed world, assumed the alias of Kiiroi Senkō, a shadowy figure of retribution haunting Tokyo’s underbelly, her mischief cloaked in the guise of a boy. It was Kazehana, the wind courtesan, whose casual collide with 'Kiiroi Senkō' unraveled the threads of deceit. With a knowing smirk and a swig of sake, she whisked Kusano to Izumo-sou—the abode that sang songs of freedom and mystery. Here, Kusano's repressed yearnings found solace, dreams of joining her Ashikabi stirring in her chest with every heartbeat. Izumo-sou was a menagerie—a prism of lives interlocking at the whims of fate and desire. Kusano, once lost, found discipleship under Kazehana’s flirtatious yet nurturing grace. Their mornings were chaotic symphonies—Kusanos's chlorokinesis adorning the garden with unseasonal blossoms; Kazehana’s laughter, both lush and inviting—as they crossed the chasm from guardian and ward to something akin to kin. Intrigue hung in Izumo-sou's every silent room, suggesting countless tales yet untold. From Minato’s grappling with inexplicable romance to the shadow of Minaka’s imperial reverie, the threads of their lives embroidered a tapestry forged in both marvel and madness. And when the comforting cloak of night descended, Kusano dreamt fiercely of the day she'd stand by her brother’s side, her place among her fellow Sekirei assured, whispered promises of matrimonial bliss lodged in her wishes. In this mosaic realm of gods and mortals, of insurmountable odds and tender allegiances, an urban fantasy unfolded atop the neon-drenched citadel of Tokyo—an unwitting Ashikabi and his celestial harem etching a cornerstone for the unquiet dawn of a new world."},{"instruction":"财通证券在践行金融顾问制度做了那些事情","output":"财通证券作为中国的一家综合性证券公司，在践行金融顾问制度上做出了多项努力。金融顾问制度主要是通过专业的金融顾问为客户提供投资建议及管理服务，目的是提升客户服务体验并满足投资者多样化的金融需求。具体来讲，财通证券在这一体系的实践中可能会有以下几个方面的工作： 1. **顾问团队建设**: 强化顾问团队培养，对金融顾问进行系统的专业知识和业务能力的培训，提升顾问团队的整体素质和服务水平。 2. **个性化服务**: 提供专属的一对一财务顾问服务，根据客户的风险偏好、资金情况、投资目标等因素，制定个性化的资产配置方案和投资建议。 3. **产品和服务创新**: 不断创新金融产品和服务，比如开发新的资管产品、优化交易工具和投资策略，为客户提供多元化的投资选择。 4. **信息技术支持**: 利用大数据、人工智能等现代信息技术，提高服务的效率和精确度，例如通过客户数据分析，更好地洞察客户需求，为客户推荐更加合适的投资产品。 5. **风险控制**: 在服务客户的过程中，注重风险管理和合规操作，确保投资建议的合理性和客户资产的安全。 6. **市场信息提供**: 及时提供市场分析、财经新闻、政策动向等信息，帮助客户更好地把握市场脉搏，作出明智的投资决策。 7. **长期关系维护**: 建立和维护与客户的长期关系，通过持续的服务和交流，深化客户信任，为客户提供持续的价值。 请注意，上述的措施是财通证券可能会采取的策略，实际上该公司可能根据其业务发展战略、市场变化、监管政策等因素，对金融顾问制度的具体实践作出调整。如果需要最新的详细信息，建议直接咨询财通证券或者查看其最新的官方公告和新闻报道。"},{"instruction":"퍼슨 오브 인터레스트 시즌3 에피소드 3에서 루트가 정신병원을 탈출 하는 상황을 자세하게 설명해줘","output":"\\"Person of Interest\\" 시즌 3 에피소드 3의 제목은 \\"Lady Killer\\"이며, 이 에피소드는 주로 The Machine으로부터 새로운 Number를 받은 Finch와 그의 팀이 여성 표적을 보호하기 위해 노력하는 이야기에 초점을 맞춥니다. 이 에피소드에서 Root(에이미 애커 분)는 정신병원에 강제로 수용되어 있지만, 본론으로 들어가 정신병원 탈출 장면에 대해 설명하도록 하겠습니다. 루트는 정신병원에 강금된 상태이고, 의사와 대화를 하는 장면이 몇 차례 나옵니다. 그녀는 의사와의 상담 시간 동안 마치 협조적인 것처럼 행동하지만, 사실은 탈출 계획을 세우고 있는 것으로 드러납니다. 그녀는 의사에게 자신이 \\"The Machine\\"과 대화할 수 있다고 주장하며, 이를 피해 망상으로 여기는 의사로부터 믿음을 얻기 위해 기지를 발휘합니다. 정신병원에서의 생활 중, 루트는 계속해서 The Machine과 의사소통을 시도하고, 이를 통해 내부 보안 시스템과 병원 직원들의 행동 패턴에 대해 배웁니다. 병원에서의 생활을 통해 그녀는 병원 시스템의 취약점을 파악해 나가고, 이 정보를 활용하여 탈출을 위한 계획을 세웁니다. 루트는 병원에 있는 동안 자신에게 행해지는 소위 '치료'에 의문을 제기하며, 이를 통해 자신이 무고함을 증명하려고 합니다. 이 과정에서 그녀는 자신의 지능을 이용하여 주변 환경을 조작하고, 병원의 보안 체계를 해킹합니다. 결국 그녀는 병원의 전기 시스템을 조작하여 정전을 유발시키고, 이 혼란을 틈타 탈출합니다. 정확한 탈출 상황이나 구체적인 시퀀스에 대한 정보는 제가 기억하고 있는 범위 내에서 제공되었으며, 정적인 장면이나 대사까지 상세하게 기억하는 것은 제한적입니다. \\"Person of Interest\\"에서 루트의 탈출 장면은 그녀의 캐릭터가 얼마나 영리하고, 자원이 풍부하며, 기술에 능숙한지를 보여주는 중요한 순간 중 하나입니다."},{"instruction":"do you have access to our previous conversation","output":"As an AI developed by OpenAI, I do not have the ability to recall personal data from previous interactions unless the conversation is still ongoing within the same session.

Here, the Daehan Jeguk, also known as the Taehan Cheguk, once a proud vestige of an ancient semi-constitutional imperial semi-democratic absolute monarchy, rose from the shadows of time to reclaim its heritage—an empire reborn, but not as it once was. The Daehan Jeguk had been a protectorate and a semi-autonomous region of the illustrious Dai Nihon Teikoku, itself a formidable constitutional democratic absolute monarchial imperial state. The Daiwa no Koushitsu, led by the venerable Imperial House of Yamato, ruled steadfastly, steering the fate of the East Asian titan through tempests of change. The fall of the CCCP, alongside its satellite states, including the subjugated Chunghwa Minkuo, the ideologically ensnared State Israels, and the turbulent Chosŏn Minjujuŭi Inmin Konghwaguk, paved the way for seismic societal shifts. Not least among these was the collapse of the Daehan-min's military dictatorship in South Korea, a chapter written in the blood of patriots and the ink of despots. It was in the theater of this grand geopolitical reconfiguration that the Daehan Jeguk emerged anew, its phoenix song resounding through the annals of history. With the fall of the oppressive regimes, both North and South Korean remnants looked wistfully toward a united Korea—a dream etched in the soul of every Hanguk-saram. Modernization of the imperial system was imperative. The decrepit infrastructure of the old monarchy, founded on ancient rites and ossified bureaucracy, underwent a baptism of innovation. Torn between old loyalties and the beckoning of a new era, the Hanguk-saram found their homeland on the precipice of transformation. The Chosŏn Inmin'gun and the Daehanminguk Gukgun, once opposed factions forged in the furnace of differing ideologies, now laid down their arms to form the core of the rebirthed Daehan Jeguggun. The Siwidae, an echo of a distant martial past, were not resurrected as an independent entity but instead integrated into the Jieitai, symbolizing the inextricable link between the protector and its charge. As for the ruling class, the question of the imperial lineage loomed large. Would the Jeonju Wangsil, holders of the royal seal since the bygone days of the elder nation Dae Joeson-gug, ascend once more? Or would an arranged union with another royal house, perhaps even the Daiwa no Koushitsu, usher in a new age of Japanese influence solidified through bloodlines and ceremony? The descendants of Kim-Il-Sung and Park-Chung-Hee, names that echoed through the turbulent chapters of Korean history, became the threads with which the new fabric of the empire's royalty was delicately woven. Conjoining the lineage of former adversaries with the ruling class was a stroke of political genius, melding the past's divisions into a tapestry of unified futures. Yet shadows lingered. The yangaban, once the eldritch keepers of an ancient status quo, the diehard communists, and Juche ideologues, the entrenched military elite from the Daehan-min era, all posed potential threats to the nascent imperial dream. Illmism, with its intoxicating allure of pure Korean nationalism, flared in the hearts of some, while others pleaded for reconciliation and embracing a pan-East Asian identity, eschewing past ethnocentric excesses. The empire's task was to navigate these treacherous waters, balancing progress with respect for the storied fabric of Korean uniqueness. To the east, Karufuto and the Japanese Home Islands were reintegrated into the Dai Nihon Teikoku's embrace, seamlessly returning to a state of pre-war normalcy. Formosa, however, danced to a different rhythm, administered once again under a restored Dōngníng Wángcháo. Yet, this was not the kingdom of old but one that cast its eyes toward democratic reform, eager to harmonize the ancient vigour of its ruling house with the modernity that the world now demanded. In Formosa, whispers of the past mingled with the breath of the future, and in Zheng Sen—or perhaps, Koxinga—its part-Japanese founder became a bridge between worlds. Here, at the crossroads of identity and legacy, the Daiwa no Koushitsu found kinship in the blood of the island's ruler, drawing parallels of unity from the interlaced histories of two great peoples. Thus, the theater of the East Asian stage was set once more, not with actors of war but with architects of a delicate peace—a peace forged by the mettle of those who dared dream of empires never truly lost to the annals of history but merely awaiting their time to rise once more, resplendent under the auspices of a world that had altogether changed."},{"instruction":"raft a captivating and enthralling urban fantasy science fiction tale in the form of a harem romantic comedy slice of life story, inspired by the Sekirei manga, anime and video game franchise. In this narrative, the Japanese government reclaims Karufuto [Sahalkin Island and the Kurils |Karufuto|], Formosa [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands |Formosa|] and Chousun [Korea/the Korean peninsula |Chousun|] as provinces of the Japanese state, following the collapse of the Berlin Wall, which [Japan reclaiming Chousun, Formosa,and Karufuto after the fall of the Berlin Wall] was [Japan reclaiming Chousun, Formosa, and Karufuto after the fall of the Berlin Wall] brought about by the Soviet Union’s depletion of resources, manpower and military strength in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, the United States remains a repressive fascist dictatorship, [the USA] controlled by [who controls the USA] the Southern Democrats/Progressives and the KKK, as Martin Luther King Jr’s untimely demise due to the covert involvement of an FBI death squad fuels suspicions of his [MLK Jr’s] alleged involvement with an international right-wing extremist communist conspiracy orchestrated by the USSR and [the world wide right-wing extremist communist conspiracy] specifically the KGB. This tragic event [the passing of MLK Jr] deters notable figures such as Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon from pursuing political office. Remarkably, the USA manages to secure victory in the Vietnam War spanning from 1955 to 1975, thanks to the People’s Republic of China [PRC] occupying [where the PRC occupies] mainland China openly supporting [whom the PRC openly supports] the Republic of Vietnam [ROV] military regime occupying [where the ROV occupying] South Vietnam, [the PRC’s support of the ROV] in an attempt to counter the Soviet Union’s previous backing of the KMT and the KMT’s state, the Leninist-Stalinist Republic of China [ROC] during the Chinese Civil War [1945-1949], a move [the PRC’s support of the ROV] driven by Mao’s desire for retribution [against the Soviets for Stalin’s backing of the KMT during the Chinese Civil War]. These transformative events [the PRC’s support of the ROV and subsequent American, PRC and Republic of Korean victory in the Vietnam War] culminated in the collapse of the People’s Republic of China when the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 spark a Second Xinhai Revolution, [the revolutionaries of the second Xinhai Revolution] rebelling against the fascist rule imposed by the Communist Party of China. Simultaneously, a revolution unfolds in the United States, led [the revolution in the United States against the Democrats] by an alliance between evangelical right-wing factions and black radicals, who [the alliance between evangelical right-wing factions and black radicals leading the revolution against the one party state of the Democrats in the USA] courageously fight against the deeply entrenched Jim Crow era. The exhaustion of the USSR in Afghanistan enables this revolution [the fight against the Democrats in the USA] to take hold. Consequently, the American North evolves into a Trotskyist-theocratic revolutionary dictatorship, while the American South witnesses the resurgence of the Confederacy, with New Deal liberals, progressive racialists, and open white nationalists uniting under the broad umbrella of the Democratic Party. As a result of these transformative events the USA remained a secular apartheid fascist dictatorship under the control of the Democrat Party due to MLK Jr’s assassination, Reagan and Nixon not running for office, the PRC’s support of the ROV and subsequent American, PRC and Republic of Korean victory in the Vietnam War which results in the Second Xinhai Revolution and the resumption of the Chinese Civil War, the USSR exhausting itself in Afghanistan and the revolution against the Democrat Party in the USA], the global landscape has shifted, creating a unique scenario where neither Russia, America, nor China are [the Russian and Chinese warlord states, the Trotskyist American North and the Confederacy in the American south] in a position to impede Japan from reclaiming its [Japan’s] long-lost prefectures [Karufuto, Chousun, and Formosa]. Additionally, Germany has successfully restored its [Germany’s] borders to those of 1914 after the reunification of the Federal Republic of Germany in the west [of Germany] and the Soviet puppet state of the German Democratic Republic in the east [of Germany], following the historic fall of the Berlin Wall. Furthermore, democratic uprisings in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Yugoslavia have liberated these nations from repressive regimes. In this era of change, Hungary has even seized Transylvania from Romania, leading to a petition for annexation by Austria [from revolutionary Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Yugoslavia] and the subsequent restoration of the majestic Austria-Hungarian Empire. Moreover, these developments have reignited the Russian Civil War, adding further complexity to the global stage. As a consequence, the talented and enigmatic mad scientist Hiroto Minaka, a brilliant but eccentric college-age university lecturer [Minaka] at Tokyo University with [Minaka’s] striking black hair and [Minaka’s] grey eyes, [Minaka’s] possesses the remarkable ability to [Minaka] assemble a fully equipped expeditionary force. This force includes a team of esteemed Soviet scientists and engineers from both the former USSR and the Republic of China in exile on Taiwan, which Japan has recently reclaimed [Taiwan] as the restored Formosa province. Additionally, Minaka has acquired the expertise of ex-Soviet scientists and engineers from the now-defunct Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, which [the DPRK] formerly occupied North Korea as [the DPRK] a Soviet satelite state until Japan regained control [of the entire Korean peninsula], transforming it [North and South Korea] into the restored Japanese province of Chosun. Furthermore, American scientists and technicians, seeking refuge from the turmoil in the former USA, have [the fleeing American scientists] joined forces with Minaka. Their [the Soviet and American scientists assisting Mika on his expedition’s] collective assistance becomes crucial when Minaka and his [Minaka’s] lover, the captivating and mysterious white-haired and grey-eyed busty Sekirei #04, Karasuba, who [Karasuba] disguises herself [Karasuba] as the alluring black-haired, grey-eyed busty college student Sahashi Takami, stumble [Karsuba as Takami and Minaka] upon a crashed extraterrestrial spaceship on a remote island that mysteriously materialized in the seas near Japan. This spacecraft holds not only 107 Sekirei embryos but also a single young adult female Sekirei, all [the 107 Sekirei embryos and 1 adult Sekirei on board the crashed spaceship] perfectly preserved in cryogenic suspended animation. When Minaka successfully awakens the solitary adult Sekirei aboard the spaceship from her [the lone adult Sekirei on the spaceship’s] slumber in cyro, he [Minaka] is [Minaka] captivated by her [the lone adult Sekirei on the spaceship’s] stunning appearance - with [the lone adult Sekirei on the spaceship’s] light purple hair and [the lone adult Sekirei on the spaceship’s] mesmerizing blue eyes, along with a tall, slender and [the lone adult Sekirei on the spaceship’s] buxom look. He [Minaka] christens her [the lone adult Sekirei on the spaceship] Miya and, [Minaka] in this fateful encounter [Minaka’s awakening of Miya], Minaka uncovers the true identity of his beloved Takami [Karasuba]. Utilizing this newfound knowledge [Takami’s true identity as the Sekirei Karasuba], Minaka skillfully coerces Takami into [Takami] joining him [Minaka] in his [Minaka’s] grand vision - a plan to establish a new era of divine supremacy through a unipolar world order, where Japan reigns supreme. Despite Takami’s derisive dismissal of his [Minaka’s] sanity and [Minaka’s] delusions, Minaka remains steadfast in his purpose. Harnessing the ‘overtechnology’ they stumbled upon within the spaceship, they empower the Japanese government, military, and police with cutting-edge weaponry and equipment. The immense profits derived from these ventures [Minaka’s and Takami’s secret sales of advanced military tech to the Japanese government, military and police forces] enable Minaka to establish a front company called MBI, which [MBI] swiftly evolves into an economic, technological, and medical powerhouse, [MBI] connecting and dominating every sector on a global scale. Amidst their extraordinary journey, Minaka and Takami consummate their [Minaka’s and Takami’s] love, leading to Takami conceiving a child - a beautiful boy with [Takami’s and Minaka’s male child’s] black hair and [Takami’s and Minaka’s male child’s] captivating blue eyes. Bearing his [Takami’s and Minaka’s male child’s] mother’s [Takami’s] surname, the child is named Sahashi Minato. Sadly, Takami’s demanding responsibilities at MBI prevent her [Takami] from raising their son [Minato], resulting in him [Minato] being passed around among relatives without [Minato] ever truly knowing the identity of [ his [Minato’s] birth parents [Minaka and Takami]. Minaka and Takami are blessed with two other children, both [Minato’s younger siblings] of whom are girls. This brings great amusement to the brilliant scientist [Minaka], as Takami has only given birth to girls after their [Minaka’s and Takami’s] eldest son, Minato. The older of the two girls who [the older of the two girls] is [the older of the two girls] at least four years younger than their [Minato’s younger sisters’] older brother [Minato], [the older of the two girls] named Sahashi Yukari, [Yukari] possesses a [Yukari’s] striking appearance with her [Yukari’s] short black hair fashioned [Yukari’s hair] in a bowl cut and her [Yukari’s] captivating bright blue eyes. Despite her [Yukari’s] reserved and [Yukari’s] shy nature, Yukari inherits her [Yukari’s] mother’s [Takami’s] fierce determination and her [Yukari’s] father’s [Minaka’s] exceptional intelligence and eccentricity.Yukari is primarily raised by Takami, yet she remains oblivious to her mother’s true occupation as the co-head of the mega-corp MBI. Unbeknownst to her [Yukari’s] parents [Minaka and Takami], Yukari carries within her [Yukari] a hidden nature that [Yukari’s hidden nature] reflects her [Yukari’s] mother’s [Takami’s] lineage as a Sekirei [Takami’s true self as Karasuba]. This aspect of her [Yukari] being manifests as a separate persona known as Sekirei #88, whose [Sekirei #88’s] name is Musubi. As Musubi, she [Yukari as ‘Musubi’] embodies a [Musubi’s] cheerful and [Musubi’s] carefree nature, [Musubi being] devoid of modesty yet [Musubi being] fiercely loyal. This second personality [‘Musubi’] manifests when Yukari finds herself [Yukari] in peril or in search of her [Yukari’s] destined soulmate, known [a Sekirei’s destined soulmate] as an Ashikabi. When Musubi takes control of Yukari’s body, Yukari’s hair lengthens and [Yukari’s hair] lightens to a rich brown hue, her [Yukari’s] vibrant blue eyes deepen to an enchanting purple, and her [Yukari’s] already ample bosom blossoms into a symbol of her [Yukari’s] womanhood. Conversely, when Yukari assumes control of their [Musubi’s and Yukari’s] shared body, her [Yukari’s] hair remains short and ebony, her [Yukari’s] eyes retain their [Yukari’s eyes] captivating blue hue, and her [Yukari’s] figure reflects that of a blossoming teenager, albeit with a generous bust that pales in comparison to her [Yukari’s] alter ego [‘Musubi’]. Neither Yukari nor Musubi are aware of each other’s [Musubi’s and Yukari’s] existence within their shared vessel [Sekirei #88’s body], with Yukari blissfully ignorant of her [Yukari’s] Sekirei heritage and even the existence of Sekirei. However, Musubi possesses the ability to access Yukari’s memories and [Musubi] is acutely aware of her [Musubi’s] connection to Minato, her [Musubi’s] beloved brother and [Musubi’s] Ashikabi. Unbeknownst to both personalities [Musubi and Yukari], the soul of the once-infamous brown-haired and purple eyed, tall and buxomSekirei Yume, designated as Sekirei #08, resides [Yume’s soul] within the very same body [Sekirei #88’s body]. Yume made the ultimate sacrifice by giving her [Yume’s] life to save Musubi during a failed assault on the headquarters of MBI, the multinational corporate empire that [MBI] is [MBI] the current sponsor of the Sekirei. Yume silently observes every action and thought of both Musubi and Yukari, with complete access to their [Musubi’s and Yukari’s] shared memories. While she [Yume] remains in the background, she [Yume] occasionally offers guidance to Musubi and Yukari, [Yume] playfully teasing them [Musubi and Yukari] about their [Musubi’s and Yukari’s] deep affection for their [Musubi’s and Yukari’s] shared brother, Minato. This teasing [of Musubi and Yukari by Yume] is rooted in the fact that Minato is the Ashikabi of Sekirei #88 [the shared body of both Yukari and Musubi]. The younger daughter of Minaka and Takami, a blonde, petite and graceful young girl with [the younger of Minaka and Takami’s daughters’] stunning green eyes and a [the younger of Minaka and Takami’s daughters’] captivating curiosity inherited from her [the younger of Minaka and Takami’s daughters’] father’s [Minaka’s] eccentricity and [Minaka’s] vast intellect, along with her [the younger of Minaka and Takami’s daughters’] mother’s [Takami’s] resolute determination and [Takami’s]strong-willed nature, is [the younger of Minaka and Takami’s daughters] Sahashi Kusano. Despite [Kusano] being at least six years younger than her [Kusano’s] older brother [Minato], Kusano possesses an [Kusano’s] intelligence and inquisitiveness that [Kusano’s intelligence and curiousity] defies her [Kusano’s] tender age and [Kusano’s] innocence. In her [Kusano’s] earlier years, Kusano endured an illness resulting from the conflicting nature of her [Kusano’s] Sekirei and human sides, leading Takami to care for her [Kusano’s] within the Sekirei tuning lab until her [Kusano’s] Sekirei nature ultimately triumphed over her [Kusano’s] human side and she [Kusano] fully recovered. Unlike her [Kusano’s] older sister [Yukari], who Yukari] displays the ability to manipulate water and [Yukari] transform it [the water Yukari manipulaties] into ice, as well as [Yukari] exhibiting exceptional strength, lightning-fast speed, and extraordinary dexterity in close combat as [Yukari’s alter ego] Musubi, Kusano possesses the remarkable power of Chlorokinesis/Phytokinesis. This incredible ability [Chlorokinesis/Phytokinesis] allows her [Kusano] to exercise control and manipulation over wood, rocks, soil, roots, fruits, flowers, and even moss found in natural habitats. Minato knows of Yukari’s existence and that she [Yukari] is [Yukari] his [Minato’s] younger sister of course, but [Minato] has no idea that he [Minato] has another little sister [Kusano] who [Kusano] is younger than both him [Minato] and Yukari. On a serene day in the enchanting Akihabara district of Tokyo, as Minato made his [Minato’s] way to a charming café to ease his [Minato’s] mind following the news of his [Minato’s] acceptance as a lecturer at Tokyo U, destiny intervened. ‘Musubi’, unexpectedly crossed his [Minato’s] path, seeking solace from her [‘Musubi’'s] relentless pursuers, the captivating twin sisters and fellow Sekirei, Hibiki and Hikari. These striking sisters [Hibiki and Hikari] possessed not only mesmerizing looks, with their [Hibiki and Hikari’s] long black hair, [Hibiki and Hikari’s] piercing blue eyes, and [Hibiki and Hikari’s] dominatrix-like attire, but also [Hibiki and Hikari’s] formidable electrical powers, in stark contrast to Sekirei #88 [Yukari/‘Musubi’'s] exceptional strength, lightning-fast speed, and remarkable dexterity as a close combat specialist. These attributes were further complemented by the radiant light-based abilities she [Sekirei #88’s/Yukari/‘Musubi’'s] inherited from Yume. Unbeknownst to her [Musubi], Hibiki and Hikari, also drawn to Minato’s presence, [Hibiki and Hikari] were [Hibiki and Hikari] hot on her [‘Musubi’'s] heels, their [Hibiki’s and Hikari’s] intention being to prevent her from being bonded with him. In a thrilling sequence of rooftop escapades, Yukari as ‘Musubi’‘s pursuit of {her Ashikabi} while [Musubi] evading Hibiki and Hikari took an unexpected turn. Unfortunately, Yukari as \\"Musubi’ stumbled and fell while [Musubi] dashing onto the sidewalk from an adjacent alley, [Musubi] inadvertently landing atop Minato. In this momentary chaos, her [‘Musubi’'s] ample bosom threatened [Musubi’s ample bosom] to engulf him [Minato] as he [Minato] struggled to comprehend the unfolding events. Regaining her [Musubi’s] composure, Musubi’s embarrassment was palpable as she [Musubi] realized the near-tragic accident she [Musub] had caused. Profusely apologizing, she [Musubi] contemplated leaving, but an instinctive realization coursed through her [Musubi’s] being. The person she [Musubi] had fallen upon was none other than her [‘Musubi’] destined Ashikabi [Minato]. Swiftly pulling him [Minato] into the shelter of the alley, Musubi locked eyes with him [Minato], her [‘Musubi’s] blushing and [Musubi’s] somewhat embarrassed gaze brimming with determination. Uttering her Norito, a sacred incantation, “Fist of my contract! Break the unhappiness of my Ashikabi,” she [Musubi] summoned forth the power of their [Musubi’s and Minato’s] contract, breaking the chains of unhappiness that bound Minato. And with an ardent kiss, their [Musubi’s and Minato’s] souls intertwined, igniting a passionate and transformative bond. As if touched by ethereal magic, delicate wings gracefully emerged from Yukari as ‘Musubi’‘s back, signifying their [Musubi’s and Minato’s] profound connection. At last, she [Musubi] was [Musubi] fully winged [bound as the eternal spouse] by her [‘Musubi’‘s] beloved Ashikabi [Minato]. As the wings on ‘Musubi’‘s back slowly fade away after her [Musubi’s] winging to Minato, all Minato can think about is the fact that this strange brown-haired girl [Musubi] looks a lot like an older version of his precious little sister [Yukari] with a different hair and eye color and that he [Minato] has [Minato] no idea what is going on. Just as this extraordinary union [Minato winging Musubi] reached its [Minato winging Musubi’s] pinnacle, Hibiki and Hikari, [Hibiki and Hikari] exhausted from their [Hibiki and Hikari’s] relentless pursuit [of Musubi], finally arrived, [Hibiki and Hikari] desperate to capture ‘Musubi’ and [Hibiki and Hikari] end her [Musubi’s] interference once and for all. Before Hibiki and Hikari could act, Hibiki noticed that Yukari as ‘Musubi’, had [Musubi] already been chosen [winged] by Minato. Hikari sighed in response. The twins [Hibiki and Hikari] approached Minato and recited their [Hibiki’s and Hikari’s] shared Norito, proclaiming themselves [Hibiki and Hikari] as the guardians [Hibiki and Hikari] against any misfortune that may befall their [Hibiki’s and Hikari’s] Ashikabi [Minato]. As they [Hibiki and Hikari] embraced Minato, ethereal wings gracefully emerged from their [Hibiki’s and Hikari’s] backs, symbolizing their [Hibiki’s and Hikari’s] bond with him [Minato]. After the wings on their [Hibiki’s and Hikari’s] faded away after their [Hibiki’s and Hikari’s] winging by Minato, Hibiki and Hikari turned their [Hibiki’s and Hikari’s] attention to the astonished ‘Musubi’. They [Hibiki and Hikari] informed her [Yukari as ‘Musubi’] that, although they [Hibiki and Hikari] would [Hibiki and Hikari] reluctantly share Minato as co-wives, they [Hibiki and Hikari] requested to [Hibiki and Hikari] be present during her [‘Musubi’s] first intimate experience with Minato on their [Musubi’s and Minato’s] official honeymoon. {I wonder what exactly happened as Musubi [what Musubi did] pulled Minato into the alleyway and [Musubi after |Musubi| pulling Minato into the alleyway] had [what Musubi allowed to happen] him [Minato] wing her [Musubi]…what exactly was going through his [Minato’s] head as she [Musubi] dragged him [Minato] into [where Musubi dragged Minato to] the alleyway and [Musubi after |Musubi| pulling Minato into the alleyway] had [what Musubi allowed to happen] him [Minato] wing her [Musubi] and what exactly did he [Minato] say as she [Musubi] dragged him [Minato] into [where Musubi dragged Minato to] the alleyway, with [Musubi after |Musubi| pulling Minato into the alleyway] having [what Musubi allowed to happen] him [Minato] wing her [Musubi] and what exactly did she [Musubi] think and say as this [Musubi dragging Minato into the alleyway and having him |Minato| wing her]? Did Yume say anything inside Sekirei #88’s head? What exactly happened when the twins [Hibiki and Hikari] were [Hibiki and Hikari] winged [Hibiki and Hikari] by [who winged Hibiki and Hikari] Minato? What exactly did they [Hibiki and Hikari] think, feel and say as their [Hibiki’s and Hikari’s] winging to [who winged Hibiki and Hikari] Minato and what exactly did he [Minato] feel, think and say about this as it [his |Minato’s| winging of Hibiki and Hikari] occurred and what exactly did they [Hibiki and Hikari] say to Musubi when they [Hibiki and Hikari] reluctantly [what Hibiki and Hikari reluctantly did] share [whom Hibiki and Hikari reluctantly shared] Minato with [whom Hibiki and Hikari reluctantly shared Minato with] her [Musubi] as co-wives in exchange for them [Hibiki and Hikari] getting to accompany them [Minato and Musubi] on their [Minato’s and Musubi’s] honeymoon, and [Hibiki and Hikari] sleeping with [having sex with] him [Minato] at that time [Minato and Musubi’s honeymoon]. As the three girls [Musubi, Hibiki and Hikari] faced their [Musubi’s, Hibiki’s and Hikari’s] shared Ashikabi [Minato], they [Musubi, Hibiki and Hikari] realized that the peculiar circumstances [Minato’s winging of Musubi, Hibiki and Hikari] had [Minato’s winging of Musubi, Hibiki and Hikari] overwhelmed him [Minato], [Minato’s winging of Musubi, Hibiki and Hikari overwhelming him |Minato|] causing him [Minato] to lose consciousness. With a sigh, Hibiki and Hikari observed as ‘Musubi’ effortlessly picked up Minato’s unconscious form, [Musubi] intending to seek refuge in a nearby hotel she [Musubi] had seen in Yukari’s memories. Reluctantly, the twins [Hibiki and Hikari] followed her [Y’Musubi’], [Hibki and Hikari] realizing with embarrassment that they [Hibiki and Hikari] had forgotten to bring a change of clothes. They [Hibiki and Hikari] were now stuck wearing their [Hibiki’s and Hikari’s] skintight purple bodysuits, which [Hibiki’s and Hikari’s skintight purple bodysuits] accentuated their [Hibiki’s and Hikari’s] enticing figures. Blushing, the twins [Hibiki and Hikari] found solace in the thought that Minato’s physical attributes appeared to be quite impressive, as they [Hibiki’s and Hikari’s] could sense through his [Minato’s] clothing during their [Hibiki’s, Hikari’s and Minato’s] bonding ritual [Minato winging Hibiki and Hikari]. As the three girls [Musubi, Hibiki and Hikari] decide to rest beside their [Musubi’s, Hibiki’s and Hikari’s] shared Ashikabi [Minato] and [Musubi’s, Hibiki’s and Hikari’s] future husband in the comfort of the hotel room, Kusano gets lost while [Kusano] sneaking out [Kusano] of [where Kusano sneaks out of] the Sekirei tuning room for [why Kusano sneaks out of the Sekirei tuning room] a look at the outside world and [Kusano] gets lost while [Kusano] on her [Kusano’s] expedition, causing her [Kusano] to be scared and frightened as the young, blonde green-eyed girl [Kusano] navigates the big city [Tokyo]. Due to her [Kusano’s] sheltered upbringing and [Kusano’s] ignorance of the outside world, she [Kusano] wraps her [Kusano’s] already generous bosom with a sarashi in keeping with her [Kusano’s] Sengoku Jidal {warring states period} [the era of Japanese history before the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate] ideals and norms of what a good little girl and young noblewoman in training should be, and [Kusano] poses as a boy while [Kusano] trying to figure her [Kusano’s] way in the strange new environment [Tokyo] she [Kusano] has found herself [Kusano] in. In order to get money for sustenance and shelter, the chlorokinetic green-eyed blonde [Kusano] decides to target small-time criminal groups, Yakuza and Triad cells embedded in Tokyo as well as the somewhat easy pickings of local toughs and delinquents, while [Kusano] remaining disguised as a young boy. Meanwhile she [Kusano] dreams of her [Kusano’s] Ashikabi [Minato], [Kusano] having vague memories of seeing her mother [Takami] holding a picture of her [Kusano’s] older siblings [Minato and Yukari] when she [Takami] was watching them [Minato and Yukari], and [Kusano] wishing that she [Kusano] could know where her [Kusano’s] destined one [Minato] is so that she [Kusano] can bond [be winged] with him [Minato]. As her [Kusano’s] victims [the criminals Kusano targets while she is disguised as a boy for money for food and shelter] never see her [Kusano’s] face when she [Kusano] attacks and defeats them [the criminals Kusano targets while she is disguised as a boy for money for food and shelter], Kusano’s male alias receives the name Kiiroi Senkō [Yellow Flash |Kiiroi Senkō|] due to ‘his’ [Kusano’s male alias’] immense speed and quick, effective takedown of his [Kusano’s male alias’] victims [the criminals Kusano targets while she is disguised as a boy for money for food and shelter]. One day, while [Kusano] walking down the clean, packed and tech-filled streets of the big city, [Tokyo], the green-eyed, plant-manipulating blonde young girl [Kusano] stumbles into a rather tall, attractive and somewhat seductive young woman whose [the young woman who Kusano stumbles into] age hovers somewhere between the end of young adulthood and middle age, with [the young woman who Kusano stumbles into’s] long black hair, [the young woman who Kusano stumbles into’s] sharp, observant purple eyes and [the young woman who Kusano stumbles into’s] well-developed figure, [the young woman who Kusano stumbles into] wearing a very short hanfu [traditional Han Chinese outfit |hanfu|] which [the young woman who Kusano stumbles into’s hanfu] shows her [the young woman who Kusano stumbles into’s] cleavage and [the young woman who Kusano stumbles into’s] belly button. The young woman [who Kusano stumbles into] introduces herself [the young woman who Kusano stumbles into] as Kazehana and [Kazehana] takes a deep sniff before [Kazehana] commenting that the mean streets of a big city [Tokyo] are [Tokyo’s mean streets] no place for a young princess [Kusano], and [Kazehana’s continued commentary] that a young lady [Kusano] shouldn’t be afraid to express her [Kusano’s] true self, which shocks the disguised girl [Kusano]. Kazehana shakes her [Kazehana’s] head before picking up the disguised green-eyed blonde [Kusano] with ease and Kazehana leaping away with the young girl [Kusano] in hand, implying that she [Kazehana] is [what Kazehana is] a Sekirei whose [Kazehana’s] Ashikabi is [whom Kazehana’s Sekirei is] Minato, like Kusano, Musubi, Hibiki and Hikari. As Kusano tries to get used to her [Kusano’s] life at Izumo-sou [Izumo Inn |Izumo-sou|, a massive, extravagant traditional Japanese mansion |Izumo-sou| that |Izumo-sou| also doubles |Izumo-sou| as a guest house, where Kazehana |what Kazehana does at Izumo-sou| now resides |Kazehana| as a tenant] while [Kusano] failing [what Kusano fails to do] to hide [what Kusano fails to hide] her [Kusano’s] wet dreams of her [Kusano’s] and her [Kusano’s] new guardian’s [Karasuba’s] shared Ashikabi [Minato], taking [having sex with] her [Kusano] on their [Minato’s and Kusano’s] wedding night, from [whom Kusano fails to hide her |Kusano’s| wet dreams from] the amused busty, black-haired drunkard temptress [Karasuba], who [Karasuba] decides to tease her [Karasuba’s] unofficial ward [Kusano] so that she [Kusano] will be able to handle him [Minato] when she [Kusano] truly becomes one of his [Minato’s] many wives [Minato’s Sekirei], Minato, Musubi, Hibiki and Hikari all get used to each other [Minato, Musubi, Hibiki and Hikari] as the happy go lucky, somewhat naive and immodest fist-type Sekirei [Musubi] beats up criminals to [why Musubi beats up criminals] get money for their [Minato’s, Musubi’s, Hibiki’s and Hikari’s] sustenance and the twins [Hibiki and Hikari] continue their [Hibiki’s and Hikari’s] legitimate jobs as maids at a local cafe, which [Hibiki and Hikari working as maids] suprises the wandering, black-haired and blue eyed genius ronin [Minato]. Things come to a head when the inevitable meeting with Hibiki’s and Hikari’s adoptive father, the tall, black-haired, black-eyed, somewhat perverted but also streetwise grizzled mercenary and former ROKAF [Republic of Korea Armed Forces |ROKAF|] special forces commando Seo [Hibiki’s and Hikari’s adoptive father], occurs, with Seo being shocked at how clueless his [Seo’s] daughters’ [Hibiki’s and Hikari’s] future husband [Minato] is about the Sekirei Plan [a secret battle royale |the Sekirei Plan| which |Sekirei Plan| consists of Sekirei fighting for the right to wield a Jinki that |the Jinki| grants |what the Jinki gives| a single wish, |the Sekirei Plan| sponsored by Minaka and MBI] but Seo reluctantly giving his [Seo’s] approval to marry his [Seo’s] daughters [Hibiki and Hikari] to the black-haired young man [Minato].

Amidst the grand historical narrative, where Japan reclaims territories and superpowers falter, a story focuses on the unique and domestic lives entwined with fantastical elements and the Sekirei – beings with mysterious powers. Hiroto Minaka, the mad scientist and enigmatic faculty of Tokyo University, partners with his enigmatic lover, the alluring Karasuba – Sahashi Takami in disguise. Their academic lives camouflage the discovery of an alien craft with a treasure trove of Sekirei – including the stunning Miya. As the world outside crumbles, Japan, under the shield of MBI's advanced technological prowess, rises to become a singular superpower. Minaka envisions a world under Japan's divine rule, with Karasuba at his side, both driven by the technology and beings of the shipwreck. In the process, they give birth to three astoundingly gifted children, each with their own destiny intertwined with the fate of Sekirei. Minato, their eldest, leads a life apart from his illustrious parents, unaware of his lineage. Yet, fate connects him with 'Musubi' – who is his sister Yukari's other, more powerful and uninhibited persona, and unknowingly, Musubi wings him as her Ashikabi. As the narrative unravels, Yukari, as Musubi, and Minato are joined by two other Sekirei, Hibiki and Hikari, forming a bond much beyond Minato's comprehension. Kusano, the youngest of Minaka's children, embarks on her own journey in Tokyo's bustling streets, haunted by yearning to find her Ashikabi and her siblings. Under the guise of a boy in search of her family, Kusano tangles with underworld figures, her powers marking her as the 'Kiiroi Senkō'. During her wandering, she runs into Kazehana, a fellow Sekirei seemingly tied to her fate. Meanwhile, the once sober but now jovial cluster of Minato, Musubi, Hibiki, and Hikari spiral into domesticity, their lives taking a comical turn of learning each other's quirks, battling day-to-day life challenges, and indecipherably weaving through what is becoming their extended family. The complex political backdrop fades against the joy and chaos of daily life, where powers are hidden in plain sight. In the extraordinary yet ordinary lives of the Sekirei and their Ashikabi, alliances form, love blossoms, and the sheer force of destiny propels them forwards. Kusano, with Kazehana as her new guardian, clumsily tries to merge into the daily life of Izumo-sou. While she struggles with her infatuation for Minato, Kazehana wryly observes, preparing Kusano for the life she is destined to lead. However, does Kazehana know the true nature of her ward? This becomes an enchanting sub-plot as the older Sekirei teases her young ward, and Minaka watches from afar as his plan unfurls through the lives of his children and their bound Sekirei. As Minato meets Seo, Hibiki and Hikari's adoptive father, the unknowing bachelor faces a reality he would have never fathomed – he is central to a hidden struggle for power and desire beyond the realms of mere human understanding. Quirky and heartwarming, comical and complex, this tale spins through the threads of life's countless possibilities, where divine beings walk amongst humans, cloaked in the subtleties of life, fighting their battles, finding love, and carving out their fate under the shadow of a world embroiled in political mayhem. And at the heart of it all, Minato holds the key, unknowingly binding together a family that defies the very laws of nature."},{"instruction":"I want your help to develop allied characters for an RPG setting. I will begin providing the lore and background of the setting: 500 anos se passaram desde os eventos tumultuados de **A Era Caótica I: Os Deuses da Razão**, um capítulo decisivo na história. Tudo começou durante a Teoclastia, um evento cataclísmico desencadeado quando os Teoclastas, uma raça tecnologicamente avançada, capturaram a poderosa divindade YHVH, resultando na devastação do velho continente de Pectus. Fugindo dos horrores deste apocalipse, os sobreviventes buscaram refúgio nas costas distantes de Yuandi, onde a saga de **A Era Caótica II: A Nova Mitologia** acontecerá. **Teoclastia:** O termo \\"Teoclastia\\", derivado de *Théos* (Deus, Divindade, Divindade) e *Klastós* (Quebrado, Fraturado), encapsula o momento crucial que incitou o êxodo em massa de Pectus. YHVH, o deus da luz e governante do Paraíso, caiu nas garras dos Teoclastas, levando à apoteose de Ptah-Khnemu. Fortalecidos por esta divindade, os Teoclastas tornaram-se uma força imparável, levando Ma'at, que psoteriormente se aliou dos mortais, a revelar que Ptah-Khnemu imaginou um mundo livre do controle das deidades, mas ainda se via indeciso se deveria exterminar os que discordavam de sua visão ou aliar-se com simpatizantes. Uma traição se desenrolou quando Montu-Sekhmet, filha do próprio Ptah-Khnemu, tomou o poder durante o auge da Teoclastia, tendo intenções contrárias às de seu pai, buscando reconstruir o universo do zero. Ma'at, que há milênios foi infundida com uma divindade cujo nome se perdeu com o tempo, escapou das garras de sua própria raça, buscando refúgio em Yuandi para não se tornar uma mera ferramenta ou fonte de poder. Com seu conhecimento tecnológico avançado e habilidades divinas, ela ergueu cinco pilares monumentais, envolvendo o novo continente dentro de uma barreira protetora. Este santuário atraiu não apenas habitantes mortais, mas também divindades menores, temerosas de uma incursão Teoclasta. Após a morte de Ma'at, sua essência se fragmentou, cada fragmento contendo uma parte de suas memórias e poderes, enquanto seus restos mortais foram enterrados no relicário do Arcebispado de Ma'at, onde acredita-se que ainda opera milagres. Após a queda de YHVH, os anjos, anteriormente subservientes à divindade, recobraram seu livre árbitrio, enquanto os demônios foram lançados em desordem após o desaparecimento de seu mestre. O caos que se seguiu levou a um êxodo anárquico do Inferno, domínio de seu senhor ALMF (Alumniferus), resultando em confusão e insanidade, que levou ao suicídiode muitos anjos e demônios. Alguns demônios remanescentes agora se disfarçam de mortais e seres míticos de Yuandi. Embora muitos anjos se esforcem para defender o legado de YHVH através de seus templos, o paradeiro da deusa do caos, NLTP (Niarlatotepe), e do deus das trevas permanecem desconhecidos dentro da barreira protetora. Estas consequências turbulentas e o equilíbrio instável das forças divinas preparam agora o cenário para uma história épica de sobrevivência, lutas pelo poder e alianças em constante mudança dentro de Yuandi. Now for the races' lore: Renshi The Rénshi are one of the native races of the new continent and are the most numerous race. Most inhabit the Ozumi Empire (based on the Empire of Japan), with significant numbers in the Wildlands, the territory of the Followers of Ma'at, and the southern tip of Igirith. The Shun culture, named after the eponymous Shun Dynasty (based on Chinese culture), once almost dominated the entire continent, making them enemies of other races and cultures. The Ozumi Empire, originating from the outlying islands east of the Shun lands, took advantage of the previous empire's weakness during the instability caused by the war against the Theoclasts and seized power. The other cultures under Ozumi's rule consider them tyrants who imagine themselves superior to their own race. They are technologically advanced thanks to a partnership with the Republic of New Medietas. The Ozumi Empire is ruled by an empress who apparently takes direct orders from her divine ancestor, Susa-tsu-Nushi-no-Mikoto. There are several noble clans and a warrior caste that is in decline due to the use of firearms. There are still a few noble clans from other cultures who swore allegiance to Ozumi and were allowed to rule their ancestral lands. The \\"Wild Renshi\\" or \\"Barbarian Renshi\\" live outside of the Ozumi Empire's administration, mostly on the tundra and arctic climates of the far southern portion of the continent. They are mostly hunters, reindeer herders, and fishermen. They wear animal skins, live in tribes, and are very resistant to the cold (based on Inuit and Chukotko-Kamchatkan cultures) their warrior class (akin to the samurai) is in decline due to the widespread use of firearms, thus many warrior clans founded conglomerates and began hiring commoners to work in fields such as metal processing, textiles, weapon fabrication, mass production of arcane goods etc. \\"Archaic\\" practices, such as martial arts, archery, and swordfighting are preserved due to their cultural value and people in the military are still trained for them They have vast natural reserves that their national deity itself deemed sacred so that the nation doesn't lose its natural beauty. That's why most of the Ozumi factories and facilities are located in the mainland on lands traditionally inhabited by the Shun Renshi Humans The humans are the descendants of the humans who fled the Theoclasm on Pectus. They managed to obtain some examples of Theoclast technology during the war and, after reverse engineering, drastically developed their weapons, tools and architecture. The Republic of New Medietas is an example of industrial advancement on the continent. Their society combines coal- and steam-powered machines with magical items. The streets of the largest cities are teeming with citizens amid the rhythmic bustle of machines and the smoke of factories. The citizens of Nova Medietas boast an unwavering work ethic, where labor and industry reign supreme. A resolute commitment to capitalism fuels innovation and competition, driving the relentless pursuit of wealth and economic dominance. Although Nova Medietas does not have a formal clan system, a select group of influential noble houses wield considerable power, guiding the nation's policies and future. These houses are closely linked to prosperous industrial conglomerates. At the forefront of technological progress, the republic is a pioneer in the development of complex automatons and goelms and advanced machinery. Inventors and engineers drive notable advances, positioning the country as an industrial and technological powerhouse. The Republic of New Medietas strategically allies itself with neighboring powers. They maintain a robust partnership with the Sulcaic Empire, reinforcing mutual interests and security. Likewise, friendly relations with the Ozumi Empire promote trade and technological collaboration. Sulkai Since they originated from Yuandi, the logistics of returning most of the Sulkai population from Pectus were simpler. Their empire has remained stable for the ~500 years since the Theoclasm took place. They appreciate refined food and items and place great importance on money and nobility. A good portion of the sulkai settlers in Pectus were merchants. As a general rule, they are gentle, delicate and sometimes passively aggressive. Their society and technology used to be more sophisticated than Pectus's until the humans made incredible advances. Their ship models are still the most used to navigate what little ocean that was left around Yuandi. Their society is loosely divided into castes, but an individual can change social status relatively easily. There are the commoners, the merchants and artisans, the knights and soldiers, the burghers, the elite wizards and the nobility, with the imperial family at the top. Many of the sulkai who came to Pectus seeking to amass wealth returned to the Sulcaic Empire completely poor and in the condition of refugees. Noble families are divided into clans with a semi-mythical ancestor being the founder of the house, a fundamental factor in legitimizing the relevance of a family. They have artifacts, which were supposedly forged by their ancestors. Their tales and stories often involve much more magic and the forces of nature. Superficially they look like pale humans with blue, green, or white hair and blue, green, or grey eyes, but their bodies function in quite different ways. Their longevity is greater, as is the time between childhood and maturity (a 30-year-old sulkai is considered a teenager). Their bodies are lighter and metabolic processes seem to affect their bodies much more, for example it takes much less time for a sulkai to get drunk or for a medicine to take effect. In the rare cases where they interbreed with humanoid races, the resulting progeny are always born sulkai. The incidence of aptitude for magic is extremely high, with 4 out of 5 having the potential. Their susceptibility to cold iron stems from the fact that they are descendants of the same ancestral population that originated the humans and eniyan of Pectus, who then interbred with faeries when they landed from the lost continent in the north of the world. While the nobility holds great importance, heads of banks and commercial enterprises, each with a personal army, and each locked in a constant struggle against all the others, hold great relevance and economic power. They have enough capital to resolve any foreign diplomatic quandaries with a well-placed sum of money or threat of withdrawal from trade. Thus, many conflicts in other nations were resolved by the economic influence of certain organizations and companies. Their religion differs drastically from the Church of YHVH. It is based on semi-mythical ancestor worship, who fulfill a similar role to saints. The existence of gods is recognized, but generally relegated to a secondary role, even if the Theoclasm made them inhabit the Barrier. Their fairy ancestors, or nature spirits, are worshiped instead. They are considered to be more sophisticated and superior to other races, sometimes attracting the hatred of some individuals. They get along especially well with the humans, whom they consider their allies for having granted the Colony of Levantia to the Sulcaic Empire. With the Theoclasm, it was the sulkai's turn to cede territory to their allies. Their aptitude for trade is always welcome in the farthest reaches, and even tribal chiefs seek out the sulkai for business. As mentioned earlier, it has been confirmed that sulkai descended from the union of proto-humans with fairies, or nature spirits. Namely naiads and haliads (water spirits), epigeia and dryads (nature spirits), aureads and boreads (wind spirits). Anglo-Elves Elves and Weisslander humans, after fleeing Pectus during the Theoclasm, unexpectedly found themselves sharing the same land west of the continent of Yuandi. Despite the mutual dislike between both races, they ended up mixing, resulting in the hybrid race known today as the Anglo-Elves. Even before the assimilation between both races, it was noted that children of elf-human couples always resulted in an appearance almost identical to that of humans, without the golden skin, pointed ears and light hair that elves prized. Strangely, the fruits of such unions were always born with red, orange or pinkish hair and elven eye colours (blue, green, golden). Despite the mixing of these two races, there is still an elite of pure elves who govern the nation in a not so explicit way. Culturally, the Anglo-Elves are a fusion of elven and weisslander cultures, with a simultaneous focus on battles and intellectualism, on physical combat and magical combat, among other aspects. There are also a significant number of dark-skinned Anglo-Elves descended from the eniyan of Pectus. Magic is a revered aspect of society, guided by guilds of wizards who educate potential wizards. Approximately half of Anglo-elves show potential for magic, with only a few becoming accomplished wizards. The Anglo-Elves practice a syncretic faith that has characteristics of the faith of YHVH, the ancestor worship practiced by the Elves, and the tribal polytheism of the Weisslanders. Clans can trace their lineages to specific individuals who embarked on the journey fleeing the continent of Pectus. While ancestor worship is typically done in family shrines at home, the worship of YHVH is done in public temples. The Anglo-Elves have long been at war with the Hazrun over territorial claims to an island to the west of both nations. This island, called Haséaleen by the Anglo-Elves and Haşarin by the Hazrun, has one of five pillars that maintain a protective barrier around the continent. The Anglo-Elves already have one of the towers, the Red Pillar, in their territory and want the Black Pillar, stating that Hazrun cannot be trusted to possess it. Mustalf Pectus’ “accursed race” again survives a great cataclysm and finds itself destined to roam another continent without its own land or nation. Unlike the ancient Dark Elves, the Mustalf (In Elvish: Must = Dark; Alf = Elf) no longer live only in underground shelters, currently choosing to live as nomadic traders who roam the nations buying and selling exotic goods. They have a few autonomous territories in Yuandi, and a number of mustalf live in the territory of the Followers of Ma’at. They are considered a cursed race by the elves. Thousands of years ago, the “Bloodstained Emperor” murdered the other three members of the Quadrumvirate and fled from the Sonne Insel archipelago to Pectus’ mainland with thousands of followers, who were later cursed by an unknown deity or altered by a powerful relic of the elves. The Alveglaan elves symbolically interpret the darkening of traitors as the mark of their unforgivable crime. Everyone is expected to work for the good of society, including children, the elderly and women. The Mustalf are trained from childhood to perform certain tasks or jobs and continue to contribute until they are unable to in some way. Their ears are movable and expressive, just like an elf’s. They have no body and facial hair (except eyebrows and eyelashes), which they consider a sign of barbarity. Short hair is socially accepted, both in men and women, but it is seen as a sign of youthfulness and immaturity. Probably as a result of their ancestors living underground, their hearing is sharper and their eyes are sensitive to light. The Mustalf have a strong sense of community and place a high value on loyalty and solidarity with their own kind. They have a tendency to put the needs of the community above the needs of the individual. Many of them consider it essential to learn at least one foreign language, to play at least one instrument, and to know at least one trade, since most of their livelihood depends on trading with different races. Hazrun One of the races native to Yuandi and the third most numerous. The hazrun were dominated for centuries by the Shun Dynasty. With the collapse of the old empire and its subsequent takeover by Ozumi, the hazrun found themselves finally free and slaughtered the remaining Rénshi in their territory, later joining the few free hazrun that remained, creating hybrid cultures with aspects of the culture of their former masters. To prevent another invasion and the enslavement of their people, the Hazrun militarized and today have large armies with highly efficient units, the result of their domestication of draconic species, such as drakes, wyverns, sauroids and avioserps. Many have returned to their old ways of life as reindeer herders, hunters and fishermen to forget their hateful past under another race's rule. Their nation, known as the United Hordes of Jirkaeriya, is ruled by a Soho (Hazrunic: leader, ruler, king), who must be of \\"divine ancestry\\". In case the next leader is not elected peacefully, pretenders can unify the cultures/tribes. The current Hazrun nation is the result of the conquest of Tazkiairga and his wife Huzur, who fought against Tazkiairga's siblings to unify the Hazrun race. Hazrun culture is diverse, with multiple \\"peoples\\" within the same nation. The biggest ones are Berihazrun (“Plain Hazrun”), Keiozhazrun (“River Hazrun”) and Damohazrun (“Mountain Hazrun”). Generally, women have short hair, letting it grow only after marriage, while the opposite occurs with men, who may also cut their hair during military service as a symbol of their “marriage to the nation”. Like the ancient elves, they have no body or facial hair. Women walk with midriff-revealing clothes while single to indicate they are available, but cover them up once they get boyfriends or husbands. The Hazrun wear earrings, necklaces, and body paint with various symbols that other races do not understand. Wars and battles are mostly fought only by men, as hazrun women are naturally physically smaller and weaker. Some hordes have women who specialize in magic and assassination. The most peculiar feature of the hazrun is certainly the presence of horns, which are highly prized in all their cultures. They also have four fingers on each hand and foot, harder nails, and sharper fangs. Individuals with branched horns like those of a deer, called Adarkahazrun (\\"Branched Horn\\"), make up the \\"upper caste\\" of the hazrun, i.e., clan chiefs, rulers, and military leaders. The hazrun see hornless races as unworthy or dishonorable. They are not able to breed with other races, so it is more accurate to refer to them as another species. It is noted that they are very resistant to alcohol and cannot feel spicy tastes very well. Usagizok They have a strong sense of balance and agility, allowing them to move quickly and gracefully through the natural landscapes. Usagizok developed unique cultural practices based on their connection to nature. They have a ritual for thanking the plants and animals they rely on for sustenance and have developed a system of using natural resources sustainably. Their enhanced hearing also plays a role in their culture. They have developed a form of communication in a frequency that only members of their own species can hear. The Usagizok were enslaved by the Shun Dynasty for being exotic and were even seen as pets by some. This led to tensions between the two races even after the fall of the dynasty. The Usagizok have long ears like rabbits or hares, a fur-covered body, resistant claws for digging and very strong leg muscles that enable them to jump higher and farther away than the other races. Their incisors are bigger and stronger due to their mostly vegetarian diet which consists mostly of root vegetables, leaves, and fruits. Some of them have short tails very similar to a rabbit’s. In terms of their current situation, the Usagizok are struggling to find their place in the world since being freed from slavery. They have difficulty integrating into other societies and prefer isolating themselves and live a more nomadic lifestyle in their partially underground warrens. As a result of their enslavement, Usagizok are usually not taken seriously by other races. They may have difficulty finding work or housing outside of their own communities, and may face discrimination or violence. Despite this, the Usagizok have managed to carve out their own niche in society. They are skilled at jobs that require agility, such as acrobatics or hunting, and have developed a reputation as skilled scouts, mercenaries, assassins, and spies due to their heightened senses and physical abilities. Many Usagizok have withdrawn from the larger world and created their own isolated communities, hidden away in forests or other remote areas. These communities are wary of outsiders and have their own unique customs and traditions. The Usagizok are matriarchal; a warren is mostly composed of related members descended from the same maternal ancestor. They are very fertile. A pregnancy lasts for only 4 months and the offspring, often born as quadruplets or triplets, reach childhood in 2 years and sexual maturity in 10. The females in the warren take turns nursing the newborns while the males cultivate plants or go out to trade, forage or hunt. To avoid inbreeding, they have a tradition of visiting other warrens to find suitable spouses. A matriarch can have multiple husbands. Like the Hazrun, they cannot interbreed with other races Usagizok are grappling with their own internal divisions and conflicts between different tribes and factions. This is related both to differences in religious or cultural practices and by more pragmatic concerns such as access to resources or disputes over leadership.","output":"Based on the rich and intricate background you've provided for the setting of **A Era Caótica II: A Nova Mitologia**, I can help you further develop allied characters who could potentially accompany players in this RPG setting. For each of the races, I'll suggest one allied character. Keep in mind these are foundations for characters that can be further developed according to your needs. **Renshi Ally: <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>** A savvy former samurai from a noble clan that has pivoted to industry, Tomoe is trying to balance her respect for tradition with the necessity of innovation. She now uses her combat expertise to protect her family's industrial endeavours but yearns for a higher purpose, feeling somewhat constrained by the business world. **Human Ally: Rowan Fairfax** An idealistic engineer from Nova Medietas, Rowan believes that technology has the power to heal the world's wounds. He seeks to develop gadgets and machinery for peacemaking and rebuilding, rather than conflict. However, he's willing to dive into combat with his inventions if it means protecting innocent lives. **Sulkai Ally: Ariandel Selanthar** A high-ranking, sophisticated wizard with a knack for artifice and money-making, Ariandel is a thrill-seeker who has grown bored with court life. She is on a quest to uncover ancient Sulkai artefacts, hoping to restore her family's prominence which was lost during the journey from Pectus. **Anglo-Elf Ally: Lyanna Redmane** Descendant from an old human family, Lyanna bridges two worlds with her fiery hair and pointed ears. A skilled warrior-mage, she desires to bring peace to the conflicting nations over territorial disputes and believes the pillars should be used for the greater good, not hoarded. **Mustalf Ally: Erevan Underfoot** Disliking the nomadic trade life, Erevan has grown fond of exploration and adventure. Gifted with critical acumen and multilingual prowess, he plays the well-informed guide and mediator, fascinated by the stories and secrets the other races may hold. **Hazrun Ally: Torgar Ironhorn** Possessing a towering presence with impressive branched horns, Torgar is respected in his society but longs for a reprieve from the constant militarization. He believes that understanding and cooperation with other races can fortify the Hazrun position without conflict, seeking diplomatic strength instead. **Usagizok Ally: Mina Swiftfoot** Trained as an assassin but with a heart leaning towards peace, Mina advocates for Usagizok integration into the wider society. She often takes on jobs that others would disdain but uses her positions to slowly change perceptions about her people, while also gathering intelligence for their protection. These characters could provide not only combat and tactical assistance to players but also serve as touchpoints to the varied cultures and struggles present within your game's universe. The allies can lead players through personal quests that intertwine with the larger narrative, helping to explore the world's richness and depth from multiple perspectives."},{"instruction":"Define Business resilience and Business Continuity Planning","output":"Business resilience refers to an organization's ability to adapt to disruptions while maintaining continuous business operations and safeguarding people, assets, and overall brand equity. Business resilience is about anticipating crises that could affect the core of an organization and adapting to them to allow the business to continue functioning effectively. It involves the integration of various strategies such as crisis management, disaster recovery, and contingency planning, with a focus on long-term planning and organizational sustainability. Business Continuity Planning (BCP), on the other hand, is a proactive planning process that ensures critical services or products are delivered during a disruption. It's a key part of business resilience, involving the development of a strategic plan that outlines the steps an organization must take to minimize the negative impacts of disruptions, recover from them, and maintain operations at a predetermined level of functionality. A BCP typically includes: 1. Risk Assessment: Identifying the risks that could lead to business disruption, their likelihood, and potential impact. 2. Business Impact Analysis (BIA): An assessment that identifies the effects of an interruption to critical business operations and establishes recovery priorities. 3. Recovery Strategies: Developing methods and procedures to ensure business continuity in the face of disruptions. 4. Plan Development: Documenting the business continuity procedures and processes. 5. Training and Awareness: Ensuring that staff understands their roles in implementing the BCP. 6. Testing and Exercises: Regular drills to ensure that the BCP works effectively and is up to date. 7. Maintenance and Review: Keeping the BCP current in relation to changes in organizational structure, technology, business processes, and external factors. In essence, while business resilience represents the overarching capacity of an organization to weather adversity and emerge even stronger, BCP is more focused on the specific plans and actions needed to ensure critical business functions continue during and after a disaster."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},I={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},F={key:0,class:"empty-state"},z=["disabled"],K={key:0},R={key:1};function E(n,e,h,f,o,s){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",I,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",P,[(a(!0),i(w,null,x(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),v(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",F,' No results found for "'+c(o.searchQuery)+'".
