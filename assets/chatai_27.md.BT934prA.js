Paragraph: The property in northern Serbia, located next to farmland and a railway line, stored about 100 tons of likely hazardous waste altogether, the country’s environmental protection ministry said. Authorities found it last month, along with another big batch cemented into the walls of a nearby brick factory. A string of similar discoveries has triggered alarms in Serbia, where masses of poorly secured industrial waste are believed to have been dumped or hidden and could pose long-term environmental and public health dangers. The situation arising from decades of neglect, corruption and economic decay is “dramatic,” Serbian Environmental Protection Minister Goran Trivan said. “People actually buried hazardous waste in their own yards as if it were some kind of hidden treasure,” Trivan said in an interview with The Associated Press. “This has to stop.” The problem has come into focus as Serbia and other Balkan nations move closer to joining the European Union, a step that ultimately will require their environmental protection standards to be in line with those in existing EU member countries. Such reforms could take the EU candidates years to achieve. Hazardous waste must be exported from Serbia to places such as Austria, Romania and Switzerland because the country does not have its own processing facilities. The shipments are costly, so some manufacturers and waste-management companies get rid of production residues improperly. The concern about concealed pollutants results from simple math, Trivan said. The country generates some 130,000 to 220,000 tons of hazardous waste every year, and while part of it is either exported or stored properly inside Serbia, a chunk remains unaccounted for, he said. “So, where is it?” Trivan said. “Figures tell us that we could be dealing with serious quantities, possibly thousands of tons.” The way to handle the problem would be to step up government oversight and to introduce harsher sentences for offenders while encouraging private investments in waste management, Trivan said. The ministry has teamed up with the state security agency, the prosecutor’s office and police to locate as much dumped waste as soon as possible. A public campaign urges citizens to report sites where they suspect toxic materials might be stored. Andjelka Mihajlov, an environmental scientist on the Serbian government team working to revise the country’s laws to be in line with EU membership, said the potential damage that hidden toxic hazards pose to the country’s people and environment cannot be estimated. It depends on factors such as the type of substances and where and how they were stowed. “If not handled properly, hazardous waste poses a serious concern for public health,” said Mihajlov, who served briefly as Serbia’s environment minister. Authorities say that out of the more than a hundred companies registered in Serbia to handle hazardous waste, only about a dozen followed proper labeling, storage and disposal regulations. Instead, many waste management firms pocket the money companies pay them and abandon loads that were supposed to be shipped abroad somewhere in Serbia. Officials suspect that was the case with the barrels and plastic tubs found on the property in the town of Pancevo in mid-March. A business named Eko 21 had been hired to deal with production waste disposed of the containers in an inhabited area without fences or any other safeguards to keep the population safe. Residents of a village near the Serbian capital, Belgrade, were warned not to use their wells after dozens of barrels of toxic waste containing carcinogenic benzene were found buried in Obrenovac. The property owner was arrested and faces a prison term of up to five years if convicted of illegally storing dangerous substances. Trivan said unreported waste could have been seeping into the ground for years at a number of as-yet unknown locations, polluting the surrounding water and land. “I am astonished by the level of negligence toward our own lives,” he lamented. Serbia also has unaddressed environmental problems with its waste water; all Serbian cities and many factories dump it straight into rivers. Air quality, drinking water safety and pollution from mines and power plans are worries as well. Trivan acknowledged that his country is lagging at least 25 to 30 years behind in environmental protection, but is optimistic it will steer its way clear. “Nothing has been done for decades and we are now dealing with the consequences,” he said. “But we should not despair. It can be done.” Claim: Long-hidden toxic waste endangers Serbia’s health, EU status.","output":"Long-hidden toxic waste endangers Serbia's health and EU status, as seen in several instances of hazardous waste dump sites being discovered in the country, such as the one in northern Serbia storing about 100 tons of likely hazardous waste. The accumulation of poorly secured industrial waste poses long-term environmental and public health dangers, as chemicals can seep into the ground and pollute water and land. Serbia's hazardous waste management problems must be addressed as the country moves closer to joining the European Union and is required to align its environmental protection standards with existing EU member countries. The country generates 130,000 to 220,000 tons of hazardous waste annually, with a portion remaining unaccounted for. The Serbian government is working to revise its laws and improve waste management to mitigate potential damage to public health and the environment. Insufficient labeling, storage and disposal regulations enforcement have resulted in only a dozen companies out of more than a hundred following proper guidelines. These environmental issues, along with challenges in waste water, air quality, and pollution from mines and power plants, have left Serbia lagging 25 to 30 years behind in environmental protection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Who is at a lower risk for getting throat cancer the future?  Jim and Robert are identical twins both getting their yearly physical check ups at the doctor's office.  They are trying to figure out if they are at risk for any future health problems. Both of them consume the same diet and exercise the same amount, and were both raised in the exact same environment. But, Jim has smoked tobacco frequently for several years and Robert has never smoked tobacco in his life.  Hint: Many different chemical substances cause cancer. Dozens of chemicals in tobacco smoke, including nicotine, have been shown to cause cancer ( Figure below ). In fact, tobacco smoke is one of the main sources of chemical carcinogens. Smoking tobacco increases the risk of cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, and bladder. Using smokeless tobacco can also cause cancer. Other chemicals that cause cancer include asbestos, formaldehyde, benzene, cadmium, and nickel. Answer:","output":"Robert is at a lower risk for getting throat cancer in the future compared to Jim. Even though they are identical twins with the same diet, exercise regimen, and upbringing, Jim has smoked tobacco frequently for several years, exposing himself to the harmful chemicals present in tobacco smoke. Many of these chemicals, including nicotine, have been proven to cause cancer, and tobacco smoke is a major source of chemical carcinogens. Among the various types of cancer that can be caused or exacerbated by smoking tobacco, cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, and bladder are some of the most common. On the other hand, Robert has never smoked tobacco in his life, which means he hasn't been exposed to these harmful carcinogens.

In 1961 a Mennonite University College was named after him in Waterloo , Ontario .  - Friesland (official) or Frisia is a province in the northwest of the Netherlands. It is situated west of Groningen, northwest of Drenthe and Overijssel, north of Flevoland, northeast of North Holland, and south of the North Sea. In 2010, the province had a population of 646,000 and a total area of .  - The Swiss Brethren are a branch of Anabaptism that started in Zürich, spread to nearby cities and towns, and then was exported to neighboring countries. Today's Swiss Mennonite Conference can be traced to the Swiss Brethren.  - In the Christian gospels, the ministry of Jesus begins with his baptism in the countryside of Roman Judea and Transjordan, near the river Jordan, and ends in Jerusalem, following the Last Supper with his disciples. The Gospel of Luke states that Jesus was \\"about 30 years of age\\" at the start of his ministry. A chronology of Jesus typically has the date of the start of his ministry estimated at around AD 2729 and the end in the range AD 3036. Jesus' \\"Early Galilean ministry\\" begins when after his Baptism, he goes back to Galilee from his time in the Judean desert. In this early period he preaches around Galilee and recruits his first disciples who begin to travel with him and eventually form the core of the early Church as it is believed that the Apostles dispersed from Jerusalem to found the Apostolic Sees. The \\"Major Galilean ministry\\" which begins in Matthew 8 includes the commissioning of the Twelve Apostles, and covers most of the ministry of Jesus in Galilee. The \\"Final Galilean ministry\\" begins after the death of John the Baptist as Jesus prepares to go to Jerusalem.  - The Mennonites are Christian groups belonging to the church communities of Anabaptist denominations named after Menno Simons (14961561) of Friesland (which today is a province of the Netherlands). Through his writings, Simons articulated and formalized the teachings of earlier Swiss founders. The early teachings of the Mennonites were founded on the belief in both the mission and ministry of Jesus, which the original Anabaptist followers held to with great conviction despite persecution by the various Roman Catholic and Protestant states. Rather than fight, the majority of these followers survived by fleeing to neighboring states where ruling families were tolerant of their radical belief in believer's baptism. Over the years, Mennonites have become known as one of the historic peace churches because of their commitment to pacifism.

Reuniting with Eno and Lanois, U2 began working on the album in late 1998. After their experiences with being pressured to complete Pop, the band were content to work without deadlines. With Bono's schedule limited by his commitments to debt relief for Jubilee 2000 and the other band members spending time with their families, the recording sessions stretched through August 2000.Released in October of that year, All That You Can't Leave Behind was seen by critics as a \\"back to basics\\" album, on which the group returned to a more mainstream, conventional rock sound. For many of those not won over by the band's forays into dance music, it was considered a return to grace; Rolling Stone called it U2's \\"third masterpiece\\" alongside The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby.

Often we believe that our child will pick up on our values if they live in the same home. While they may pick up many of our values, parents need to remember they are not the only influence in their child's life. These outside values often compete with family values for your child's attention. If we do not make a conscious  effort to _ our children, they may not get instilled at all. I wish I had learned that lesson a little earlier. I thought if I lived my values for my children they would pick them up and make their own. Sometimes this happened and sometimes it didn't. I often see twenty-something \\"kids\\" who have no faith in many of the values of their family in favor of the values of their friends. Children will often pick up the negative you show quicker than the positive, so the positive things need extra focus to set them. Some of the influences your children face every day include their church, their school, their friends, any clubs or sporting groups they are part of and more. Kids spend many hours a day at school and with their friends. Sometimes in the business of life, we suppose our children will obtain that foundation we want for them. Instilling a foundation of family values to sustain  your child requires more than living it in front of them. That is important, but building up your child with this important foundation must become intentional. That means we plan times to gather as a family. We plan activities together that show the values we want to pass on. We talk about our values; we live our values; we discuss the values of others and how they differ from ours; we constantly look for opportunities and make our own opportunities to share these values in word or deed with our children.

Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for Läther (pronounced \\"leather\\"), a four-LP project. Läther encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it. Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast Läther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the Läther material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited promotion.Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands. Drummer Terry Bozzio became a regular band member, Napoleon Murphy Brock stayed on for a while, and... contains an answer for the question: What station played Läther?, what is it ?

Article: IRS head: 'Foolish mistakes' behind Tea Party targeting      By Peter Schroeder -      \\"Foolish mistakes\\" were behind the Internal Revenue Service's targeting of Tea Party groups, the agency's former acting commissioner said Friday.      Steven Miller, who was pushed out as acting commissioner over the controversy, apologized to members of the House Ways and Means Committee even as he maintained that IRS employees were not picking political sides when they set aside Tea Party groups seeking tax exemption for added scrutiny.      \\"I want to apologize on behalf of the Internal Revenue Services for the mistakes that were made,\\" Miller, whose resignation is effective at the beginning of June, said in his opening statement. \\"I do not believe partisanship motivated the practices described ... Foolish mistakes were made by people trying to be more efficient.\\"      Miller appeared before the panel in the first of a series of hearings exploring the IRS scandal.      Russell George, the Treasury watchdog for tax administration who recently authored a report on the practice, is also testifying.      The Treasury report found that IRS agents used inappropriate criteria to identify conservative groups, and demanded unnecessary information from those groups seeking tax exemption, including donor lists or whether any group leaders were considering running for office.      President Obama requested and accepted Miller's resignation Wednesday. He took over the tax collecting agency in November 2012 as acting commissioner, following the departure of IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman at the end of his term.             ||||| Acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller struck a defiant tone on Friday under intense questioning from Republicans who railed against “systemic abuse” at the agency.      In the first congressional hearing probing the agency’s recently revealed practice of targeting conservative groups seeking a tax exemption, Miller apologized for “foolish mistakes” carried out by “people trying to be more efficient in their workload selection.”      Text Size -      +      reset Camp to IRS: 'That is lying' Miller apologizes for IRS      But he strongly pushed back against Republican assertions that the agency is politicized, insisted that the practice of flagging key terms in applications for tax exemptions is legal and even praised a civil servant coming under heavy GOP criticism for working in the agency’s scandal-ridden tax exempt division before helping it implement the health care overhaul.      (Also on POLITICO: Camp: Politics behind IRS leaks)      And he maintained that he didn’t lie to Congress — even though he never revealed the targeting program in response to repeated requests from Republican lawmakers in recent years.      “I did not mislead Congress,” he said. “I answered the questions as they were asked.”      The hearing, which spanned nearly four hours, left Republicans frustrated and yearning for more information.      Miller’s answers “are not very complete,” said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.), who led the hearing. “We’re not done. We found out about this a week ago, so we’re going to continue to examine.”      Miller stepped down on Wednesday at the request of Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. But he told lawmakers at the hearing that he currently remains in the position as the agency transitions to a new leader. President Barack Obama said on Thursday that he appointed Daniel Werfel, the current controller of the Office of Management and Budget, to succeed Miller as acting IRS commissioner next week.      (WATCH: POLITICO Junkies: IRS heads roll - who's next?)      Two things became clear as the hearing played out: The IRS didn’t inadvertently announce the targeting program last year as it initially appeared, and Republicans are dedicated to expanding the scope of their investigation.      Miller indicated on Friday that agency officials had discussed how to talk about the controversial targeting program before Lois Lerner, the director of the agency’s tax exempt division, was scheduled to appear at an American Bar Association conference on May 10.      Her comments that the agency was wrong to flag nonprofit applications if they included the terms “tea party” or “patriot” triggered a firestorm that has held Washington’s attention for a week.      “I believe we talked about that,” Miller said, referring to the discussions in advance of Lerner’s public appearance.      (PHOTOS: 10 slams on the IRS)      Meanwhile, Republicans are making it clear they don’t intend to limit their investigations to the initial news that the IRS gave extra review to groups that used certain terms. Camp is also drawing in other IRS actions that have had conservatives stewing for a long time — like a March 2012 Huffington Post story that he said disclosed confidential donor information for the National Organization for Marriage.      He also cited a ProPublica article that said the IRS had leaked the applications conservative groups had submitted for tax-exempt status.      Meanwhile, Miller maintained the agency’s insistence that no one at the IRS told the White House of its activities.      Miller’s testimony didn’t go far to soothe the outrage that has festered among Republicans. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"The head of a group called the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) said they made some \\"foolish mistakes.\\" They were supposed to treat all groups the same, but they accidentally treated some groups called the Tea Party differently.

Article: Everybody knows that colors are connected with certain feelings. For example, why do some people paint the walls of their rooms yellow and others pink? The same is true in stores. They want us to feel something when we look at their products. Green, for example, tries to show the quality of a product: how good it is for us or for our environment. It also suggests that the product is healthier, has less fat and maybe fewer calories. Red, on the other hand is an aggressive color that is often used for packaging food. Red wants us to become hungry or thirsty. Purple is a kind of color that is often seen as royal. It indicates that it is something special. Producers use purple to show that something is of good quality. Blue is not very often found in food packaging because there are not very many foods that have a blue color. Colors can also have different meaning in different cultures and countries. For example, while the color white is used in many Western countries to represent purity and innocence, it is seen as a symbol of mourning in many Eastern countries. The Egyptian pharaohs  wore white crowns. A white sale is a sale of sheets, towels, and other bed and bath items. A white flag is the universal symbol for truce . A white elephant is a rare, pale elephant sacred  to the people of India, Thailand, Burma, and Sri Lanka. In these countries, something that is a white elephant is either a possession that costs more than it is worth to keep or an item that the owner doesn't want but can't get rid of.

Article: HONG KONG -- Hong Kong Disneyland is too crowded, a senior Chinese tourism official said today, hinting that another Disney Park is necessary to accommodate demand from China's huge population. The comments by Shao Qiwei, director of China's State Administration of Tourism, came a day after Shanghai's mayor Han Zheng said the city was preparing to build China's second Disney theme park. \\"China has a very large population. We now have 1.3 billion people. The market is very large. As far as I know, Hong Kong Disneyland is now very crowded,\\" said Shao, whose comments were broadcast on Hong Kong's Cable TV. The Hong Kong theme park, which opened in September, was widely criticized in January when it turned away hundreds of Lunar New Year holiday makers from mainland China because the park was full. Chaos  erupted when angry crowds tried to force their way into the park. The embarrassing incident prompted a public apology from Hong Kong Disneyland Managing Director Bill Ernest and a dressing down from Hong Kong's leader Donald Tsang. Authorities are carefully studying the issue of overcrowding in preparation for the possible building of the Disney park in Shanghai, Shao said. The official Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesday that no agreement has been reached on the park in Shanghai, quoting senior vice president of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, Leslie Goodman. Hong Kong Disneyland is a joint venture between The Walt Disney Co. and the local government, which shouldered the bulk of the park's construction fees. Question: Why is it necessary to build a Disney park in Shanghai? Answer: A:","output":"It is necessary to build a Disney park in Shanghai due to the increasing demand and overcrowding issues at Hong Kong Disneyland. With China's large population of 1.3 billion people, there is a huge market for theme parks, but the existing Hong Kong Disneyland has been struggling to accommodate the high number of visitors, especially during peak times like the Lunar New Year holiday. This overcrowding has led to incidents such as park visitors being turned away, leading to chaos and criticism. By building a Disney park in Shanghai, it would help to alleviate the pressure on the Hong Kong park and better cater to the vast Chinese market, enhancing the overall visitor experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire.  At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher.  Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford.  Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study.  At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836.

The reviewer has chosen words such as \\"sad\\" and \\"sick sight,\\" both of which are associated with negative emotions and experiences. The word \\"sad\\" may imply that the viewer felt unhappy, disappointed, or even disheartened by the film. This can be interpreted in several ways, such as the movie's content not meeting their expectations, or perhaps causing an emotional reaction that they did not enjoy. Alternatively, \\"sad\\" could refer to the overall quality of the film, indicating that the reviewer felt the production values, acting, or story were subpar. The term \\"sick sight\\" further supports the notion of a negative opinion towards the movie. This phrase could signify that the reviewer found the visuals or content of the film to be distasteful or offensive. In this context, the term \\"sick\\" is generally used in a pejorative manner, rather than implying that the movie was surprising or challenging in a positive way. It is also possible that the reviewer is expressing a negative view of the movie's subject matter. For example, if the film portrays violence, suffering, or other distressing themes, the viewer may be using \\"sad\\" and \\"sick sight\\" to describe their aversion to the content. Hence, the unsettling nature of the movie could be the main reason for the reviewer's unfavorable opinion.

Here is an article: This post is in partnership with the History News Network, the website that puts the news into historical perspective. The article below was originally published at HNN. Myth 1: Emperor Hirohito was a God After the overthrow of the Japanese Shogunate in 1868, the four southern tribes, the Satsuma, Choshu, Saba and Tosa, sought to embed the legitimacy of their new regime by the re-promotion of an eighth century myth that the Japanese Emperor was a God. The myths were set out in two official chronicles, the Kojiki (Record of Ancient Matters: AD 712) and the Nihon Shoki (Chronicles of Japan: AD 720). The powers of the Emperor did not survive as power shifted to the Shogun system and until 1868 the Imperial Japanese family continued to exist largely in obscurity and often in relative poverty. As often happens with revolutionary regimes, a new national identity was required to justify and embed the country’s new military rulers. An infant Emperor Meiji was adopted as the new order’s figurehead and self-justification. Japan’s new regime re-emphasized the role of the Emperor as a living God, making it the heart of an ideological indoctrination taught in the new state school education system. The Japanese Army took this further by the simultaneous incorporation of Bushido (the military scholar code) into its military programs. Thus the overthrow of the Shogun was portrayed less as a revolution and was characterized instead as the Meiji Restoration, a title that gave moral justification to a successful armed insurrection. Myth 2: Hirohito was simply a constitutional monarch forced into war by his generals In March 1946, some nine months after the Pacific War had been brought to an end, Emperor Hirohito made a testament about his role in the war. In a bizarre scene, Hirohito had a single bed set up on which he lay in pure white pajamas on the finest soft cotton pillows. In eight hours of statements, the Showa Tenno no Dokuhaku Roku (Emperor’s Soliloquy: his post-war testament) Hirohito absolved himself for all responsibility for the war by claiming that he was a constitutional monarch entirely in the hands of the military: ‘I was a virtual prisoner and was powerless.’ This was a lie. Although by convention Hirohito behaved as a constitutional monarch, the Meiji Constitution granted him absolute power – he was after all enshrined as a God. On three separate occasions during his rule he had demonstrated his absolute powers; in 1929 he forced the resignation of his prime minister; in 1936 he overruled his military advisors to insist on the harshest treatment of the young officers involved in the coup d’etat known as the 26 February Incident in 1945; and finally in August 1945 he overruled his advisors by insisting on a Japanese surrender. Hirohito had the power to stop Japan’s military adventurism in the 1930s but chose not to. As his former aide-de-camp Vice-Admiral Noboru Hirata conjectured, “What [his majesty] did at the end of the war, we might have had him do at the start.” Myth 3: Hirohito was a peace-loving scientist only interested in ocean mollusks After the Pacific War, General MacArthur’s propaganda machine as well as the Imperial court went into overdrive to convince the world that the Emperor was a peace loving man, a scientist, whose main interest was the study of hydrozoa, microscopic jellyfish. Hirohito was indeed an avid gentleman scientist. However he was also a young man with an interest in the minutiae of military activity. He had a war room built underneath the Imperial Palace in Tokyo from where he could follow Japan’s military adventures in detail. Even the military hierarchy complained at the level of resources needed to update the Emperor. Throughout the war, he mainly wore a military uniform and to celebrate great victories he rode a pure white charger in parades in front of the Imperial Palace. Furthermore, although the Emperor’s court papers were destroyed before the Allies could seize them, it seems clear from contemporary accounts that as Japan’s war situation deteriorated, that he became increasingly shrill in his criticisms of the military, and more insistent on his own strategic suggestions. Myth 4: Hirohito did not know about the Rape of Nanking and the genocide in China The Rape of Nanking was widely reported in the Japanese Press, even relaying in gory detail a competition between officers as to who could cut off most Chinese heads. Hirohito could not have been unaware of these reports particularly as his own family was closely involved in the atrocities in China. His own uncle, Prince Asaka had commanded the Japanese troops at Nanking. As a reward Hirohito gifted Asaka a pair of silver vases and they also resumed their regular games of golf. In a genocide that killed 20 to 30 million Chinese, the Emperor’s relation, Field Marshal Prince Kanin, gave the authorization for the use of gas. Prince Mikasa, Hirohito’s youngest brother, even visited Unit 731 in Manchurian where live vivisection and other experiments were carried out on Chinese and western prisoners. Although unproven, it seems highly unlikely that the inquisitive Hirohito would have been uninformed by his relatives of these activities conducted by the Japanese Army. Like Hirohito, all the imperial family was excused prosecution at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal. Myth 5: Hirohito apologized for Japan’s war crimes in the Pacific War It is variously reported that Emperor Hirohito offered to give a formal apology for Japanese war crimes including the attack on Pearl Harbor. Supposedly MacArthur, in order not to undermine the Tokyo War crimes trials refused to allow this. However if Hirohito had really wanted to issue an apology to the nations of Asia and to the United States he could surely have done so by handing a press release to the international press. In 1975, when asked about the “responsibility for the war,” Hirohito replied, “I can’t comment on that figure of speech because I’ve never done research in literature.” It is an obfuscation that is fully reflected in the Japanese post-war historiography taught in schools and universities. Francis Pike is a historian, journalist and specialist in Asian economics, politics and history. He is the author of Empires at War: A Short History of Modern Asia Since World War II (2009). His latest book is Hirohito’s War: The Pacific War, 1941-1945 (Bloomsbury Academic, 2015).

The son and aide-de-camp to Field Marshal and Reich President Paul von Hindenburg had considerable influence on the appointment of Adolf Hitler as German chancellor in January 1933.","output":"Based on the text provided, it is possible to infer that the sentence \\"1933 was a sad year\\" could be considered true from a certain perspective. The text mentions that Oskar von Hindenburg, a German Generalleutnant, had considerable influence on the appointment of Adolf Hitler as the German chancellor in January 1933. This event was a turning point in German history and marks the beginning of the Nazi era, which later led to the end of the Weimar Republic and the establishment of the totalitarian Nazi regime. This regime was responsible for widespread repression, World War II, and the Holocaust, which collectively caused massive loss of life, destruction, and human suffering. Therefore, associating the year 1933 with sadness can be justified due to the historical consequences of Hitler's rise to power, which Oskar von Hindenburg had a significant influence on. However, it is essential to note that this evaluation is subjective, as the term \\"sad\\" might hold different meanings and connotations to different people.

Interesting one; while Clinton was still in office he was at a fund raising dinner at a restaurant I managed. I met his personal valet from the white house mess, Oscar, and he casually said, if you are ever in DC…. To which I replied, I sure can be! My husband and I made the trip a month or so later, we met up with Oscar for dinner on our first night there. We had just started planning all we wanted to see as it was our first visit there. We had no idea that Oscar would invite us for not one but two private tours of the White House. We saw the oval office, the situation room, the rose garden, the mess, the press room and the OEOB. We even heard Buddy bark! It was a trip I knew I’d never be able to repeat and was very grateful to have had the chance to take. For the fun one…My friend was turning 50 and she wanted a theme destination celebration. 18 of us went to Belize. She went all out.

He gets a bucket of water and says to him \\"I bet i can turn this bucket upside down and no water will fall out\\". His brother doesn't believe him of course. So Adam takes the bucket by the handle and quickly starts spinning it in a circle.  Given Adam stops swinging the bucket, will its centripetal acceleration increase or decrease?  Hint: Centripetal force is, simply, the force that causes centripetal acceleration. Objects that move in uniform circular motion all have an acceleration toward the center of the circle and therefore, they must also suffer a force toward the center of the circle. That force is the centripetal force. For orbiting satellites, such as the moon orbiting the earth or the earth orbiting the sun, the centripetal force is produced by gravity. When an Olympic hammer thrower whirls a massive ball on a chain, the centripetal force is created by the athlete and transmitted by the chain. The answer is:","output":"When Adam stops swinging the bucket, its centripetal acceleration will decrease. This is because the centripetal force keeping the water inside the bucket while it's being swung in a circle is created by Adam's arm and the tension in the handle of the bucket. When he stops swinging it, the centripetal force is no longer being applied, and thus the centripetal acceleration decreases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

By 1973 the Bizarre and Straight labels were discontinued. In their place, Zappa and Cohen created DiscReet Records, also distributed by Warner Bros. Zappa continued a high rate of production through the first half of the 1970s, including the solo album Apostrophe (') (1974), which reached a career-high No. 10 on the Billboard pop album charts helped by the No. 86 chart hit \\"Don't Eat The Yellow Snow\\". Other albums from the period are Over-Nite Sensation (1973), which contained several future concert favorites, such as \\"Dinah-Moe Humm\\" and \\"Montana\\", and the albums Roxy & Elsewhere (1974) and One Size Fits All (1975) which feature ever-changing versions of a band still called the Mothers, and are notable for the tight renditions of highly difficult jazz fusion songs in such pieces as \\"Inca Roads\\", \\"Echidna's Arf (Of You)\\" and \\"Be-Bop Tango (Of the Old Jazzmen's Church)\\".

Possible A: fluidity, hollowness, openness, weakness, instability  Why is \\"fluidity\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Fluidity\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly relates to the observable properties of a substance as it transitions from a frozen (solid) state to a thawed (liquid) state. When a substance is frozen, its molecules are more tightly packed and it has a rigid structure. As it thaws, the substance melts and loses that rigidity. This change is marked by an increase in fluidity, as the substance can now flow more easily and take the shape of its container. The other possible answers are not as relevant to the context of thawing and melting: 1. Hollowness: While substances may have air pockets or gaps inside, this term isn't directly related to the process of freezing or thawing. 2. Openness: This term is rather vague in the context of melting or freezing and does not specifically describe the physical properties or behavior during these processes. 3. Weakness: Although a substance could become weaker as it melts or thaws (e.g., reduced structural strength), this term isn't as specific in describing the physical change that occurs compared to fluidity. 4. Instability: This term more typically refers to chemical or structural instability and is not strongly associated with the melting or thawing process on its own. In conclusion, \\"fluidity\\" is the most appropriate answer among the given options because it specifically and accurately describes the change in properties of a substance as it thaws and melts, which aligns with human common sense."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If they generally don't mind pranks and understand that it's a fun tradition for their child, they could easily brush it off and even find it entertaining.  2. If parents themselves are lovers of April Fool's traditions, they'll most likely enjoy the prank, provided it's safe and playful. They may even appreciate the creativity and effort put into it by their child, Kai. It might also inspire them to retaliate with a prank of their own, turning the situation into a fun family tradition of trying to outdo each other with creative and amusing pranks. 3.

Several companies, refusing to pay the licensing fee or having been rejected by Nintendo, found ways to circumvent the console's authentication system. Most of these companies created circuits that used a voltage spike to temporarily disable the 10NES chip in the NES. A few unlicensed games released in Europe and Australia came in the form of a dongle that would be connected to a licensed game, in order to use the licensed game's 10NES chip for authentication. In order to combat unlicensed games, Nintendo of America threatened retailers who sold them with losing their supply of licensed titles. In addition, multiple revisions were made to the NES PCBs to prevent these games from working. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What did Nintendo do to curb unlicensed game sales?","output":"Nintendo implemented a couple of strategies to curb the sales of unlicensed games: 1. They threatened retailers who sold unlicensed games with the loss of their supply of licensed titles. By doing this, Nintendo created a risk for retailers in selling unlicensed games. The retailers would have to weigh the profits of selling unlicensed games against the possibility of not being able to sell any Nintendo-licensed games. This could potentially mitigate the distribution of unlicensed games. 2. Nintendo made multiple revisions to the NES PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards) to prevent unlicensed games from working. PCBs are used in electronics for mechanically supporting and electrically connecting electronic components. By making revisions to these boards, Nintendo could potentially make unlicensed games incompatible with their devices, thus discouraging the production and sale of such games."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The NAACP argued that although schools were not legally segregated, the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain racial segregation in public schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation, which followed segregated neighborhoods. The District Court held all levels of government accountable for the segregation in its ruling. The Sixth Circuit Court affirmed some of the decision, holding that it was the state's responsibility to integrate across the segregated metropolitan area. The U.S. Supreme Court took up the case February 27, 1974. The subsequent Milliken v. Bradley decision had wide national influence.

Scroll through the list of drives and folders on the left until you find the one that contains the files you want to save to your USB drive.  Personal files are often stored in the “Documents” folder (sometimes called “My Documents” or “Joe’s Documents,” if your name is Joe). If you are looking for photos or music you’ve saved to your computer, try looking in the “Pictures” and “Music” folders. USB ports are located in different places, depending on your computer. Desktop computers often have these ports on the front panel of the unit, though sometimes you’ll find them on the rear of the monitor. Laptops generally have USB ports on both sides of the device. You can copy files to any folder on the USB drive.  Your system likely popped up a dialog box a few moments after the device was connected. One of the options should be “Open folder to view files.” Click that link to arrive at the root (main folder) of your USB drive. Files can be copied right to this folder, or to any folders you see here. If no window pops up, press ⊞ Win+E to open a new Explorer window, then double-click the name of your USB drive on the left side of the screen. It should be called something like “USB Drive” or “Removable Storage,” or perhaps the name of its manufacturer (e.g., “Sandisk”). Creating a new folder with a memorable name will help you stay organized. To create a new folder on your USB drive, press Ctrl+⇧ Shift+N, then type a folder name (e.g., “Personal,” “Photos,” etc). Press ↵ Enter. Double-click the new folder to open it. With both Explorer windows open (one to the computer, the other to the USB drive), drag a file from the computer to the USB drive. Dragging a file to the USB drive will create a new copy of the file without deleting the original on the USB drive.  To copy multiple files at once, hold down the Ctrl key and single-click each file. When all of the correct files are highlighted, click anywhere in the highlighted area and drag the group of files to the USB drive. You can also copy entire folders to your computer by dragging them in the same way. If you have a file open in a program like Microsoft Word or Photoshop, you can save it directly to the USB drive without having to drag it between Explorer windows. Click “File,” then “Save As,” and select a save location on the USB drive. To ensure you don’t harm the data on the USB drive, you’ll need to safely eject the drive.  At the bottom right corner of the screen by the clock, find the USB icon (depending on your version of Windows, it may have a green checkmark over it). Right-click the icon, then choose “Safely eject.” When you see a confirmation that says “It’s safe to unplug your device,” you can remove the USB drive from the port.","output":"This article teaches you how to save files from your computer to a USB drive.

Article: Women teachers are holding back boy students by blaming them for typically male behavior, according to a new study. Women teachers are always saying that boys are \\"silly\\" in class. They refuse to \\"sit nicely like girls\\" and are more likely to be addicted to \\"schoolboy tricks\\".Women teachers may also keep low expectations of boys' academic achievement and encourage girls to work harder by letting them think they are cleverer than boys. The study suggests that under-performance among boys in most national exams could be linked to lower expectations of their women teachers. The researchers did their research mainly on women teachers, since nearly 90 percent of primary school teachers are female. According to the research, women teachers said they often found boys' play in the classroom or in the playground, such as playing with toy guns. The researcher also found that boys were often punished and urged to follow a more feminine style of play instead of being taught how to play responsibly with their favorite toys by their women teachers. Bonny Hartley, the study's lead author, said, \\"By seven or eight years old, children of both boys and girls believe that boys are less focused, less able, and less successful than girls -- and think that adults admit this idea. There are signs that these expectations have the potential to become self-fulfilling in influencing children's achievement. Boys are really held back by their women teachers.\\" Question: What is the women teachers' attitude towards the boys? - They encourage boys to work harder at their lessons. - They keep the same expectations of boys and girls. - They are always thinking that boys are silly in class. - They think boys are cleverer than girls in their studies.

Their sound is hard rock mixed with blues rock influences, with songs including \\"Bad Boy for Love\\", \\"Rock 'n' Roll Outlaw\\", \\"Nice Boys\\", \\"We Can't Be Beaten\\" and \\"Scarred for Life\\". Their first four albums were produced by Harry Vanda and George Young who also worked with AC/DC. They disbanded in 1987, subsequently reforming briefly in 1993 to support Guns N' Roses on an Australian tour. Anderson mounted his solo career from mid-1987. He released the ballad, \\"Suddenly\\" as a single. It was taken from Beats from a Single Drum, which was then re-released as his debut solo album in 1988. \\"Suddenly\\" had little chart success until it was used on television soap opera, Neighbours for the wedding of characters Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan) and Charlene Mitchell (Kylie Minogue). \\"Suddenly\\" peaked at No. 2 in September 1987 and was kept out of top spot by Minogue's debut single, \\"Locomotion\\". In the early 90s, Anderson tried to reunite Rose Tattoo, but the death of Royall, who died in 1991 of cancer while trying to overcome substance abuse in the form of a heroin addiction and alcoholism, stalled the reformation.  In an interview with Australian journalist Nick Milligan on 25 March 2011, Anderson explained, \\"I was in Los Angeles in 1989 recording an album which the 'Bound For Glory' single came off and I was hanging around with the Gunners and a lot of other LA bad boy rock bands that we supposedly influenced. I realised then that apart from the fact that I was there to establish myself as a singer songwriter, there was still this great following for the band. I rang up the other members and said 'Let's reform. We've been apart for three years or more.' It was long enough for us to settle our differences and let all the wounds heal. I rang up each of the original members that were still interested and they all said, 'Yeah, let's get together.' So I said we should negotiate a deal where the band can come over and record in Los Angeles. But, of course, that was the year that our original drummer \\"Digger\\" Royall kicked his heroin habit. While he was recovering on methadone, cancer exploded through his body, quite sadly. That was the irony of it, because the cancer had been suppressed by the heroin addiction. Within months he was dead. That shook the band so badly on a personal level, because we had been so enthusiastic to reform. We didn't reform until '92. In '93, the word got around, because we had reformed with our existing drummer Paul DeMarco. The Gunners heard we were out playing again and said, 'We want you to do our support gigs throughout Australia.' We did those two Guns N' Roses raceways gigs - Eastern Creek in Sydney and the raceway down in Melbourne.\\"  Rose Tattoo supported Guns N' Roses on the Australian leg of their Use Your Illusion Tour. Anderson, Wells, Cocks, Leach and new drummer Paul DeMarco from Wells' solo band reunited for the 1993 tour. The reunion was brief and each returned to solo projects.  Around this time, ex-members of Rose Tattoo formed a short lived band with ex-Candy Harlots vocalist Aiz Lynch. This band had numerous rehearsals, but only recorded one demo before disbanding.

Check your school’s website or contact the office in charge of graduation to confirm the dress code. If there isn’t a dress code, you should still attempt to look put together and professional. Pick a solid-colored or striped dress shirt with a collar, and add a coordinating tie. Opt for a pair of neutral-colored slacks or dress pants to round out the outfit, and wear a belt with your shirt tucked in.  If you live in a warm climate, you could also wear a polo shirt with a collar. To show off your school spirit, you can match your tie to the color of your robe or the school colors. Choose a dress in a neutral color, like white, tan, gray, navy, or black. If you’re wearing a skirt and a blouse, stick to a solid-colored top that’s easy to pair with a bright color. Pick a knee-length skirt in a solid color to add dimension to the outfit. Make sure the skirt or dress is an appropriate length for a professional occasion, but not so long that it sticks out of the bottom of the gown. Leave your purse or backpack at home for graduation, and stick to just the necessities, like your keys, phone, and wallet. If you’ll see your family before the ceremony, drop off your bag with them to retrieve it later.

Mr. Gallup, who died Monday at age 81, served for many years as corporate spokesman and with his brother Alec was co-chairman of the Gallup Poll.      \\"George had this unusual combination of training at his father's knee in polling, the scientific ascertainment of public opinions, and also a passion for religion,\\" said Frank Newport, Gallup's editor in chief.      In ... ||||| George Gallup Jr., who led the firm that his father made all but synonymous with polling and expanded it to become a barometer of Americans’ views on religion as well as their political attitudes, died on Monday in Princeton, N.J. He was 81 and lived in Princeton.      He learned he had liver cancer a year ago, his daughter Alison said.      Mr. Gallup had once considered becoming an Episcopal priest, and after graduating from Princeton with a degree in religion in 1953, he went to Texas to work in a ministry on Galveston Island. But the pull of the family enterprise proved stronger, and he joined his older brother, Alec, at his father’s firm, serving as an executive from the mid-1950s until his retirement in 2004.      While Mr. Gallup lamented late in his life that politicians follow polls rather than their conscience, he echoed his father in arguing that polling was vital to democracy. “It’s removed power out of the hands of special interest groups,” he said in an interview on PBS a few years ago. “It’s given people who wouldn’t normally have a voice a voice.”      Surveying American views on schools, families and institutions, he used the results to paint a portrait of the nation. “The mood of America is one of disillusionment,” he declared in 1973 as Watergate dragged down the approval ratings of President Richard M.

Fill your container with some water from the pond. Then scoop some duckweed from the pond with your hand and place the duckweed into your container.  Place the lid on the container to prevent splashing while you bring the duckweed home. Between 50-100 duckweed pods will be enough as they will grow and multiply quickly. You'll need potassium permanganate to disinfect the duckweed. Mix one teaspoon of this chemical in 12 gallons (45 L) of water. Place the duckweed into the permanganate solution for 30 seconds or so.  Potassium permanganate can be bought at your local pharmacy. Disinfecting the duckweed will make sure that it is free of pests and bacteria. This will help you create a suitable environment for the duckweed to thrive in. Fill the tray with freshwater and add the duckweed to it. Use freshwater from a pond for best results but you can also use tap water. You need to use freshwater as duckweeds  are freshwater plants. This is why they only grow in ponds and not at sea. Salt water will kill the duckweed. The best place to put the tray is right next to a window that receives at least 10 hours of sunlight each day. Like many plants, duckweed will thrive in direct sunlight. If you see duckweed in a pond, notice how the pond is almost completely without any shade and receiving plenty of sunlight. If you can't put duckweed near a window that receives 10 hours of sunlight, you can also use fluorescent light bulbs to help them grow. For best results, place the light bulbs 15 inches (38 cm) above the tray. The duckweed won't grow under these light bulbs as well as it would with direct sunlight. Check the tray a couple of times a day and remove damaged duckweed from the tray. Replace the water in the tray with more freshwater. It will take 10 days or so for the duckweed to multiply. If transferring the duckweed to a pond in your garden, make sure that the pond is receiving plenty of sunlight. If you're moving the duckweed to an aquarium, make sure that the aquarium lid has a light source attached to it.  Duckweed requires no further care or maintenance once it's in your pond or aquarium. You can get a suitable net in your local garden store.","output":"This article talks about how to get and grow duckweed. Duckweed is a tiny plant that grows in ponds.

How can you clean your eyelashes and eyes naturally? And also, how can you regrow eyelashes? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. The first question asks about removing an eyelash in the eye, while the second question covers cleaning eyelashes and eyes and regrowing eyelashes. Let me provide you with information for each question: 1. How to remove an eyelash in your eye: Step 1: Wash your hands with soap and water to ensure they are clean before touching your eye. Step 2: Look in the mirror to locate the eyelash. Step 3: Blink your eyes repeatedly to encourage tears, which may help to flush out the eyelash naturally. Step 4: If blinking doesn't help, try pulling your upper eyelid over your lower eyelid; this could help dislodge the eyelash. Step 5: If the eyelash is still in your eye, use a cotton swab or a clean tissue to gently wipe the corner of your eye, attempting to move the eyelash towards your tear duct. Step 6: If all other steps fail, seek the help of a medical professional to remove the eyelash. 2. How to clean your eyelashes and eyes naturally, and how to regrow eyelashes: To clean your eyelashes and eyes naturally: - Use a gentle cleanser, such as a mixture of water and baby shampoo. - Apply the cleanser with a clean cotton ball or pad. - Use gentle, sweeping motions to clean the eyelashes and the surrounding eye area. - Rinse thoroughly with clean water and pat dry with a clean towel. To regrow your eyelashes: - Maintain a healthy diet with nutrients like biotin, vitamin E, and omega-3 fatty acids which promote hair growth. - Avoid rubbing your eyes, which can lead to eyelash breakage or loss. - Use an eyelash serum with growth-stimulating ingredients like peptides or castor oil. Apply it to the lash line as directed. - Be cautious when using false eyelashes or eyelash extensions, as they can damage natural eyelashes. Choose hypoallergenic glue and remove them carefully. - Be gentle when removing eye makeup, using a mild makeup remover to avoid breakage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I've been \\"living\\" out of this coffee shop since it opened, so this review is long overdue.  Matador has the best coffee in the country-- hands down.  I honestly can't drink anything else.  When I travel, my wife & I always pack along a couple of pounds of Matador coffee.  (We have back-up Matador coffee stashed at both of our in-laws' houses, too)!  Ususally, I buy/drink the Espresso Roast, or the French.  However, the Mocha Java is the best-- ever!  In the shop, I'll get Americanos or Lattes.  The Americanos are always made just right.  Y'know...  with that slight frothy top-layer. This is a family-owned business with a long-lineage of coffee roasting and cafe operation.  They know what they are doing.  Everyone who works here is great too--  knowledgable, friendly, & fast baristas.  Great environment.  The shop is decorated w/ vintage matador/spanish bullfighting posters and old italian renaissance paintings.  Great music always on their soundsystem -always changes depending on the barista - but it usually varies between, jazz (big band, crooners, beebop), underground garage rock, indie, electronica & downtempo, 90s and new wave.  Cool, friendly diverse crowd always here--  families, college kids, hipsters, business ppl laptopping, artists, people on dates, etc.  The evenings here are great too.  They transform the space into a wine cafe w/ \\"afterhours\\" specialty coffee drinks (like the Mafia Hit - scotch & amaretto in a cappucino) + an evening menu of various apps and hummus platters.  They dim the lights and all the tables are candlelit, btw.  Makes for a nice vibe- think old italian cafe.  Great spot for the wife & I to bike/beachcruise to and grab a glass of wine in the evenings.  PS- they distribute their coffee to many other establishments around town.

Plot title: Don't Say a Word Movie plot: In 1991, a gang of thieves steal a rare 10-million gem, but, in the process, two of the gang double-cross their leader, Patrick Koster (Sean Bean) and take off with the precious stone. Ten years later, on the day before Thanksgiving, prominent private practice Manhattan child psychiatrist, Dr. Nathan R. Conrad (Michael Douglas), is invited by his friend and former colleague, Dr. Louis Sachs (Oliver Platt), to examine a disturbed young lady named Elisabeth Burrows (Brittany Murphy) at the state sanatorium. Having been released from prison on November 4, Patrick and the remaining gang members break into an apartment which overlooks Nathan's apartment, where he lives with his wife Aggie (Famke Janssen) and daughter Jessie (Skye McCole Bartusiak). That evening, Patrick kidnaps the psychiatrist's daughter as a means of forcing him to acquire a six-digit number from Elisabeth's memory. As Nathan visits Elisabeth, she is reluctant at first, but he gains her trust laterâespecially when he reveals that his daughter has been kidnapped and will be killed if he doesn't get the number they want. Dr. Sachs admits to Nathan that the gang who kidnapped Jessie also kidnapped his girlfriend to force him to acquire the number from Elisabeth. Sachs is then visited by Detective Sandra Cassidy (Jennifer Esposito) who reveals to him that his girlfriend has been found dead. Meanwhile, Aggie hears Jessie's voice and realizes the kidnappers reside in the apartment nearby. The kidnappers send one of them to kill Aggie while the others escape with Jessie, but Aggie sets an ambush and kills him. After Nathan takes Elisabeth out of the sanatorium, she remembers certain events regarding the gang. It is revealed that Elisabeth's dad was a member of the gang that committed the robbery ten years prior and that he double-crossed them and took the stolen gem.

Spectator: You might be attending the hotdog competition to watch and enjoy the event as a spectator. Many people go to competitions to witness the excitement, skills, and talents of the participants. 2. Supporter: You could be going to the hotdog competition to cheer for and encourage a friend or family member participating in the competition, showing your support and enthusiasm for their efforts. 3. Event staff or volunteer: It's possible that you are attending the hotdog competition as a staff member or volunteer to help with various tasks required to organize and execute the event, such as setting up the venue, registering participants, or cleaning up afterward. 4.

We have this math problem: -3 * q - 319 = -32 * q First, we want to make all the q's be together. So, let's add 32*q to both sides of the equation. When we do that, we get: -3 * q + 32 * q - 319 = -32 * q + 32 * q Now it looks like: 29 * q - 319 = 0 Now, we want to move the 319 to the other side. We do this by adding 319 to both sides of the equation. Here's what it looks like now: 29 * q - 319 + 319 = 0 + 319 This simplifies to: 29 * q = 319 Now, to find out what q is, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 29: q = 319 / 29 After we do the division, we find that: q = 11 So, our answer is q = 11.

Two Tomatillo Salsas Andrew Scrivani for The New York Times Iâve always had a weakness for green salsa made with tomatillos, so when I stumbled upon a stall at a small farmersâ market selling beautiful firm, purple-tinged tomatillos last week, I bought them on impulse. I let the other produce at the market guide my decisions about the taco fillings I now knew Iâd be working on in the coming days. That wasnât difficult; the same farmer who had the tomatillos had pink-skinned potatoes and red onions. I bought corn and squash, cilantro and beautiful green beans at other stands. And now I had a great destination for the serrano chiles that were ready in my garden. Tomatillos, which are closer botanically to the gooseberry than to the tomato, have a wonderful acidic tang. Theyâre low in calories and a good source of iron, magnesium, phosphorus and copper, as well as dietary fiber, vitamin C, vitamin K, niacin, potassium and manganese. To get the best out of them they should be simmered or grilled for about 10 minutes, until theyâre soft and the color has gone from pale green to olive. You can use them for a quick, blended salsa and also for a cooked salsa, which has a rounder, seared flavor. I made both last week and used them with different taco fillings. The salsas keep well in the refrigerator and Iâm enjoying the leftovers with just about everything I make, from scrambled eggs to grilled fish to plain corn tortillas that I crisp in the microwave. I could eat both of these green salsas with a spoon. The quick fresh salsa is the tangier of the two. 1 pound tomatillos, husked and rinsed 2 to 4 jalapeÃ±o or serrano chiles, seeded for a milder salsa, coarsely chopped 1/4 cup chopped onion, soaked for 5 minutes in cold water, drained and rinsed 1/4 to 1/2 cup coarsely chopped cilantro (to taste) Salt to taste (about 1/2 teaspoon) 1/4 to 1/2 cup water, as needed 1. Place the tomatillos in a saucepan, cover with water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes, flipping them over halfway through, until softened and olive green. Remove from the heat. Transfer to a blender. Add the chiles, onion, cilantro, and 1/4 cup water to the blender and blend to a coarse puree. Transfer to a bowl, add salt, and thin out as desired with water. Taste and adjust salt, and set aside for at least 30 minutes before serving, to allow the flavors to develop.

Place the tomatillos in a saucepan, cover with water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes, flipping them over halfway through, until softened and olive green. Drain and place in a blender. Add the chiles, chopped onion, garlic, salt, and cilantro sprigs. Blend until smooth. 2. Heat the oil in a large, heavy saucepan or skillet over medium-high heat until it ripples. Drizzle in a drop of tomatillo purÃ©e to test the heat. If it makes a lot of noise and sputters immediately, the oil is hot enough. Add the tomatillo purÃ©e, and stir constantly until it thickens and begins to stick to the pan, about 5 minutes. When you run your spoon down the middle of the pan it should leave a canal. Stir in the stock, bring to a simmer, and simmer 10 to 15 minutes, stirring often. The sauce should coat the front and back of your spoon. Taste and adjust seasoning. Remove from the heat. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches. Yet, the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective.

Napoleon Bonaparte, having kept his guardians from killing the pair, exchanges his physicianâs services with Edmond for the delivery of a letter to a Monsieur Clarion.

Scientists say the creature defies the convention on how reptiles evolved and flourished. Their research is published in the journal Current Biology. The new fossils, found in a New Mexico quarry, suggest Drepanosaurus was the size of a cat and lived in the trees. It had a bird-like head on a chameleon-like body, but the most unusual feature was its forearms, said Dr Adam Pritchard, of Yale University, who led the research. \\"Drepanosaurus itself has extremely massive arms and forearms - very muscular,\\" he said. \\"The index finger is much much larger than any of the other fingers and supports this gigantic claw, which is easily the most massive bone of the entire arm.\\" The forelimbs of tetrapods are known for their versatility, used to walk, dig, fly or swim. However, the basic plan of the forelimb has stayed much the same throughout 375 million years of evolution. \\"The arm of tetrapod animals almost always follows some very consistent rules,\\" Dr Pritchard said. The US team made 3D reconstructions of the reptile based on micro-CT (computerised tomography) scans of dozens of bones. Other fossils that have been unearthed were partly crushed, making interpretation difficult. \\"In your forearm, in the forearm of Tyrannosaurus rex, in the forearm of an elephant, you have two bones - the radius and the ulna, which manifest as these elongate, slender, parallel shafts,\\" he explained. But the Drepanosaurus did not have these parallel bones. \\"So all of these consistent patterns that we see across a huge range of tetrapods, regardless of their ecology, regardless of their ancestry, are violated by this animal,\\" Dr Pritchard said. \\"On the one hand, it extends the bounds of what we think the arm of tetrapod animals - those four-footed animals in the world - is capable of in terms of its development, in terms of evolution. \\"And, it is also remarkable in what it evidences about the ecology, the lifestyle of the animal, in that it seems to have quite independently developed adaptations that we see today in modern groups like anteaters.\\" Palaeontologist Dr Nicholas Fraser, of National Museums Scotland said the Triassic period was a \\"melting pot of experimentation\\". \\"The unconventional rules in the Triassic,\\" he said. \\"Here is another animal which is completely unconventional in the way it has got this system of bones in the limb to help it dig - those are massive claws too.\\" Drepanosaurus disappeared at the end of the Triassic and did not lend its form to any future creatures. \\"It was only useful in this one particular instance, where you have got a really specialised fossorial animal - a digger,\\" Dr Fraser said. \\"But it is the first real departure like this in the basic ground plan that you see ever since the first tetrapods invaded land 365 million years ago.\\" The researchers say they are continuing to excavate the quarries in New Mexico, with the hope of finding more discoveries. \\"There's a lot - especially in terms of the smaller animals in the fossil record - that has remained undiscovered,\\" said Dr Pritchard. \\"I don't see an end to it.\\" Follow Helen on Twitter @hbriggs.","output":"Fossils discovered in a New Mexico quarry indicate that the long-extinct Drepanosaurus evolved with unique muscular forearms, topped with large hooked claws, which were used to pull insects from bark, in a similar manner to modern day anteaters. Drepanosaurus is the only reptile thought to have evolved in this way during its existence in the Triassic period. Dr. Adam Pritchard from Yale University led the research and the team constructed 3D visualizations based on CT scans of dozens of bones to determine the distinctive arm structure. Typically, forelimbs of tetrapods have not changed much throughout 375 million years of evolution, making the Drepanosaurus an interesting exception."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Do you know how it came about? The tea bag was invented in 1908 by Thomas Sullivan, an American tea seller. He was sending out free tea in silk bags for people to try. People put the bags together with the tea leaves into the cup and added  hot water. The tea tasted good, and people thought it was easy to clean the cup. They were not happy when Sullivan started sending them loose   tea again. Sullivan realized that he had a hot new thing in his hands, and he built a machine to pack the bags. As tea bags became popular, they were changed from silk to gauze   and later paper. In 1952, Lipton Tea made the tea bag even more popular with its invention of the four-sided tea bag. Tea bags were soon a hit in the UK, and today 85%of the tea in the UK is packed in paper bags. However, many people still prefer loose-leaf tea.  This is because some tea companies put not very good tea in their tea bags. But for most drinkers, tea bags are still the easy and tasly way to go.

Titan is unique in our solar system because of its dense nitrogen-methane atmosphere. Moon has seasons just like Earth - but each lasts over seven years.","output":"Title: Gigantic Polar Clouds of Hydrogen Cyanide Unveiled on Titan: Exploring the Unique Seasonal Phenomenon in our Solar System Introduction: A recently observed phenomenon on Titan, Saturn's largest moon, has led to the discovery of gigantic polar clouds composed of hydrogen cyanide. Titan has long been considered a unique celestial body due to its dense nitrogen-methane atmosphere. However, one lesser-known fact about this moon is that it experiences lengthy seasons, much like Earth, with each season lasting over seven years. In this article, we will shed light on these fascinating findings and delve into the environmental factors that contribute to Titan's distinctive climatic cycle. Section 1: Titan's Unique Atmosphere Titan's atmosphere mainly consists of nitrogen (around 98%) and methane (approx. 2%). Its massive atmosphere extends as far as 10 times the Earth's atmospheric height, making it the only moon in our Solar System known to have such a dense atmosphere. The methane present interacts with sunlight, resulting in a thick haze over the moon. The haze particles slowly combine with other hydrocarbons, forming complex molecules like hydrogen cyanide. The presence of such molecules adds to the uniqueness of Titan's atmospheric composition, making it a point of interest for astronomers and planetary scientists. Section 2: Gigantic Polar Clouds of Hydrogen Cyanide Recently, observations carried out by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) telescope have revealed gigantic polar clouds primarily composed of hydrogen cyanide, towering high in Titan's atmosphere. These clouds consist of a mixture of gaseous hydrogen cyanide and icy grains of the same compound. Researchers were particularly intrigued by their towering heights, some reaching nearly 124 miles (200 kilometers) above the surface.  The formation of these towering hydrogen cyanide clouds is closely linked to Titan's unique seasonal changes. The temperature differences between the equator and poles result in atmospheric circulation, effectively moving heat generated near the equator towards the poles. As warm air from the equator rises and moves poleward, the air is gradually cooled, resulting in the formation of clouds consisting of hydrogen cyanide at high altitudes. Section 3: Titan's Changing Seasons Titan orbits Saturn at a tilted angle, much like Earth's axial tilt in its orbit around the Sun. This tilt results in similar seasonal changes in which different parts of the moon experience varying amounts of sunlight throughout its year, which is equivalent to approximately 29.5 Earth years. Each of Titan's four seasons lasts approximately 7.5 Earth years.  During their respective winter season, both of Titan's poles are subjected to prolonged darkness. This absence of sunlight allows the winter pole to cool down significantly, causing the atmosphere to condense into clouds. As Titan transitions into spring, sunlight begins to reach the pole again, allowing the hydrogen cyanide clouds to dissipate. Researchers have discovered a similar pattern of cloud formation and dissipation over each of Titan's poles throughout its seasonal cycle. Conclusion: Titan's unique atmosphere, gigantic polar clouds of hydrogen cyanide, and prolonged seasons provide valuable insights into the diverse celestial bodies that make up our Solar System. The recent observations from the ALMA telescope have addressed several questions about Titan's atmospheric dynamics while raising new ones. Future missions to Titan might be able to probe deeper into the origins and formation of these clouds and reveal more about the fascinating chemistry and climate of Saturn's largest moon. Understanding these phenomena is crucial as it can potentially help researchers uncover more about the delicate balance between climate, atmosphere, and celestial dynamics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer to this question is:","output":"This review depicts the product in a mostly flattering light, as the reviewer shares their positive experience with the product's measurements, construction, and overall build quality.  Firstly, the reviewer addresses the concerns about the jack diameter mentioned in other reviews by confirming that the one they received was sized correctly, as measured with a micrometer. This reinforces the idea that the product is manufactured according to the provided specifications and could potentially ease the doubts of potential buyers who have read the negative reviews. The mention of construction quality being solid further supports the positive depiction of the product. The reviewer's remark about the product seeming solid indicates that it is well-built and is likely to withstand usage over time, which is an essential factor for customers when making purchasing decisions. However, it is also important to note that the reviewer adds a minor qualification by stating that \\"only time will tell\\" regarding the overall durability of the product. This statement could suggest a hint of uncertainty but does not necessarily cast the product in an unflattering light, as it acknowledges the fact that any product's true longevity can only be gauged through long-term use.  In summary, the review largely portrays the product in a flattering light by emphasizing accurate measurements, solid construction, and the potential for durability. The small detail about uncertain longevity does not significantly detract from the positive aspects presented in the review, making it an overall favorable evaluation of the product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(B). positive.).","output":"Title: Disappointment's Gala Review: Disappointment's Gala is a film that aims high but falls woefully short of its ambitious aspirations. As a negative review points out, the film is riddled with a multitude of issues that detract from the overall experience. To begin with, the plot is flimsy and filled with glaring inconsistencies. The film attempts to weave a complex tapestry of interconnected lives, but what unfolds is more akin to a tangled mess of threads. The story feels forced and difficult to follow, resulting in a disorienting narrative that leaves viewers frustrated and dissatisfied. Moreover, the characters are shallow and lack depth, which can be attributed to the weak, one-dimensional script. The dialogue is cringe-worthy, filled with cliches and stereotypes that undermine the unique voice each character should ideally possess. It is clear that the writer took no time to provide the characters with distinct personalities, motivations, or histories, thereby leaving the audience feeling no emotional connection to their plights. The pacing of Disappointment's Gala is ponderous and laborious. The 90-minute runtime feels inexplicably stretched out, with too many unnecessary scenes that add little to the story. The editing fails to provide the film with a coherent structure, resulting in a plodding narrative that would surely have viewers checking their watches throughout the duration. Additionally, the film suffers from poor production value, with shoddy cinematography and subpar special effects that make it appear as though the film was shot on a minuscule budget. The talent of the cast is wasted on the subpar material, as the actors struggle to deliver believable performances with such lackluster dialogue and direction. Ultimately, even with a few good performances, the film becomes a chore to watch due to the various technical issues. Lastly, the film's score is a cacophony of jarring, discordant musical cues that only serve to further undermine the viewing experience. The music never quite seems to mesh with the emotions on screen and distracts from the narrative, making the film feel disjointed and amateurish. In conclusion, Disappointment's Gala is a forgettable film marred by a weak script, shallow characters, poor production value, and questionable artistic choices. Unfortunately, these numerous flaws overshadow some of the film's positive aspects, such as the supporting cast's performances and occasional visual flair. Regrettably, this film is best left forgotten, as it fails to deliver on its lofty ambitions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What I do know for certain however, is that the food I was eating at Vitamin T was very, very tasty. I've had the chicken tacos...which are nearly nirvana with a little sour cream on there. I've also tried the veggie torta. Word to the wise: tortas aren't the neatest of all dishes so maybe get a lot of napkins. The veggie torta was so good, I felt like I couldn't eat it fast enough. Picture petite me, sitting on the delightful patio in my jeans and a shirt amongst a bunch of business suits, literally wolfing down this torta that is messy to eat to begin with.

Is pay used to mean the same thing in the next two sentences? How much does this savings certificate pay annually? To pay attention.","output":"No, the word \\"pay\\" is not used to mean the same thing in these two sentences. The word \\"pay\\" in the English language has multiple meanings and can function as both a verb and a noun. In these sentences, \\"pay\\" is being used with different connotations and contexts. 1. In the sentence \\"How much does this savings certificate pay annually?\\" The word \\"pay\\" is being used as a verb. In this context, \\"pay\\" is used to describe the interest or income generated by the savings certificate on an annual basis. This usage of \\"pay\\" revolves around the concept of financial gain or remuneration. Savings certificates, also known as certificates of deposit, are a financial investment where money is deposited for a specific period with a predetermined interest rate. The interest received is considered as the payment made by the certificate. So when we ask how much it pays, we are referring to the amount of money earned from the investment on an annual basis. 2. In the sentence \\"To pay attention,\\" the term \\"pay\\" is also being used as a verb but has a different meaning. Here, \\"pay\\" signifies the act of focusing one's mind and concentration on something. It refers to the action of giving particular consideration or being actively engaged in a specific thought, task, or event. The use of \\"pay\\" in this sentence is unrelated to any financial transactions or exchanges. Instead, it focuses on the metaphorical sense of \\"giving\\" attention to something and, in a way, investing one's mental and emotional energies into that particular thing or situation. To sum up, the word \\"pay\\" in these two sentences is not used to mean the same thing. Whereas the first sentence denotes a financial aspect of a savings certificate, the second sentence addresses the metaphorical act of concentrating or focusing on something. Both meanings are essential in understanding the versatile role \\"pay\\" plays in the English language depending on the context in which it is used."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Swaziland's other key trading partners are the United States and the EU, from whom the country has received trade preferences for apparel exports (under the African Growth and Opportunity Act – AGOA – to the US) and for sugar (to the EU). Under these agreements, both apparel and sugar exports did well, with rapid growth and a strong inflow of foreign direct investment.

Article: Today is Sarah's birthday. She is seventy-five. We asked a few old friends to dinner. Like most elderly people, I suppose, we spent most of the evening talking about old times. Thirty years ago, the village used to be a quiet place. Now it has changed. Every Sunday hundreds of cars pass through the village at what I think a dangerous speed. They make the village almost as noisy as the streets of a large town. As a boy I enjoyed riding on the backs of the farm horses. Things are different now. Today there are very few horses working on the farms. The farm workers today drive tractors, not horses. A man is not of much use on a farm unless he knows all about machines. Now almost every house in the village has a TV set. Is it a good thing for children to spend the evening sitting in front of a TV set? When I was young I did not waste my time indoors. I would spend the long summer evenings outdoors. I would play with my friends, go fishing or walk by the river.

There are only 3-4 pages on how to breastfeed, and the information on those pages is very basic. There is very little advice on good positioning and good latching, both of which are absolutely vital to breastfeeding. The funny thing is that my mother bought an earlier version of this book in the late 60's.

However, they seem to have taken out most of the helpful stuff from the earlier version.

In this case, the reviewer has mentioned that the book has the wrong title, there is very little helpful information, and the earlier version of the book was more helpful. Step 3: Analyze the overall tone and specific details mentioned in the review. The tone is critical, and the reviewer has listed a few specific issues they had with the book, such as the lack of information on breastfeeding, positioning, and latching. Step 4: Compare the reviewer's sentiment and tone with what constitutes a positive review. A positive review typically has a favorable opinion, a positive tone, and would mention the positive aspects of the product. Step 5: Make a conclusion based on the analyzed information.

Stowe botches a sting operation against Callahan, resulting in the death of fellow cop Maria Ronson, whose fiancée, fellow cop Van Huffel, nearly comes to blows with him over it. Chief Mac Baylor has a very blunt chat with Stowe, who is dismissive. Stowe is approached by fellow cop Walter Curry to help his nephew beat a drug-dealing charge; he instead turns Curry over to Baylor, who fires him.

Their village is attacked by Khalar Zym, a warlord who wishes to reunite the pieces of the Mask of Acheron to revive his dead wife and conquer Hyboria.

After locating Corin's piece of the mask, and murdering the entire village, Zym leaves. Conan, the only survivor, swears revenge. Years later, Conan has become a pirate but still seeks revenge. He encounters a slave colony and frees it, killing all of the slave handlers in the process. In the city of Messantia, he encounters Ela-Shan, a thief being chased by a man whom Conan recognizes as Lucius, one of Zym's soldiers from years before. He allows himself to be captured alongside Ela-Shan. Conan escapes imprisonment, kills several of the guards, and confronts Lucius, forcing him to reveal that Zym seeks a girl, the pure-blood descendant of the sorcerers of Acheron; sacrificing the descendant and using blood from the body of the girl will unleash the mask's power. Conan helps the rest of the prisoners to escape, and, in gratitude, Ela-Shan tells Conan that, if he ever needs him, Conan will find him at the City of Thieves, Argalon.

Now you are ready to crack and enjoy!","output":"Option b makes more sense to accomplish the goal of boiling eggs and prepping them for egg salad. To summarize, here's the detailed process: 1. Place the eggs in a pot: Lay the eggs in a single layer at the bottom of a saucepan or pot. Make sure not to overcrowd the eggs, giving them enough space to cook evenly. 2. Fill the pot with water: Fill the pot with enough cold water to submerge the eggs completely, with approximately an inch of water above the eggs. This ensures that they are fully surrounded by water and cook evenly. 3. Bring the water to a boil: Turn on the heat to medium-high and bring the water to a rolling boil. To prevent cracking, you may add a pinch of salt to the water, which can also help with the peeling process later. 4. Cover and boil the eggs: Once the water is at a rolling boil, cover the pot and let the eggs cook for 2-3 minutes. This will provide enough heat to cook the eggs through. 5. Turn off the heat and let the eggs sit: After boiling for 2-3 minutes, remove the pot from the heat source and let the eggs sit in the hot water, still covered, for 12-13 minutes. This ensures that the eggs reach the desired consistency for egg salad without overcooking. 6. Stop the cooking process: Pour out the hot water from the pot and immediately rinse the eggs with cold water. Add ice to create an ice bath for the eggs; this will quickly lower their temperature and halt the cooking process. 7. Let the eggs sit in the ice bath: Allow the eggs to sit in the ice bath for around 10 minutes. This will not only help to stop the cooking process but also make peeling the eggs easier. 8. Peel and prepare the eggs: Once the eggs have cooled, tap and roll them on a hard surface to crack the shell, then carefully peel the shell away.

Petri's most acclaimed work, \\"Indagine su un cittadino al di sopra di ogni sospetto\\" (Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion), earned him widespread recognition and numerous awards, including an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1970. This film, like many of his other works, delved deeply into the themes of power, politics, and moral ambiguity, challenging the status quo and encouraging audiences to critically examine the world around them. Ralph Smart (1908 – 2001) was an English-Australian film and television director, screenwriter, and producer, who began his career in the British film industry during the 1930s. He then moved to Australia, where he primarily focused on producing and directing television shows. Smart's early work included contributions to the landmark British documentary series, \\"The March of Time,\\" as well as numerous wartime propaganda films aimed at boosting morale and encouraging patriotism during World War II. In the 1950s, Smart transitioned to television production, where he was instrumental in developing and directing several series such as \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\" and \\"The Invisible Man\\" for British television. He is perhaps best known for creating and producing the popular espionage series \\"Danger Man\\" (also known as \\"Secret Agent\\" in the United States) starring Patrick McGoohan, which originally aired in the 1960s. While Elio Petri and Ralph Smart worked in different countries and cultures, both shared an occupation as film directors, screenwriters, and producers, leaving a significant impact on their respective industries and audiences through their work. Their contributions to the world of film and television have undoubtedly left a lasting impression and continue to influence filmmakers and storytellers today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To answer the question, it is important to provide some background information on the Richmond International Raceway and the Capital City 400 event. The Richmond International Raceway, currently known as the Richmond Raceway, is a 3/4-mile D-shaped asphalt racetrack located in Richmond, Virginia. It has a seating capacity of around 51,000 and is owned by the International Speedway Corporation. The Capital City 400 is a NASCAR Cup Series race that has been held at the Richmond Raceway in various forms since the track's early days. The race is currently called the Toyota Owners 400, following multiple title changes and sponsorships over the years. The race is typically held under the lights at night on a Saturday in the spring, and serves as an important lead-up to the annual NASCAR playoffs. The RIR began to host the Capital City 400 in the early 1960s, with the first Capital City 400 race taking place on April 23, 1961. Joe Weatherly won the inaugural event by driving a 1961 Pontiac owned by Bud Moore. Since then, the race has seen many iconic racing moments, and NASCAR legends like Richard Petty, Dale Earnhardt, and Jeff Gordon, among others, have all earned victories at the historic race. In summary, the Richmond International Raceway began to host the Capital City 400 in April 1961.

They were each recommended to begin exercising regularly. Michael took this advice to heart, and began regular aerobic exercise every week. Robert, on the other hand, only performs aerobic exercise every couple of weeks.  Who is more likely to have LDL cholesterol build up in the inner walls of their arteries?  Hint: Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol.","output":"Based on the information provided, Michael is more likely to have a lower risk of LDL cholesterol build-up in the inner walls of his arteries compared to Robert. This is because Michael has been performing regular aerobic exercise every week, which is known to help lower LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) and increase HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol).

Conciseness: While the review is concise and to the point, it is too brief to provide substantial or meaningful insight into the software's specific features or capabilities. There is a potential for improvement in this area for the user to have shared more specific details. 2. Positivity: The review conveys a positive sentiment towards the software by using the words \\"very good,\\" indicating that the user was satisfied with the product. This positive tone is in line with a favorable rating of 5 out of 5. 3. Clarity: As mentioned earlier, the review is too brief to offer significant insight into the software's functions or features, leaving potential customers with little information to make informed decisions. This lack of clarity could be addressed with a more in-depth and informative review, reducing the overall rating for clarity to a 2 out of 5. 4.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a new situation: Danny owned two parcels of land. parcel A had a soil with high salinity levels, while parcel B had a rich and healthy soil.  But I can use this background: A plant's first line of defense against abiotic stress is in its roots. If the soil holding the plant is healthy and biologically diverse, the plant will have a higher chance of surviving stressful conditions.The plant responses to stress are dependent on the tissue or organ affected by the stress. For example, transcriptional responses to stress are tissue or cell specific in roots and are quite different depending on the stress involved.One of the primary responses to abiotic stress such as high salinity is the disruption of the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cell. High concentrations of Na+, for example, can decrease the capacity for the plant to take up water and also alter enzyme and transporter functions. Evolved adaptations to efficiently restore cellular ion homeostasis has led to a wide variety of stress tolerant plants.Facilitation, or the positive interactions between different species of plants, is an intricate web of association in a natural environment. It is how plants work together. In areas of high stress, the level of facilitation is especially high as well. This could possibly be because the plants need a stronger network to survive in a harsher environment, so their interactions between species, such as cross-pollination or mutualistic actions, become more common to cope with the severity of their habitat.Plants also adapt very differently from one another, even from a plant living in the same area. When a group of different plant species was prompted by a variety of different stress signals, such as drought or cold, each plant responded uniquely. Hardly any of the responses were similar, even though the plants had become accustomed to exactly the same home environment.Rice (Oryza sativa) is a classic example. Rice is a staple food throughout the world, especially in China and India. Rice plants experience different types of abiotic stresses, like drought and high salinity. These stress conditions have a negative impact on rice production. Genetic diversity has been studied...  What is an answer for this question: Which parcel had more plants which presented a disruption in the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cell?","output":"Based on the information provided, parcel A, with the soil having high salinity levels, has more plants that would present a disruption in the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cells. High salinity levels increase the concentration of Na+ ions in the soil, which can disrupt the Na+/K+ balance in plant cells, leading to negative effects on their water uptake and enzymatic functions. On the contrary, parcel B has rich and healthy soil, meaning the plants on this land are less likely to face high salinity stress which would cause disruption in the Na+/K+ ratio."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

What is the most logical completion of this news story?. By Daily Mail Reporter PUBLISHED: 11:13 EST, 5 July 2013 | UPDATED: 14:53 EST, 5 July 2013 A journalist has lost the libel lawsuit she filed against a rival station after they aired footage of her in a bikini at a pool party at the home of a man who is a person of interest in the case of his wife's disappearance. Amy Jacobson was an on-air reporter for Chicago's NBC affiliate when the local CBS station aired footage of her lounging at a July 6, 2007 pool party at the home of Craig Stebic. Craig's wife Lisa disappeared in April 2007 and he refused to speak to police for much of the investigation. After her disappearance, friends and neighbors told of how","output":"Lisa had confided in them about her troubled marriage and her fears for her own safety. She had confided in Amy, a seasoned journalist, known for her empathetic nature when dealing with cases involving missing persons. Amy had covered many high-profile stories where families had struggled with the aftermath of the inexplicable absence of their loved ones. Amy's approach towards the Stebics had always been professional, and she had interviewed Lisa's friends and family members extensively in an attempt to keep the public's attention on the missing mother of two. Unbeknownst to Amy, a fellow reporter from the local CBS station had received an invitation to the same pool party by another guest at the gathering. The reporter had managed to capture Amy on video at the event, wearing a bikini and seemingly enjoying herself. The footage quickly made its rounds on local and national news, along with various social media platforms, tainting Amy's image as a serious journalist. Consequently, Amy's credibility as a journalist was put into question, and she subsequently lost her job at the NBC affiliate. She decided to file a libel lawsuit against the CBS station, claiming that the footage was taken out of context and had unfairly portrayed her as unprofessional, damaging her reputation as a dedicated journalist. During the course of the trial, Amy's legal team presented evidence showing that she had been working diligently on the Lisa Stebic case, had multiple off-camera interviews with those close to the family, and had attended several press conferences raising awareness for her disappearance. They sought to demonstrate that the pool party was an informal social gathering with people from the neighborhood, arguing that it was her attempt to build rapport and gather more information about the case in a less formal setting. Moreover, Amy testified that she had been invited to the party by one of Lisa's friends, who believed she should be present in order to speak with Craig and glean new leads on Lisa's whereabouts. The prosecution, on the other hand, argued that the footage spoke for itself and that Amy's presence at the party in a bikini was unprofessional and inappropriate, given the sensitive nature of the case. In the end, the jury on the libel case found in favor of the CBS station, stating that although Amy's journalistic integrity was not put into question, her decision to attend the pool party in a bikini and the subsequent fallout that followed was a consequence of the choices she made of her own free will.   Following the conclusion of the lawsuit, Amy expressed her disappointment with the ruling and reiterated her dedication to her reporting career. She said that even though the outcome was unfavorable, she would continue to advocate for missing persons, such as Lisa Stebic, and seek justice for their families. In the years following the lawsuit, Amy went on to work at a smaller news outlet, where she has continued to focus on uncovering the truth about unsolved cases. Despite the painful setback in her career, she remains driven by her commitment to giving a voice to the voiceless and standing up for those who are no longer here to stand up for themselves. As for the case of Lisa Stebic, it remains unsolved, with her family and friends continuing their search for answers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A World and Olympic champion , he has also won numerous other medals at World Championships , World Cups and at the Commonwealth Games .  - Cycle sport is competitive physical activity using bicycles. There are several categories of bicycle racing including road bicycle racing, time trialling, cyclo-cross, mountain bike racing, track cycling, BMX, and cycle speedway. Non-racing cycling sports include artistic cycling, cycle polo, freestyle BMX and mountain bike trials. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) is the world governing body for cycling and international competitive cycling events. The International Human Powered Vehicle Association is the governing body for human-powered vehicles that imposes far fewer restrictions on their design than does the UCI. The UltraMarathon Cycling Association is the governing body for many ultra-distance cycling races.  - The Commonwealth Games (known as the British Empire Games from 19301950, the British Empire and Commonwealth Games from 19541966, and British Commonwealth Games from 19701974) is an international, multi-sport event involving athletes from the Commonwealth of Nations. The event was first held in 1930, and, with the exception of 1942 and 1946, which were cancelled due to World War II, has taken place every four years since then.  - BMX racing is a type of off-road bicycle racing. The format of BMX was derived from motocross racing. BMX bicycle races are sprint races on purpose-built off-road single-lap race tracks. The track usually consists of a starting gate for up to eight racers, a groomed, serpentine, dirt race course made of various jumps and rollers and a finish line. The course is usually flat, about wide and has large banked corners that help the riders maintain speed.  The sport of BMX racing is facilitated by a number of regional and international sanctioning bodies. They provide rules for sanctioning the conduct of the flying, specify age group and skill-level classifications among the racers, and maintain some kind of points-accumulation system over the racing season. The sport is very family oriented and largely participant-driven, with riders ranging in age from 2 to 70, and over. Professional ranks exist for both men and women, where the age ranges from 18 to 40 years old.  - A BMX bike is an off-road sport bicycle used for racing and stunt riding. BMX means bicycle motocross.  - The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states.

By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.  - Motocross is a form of off-road motorcycle racing held on enclosed off-road circuits. The sport evolved from motorcycle trials competitions held in the United Kingdom.  - BMX, an abbreviation for bicycle motocross, is a cycle sport performed on BMX bikes, either in competitive BMX racing or freestyle BMX, or else in general on- or off-road recreation.

Answer the question...how many lives were lost in the bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki??","output":"The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II represent one of the most significant and devastating events in human history. On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped the first atomic bomb, named \\"Little Boy,\\" on Hiroshima, and three days later, on August 9, 1945, the second atomic bomb, named \\"Fat Man,\\" was dropped on Nagasaki. These two events led to the surrender of Japan and marked the end of World War II. Estimating the exact number of lives lost in both bombings is difficult due to various factors including the intensity of the blasts, the subsequent fires, and the long-term effects of radiation exposure. However, some approximations can be made based on historical records and research studies. In Hiroshima, it is estimated that approximately 140,000 people lost their lives as a direct or indirect result of the bombing. This number accounts for the immediate deaths due to the explosion, those who were killed by the fires that followed, and the people who perished as a result of the radiation exposure during the days, months, and years that followed. As Hiroshima had a population of around 350,000 at the time of the bombing, nearly 40% of the residents lost their lives. The bombing in Nagasaki claimed fewer lives, but the destruction was still immense. It is estimated that approximately 74,000 people died due to the bombing, either immediately or as a result of radiation exposure and its related health complications over the following years. A substantial portion of Nagasaki's 240,000 residents was affected by the blast. Adding the estimated fatalities from both cities, the total number of lives lost in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is approximately 214,000. It is essential to mention that apart from those who lost their lives, thousands of others faced long-term physical and psychological harm from the bombings. Survivors, also known as Hibakusha, experienced numerous health problems, including cancer and other radiation-induced illnesses. The social stigma associated with being a Hibakusha led to discrimination and further psychological distress for many. The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated the terrifying power and destruction of nuclear weapons, leading to global efforts towards nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. These tragic events still serve as a poignant reminder of the suffering and loss of life war can cause and the importance of promoting peace and diplomacy around the world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Master is a recurring character in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who and its associated spin-off works. The character is a renegade alien Time Lord and the archenemy of the title character the Doctor. The Master has been played by multiple actors since the character's introduction in 1971. The Master, played by Roger Delgado, makes his first appearance in Terror of the Autons (1971), where he allies with the Nestene Consciousness to help them invade Earth. The Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) convinces the Master to stop this plan at the last minute, and the Master subsequently escapes, albeit with his TARDIS, a space-time ship, left non-functioning after the Doctor confiscates the ship's dematerialisation circuit.  Having become a main character in the show's eighth season, the Master reappears in The Mind of Evil, where he regains his TARDIS' circuit from the Doctor after attempting to launch a nerve gas missile that would initiate World War III. After another incursion on Earth in The Claws of Axos, and failing to hold the galaxy to ransom using a doomsday weapon on the planet Uxarieus in the year 2472 in Colony in Space, in The Daemons the Master is finally captured on Earth by the organisation UNIT after Jo Grant (Katy Manning) prevents the alien Azal (Stephen Thorne) from gifting the Master his powers.  In The Sea Devils (1972), the Master is shown to be imprisoned on an island prison off the coast of England. He convinces the governor of the prison, Colonel Trenchard (Clive Morton), to help him steal electronics from HMS Seaspite, the nearby naval base, which helps the Master contact the reptilian Sea Devils, the former rulers of Earth, so he can help them retake the planet from humanity. The Master convinces the Doctor to help him build machinery that would bring the Sea Devils out of their millions of years of hibernation, but the Doctor sabotages the device by overloading it, destroying the Sea Devil base and preventing war between humanity and reptiles. The Master subsequently escapes in a hovercraft. The Doctor reveals in this serial that the Master was once a \\"very good friend\\" of his.  Delgado's last appearance as the Master is in Frontier in Space (1973), where he works alongside the Dalek and Ogron races to provoke a war between the Human and Draconian Empires. The scheme fails, and the Master escapes after he shoots at the Doctor.  Delgado was slated to return in a serial called The Final Game, which would have been the season 11 finale. However, he died in a car crash in June 1973 and the story was never filmed.  The Master appeared as a main character of the 1996 Doctor Who television movie, played by American actor Eric Roberts.  In the prologue, the Master (portrayed briefly by Gordon Tipple) is executed by the Daleks as a punishment for his \\"evil crimes\\". But before his apparent death, the Master requests his remains to be brought back to Gallifrey by the Seventh Doctor. However, as posited in the novelisation of the television movie by Gary Russell, the Master's self-alterations to extend his lifespan allow him to survive his execution by transferring his mind into a snake-like entity called a \\"morphant\\". This interpretation is made explicit in the first of the Eighth Doctor Adventures novels, The Eight Doctors by Terrance Dicks, and also used in the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip story The Fallen, which states that the morphant was a shape-shifting animal native to Skaro.  Using his morphant body to break free from the container holding his remains, the Master sabotages the TARDIS console to force the vessel to crash land in San Francisco at the start of Earth's new millennium. From there, the Master has the morphant enter the body of a paramedic named Bruce to take control of him. However, the Master finds his human host to be unsustainable as the body slowly begins to degenerate, although the Master has the added abilities to spit an acid-like bile, both as a weapon and to mentally control victims as an alternative to his usual hypnotic abilities. The Master attempts to access the Eye of Harmony to steal the remaining regenerations of the Eighth Doctor (Paul McGann), but instead is sucked into it and supposedly killed.  The Master and the Doctor are shown to have similar levels of intelligence, and were classmates at the Time Lord Academy on Gallifrey, where the Master outperformed the Doctor. A similar connection between the two was also referenced in The End of Time in which the Master reminisces with the Tenth Doctor about his father's estates on Gallifrey and his childhood with the Doctor before saying \\"look at us now\\". In the 2007 episode \\"Utopia\\", the Tenth Doctor calls the transformed and disguised Master a genius and shows admiration for his intellect before discovering his true identity. The Tenth Doctor further expresses admiration for the Master's intellect in The End of Time by calling him \\"stone cold brilliant\\" and yet states that the Master could be more if he would just give up his desire for domination. The Twelfth Doctor states that Missy is \\"the one person almost as smart as me\\" (\\"The Lie of the Land\\").  Delgado's portrayal of the Master was that of a suave and charming sociopathic individual, able to be polite and murderous at almost the same time. His design is homage to the classic Svengali character: a black Nehru outfit with a beard and moustache.  Aspects of Simm's portrayal of the Master parallel Tennant's Doctor, primarily in his ability to make light of tense situations and his rather quirky and hyperactive personality. According to the producers, this was done to make the Master more threatening to the Doctor by having him take one of his opponent's greatest strengths, as well as making the parallels between the two characters more distinctive. This rationale is written into dialogue by the Master in \\"Utopia\\", in which he explicitly states, as he is regenerating, that if the Doctor can be young and strong, then so can he. In an episode of Doctor Who Confidential, \\"Lords and Masters\\", Russell T Davies also classifies the Master as both a sociopath and a psychopath.  Michelle Gomez maintained Simm's portrayal of the character, specifically the psychopathic behavior and inappropriate emotional responses to certain situations, as well as the original traditions of ruthless, murderous behaviour and grandiose, Machiavellian criminal intelligence that have been consistent throughout all incarnations. However, she also displayed a much more coquettish manner, with her new female identity allowing her to fully express aspects of the Master's ambiguous bond with the Doctor (as previously explored by Simm's incarnation in \\"The Sound of Drums\\"). While determined to torment and corrupt the Doctor with moral temptation while inflicting pain and death to humanity, she frequently referred to him as her \\"boyfriend\\" or \\"friend\\" and appeared to ultimately desire his acquiescence and company. She is also well aware that she is even more dangerously psychopathic than before, describing herself as \\"Bananas\\" to UNIT agent Osgood right before killing her (\\"Death in Heaven\\"). However, when circumstances result in Missy being kept in a vault and monitored by the Doctor after an averted execution, Missy actually comes to show signs of remorse for what she had done in the past, to the point that she prepares to side with the Doctor over her own past self (\\"The Doctor Falls\\"). Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Is he a very intelligent person?","output":"Yes, the Master is a very intelligent person.

The passengers cram into a small village hotel for the night. Among the hotel guests eager to return to England are two British gentlemen, Caldicott and Charters, who are worried about missing the upcoming cricket Test match. The only room left for them is the maid's room. Other Britons are Iris (Margaret Lockwood), a young woman of independent means who has spent a holiday with some friends, now returning home to be married, Miss Froy (May Whitty), an elderly lady who has worked some years abroad as a governess and music teacher, Gilbert (Michael Redgrave), a young musicologist who has been studying the folk songs of the region, and a secretive couple Mr. and Mrs. Todhunter (Cecil Parker and Linden Travers) who are having a clandestine affair. Folk dancers stomp loudly in Gilbert's room just above Iris, making it impossible for Miss Froy to properly hear a musician singing a haunting melody out in the street. Iris bribes the manager to throw Gilbert out of his room. Gilbert retaliates by barging into Iris's room and refusing to leave. Miss Froy seems to particularly enjoy the musician in the street below, and she throws a coin out her window. The music stops, as a murderous hand is seen to strangle the balladeer, but no one seems to notice anything wrong.The next morning, as the passengers are leaving the hotel to board the train, Miss Froy asks Iris for help in finding her luggage. They huddle around a pile of baggage, and just then a flowerpot is pushed off a window ledge from an upper floor. The pot appears meant for Miss Froy, but it knocks Iris on the head, instead.

Question: \\"Where is Buddhism not seen as traditional?\\"  Context: \\"Formal membership varies between communities, but basic lay adherence is often defined in terms of a traditional formula in which the practitioner takes refuge in The Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma (the teachings of the Buddha), and the Sangha (the Buddhist community). At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East it is regarded as familiar and traditional. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organized and well funded. In countries such as Cambodia and Bhutan, it is recognized as the state religion and receives government support. Modern influences increasingly lead to new forms of Buddhism that significantly depart from traditional beliefs and practices.\\"  Answer:","output":"In the given context, Buddhism is not seen as traditional in Western countries. While Buddhism has spread throughout the world and its teachings have been translated into various languages, it is still often perceived as exotic and progressive in the West. This is in contrast to the familiar and traditional perception of Buddhism in Eastern countries, where it is more deeply rooted in the culture and history. In Western countries, Buddhism is generally considered a non-traditional or alternative spiritual path, and its followers may come from various religious or non-religious backgrounds. Many Westerners are attracted to Buddhism due to its emphasis on mindfulness, meditation, and self-improvement, which may be seen as appealing alternatives to the traditional Judeo-Christian beliefs and practices that dominate the religious landscape. As a result of this non-traditional perception and the cultural differences between East and West, the practice of Buddhism in Western countries often takes on new forms that depart significantly from the traditional beliefs and practices found in Asia. This may include adaptations in the practices and interpretations of core Buddhist ideas to suit the needs and sensibilities of Western practitioners. In summary, Buddhism is not seen as traditional in Western countries where it is often viewed as an alternative or non-conventional spiritual path. The practice of Buddhism in the West tends to evolve and adapt to suit the cultural context, resulting in new forms that differ from traditional Asian practices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Gabe studied about other influencing factors.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which student read more about reactant particles being heated?  Hint: Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases.

Test sentence: \\"Carmen obtained a spare part to Mary.\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence?","output":"The test sentence, \\"Carmen obtained a spare part to Mary,\\" is not entirely correct grammatically. The main issue lies in the use of the preposition \\"to\\" in this context. The preposition \\"to\\" suggests a direction or a sense of movement towards something or someone. However, in this sentence, it is clear that Carmen obtained a spare part for Mary, not the physical act of moving towards her.  A more grammatically correct version of the sentence would be: 1. Carmen obtained a spare part for Mary. In this version, the preposition \\"for\\" implies that Carmen got the spare part on Mary's behalf or for her benefit. This is a more precise and correct use of a preposition in this context. Alternatively, suppose Carmen gave the spare part to Mary after obtaining it. In that case, a better structured sentence would involve breaking the sentence into two parts or using a conjunction to link the two actions. Here are some other possible versions: 2. Carmen obtained a spare part and gave it to Mary. In this version, the sentence appropriately highlights Carmen's action of obtaining the spare part and then giving it to Mary. The conjunction \\"and\\" connects the two related actions. 3. Carmen obtained a spare part, then gave it to Mary. This version emphasizes the order of the actions: Carmen first obtained the spare part, and afterwards, she gave it to Mary. The adverb \\"then\\" helps to signal the sequence of events. In summary, while the initial test sentence has some merit, it has issues with the preposition \\"to,\\" which does not accurately convey the intended meaning. The suggested alternative sentences provide more grammatically correct and clear ways to express the same idea."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Luckily I was not the target or victim of this road rage, but I was a first hand witness. Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction.

News article: .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........      Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that the NSF, NSO and AURA decided to evacuate the observatory without advisement or assistance from the FBI.      Mystery solved.      Authorities say it wasn’t aliens, but a janitor’s unsavory tastes that ultimately led to the closure of an observatory in southern New Mexico.      ADVERTISEMENTSkip      The Sunspot Observatory was evacuated when that same janitor made veiled threats against the facility after federal agents seized a laptop he used to access child pornography.      The closure on Sept. 6 sparked international attention since authorities refused to release any details, while news outlets and conspiracy theorists filled in the blanks with rumors of geomagnetic storms, alien sightings and apocalyptic asteroids.      According to a search warrant filed in U.S. District Court in Las Cruces, the FBI began investigating after a wireless signal at the observatory, located on Sacramento Peak in the Lincoln National Forest, accessed child porn multiple times since January.      During an interview on Aug. 21, the facility’s chief observer told agents he had found a running laptop with child porn on it in an empty office several months before.      Agents say the chief observer believed the laptop belonged to a research student and didn’t report it at the time because he was “distracted by an urgent matter within the facility.”      The chief observer told agents that only one person had access to the facility around the time of the child porn being accessed: a janitor who started working at the facility a year ago and cleans for a couple of hours a day. The janitor’s parents own the janitorial contract for the observatory.      ADVERTISEMENTSkip      Agents say the janitor has a key and “unlimited access” to the building.      According to the search warrant, agents seized the laptop.      Agents say that when the janitor returned the next morning, unaware of the seizure, he claimed to be “missing some cleaning supplies” and asked if anyone had been in the office.      The chief observer told agents the janitor began complaining about “lax security” at the facility and claimed someone was breaking into the facility at night to steal internet service and toilet paper.      As time went on, agents say the janitor’s actions grew increasingly “frantic” and he continually approached the chief observer with questions and comments about missing items.      “(The janitor) had continued to look feverishly through the facility and continued to make comments about the lax security,” an agent wrote in the search warrant.      ADVERTISEMENTSkip      Agents say the janitor mentioned that decoy security cameras “were a joke” and it was only “a matter of time” until the facility “got hit.”      The agencies that oversee the observatory, National Science Foundation, National Solar Observatory and Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, decided to evacuate and close the facility after the janitor spoke of a serial killer in the area and was fearful that the killer might “enter the facility and execute someone.”      While authorities maintain their silence, the observatory reopened Monday.      “Sunspot is now open, and we’re ready to show you all the great science and public outreach we do at this fantastic facility!” says a statement on the facility’s website. ||||| A federal search warrant reveals that Sunspot Solar Observatory was shut down as FBI agents conducted computer forensic searches for child pornography.      The source of child pornography was traced to an IP address used at the observatory and a source within the building observed a computer with \\"not good\\" images on it, the warrant states.      An investigation by the FBI revealed that a janitor is the main suspect in the search, however he has not been charged with a crime even though his name is on the warrant.      The warrant states the suspect would use the observatory Wifi and a personal laptop to download the child pornography.      A limited number of people have access to the observatory from dusk until dawn, which helped narrow their search.      The observatory in the mountains of southern New Mexico had been closed since Sept. 6 because of an undisclosed security concern, but reopened on Monday. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"The Sunspot Observatory in southern New Mexico was evacuated and closed due to a janitor's involvement in accessing child pornography, rather than the initially speculated extraterrestrial activities or geomagnetic storms.

Deena no longer keeps any of her promises, skips school and leaves the family home whenever she pleases. Her newfound harsh attitude upsets her mother, Cynthia, who once enjoyed a close relationship with her daughter. Cynthia is frustrated because the lines of communication have broken down between mother and daughter. Cynthia's relationship with her own mother is not entirely pleasant. Although Cynthia's alcoholic mother advises her daughter to be stricter with Deena, Cynthia does not  heed the advice. For example, she tidies Deena's bedroom, a chore which Cynthia has consistently and politely reminded her daughter to do. When Deena discovers what Cynthia has done, she is less than grateful and reacts violently and ends up pushing her mother. Adam, Deena's younger brother notices the impact that Deena's behavior has upon his mother and drinks alcohol in order to forget about the family problems. At one point, Cynthia and Deena's relationship seems to improve, until Cynthia finds out that she has been skipping school. Her confrontation leads to an argument, during which Deena slaps her. Although she admits to Garret that she liked hitting her, Deena later apologizes to her mother, only to ask her to cover for her absence at school., can you guess it ?

A:","output":"The question asks: \\"What is Bill?\\" Assessing each of the options will help us to find the right answer.  Option A suggests that \\"He's Mr. Black's friend.\\" From the article, we find that this statement is true. The article does say, \\"This is Mr Black... We are good friends.\\" However, while this statement is correct, it does not fully identify who or what Bill is, but only a relationship he has with someone else. Option B states \\"He's Linda's husband.\\" Again, this is a true statement according to the article which says, \\"My wife is Linda.\\" Thus, Bill is identified as Linda's husband. Like option A though, while this is correct, it only indicates a relationship that Bill has, but doesn't specifically answer what Bill is. Option C indicates \\"He's an English teacher.\\" The article begins with the statement, \\"I am Bill. I am an English teacher.\\" This not only establishes who Bill is (an English teacher) but goes beyond his relationships to characterize what he does or who he is professionally. Option D posits \\"He's a worker.\\" This is incorrect because even though Bill is technically a worker since he is an English teacher, the term \\"worker\\" in the article is used in relation to Mr Black who \\"works in a shoe factory.\\" Bill isn't mentioned in any professional context as a worker. Therefore, based on the article and the question asked, the right answer appears to be Option C: \\"He's an English teacher\\", because it directly answers the question \\"what is Bill\\", describing his professional identity not just his personal relationships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Not until 1998 did al Qaeda undertake a major terrorist operation of its own, in large part because  Bin Laden lost his base in Sudan. Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by  Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to  Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies.  Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him.  Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of  Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the  Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case,  Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely.

SeaWorld in San Diego is suing Canadian marine park after refusing to return 'loanee' whale Ikaika Whale's father, Tilikum, killed his trainer at SeaWorld in Florida A killer whale at the centre of an international custody battle has arrived in California.

The whale's father is Tilikum the 12,000lb whale that killed his trainer Dawn Brancheau in February 2010 at SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida. SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida, is demanding the return of Ikaika, pictured swimming in a tank at Marineland in Niagara Falls Lawyers for","output":"SeaWorld argued that the loan agreement between the two parks clearly stated that Ikaika was to be returned upon request. They claimed that the Canadian marine park had breached the terms of the agreement by refusing to return the valuable orca. The Canadian marine park countered by stating that Ikaika's well-being was at risk if he were to be moved to the US facility, citing concerns about the treatment of animals at SeaWorld parks. This legal dispute caught the attention of animal rights activists, who argued that both facilities should prioritize the safety and welfare of the orca over any financial or business-related interests. The court eventually ruled in favor of SeaWorld, granting the US theme park custody of Ikaika. Preparations were then made to safely transport the orca from Canada to California. Specialized equipment, including a custom-built container filled with water and a team of marine mammal experts, were arranged to ensure Ikaika's physical and mental well-being during the transport. Additionally, the team carefully planned the logistics of the journey to minimize stress and risks to the whale's health. Upon arrival in San Diego, Ikaika was closely monitored by SeaWorld staff to help him adjust to his new environment. The park implemented a thorough care plan to address the orca's physical, social, and mental needs, reaffirming its commitment to prioritize the well-being of the animals in its care. However, the custody battle raised important questions about the ethics of keeping these intelligent, social creatures in captivity and led to ongoing debates about the role of marine entertainment parks and the future of orcas in captivity. In conclusion, the custody battle for Ikaika, a killer whale at the center of an international dispute, was resolved with his transfer to SeaWorld in San Diego. The US and Canadian theme parks initially fought over ownership, highlighting the complex issues surrounding orca captivity and raising concerns from animal rights activists. While the court ruling in favor of SeaWorld resolved the immediate legal issue, the discussion about the appropriate treatment and future of these magnificent animals in marine parks continues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which British surgeon is generally recognised as the founder of antiseptic surgery","output":"The British surgeon generally recognized as the founder of antiseptic surgery is Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister (5 April 1827 – 10 February 1912). Born in Upton, Essex, England, Lister made significant contributions to the field of medicine, particularly in the area of infection control during surgical procedures. His discoveries and practices related to antiseptic surgical methods revolutionized the medical field and drastically reduced the rate of infection and mortality among patients. Joseph Lister pursued his medical studies at the University College London, earning his Bachelor of Medicine degree in 1847 and later becoming a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1852. Throughout his career, he held various positions in major hospitals, including lecturing and teaching medical students. He served as a Professor of Surgery at the University of Glasgow and the University of Edinburgh as well as the President of the British Royal Society from 1895 to 1900. Lister's groundbreaking work in antiseptic surgery was sparked by the work of French scientist Louis Pasteur, who discovered that microorganisms such as bacteria were responsible for the spoilage of food and beverages. Pasteur's research prompted Lister to question whether bacteria could also be responsible for the high rates of infection and death among surgical patients. Intrigued by this possibility, Lister began conducting experiments to reduce the presence of bacteria in the operating room. He discovered that carbolic acid (now known as phenol), which was used as a disinfectant for treating sewage, could be used to clean surgical instruments and dressings as well as to cleanse wounds. He developed a new approach to surgery, using sterilized instruments, antiseptic dressings, and a careful cleaning of patients’ wounds to prevent contamination. Lister's new antiseptic methods were a turning point in surgical history. Before Lister's discoveries, post-operative infections, often referred to as \\"hospital gangrene\\" or sepsis, were common and frequently led to the death of patients. The introduction of antiseptic surgery dramatically reduced infection rates and significantly improved patient outcomes. Joseph Lister's contributions to the field of medicine were widely recognized during his lifetime and after his death. The medical world has since continued to build upon his pioneering work, and his techniques have evolved into the modern protocols of aseptic surgery that surgeons still follow today. Lister's work has saved countless lives, and he is rightfully remembered as a giant in the history of medicine, dubbed the \\"father of modern surgery\\" for his innovations in antiseptic practices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Agent Bart Langner finds Elsa Brinkmann, a would-be actress who looks and sounds just like  Lylah Clare, a flamboyant star who fell to her death in suspicious circumstances 20 years ago. He persuades arrogant director Lewis Zarkan, who had been married to Lylah, to see her. The two men then convince brash studio head Barney Sheean, who is equally struck, to back a picture with her as Lylah.  Besides coping with the tyrannical Zarkan and easy access to alcohol and drugs, Elsa also has to contend with other hazards of Hollywood like malicious journalist Molly Luther and lesbian admirer Rossella. As filming continues, her identification with her rôle gets more intense. She also begins to fall in love with Zarkan, who is happy to sleep with her but his priority is to get his film finished.  By the last day of shooting, her personality seems to have merged with that of the outrageous Lylah whose fatal fall, we learn, was prompted by the jealous Zarkan. To antagonise him, she first lets him find her in bed with the gardener. Then, as he directs her in a circus scene, she leaps to her death from the high-wire. The resulting publicity makes his film a huge success. Tragedy later comes when Zarkan himself is shot and killed by Rossella.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.”  Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier.

Clarence Edwin \\"Cito\\" Gaston (; born March 17, 1944) is a former Major League Baseball outfielder and manager. His major league career as a player lasted from 1967 to 1978, most notably for the San Diego Padres and the Atlanta Braves. He spent his entire managerial career with the Toronto Blue Jays, becoming the first African-American manager in Major League history to win a World Series title. Cito Gaston managed the Toronto Blue Jays from 1989 to 1997, and again from 2008 to 2010. As a coach and manager, Gaston was considered a player's manager. He was a soft-spoken and steady influence during years that saw a large group of talented, high-salaried players grace the Blue Jays uniform. The franchise led the Major Leagues in attendance each year from 1989 to 1992, setting new records each of the latter three years, riding high from a dedicated fan base and a new stadium to play in when Gaston took the helm. The Jays opened the SkyDome a few weeks after Gaston became manager and the financial success translated into major free agent signings, including pitcher Jack Morris, outfielder Dave Winfield, and designated hitter Paul Molitor. They also retained core All-Stars such as Joe Carter, Devon White, Roberto Alomar, and John Olerud. Joe Carter credits Gaston for the team's championships:  Cito knows how to work with each individual, treating everyone like a human being. He knows exactly what to say, when to say it, what to do and how to go about doing it. When you have a manager like that, it makes you want to play for the guy. We'd go to war for him. What Cito has done for the Blue Jays can't be taken lightly.  Gaston had worked with players at an individual level as a hitting instructor and transferred this to the job of manager. He was known for his open communication with his players. He was a successful game strategist, effectively handling National League rules during World Series games in Atlanta and Philadelphia. In the six games the Blue Jays played in those places during World Series play, the Jays went 4-2, including the title clincher in Game 6 of the 1992 World Series in Atlanta. The 1992 World Series victory was widely recognized as the first for a non-American team, and Gaston was the first ever African-American manager to win a World Series. The Blue Jays followed their 1992 success with a repeat victory in the 1993 World Series. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did his team win the series?","output":"Yes, Cito Gaston's team won the series.

Review title: Simplest yogurt maker ever! Product review: I've had my Salton yogurt maker for 3 years and it's wonderful. I started out scientifically measuring the temperatures and measuring the starter. Now, I microwave milk in a pyrex bowl(in)for about 5 minutes let it cool a few minutes then pour it along with about 1/2 cup of starter (from the last batch or a new container)into a clean empty Dannon 32 oz. yogurt container (which fits the unit perfectly, is easier to clean, and I can keep several in circulation so I always have yogurt in the fridge!). I plug in the unit and forget about it. I notice the orange power light every time I'm in the kitchen and retrieve the yogurt in 24-48 hours (I like it fairly thick). Fantastic! I buy an 8 oz. plain yogurt (if I can find one, blasted supermarkets usually only stock plain in 32 oz. size) for starter about once a month. A:","output":"After analyzing the review, the chances of buying the product would likely increase. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the justifications: 1. The reviewer has had the Salton yogurt maker for 3 years, which indicates durability and long-term satisfaction with the product. 2. The reviewer describes the process of making yogurt as simple and easy, which is a positive aspect for potential buyers who value convenience and ease of use. 3. The reviewer mentions using an alternative yogurt container, demonstrating the flexibility and adaptability of the product to suit personal preferences. 4. The yogurt maker requires minimal monitoring, allowing users to \\"plug in the unit and forget about it,\\" which is another positive feature in terms of convenience and low maintenance. 5. The reviewer states that the yogurt turns out \\"fantastic\\" and they like it fairly thick, implying that the product delivers satisfactory results for its intended purpose. 6. The only issue mentioned is about finding an 8 oz. plain yogurt as a starter; however, this concern is not directly related to the performance of the yogurt maker itself but rather the availability of starter yogurt in stores. Overall, this review highlights the product's durability, ease of use, convenience, and satisfactory results, which would likely increase the chances of potential buyers considering the purchase of the Salton yogurt maker."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Who was a member of the alternative rock band Lush, Nell Sigland or Miki Berenyi? A:","output":"Miki Berenyi was a member of the alternative rock band Lush. Lush was a British alternative rock band that formed in 1987 and was active until 1998. The band's original lineup consisted of Miki Berenyi (vocals, guitar), Emma Anderson (guitar, vocals), Steve Rippon (bass), and Chris Acland (drums). In 1991, Rippon was replaced with Phil King on bass. Miki Berenyi, born on March 18, 1967, is of Japanese and Hungarian descent. She is known for her distinctive vocals and striking red hair. Berenyi met future bandmate Emma Anderson during their time in school. The two eventually formed Lush, with each of them contributing vocals and playing guitar. Lush was part of the shoegazing and Britpop movements during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Some of their popular releases include albums such as \\"Spooky\\" (1992), \\"Split\\" (1994), and \\"Lovelife\\" (1996). On the other hand, Nell Sigland is a Norwegian singer who was a member of the gothic metal band Theatre of Tragedy. She joined the band in 2004 after the departure of their original vocalist, Liv Kristine. Sigland contributed to two albums \\"Storm\\" (2006) and \\"Forever Is the World\\" (2009) during her time with Theatre of Tragedy. It is worth noting that Theatre of Tragedy's musical style is quite different from Lush's alternative rock sound.

[-] no.","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"The Russians planned to hold the line of the Ingur River which separates Abkhazia from Georgia proper.\\" answers the question \\"What river divides Abkhazia from Georgia?\\" The sentence explicitly states that the Ingur River serves as the dividing line between Abkhazia and Georgia proper (the core territories of Georgia). The ingur river functions as a natural border between the two regions, and its mention in this context confirms that it is indeed the geographical feature that separates them. Abkhazia is a disputed territory in the South Caucasus, located on the eastern coast of the Black Sea. While it considers itself an independent state, it is widely regarded as a part of Georgia by the international community. The Ingur River has historical, political, and geographical significance in the region. The Ingur River, also referred to as the Enguri River, is approximately 213 kilometers (132 miles) long. It originates from the Greater Caucasus Mountains in Georgia and flows through the Svaneti region before reaching Abkhazia. The river then flows into the Black Sea, forming a delta near the Abkhaz town of Ochamchira. The Ingur River's hydroelectric potential has long been harnessed through the construction of the Inguri Hydroelectric Power Station. The dam and reservoir are located in the Georgian region of Samegrelo, while the power station sits on the Abkhaz side. This strategic infrastructure reflects the importance of the river within the region for both economic and energy sustainability. The political and military tensions between Georgia and Abkhazia make the Ingur River a significant border in the disputed territory. Russian involvement in the region dating back to the 1990s has played a role in the conflict between Abkhazia and Georgia, as illustrated by the sentence that mentions Russian plans to hold the line along the Ingur River. In conclusion, the sentence does answer the question \\"What river divides Abkhazia from Georgia?\\" by identifying the Ingur River as the geographical feature that separates the two regions. The river holds a crucial significance in the history, politics, and geography of the wider South Caucasus region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Fowzi Nejad was the only gunman to survive the SAS assault. After being identified, he was dragged away by an SAS trooper, who allegedly intended to take him back into the building and shoot him. The soldier reportedly changed his mind when it was pointed out to him that the raid was being broadcast on live television. It later emerged that the footage from the back of the embassy was coming from a wireless camera placed in the window of a flat overlooking the embassy. The camera had been installed by ITN technicians, who had posed as guests of a local resident in order to get past the police cordon, which had been in place since the beginning of the siege. Nejad was arrested, and was eventually tried, convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the siege. He became eligible for parole in 2005. As a foreign national, he would normally have been immediately deported to his home country but Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, incorporated into British law by the Human Rights Act 1998, has been held by the European Court of Human Rights to prohibit deportation in cases where the person concerned would be likely to be tortured or executed in his home country. Nejad was eventually paroled in 2008 and granted leave to remain in the UK, but was not given political asylum. The Home Office released a statement, saying \\"We do not give refugee status to convicted terrorists. Our aim is to deport people as quickly as possible but the law requires us to first obtain assurances that the person being returned will not face certain death\\". After 27 years in prison, Nejad was deemed no longer to be a threat to society, but Trevor Lock wrote to the Home Office to oppose his release. Because it is accepted by the British government that he would be executed or tortured, he cannot be deported to Iran under the Human Rights Act 1998.

It is surely the bane of drivers' lives - discovering what you think is the perfect parking spot, only for it to be ruined by the appearance of a set of double yellow lines. But at just four foot wide, and far too narrow to fit a car down, it was unlikely any motorists were going to risk a ticket down this lane. This 'ridiculous' set of double yellow lines, painted by bungling council workers on a Wiltshire lane,  have now been covered over after complaints from residents. Swindon Borough Council became was branded a laughing stock when the lines appeared earlier this year. A 'ridiculous' set of double yellow lines were painted by council workers on a Swindon lane which is too narrow to drive down. The council blamed the gaffe on contractors, incredibly saying the workers had forgotten 'just how big cars actually are'. There was just 13 inches of space between the two sets of yellow lines - which is roughly the width of some high-end car tyres, and barely wide enough to fit a toy car between. The council blamed the gaffe on contractors, incredibly saying the workers had forgotten 'just how big cars actually are'. A spokesman for the council has now confirmed the yellow lines have now been covered over in black paint. They said: 'The lines will be burnt off, but in the meantime they have been painted over as a temporary measure.' The yellow lines were in a lane so narrow a man struggles to walk in the space in between them (left)  and (right) resident Liz Adams in the lane, now the council has 'erased them' using black paint. Ray Mudhar, the owner of Ray's Autos near the alleyway double yellow lines in Swindon, previously described the gaffe as 'one of the stupidest things I've ever seen.' He said: 'When me and my mate saw it we were just laughing our heads off. It's a waste of time, waste of money and waste of material. 'The only thing you could get down there would be a bike and no-one is going to leave a bike parked up there. 'They have painted down all the alleys around here.

Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"This article is about a funny mistake made by some workers in a town called Swindon in England.

If \\"A young man is crossing an urban street at the crosswalk.\\", does this mean that \\"An old man is waiting to cross the street\\"?","output":"The statement \\"A young man is crossing an urban street at the crosswalk\\" does not provide enough information to establish whether or not \\"An old man is waiting to cross the street.\\" The two scenarios could coexist, or they could be completely independent of one another. There are several possibilities to consider in relation to the two statements: 1. Coincidentally, the old man is waiting to cross the street at the same crosswalk: In this scenario, both the statements are accurate, and the two individuals are present at the same location. However, the initial statement does not explicitly suggest this, so we can't make this assumption without additional context or information. 2. The old man is waiting to cross the street at a different crosswalk: In this case, both the young man and the old man are present in the urban area but at different locations. The initial statement does not provide any information about the old man or his location, so this scenario remains a possibility. 3. There is no old man waiting to cross the street: It's entirely possible that the initial statement is focused solely on describing the young man's actions, and there is no old man waiting to cross the street at all. The absence of any mention of the old man in the statement doesn't confirm that he exists in the scene. 4. The young man and the old man are unrelated: The two situations might be completely independent of one another, and the statement about the young man crossing the street doesn't necessarily have any bearing on the old man's actions. There might be a young man crossing the street at the crosswalk and an old man waiting to cross the street at a different time or place. 5. Additional context or information about the scene is needed: To confirm whether or not an old man is waiting to cross the street, more information about the situation would be necessary. Details such as whether there are multiple crosswalks in the area, the time of day, or the level of pedestrian traffic could offer more insight into the relationship between the young man and the old man's activities. In conclusion, without further context or information, we cannot definitively determine if \\"An old man is waiting to cross the street\\" based on the statement, \\"A young man is crossing an urban street at the crosswalk.\\" These scenarios are not mutually inclusive or exclusive and could occur independently or concurrently.

Review: showtime is n't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"This movie review sentence can be interpreted as negative. The reviewer doesn't explicitly criticize the movie by using harsh language or intense negativity, but the overall tone and implications suggest dissatisfaction with the film. The term \\"assaultive\\" implies that the movie does not aggressively attack the viewer with intense action sequences. However, the following statement about not wanting to see another car chase, explosion, or gunfight again implies that the film may have used these elements excessively, leading to viewer fatigue or disinterest. Furthermore, the word \\"but\\" serves as a contrast between the movie not being particularly assaultive and the negative impact it still has on the viewer. If the review were positive, the writer would likely point out how the movie effectively utilized these action elements without causing viewer burnout. To summarize, this movie review sentence is negative because it implies that the movie's use of common action tropes such as car chases, explosions, and gunfights might be excessive to the point where the viewer is fatigued by them and no longer finds them enjoyable or engaging."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given those answer options, answer the question: You are presented with the quiz \\"What does biodiversity do towards the poles?\\"   But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"biodiversity generally increases from the poles to the equator\\" and \\"biodiversity, on the whole, increases towards the equator and decreases towards the poles\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? A:","output":"Biodiversity decreases towards the poles Based on the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the question, \\"What does biodiversity do towards the poles?\\" can be determined. The teacher mentioned that \\"biodiversity generally increases from the poles to the equator\\" and \\"biodiversity, on the whole, increases towards the equator and decreases towards the poles\\". Both these statements suggest that as we move from the equator towards the poles, the overall biodiversity reduces.  There are several factors that contribute to this decrease in biodiversity towards the poles. These factors primarily revolve around climatic and environmental conditions: 1. Temperature: As we move towards the poles, the temperature drops significantly. The harsh, cold environment that polar regions are characterized by limits the number of species that can survive and thrive in these areas. Species that live in these extreme environments have specific adaptations to withstand these conditions, but overall, fewer species can tolerate living in such locations as compared to more temperate or tropical areas. 2. Availability of sunlight: In polar regions, sunlight availability is limited due to the Earth's tilt and the length of day varying between the summer and winter solstices. In some parts of the polar region, the sun does not rise or set for months at a time. This leads to a reduction in primary productivity (the production of organic compounds through photosynthesis), which then affects the entire food chain and leads to reduced biodiversity. 3. Habitats: The extreme conditions of the polar regions result in reduced habitat diversity. The land may often be covered in snow and ice, which limits the number of habitats that can support life. These habitats also tend to be relatively uniform in nature, further reducing biodiversity. 4. Nutrient availability: Due to the lower temperatures, the rate of decomposition of dead matter in the poles is slower than in more temperate regions. Consequently, the release of nutrients into the soil is slower as well, leading to nutrient-poor ecosystems that are unable to sustain a high biodiversity. With the above factors in mind, the best answer to the question, \\"What does biodiversity do towards the poles?\\" would be \\"Biodiversity decreases towards the poles\\". In line with the hints provided by the teacher, the overall biodiversity tends to decrease as we travel from the equator to the poles, mainly due to the extreme environmental conditions and reduced habitat diversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fortunately, you can remove them using items you may already have at home. One choice is lemon Kool-aid. Simply sprinkle 1 package of lemon Kool-aid around the toilet bowl, wait 1 hour, and use a toilet brush to scrub away stains. Lemon Kool-aid is available at most grocery stores for as little as 0.25. Pumice stones are excellent at scrubbing away hard water stains. Use a pumice stone you already have at home, or purchase a \\"pumie\\" (a pumice stone on a stick designed for this purpose). Soak your pumice stone in water for 10-15 minutes, then use it to scrub away stains. Dryer sheets are another great product for scouring away hard water stains. In fact, used dryer sheets seem to work even better than brand new ones! Wear a pair of rubber gloves, then use an ordinary dryer sheet (used or unused) to scrub away stains.","output":"Hard water stains, which are both commonplace and visually displeasing, can fortunately be removed using everyday household items. There are a few different methods you can choose from to effectively eliminate these stains. One option is to use lemon Kool-aid, a commonly found and affordable product available at most grocery stores for as low as 0.25. Begin by sprinkling one packet of the lemon-flavored powder around the toilet bowl. Allow it to sit for approximately an hour before using a toilet brush to scrub the stains away, revealing a clean surface. Another effective way to remove hard water stains is by using pumice stones. These are a great natural and environmentally friendly choice and can be applied in two forms: an ordinary pumice stone or a \\"pumie,\\" a specialized pumice stone with a handle designed specifically for cleaning purposes. To utilize this method, submerge the pumice stone in water for 10-15 minutes to soften it and then scrub the stained area. The abrasive qualities of the stone will effectively remove the hard water stains. Lastly, dryer sheets, particularly used ones, can also be quite efficient at tackling hard water stains. You can simply grab an old or new dryer sheet, put on a pair of rubber gloves as a precaution, and scrub the stained area using the dryer sheet. The texture of the sheet will help to scour away the pesky hard water stains, bringing back the cleanliness and shine of the surface. In conclusion, hard water stains can be effectively removed using everyday items such as lemon Kool-aid, pumice stones, and dryer sheets. By employing these materials and incorporating proper cleaning techniques, you can easily restore the appearance of your toilet bowl or any other surface affected by hard water stains."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Thirty Seconds to Mars (commonly stylized as 30 Seconds to Mars) is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 1998. The band consists of Jared Leto (lead vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards), Shannon Leto (drums, percussion) and Tomo Milicevic (lead guitar, bass, violin, keyboards, other instruments). The band's debut album, 30 Seconds to Mars (2002), was produced by Bob Ezrin and released to positive reviews but only to limited commercial success. The band achieved worldwide fame with the release of their second album A Beautiful Lie (2005), which received multiple certifications all over the world, including platinum in the United States. Context: Thirty Seconds to Mars launched a website, called abeautifullie.org, to provide information about environmental issues and ways to participate in environmental activities. People can make donations through the site to support the Natural Resources Defense Council. In 2006, Jared Leto created the cover art for The 97X Green Room: Volume 2, a compilation of live music that includes a Thirty Seconds to Mars song, which proceeds from the sales benefited The Nature Conservancy. During their Welcome to the Universe Tour, the group worked to develop strategies that would minimize fuel consumption to offset the impact that the tour would have had on the environment.  In June 2008, the band joined Habitat for Humanity to work on a home being repaired and renovated through the Greater Los Angeles Area's \\"A Brush With Kindness\\" programme. In advance of the build, the band organized an auction of \\"build slots\\" to give fans the opportunity to volunteer alongside them. In less than a week, six extra workers were enlisted and over 10,000 was raised to fund additional Habitat for Humanity projects. Thirty Seconds to Mars fans, termed as the Echelon, started several philanthropic organizations and projects with the purpose of supporting various charities and humanitarian causes.  After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Thirty Seconds to Mars raised 100,100 for Haitian relief through a charity auction. The band has also supported the Haitian population through the Echelon project \\"House for Haiti\\" and Hope For Haiti Now telethon special. The group auctioned a quantity of items raising funds to help the Red Cross assist people affected by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. The band contributed one dollar per concert ticket sold on the Carnivores Tour to the charity Music for Relief to support disaster relief and programs to protect and restore the environment. Question: Did they donate any money?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Thirty Seconds to Mars, beyond their extensive involvement in environmental and humanitarian issues, have also been involved in numerous charitable donations. They have used a variety of ways to raise and donate money to causes and organizations they support. In their efforts towards environmental conservation, the band developed the website abeautifullie.org. Visitors could gain knowledge about environmental issues, participate in related activities, and make donations to the Natural Resources Defense Council — an organization dedicated to preserving natural resources and the environment.  Their embrace of philanthropy extended to their creative endeavors as well. A notable example is the cover art that Jared Leto created for The 97X Green Room: Volume 2. This compilation of live music included a song by Thirty Seconds to Mars and proceeds from its sales were directed to The Nature Conservancy, thus providing financial support to this organization. Their commitment to charity was also demonstrated during their Welcome to the Universe Tour, during which the band sought to develop strategies to minimize fuel consumption, effectively offsetting the environmental impact of touring, and in turn saving money which could potentially be used to support their philanthropic ventures. In addition, the band contributed their time and effort to Habitat for Humanity in June 2008. They didn't stop at just contributing their physical efforts, they also found a way to financially contribute to the cause by auctioning off \\"build slots\\", which gave fans a chance to volunteer alongside them. This creative approach to charity allowed them to raise over 10,000 in less than a week, which was utilized for future Habitat for Humanity projects. The band's fans, known as the Echelon, were inspired to start their own philanthropic organizations and projects, aimed at supporting various charities and humanitarian causes. This shows that the band's charitable efforts not only involved donating their own money, but also motivating their fan base to establish organizations that perpetuate these acts of philanthropy. After the 2010 earthquake that devastated Haiti, the band managed to raise 100,100 toward Haitian relief through a charity auction. They also supported the Haitian population through the Echelon project \\"House for Haiti\\" as well as the Hope For Haiti Now telethon special.  When the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami struck, the band rallied once again, auctioning numerous items to raise funds that helped the Red Cross in their efforts to assist people affected by the disaster.  Lastly, the band donated one dollar from each concert ticket sold on the Carnivores Tour to the charity Music for Relief, assisting in disaster relief efforts and backing programs that protect and restore the environment. Therefore, the evidence points to a strong trend of financial giving by Thirty Seconds to Mars, either directly or indirectly, in support of various charitable causes over the years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The company sent an email to users of the Sega Pass system on Friday to warn them that email addresses, dates of birth and encrypted passwords had been stolen from online database.      The email stressed that no financial information was at risk and that it has launched a probe into the extent of the breach. It is not immediately clear how many users were affected.      \\"Please note that no personal payment information was stored by Sega as we use external payment providers, meaning your payment details were not at risk from this intrusion,\\" the company said.      The company says it had taken its Sega Pas system offline and all users' passwords have been reset.      The security breach came after Sony Corp. and Nintendo suffered similar attacks by hackers.      In April, Sony's Playstation Network was the victim of a huge security breach that affected more than 100 million online accounts. The company suffered a second data breach earlier this month.      The hackers' group that claimed credit for the Sony attack, Lulz Security, had also said it was responsible for the recent breaches of the U.S. Senate computer system and the CIA website.      The group did not appear to be responsible for the Sega intrusion. It said on Twitter Friday that it wanted to help Sega \\"destroy the hackers\\" that attacked it. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Hackers have stolen personal information of over 1.2 million customers of Japanese gaming company SEGA, according to a company statement. The breach targeted user data from the subsidiary \\"SEGA Pass\\", which is operated by Britain-based SEGA Europe Limited. The information stolen included names, birth dates, email addresses, and encoded passwords. However, SEGA emphasized that it does not hold any confidential information such as credit card information. The company shut down the service and sent affected customers an email apology as soon as the illegal access was confirmed. SEGA is currently investigating the cyber break-in."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Irwin coached at the University of Pennsylvania between 1893 and 1895, and managed the Philadelphia major league club during those last two seasons.  In 1894, he angered Penn supporters when a talented first baseman named Goeckle nearly signed with Irwin's major league team just prior to a series of collegiate championship games. Nonetheless, by 1895, Irwin's coaching role at Penn included the selection of players and other duties that traditionally fell to the team captain. Irwin left Philadelphia in 1896 to manage the New York Giants. Relieved of his duties after one season in New York, he was subsequently recruited to manage in Milwaukee. However, he returned to coach the minor league team in his native Toronto instead.  Irwin coached Toronto during 1897 and 1898. He faced arrest on a libel charge in 1898, which stemmed from comments made by Irwin about the actions of the Philadelphia ownership during his time there. Though Irwin turned himself in, it appears that he was never arrested. In 1898, Irwin traded some of his best players to the Washington major league team. The moves were seen as particularly suspect when Irwin was named the Washington manager shortly thereafter. After 1899, Irwin did not return to the major leagues as a coach. He returned for a subsequent term as Penn's coach in 1900, but he left in 1902. In August 1902, Irwin was signed as an NL umpire for the remainder of that season. Irwin, who had previously only filled in for one three-day umpiring stretch in 1881, umpired his first NL game on August 7, 1902. His last umpiring appearance came with the end of the 1902 season on October 3. In fifty games as an umpire, Irwin ejected nine players, including future Hall of Fame inductees Roger Bresnahan and Fred Clarke. Irwin, who had retained partial ownership of the Toronto club, then returned to manage that team for a couple of seasons.  By 1906, Irwin was manager of the Altoona Mountaineers in the Tri-State League. In July 1907, Irwin resigned as manager of the Mountaineers after fans became disgruntled. Even after entering baseball scouting, Irwin briefly managed the 1908 Washington club in the short-lived Union Professional League. The league was plagued by financial problems--including the inability to pay players at times--and it folded less than two months after play began. He was rehired to the Penn coaching staff in 1908.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Organisms that live in a hypotonic environment such as freshwater, need a way to prevent their cells from taking in too much water by osmosis. A contractile vacuole is a type of vacuole that removes excess water from a cell. Freshwater protists, such as the paramecia shown in Figure below , have a contractile vacuole. The vacuole is surrounded by several canals, which absorb water by osmosis from the cytoplasm. After the canals fill with water, the water is pumped into the vacuole. When the vacuole is full, it pushes the water out of the cell through a pore.

Wall Street Journal managing editor Alan Murray and editors discuss Jobs's legacy, early reactions to his death and how his showmanship changed the retail and tech landscape. Steven P. Jobs, the Apple Inc. chairman and co-founder who pioneered the personal-computer industry and changed the way people think about technology, died Wednesday at the age of 56. His family, in a statement released by Apple, said Mr. Jobs \\"died peacefully today surrounded by his family.\\" The company didn't specify the cause of death. Mr. Jobs had battled pancreatic cancer and several years ago received a liver transplant. In August, Mr. Jobs stepped down as chief executive, handing the reins to longtime deputy Tim Cook. \\"Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being,\\" Mr. Cook said in a letter to employees. \\"We will honor his memory by dedicating ourselves to continuing the work he loved so much.\\" During his more than three-decade career, Mr. Jobs transformed Silicon Valley as he helped turn the once-sleepy expanse of fruit orchards into the technology industry's innovation center. In addition to laying the groundwork for the industry alongside others like Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, Mr. Jobs proved the appeal of well-designed products over the power of technology itself and transformed the way people interact with technology. \\"The world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has had, the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come,\\" Mr. Gates said in a statement Wednesday. The most productive chapter in Mr. Jobs's career occurred near the end of his life, when a nearly unbroken string of successful products like the iPod, iPhone and iPad changed the PC, electronics and digital-media industries. The way he marketed and sold those products through savvy advertising campaigns and Apple's retail stores helped turn the company into a pop-culture phenomenon. At the beginning of that phase, Mr. Jobs described his philosophy as trying to make products that were at \\"the intersection of art and technology.\\" In doing so, he turned Apple into the world's most valuable company with a market value of 350 billion. Steve Jobs has been interviewed by Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher a number of times over the years at the All Things D Conference. Take a look back at some of the highlights - including Jobs and Bill Gates on stage together. After losing considerable weight in mid-2008, Mr. Jobs took a nearly six-month medical leave of absence in 2009, during which he received a liver transplant. He took another medical leave of absence in mid-January, without explanation, before stepping down as CEO. Mr. Jobs is survived by his wife, Laurene, and four children. Mr. Jobs turned Apple into the largest retailer of music and helped popularize computer-animated films as the financier and CEO of Pixar Animation Studios, which he later sold to Walt Disney Co. He was a key figure in changing the way people used the Internet and how they listened to music, watched TV shows and movies, and read books, disrupting industries in the process. \\"Despite all he accomplished, it feels like he was just getting started,\\" Disney CEO Robert Iger said in a statement Wednesday. Fans held iPads during a vigil outside an Apple store in Tokyo Thursday. Mr. Jobs pulled off a remarkable business comeback, returning to Apple after an 11-year absence during which he was largely written off as a has-been. He went on to revive the struggling company by introducing products such as the iMac all-in-one computer, iPod music player and iTunes digital-music store. Apple now produces 65.2 billion a year in revenue compared with 7.1 billion in its business year ended September 1997. Apple dropped the \\"computer\\" in its name in January 2007 to underscore its expansion beyond PCs. Although Mr. Jobs officially handed over the reins of the company to Mr. Cook, his death nevertheless raises a question for Apple of how it will sustain its success without his vision and guidance. Other companies, including Walt Disney, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and International Business Machines Corp., experienced some transitional woes before eventually managing to thrive after their charismatic founders passed on. But few companies of that stature have shown such an acute dependence on their founder, or have lost the founder at the peak of his career. Several years after Mr. Jobs was fired from Apple in 1985, the company began a steady decline that saw it drift to the margins of the computer industry. That slide was reversed only after Mr. Jobs returned in 1997. AllThingsD's Kara Swisher discusses the what the impact of Steve Jobs's death will have on Apple and whether the company will remain an innovator and market leader. Photo: Getty Images Mr. Jobs also leaves behind many tales about his mercurial management style, such as his habit of calling employees or their ideas \\"dumb\\" when he didn't like something. He was even more combative against foes like Microsoft, Google Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. When Adobe Systems Inc. waged a campaign against Apple for not supporting Adobe's Flash video format on its iPhones and iPads in April 2010, Mr. Jobs wrote a 1,600-word essay about why the software was outdated and inadequate for mobile devices. He maintained uncompromising standards for the company's hardware and software, demanding \\"insanely great\\" aesthetics and ease of use from the moment a shopper walked into one of Apple's stores. His attention to detail shaped some of the distinctive features of Apple's products. Apple CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs died on Wednesday at the age of 56. A look back at the life of an American business icon. (Photo: Getty Images) Mr. Jobs enforced strict secrecy among employees, a strategy that he believed heightened anticipation for new products. News of his death came a day after Apple unveiled its newest device, the iPhone 4S, without him on stage. Mr. Jobs, the adopted son of a family in California, was born on Feb. 24, 1955. A college dropout, he established his reputation early on as a tech innovator when, at 21 years old, he and friend Steve Wozniak founded Apple Computer Inc. in the Jobs family garage in 1976. Mr. Jobs chose the name, in part, because he was a Beatles fan and admired the group's Apple records label, according to the book \\"Apple: The Inside Story of Intrigue, Egomania, and Business Blunders\\" by Wall Street Journal reporter Jim Carlton. The pair came out with the Apple II in 1977, a computer that was relatively affordable and designed for the mass market rather than for hobbyists. It went on to become one of the first commercially successful PCs, making the company 117 million in annual sales by the time of Apple's initial public offering in 1980. The IPO instantly made Mr. Jobs a multimillionaire. Not all of Mr. Jobs's early ideas paid off. The Apple III and Lisa computers that debuted in 1980 and 1983 were flops. But the distinctive all-in-one Macintosh—foreshadowed in a TV ad inspired by George Orwell's novel \\"1984\\" that famously only aired once—would set the standard for the design of modern computer operating systems. Even then, Mr. Jobs was a stickler for design details. Bruce Tognazzini, a former user-interface expert at Apple who joined the company in 1978, once said that Mr. Jobs was adamant that the keyboard not include \\"up,\\" \\"down,\\" \\"right,\\" and \\"left\\" keys that allow users to move the cursor around their computer screens. Mr. Jobs's pursuit of aesthetics sometimes bordered on the extreme. George Crow, an Apple engineer in the 1980s and again from 1998 to 2005, recalls how Mr. Jobs wanted to make even the inside of computers attractive. On the original Macintosh PC, Mr. Crow says Mr. Jobs wanted the internal wiring to be in the colors of Apple's early rainbow logo. Mr. Crow says he persuaded Mr. Jobs it was an unnecessary expense. Even in his appearance, Mr. Jobs seemed to cultivate an image more like that of an artist than a corporate executive. In public, he rarely deviated from an outfit consisting of Levi's jeans, a black mock turtleneck and New Balance running shoes. As Apple expanded, Mr. Jobs decided to bring in a more experienced manager to lead the company. He recruited John Sculley from PepsiCo Inc. to be Apple CEO in 1983, overcoming Mr. Sculley's initial reluctance by asking the executive if he just wanted to sell \\"sugar water to kids\\" or help change the world. After Apple fell into a subsequent slump, a leadership struggle led to a board decision to back Mr. Sculley and fire Mr. Jobs two years later at the age of 30. \\"What can I say—I hired the wrong guy,\\" Mr. Jobs brooded in a PBS documentary. \\"He destroyed everything I had spent 10 years working for.\\" Mr. Jobs then created NeXT Inc., a start-up that in 1988 introduced a black desktop computer with advanced software. The machine suffered from a high price and some key design decisions. But its operating system would eventually become a foundation for OS X, the software backbone of today's Macs, after Apple purchased NeXT for 400 million in December 1996. In 1986, using part of his fortune from Apple, Mr. Jobs paid filmmaker George Lucas 10 million to acquire the computer-graphics division of Lucasfilm Ltd. The company Mr. Jobs formed from that purchase, Pixar Animation Studios, went on to create a string of computer-animated film hits, such as \\"Toy Story.\\" Mr. Jobs sold Pixar to Disney in 2006 in a 7.4 billion deal. In Mr. Jobs's absence, Apple began foundering, and computers using Intel chips and Microsoft software became increasingly dominant. By 1997, Apple had racked up nearly 2 billion in losses in two years, its shares were at record lows and it was on its third CEO—Gil Amelio—in four years. Eight months after the deal to buy NeXT in December 1996, Mr. Amelio was ousted and Mr. Jobs appointed interim CEO, a title that became permanent in January 2000. One former Apple employee recalls Mr. Jobs joking soon after he returned that \\"the lunatics have taken over the asylum and we can do anything we want.\\" Mr. Jobs, who was given a salary of 1 a year along with options to Apple stock, made a series of changes. He killed the struggling Newton handheld computer and trimmed a confusing array of Mac models to a handful of systems focused on the consumer market. In May 1998, he introduced the iMac, an unusual one-piece computer that sported a colorful translucent case. Apple launched an ad campaign featuring the phrase \\"Think Different,\\" featuring photographs of creative individuals including Albert Einstein and Muppets creator Jim Henson. While shareholders cheered the changes, Mr. Jobs flexed his power on Apple's Cupertino, Calif., campus. Within months of taking over, he replaced four of the five top executives with former NeXT underlings. He issued emails forbidding employees to bring pets to the office or to smoke, even in parking lots. He threatened to fire anyone caught leaking company documents. Apple had stumbles during Mr. Jobs's second stint, including a cube-shaped Macintosh that failed to catch on and was scrapped in 2001. The failure was one reason Apple posted a quarterly loss and warned it would miss estimates several times in 2000 and 2001. But big hits followed. In 2001, Apple introduced the iPod, which transformed digital music players. Apple has more than 70% market share in the market. A key advantage was the iTunes Music Store, opened in 2003. Mr. Jobs helped persuade major record labels to sell recordings for 99 cents each. The store, which has sold more than 16 billion songs, became an incentive for people to buy iPods because, for much of its history, songs from the iTunes store could be downloaded only to Apple's music player. At the same time, Mr. Jobs was building his bench of executives. He recruited Mr. Cook, a former Compaq Computer Corp. executive, in the late 1990s to straighten Apple's operations and promoted him over time to chief operating officer. In 2004, Mr. Jobs had to lean on this bench when he disclosed that he had had surgery to remove a cancerous tumor from his pancreas. Apple revealed the procedure in early August 2004, but a person familiar with the situation said Mr. Jobs first learned of the tumor during a routine abdominal scan nine months earlier. The board and Mr. Jobs said nothing to Apple shareholders as the Apple executive, during that time, dealt with the tumor through changes to his diet, the person said. In June 2007, Mr. Jobs made another splash when Apple introduced the iPhone. Mr. Jobs was typically hands-on in the creation of the iPhone. People familiar with the matter say the former CEO was the one who made a decision to change the screen of the iPhone from plastic to glass after he unveiled the product at the Macworld trade show in 2007. The iPhone team scrambled to procure glass that would meet his standards, so the devices could be manufactured in time for the launch. Despite skepticism about Apple's ability to enter an already competitive market dominated by the likes of Research in Motion Ltd.'s BlackBerry devices, Apple became a force in the mobile phone market, selling 92 million iPhones as of December 2010. Last year, Mr. Jobs also unveiled the iPad tablet computer to great fanfare. Apple has sold more than 29 million iPads as buyers snapped them up. People who work closely with Mr. Jobs said the project was so important to him that he was deeply involved in its planning even while recovering from his 2009 liver transplant. Those who knew Mr. Jobs say one reason why he was able to keep innovating was because he didn't dwell on past accomplishments and demanded that employees do the same. Hitoshi Hokamura, a former Apple employee, recalls how an old Apple I that was displayed by the company cafeteria quietly disappeared after Mr. Jobs returned in the late 1990s. \\"Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose,\\" Mr. Jobs said in a commencement speech at Stanford University in June 2005, almost a year after he was diagnosed with cancer.

As of 2010, the most widespread are ID3v1 and ID3v2, and the more recently introduced APEv2. These tags are normally embedded at the beginning or end of MP3 files, separate from the actual MP3 frame data. MP3 decoders either extract information from the tags, or just treat them as ignorable, non-MP3 junk data. If the MP3 decoders do not extract information from the tags, what do they do to them?","output":"If MP3 decoders do not extract information from the tags, they essentially treat these tags as ignorable, non-MP3 junk data. In this context, it is important to understand the structure and function of MP3 tags and how they interact with MP3 decoders. MP3 tags, such as ID3v1, ID3v2, and APEv2, are metadata containers that provide information about an MP3 file, such as the title, artist, album, track number, and genre. These tags are embedded within the MP3 file, either at the beginning or the end of the file. This allows media players and other audio software to read and display relevant information about the audio track during playback or when organizing and categorizing audio files in a user's music library. MP3 decoders, on the other hand, are responsible for converting the compressed MP3 data into an audio waveform that can be played back by speakers or other audio output devices. This decoding process requires understanding the structure of an MP3 file, including how frames are organized and how to interpret different bits of data within the file. When an MP3 decoder encounters tag information that it is not programmed to extract, it disregards the data as nonessential information. This is because, from the perspective of audio playback, the metadata of an MP3 file does not contribute to the actual decoding process that generates the audio waveform. Thus, the decoder can safely ignore any tag data it does not understand or is not programmed to handle without affecting the playback quality of the audio. In some instances, MP3 decoders may be designed to be more robust by implementing additional logic to recognize and discard different types of tag data. This can help ensure that the decoder remains compatible with a wide range of MP3 files and adheres to various tagging standards that may be employed by different audio software. In summary, if MP3 decoders do not extract information from the tags, they treat the tags as ignorable, non-MP3 junk data. This means that the decoders focus on processing the primary MP3 frame data to produce the audio waveform, without affecting the playback quality. Tags are primarily used by media players and audio software to organize, categorize, and display information about audio files, while MP3 decoders' main priority is to accurately decode and reproduce the audio content of those files."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer this question: is a description of how probabilities are distributed over the values of a random variable?","output":"A description of how probabilities are distributed over the values of a random variable is often referred to as a probability distribution. Probability distributions play a crucial role in the study of statistics and probability theory as they provide a method to represent and analyze uncertainties in data or processes. Probability distributions can be classified into two broad categories: 1. Discrete Probability Distributions: These distributions are used when a random variable can take only a finite or countably infinite number of distinct values. Some common examples include flipping a coin, rolling a die, or counting the number of defective items in a batch. Discrete probability distributions assign probabilities to individual outcomes or events. Some well-known discrete probability distributions are:    a. Uniform Distribution: All the possible outcomes have an equal probability of occurring. For example, in a fair coin toss, the probability of getting a head or a tail is equal (1/2).    b. Bernoulli Distribution: This distribution represents the probability of success or failure in a single trial. It can be used to model situations where only two outcomes are possible, such as yes/no or true/false.    c. Binomial Distribution: It describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials with the same probability of success. For example, the probability of getting exactly three heads in five coin tosses.    d. Poisson Distribution: This distribution models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given that the events are rare and unpredictable. For example, the number of phone calls received at a call center in an hour. 2. Continuous Probability Distributions: These distributions are used when a random variable can take any value in a continuous range, such as measurements like height, weight, or temperature. Continuous probability distributions are described by probability density functions (PDFs), which determine the shape of the distribution curve and provide the probability of a random variable taking a value within a specific range. Some well-known continuous probability distributions are:    a. Uniform Distribution: The continuous uniform distribution assigns equal probability to all the values within a given range. For example, the probability of a person's height being between 5' and 6' is the same as between 6' and 7'.    b. Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution): It is a bell-shaped distribution that occurs naturally in many phenomena, such as biological measurements, social sciences, and physical sciences. The normal distribution is characterized by two parameters: the mean (µ), which indicates the central location of the distribution; and the standard deviation (σ), which represents the spread of the distribution.    c. Exponential Distribution: This distribution models the waiting time between successive events in a Poisson process. For example, the time between two buses arriving at a bus stop.    d. Log-Normal Distribution: It is a distribution whose logarithm is normally distributed. It can model variables that are always positive and have a skewed distribution, such as stock prices or lifetimes of products. Understanding probability distributions and their properties is essential for statistical inference, prediction, quality control, and decision-making in a wide range of fields, including finance, engineering, physics, social sciences, and biology. By using the probability distributions, we can estimate the likelihood of observing particular outcomes or values and make better decisions based on the available data."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:     Choices:  - thyroid  - pituitary gland  - medulla  - the hypothalamus   A: A:","output":"The sensors for thermoregulation are predominantly concentrated in the hypothalamus of the brain. The hypothalamus plays a crucial role in maintaining the body's temperature within a normal range by acting as a thermostat for the body. This region of the brain is responsible for detecting fluctuations in body temperature and making adjustments accordingly to maintain a stable internal environment, known as homeostasis. In order to regulate body temperature, the hypothalamus receives information from various thermoreceptors located throughout the body. These thermoreceptors are sensitive nerve cells that detect changes in temperature and send signals back to the hypothalamus. They can be categorized as either central or peripheral. Central thermoreceptors are found within the hypothalamus and the spinal cord, while peripheral thermoreceptors are located in the skin, mucous membranes, and deep tissues. When the hypothalamus detects a change in body temperature, it initiates various physiological responses to correct the imbalance. For instance, if the body is too warm, the hypothalamus triggers vasodilation, which is the widening of blood vessels to allow increased blood flow to the skin surface. This results in increased heat loss and thus helps to lower body temperature. Conversely, if the body is too cold, the hypothalamus triggers vasoconstriction, which is the narrowing of blood vessels to reduce blood flow to the skin surface. This conserves heat and reduces heat loss. Additionally, the hypothalamus can activate shivering, which is the involuntary contraction of muscles that generates heat as a byproduct, thus raising body temperature. Although the hypothalamus is the primary region for thermoregulation, other parts of the brain may also be involved in processing temperature information and generating response mechanisms. For example, the medulla and the pituitary gland can regulate hormones that may have an impact on thermoregulation, such as thyroid hormones and vasopressin. In summary, the sensors for thermoregulation are primarily concentrated in the hypothalamus of the brain, which receives temperature information from a variety of thermoreceptors located both centrally and peripherally. The hypothalamus then coordinates the necessary physiological responses to maintain a stable internal temperature, ensuring proper body function and overall health."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

No A:","output":"B). No The correct answer to the question \\"what soil helps a plant grow?\\" is not \\"support.\\" Instead, it is \\"loose soil,\\" as stated in the given information. Loose soil helps plants grow, develop, and expand because it provides several benefits that are essential to their growth process. Some of the key benefits of loose soil include: 1. Improved aeration: Loose soil allows air to penetrate it easily. Adequate aeration is vital for the overall health and growth of plants, as it ensures that plant roots have access to the oxygen they need for respiration and other metabolic processes. 2. Enhanced drainage: Loose soil typically has better drainage, which prevents waterlogging and root rot. Excess water can damage or kill plants by suffocating their roots and promoting the growth of pathogens and diseases. 3. Easy root penetration and proliferation: Loose soil is less compact and offers less resistance to root growth, making it easier for plants to extend their root systems. This results in stronger plants with better anchorage, increased access to water and nutrients, and an enhanced ability to tolerate stress. 4. Enhanced nutrient uptake: Loose soil allows for easier nutrient penetration, leading to better absorption of essential nutrients by plant roots. Well-nourished plant roots promote healthy, vigorous growth and increased resistance to diseases and pests. 5. Promotes beneficial organisms: Loose soil provides a favorable environment for beneficial soil organisms like earthworms, beneficial bacteria, and fungi. These organisms help decompose organic matter, releasing nutrients into the soil, and improve soil structure, which makes it even more conducive to plant growth and health. To sum up, the correct answer to the question \\"what soil helps a plant grow?\\" is loose soil, as it offers better aeration, enhanced drainage, easy root penetration, improved nutrient uptake, and an environment that supports biological activities beneficial to plant growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Where are the cousins of the species of nukupuʻ located other than the oldest of the main Hawaiian Islands? Answer:","output":"The cousins of the species of Nukupu'u (scientific name: Hemignathus lucidus) are primarily found within the Hawaiian archipelago, specifically in the main Hawaiian Islands and some of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. The Nukupu'u itself belongs to the family Fringillidae and is part of the group of birds known as Hawaiian honeycreepers. To understand the distribution of the close relatives of Nukupu'u, we first need to examine the characteristics that define the genus Hemignathus and then look at other genera that share similar traits.  The genus Hemignathus comprises four species, all endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. These species are: 1. Nukupu'u (Hemignathus lucidus) - As mentioned earlier, this species is found on the oldest of the main Hawaiian Islands. 2. Akiapola'au (Hemignathus munroi) - This species is found on the Big Island of Hawaii, mostly in the wet and mesic forests of Hakalau and Kilauea. 3. Greater Koa-Finch (Hemignathus ellisianus) - This now-extinct species was historically present on both Maui and the Big Island. 4. Lesser Koa-Finch (Hemignathus affinis) - Another extinct species, this bird was only ever known from the island of Maui. Apart from Hemignathus, there are several other genera within the Hawaiian honeycreepers that are considered cousins of Nukupu'u due to similar morphological features, behavior, and feeding habits. Some of these genera include: 1. Loxops - This genus comprises four species of small honeycreepers, known as 'akepas, found on different Hawaiian Islands:    - Hawai'i 'Akepa (Loxops coccineus) - Big Island of Hawaii    - O'ahu 'Akepa (Loxops wolstenholmei) - Island of O'ahu, currently considered critically endangered    - Maui 'Akepa (Loxops ochraceus) - Island of Maui, believed to be extinct    - Kaua'i 'Akepa (Loxops sclateri) - Island of Kaua'i, conservation status is critically endangered 2. Chlorodrepanis - This genus consists of three species of honeycreepers known as ʻamakihis:    - Hawai'i 'Amakihi (Chlorodrepanis virens) - Big Island of Hawaii    - O'ahu 'Amakihi (Chlorodrepanis flava) - Island of O'ahu    - Kaua'i 'Amakihi (Chlorodrepanis stejnegeri) - Island of Kaua'i 3. Akialoa - This extinct genus comprises four species of long-billed honeycreepers, which were spread across different Hawaiian Islands:    - O'ahu 'Akialoa (Akialoa ellisiana) - Island of O'ahu    - Kaua'i 'Akialoa (Akialoa stejnegeri) - Island of Kaua'i    - Maui 'Akialoa (Akialoa lanaiensis) - Islands of Maui, Moloka'i, and Lāna'i    - Hawai'i 'Akialoa (Akialoa obscurus) - Big Island of Hawaii In conclusion, the cousins of the species of Nukupu'u can be found on various islands within the Hawaiian archipelago, including the main Hawaiian Islands such as Big Island, Maui, O'ahu, Kaua'i, Moloka'i, and Lāna'i, as well as some of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. These relatives mainly belong to the genera Hemignathus, Loxops, Chlorodrepanis, and Akialoa. While some of these species are still thriving, others have already gone extinct or are facing critical endangerment due to habitat loss, invasive species, and diseases. Conservation efforts are vital to preserving the unique biodiversity of Hawaiian honeycreepers and their ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Blood vessels help regulate body processes by either constricting (becoming narrower) or dilating (becoming wider). These actions occur in response to signals from the autonomic nervous system or the endocrine system. Constriction occurs when the muscular walls of blood vessels contract. This reduces the amount of blood that can flow through the vessels (see Figure below ). Dilation occurs when the walls relax. This increases blood flows through the vessels.  Now, I have a new situation: Greg is a physician working for the city hospital. Today he is seeing two patients, patient A and patient B.

Blood vessels can either constrict (become narrower) or dilate (become wider) in response to signals from the autonomic nervous system or the endocrine system. 2. Constriction occurs when the muscular walls of blood vessels contract, reducing the amount of blood that can flow through the vessels. 3. Dilation occurs when the walls relax, increasing blood flow through the vessels. 4. Patient A's blood vessels are constricted. 5. Patient B's blood vessels are dilated. Based on the information provided, patient B's blood vessels would be wider than patient A's since they are dilated, and dilation results in the relaxation of the blood vessel walls, increasing blood flow through the vessels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who is the Chief of Detectives of the Santa Rosita Police Department? Movie plot title: It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World Movie plot: \\"Smiler\\" Grogan (Jimmy Durante), an ex-convict wanted by police in a tuna factory robbery fifteen years ago and currently on the run, careens his 1957 Ford Fairlane off twisting, mountainous State Highway 74 near Palm Springs in Southern California and crashes. Five motorists stop to help him: Melville Crump (Sid Caesar), a dentist; Lennie Pike (Jonathan Winters), a furniture mover; Dingy Bell (Mickey Rooney) and Benjy Benjamin (Buddy Hackett), two friends on their way to Las Vegas; and J. Russell Finch (Milton Berle), an entrepreneur who owns Pacific Edible Seaweed Company in Fresno. Just before he dies (literally kicking a bucket), Grogan tells the five men about 350,000 buried in Santa Rosita State Park near the Mexican border under \\"The Big W\\". Initially, the motorists try to reason with each other and share the money, but it soon becomes an all out race to get the money first. Unbeknownst to them all, Captain T.G. Culpeper (Spencer Tracy), Chief of Detectives of the Santa Rosita Police Department, has been patiently working on the Smiler Grogan case for years, hoping to someday solve it and retire. When he learns of the fatal crash, he suspects that Grogan may have tipped off the passersby, so he has them tracked by various police units. His suspicions are confirmed by their behavior. Everyone experiences multiple setbacks on their way to the money. Crump and his wife Monica (Edie Adams) charter an old WWI-era Jenny biplane and eventually make it to Santa Rosita, but are soon unknowingly locked in the basement of a hardware store by its owner (Edward Everett Horton). They eventually free themselves with dynamite. Bell and Benjamin charter a modern plane, but when their wealthy alcoholic pilot (Jim Backus) knocks himself out drunk, the two are forced to fly and land the plane themselves. Finch, his wife Emmeline (Dorothy Provine), and his loud and obnoxious mother-in-law, Mrs. Marcus (Ethel Merman), are involved in a car accident with Pike's 1954 Ford furniture van.

A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).  There was a soccer match between Red team and Blue team. Blue team got there early, warmed up properly and were ready for the game.

These services can include bill payment options, voter registration, and more. Public buildings are constructed with the purpose of facilitating the efficient functioning of public services and maintaining a pleasant and functional environment for both employees and visitors. The other options provided are not as fitting for the description given in the question: 1. Thunderdome: A thunderdome refers to a large, domed arena or venue typically used for various events such as concerts, sports, or competitive activities. While the reference to a hallway in the question might suggest an elaborate entrance or concourse, the main function of a thunderdome is not to facilitate paying bills or voter registration. 2. Access rooms: This term is relatively vague but could refer to rooms used to provide access to certain facilities or equipment. Access rooms can be found in various types of buildings. However, they generally do not have a central passage where you can pay bills or register to vote. 3. Tomb: A tomb is a place for housing the remains of deceased individuals, often constructed with beautiful architecture and artistic flourishes. Despite the possible presence of a grand hallway, its primary function is as a burial site and not for public services related to bill payment or voter registration. 4. Arena: An arena is a large, enclosed space designed for sporting events, concerts, or other performances. While you might find a big arched hallway as part of an arena's architectural design, the primary purpose of this type of structure is to host events, not to provide public services such as paying bills or registering to vote. Given the options, a public building is the most fitting answer to the question as it would be a place where you could find a central passage for people to pay their bills or register to vote.

Despite this, Huxley strongly supported Darwin on evolution; though he called for experiments to show whether natural selection could form new species, and questioned if Darwin's gradualism was sufficient without sudden leaps to cause speciation. Huxley wanted science to be secular, without religious interference, and his article in the April 1860 Westminster Review promoted scientific naturalism over natural theology, praising Darwin for \\"extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated\\" and coining the term \\"Darwinism\\" as part of his efforts to secularise and professionalise science.

A split second later, the screen went entirely black, leaving me in a state of confusion and panic. My heart raced as I tried to figure out what could have gone wrong. I had spent countless hours taking those photos, exploring hidden gems in the city, winding through alleys, and capturing stunning landscapes during golden hour. The thought of losing them all was unbearable. Determined to find a solution, I immediately started exploring all the possible causes, hoping it was a minor technical glitch that I could fix myself. I unplugged and reconnected all the cords, and even tried turning the computer off and back on again, but nothing seemed to work. The screen remained stubbornly blank. Feeling helpless and desperate, I decided to search for answers on my phone. After scouring online forums and articles, I came across a similar issue other photographers had experienced. The consensus was to try data recovery software, but there were mixed reviews on their effectiveness. Still, giving it a try seemed to be my best option. I quickly downloaded one of the recommended programs and followed the instructions. While the software did its work, I paced nervously around the room, envisioning my lost photos, each one a memory frozen in time. An hour passed, and then another. Just as I started to lose hope, my computer screen flickered back to life. A message appeared on the screen, stating that the software had managed to recover 87% of my lost photos. My heart soared with relief and gratitude. I spent the next hour carefully reviewing the recovered images, finding many of my favorites among them. The fact that I had lost some photos stung, but I resolved to learn from this experience and take precautions in the future. Investing in more reliable storage, backing up my work on multiple platforms, and researching ways to properly maintain my computer became my top priorities. Besides, some of the photos that were lost served as a reminder to appreciate the fleeting beauty of those captured moments and the transient nature of life itself. Over the next few weeks, I slowly rebuilt my photography portfolio, curating the recovered images into various collections. I reached out to fellow photographers in the community and participated in local exhibitions to showcase my work. Each conversation I had with fellow artists about photography was filled with lessons on best practices for securing and preserving our treasured images. Realizing the importance of sharing my experience, I began documenting my journey through a blog. I wrote about the fear and anxiety I felt during this ordeal and how it transformed into a valuable learning experience. The response from my readers was overwhelmingly positive, with many expressing gratitude for sharing my story, as it had inspired them to ensure their memories were properly protected. As I continued to share my experiences and learn from others, I became more involved in the photography community. I participated in workshops, conferences, and photo walks. My photography skills improved, and so did my understanding of crucial safety measures within the digital world. Eventually, I combined my passion for photography and newfound knowledge of data preservation to launch a workshop dedicated to helping photographers secure their work. The incident that had once filled me with terror and despair ultimately became the catalyst for personal growth, new friendships, and a rewarding career. Had it not been for that fateful day, I may have never discovered the potential and resilience within myself.

Prince Harry and Sentebale ambassador Joss Stone at the  summer party. Among the stars at tonight’s glitzy event was singer Joss Stone, who recently visited some of the charity’s projects in Africa and will entertain fellow guests. Other star turns include magician Troy and singer Beverley Knight. Harry's cousin Peter Phillips and his wife Autumn were among the guests as were Westlife singer Kian Egan and wife actress Jodi Albert. The evening will also see Harry give a short speech and hand out awards honouring key individuals and organisations that have supported his charity over the past decade. The seed of Sentebale was first planted in 2004 when the prince spent two months in the impoverished African kingdom of Lesotho during his gap year. He had been invited to visit the land-locked country located within South Africa by a member of its ruling family, Prince Seeiso, a friend of his mentor, ex-army officer Mark Dyer. The young prince leant in for a kiss as he arrived at the summer bash for the charity, which also works with  disadvantaged children in the African kingdom of Lesotho. The evening will also see Harry give a short speech and hand out awards honouring key individuals and organisations that have supported his charity over the past decade. The charismatic prince addresses the crowds at the tenth celebrations for Sentebale. The organisation's name - chosen by Harry - is a poignant tribute to his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, who was killed in a car crash in 1997, and points to Harry's drive to ensure both the princess and the children of Lesotho are never forgotten. According to latest statistics, some 23 per cent of the country's entire population - around 360,000 people - are infected with HIV. Of that, 38,000 are believed to be children. Sentebale founding patron Prince Seeiso Bereng Seeiso and Prince Harry speak on stage during the Sentebale Summer Party. The experience made a lasting impression on the young royal, who was then aged 19. Not only did Harry come face-to-face with hundreds of Aids orphans but he also visited herd boys living a harsh existence in remote mountain areas looking after cattle. Two years later he returned to set up the charity Sentebale - which means forget me not in the local Basotho dialect - with Prince Seeiso to help youngsters in need.

As well as its nationwide programme of education and support, Sentebale has been raising funds to build the Mamohato Children’s Centre to provide emotional and psychological support to children affected by HIV and Aids. The centre will act as a flagship for all of Sentebale’s work in the country. Harry, 29, recently gave up his job as a frontline Apache helicopter pilot to take a London-based desk job with the army and concentrate on his royal duties and charitable initiatives. Last week sources confirmed that he. had unexpectedly split from his girlfriend, ex-dance student Cressida. Bonas, with friends suggesting that the 25-year-old found it difficult. to live under the spotlight of being a royal girlfriend. Despite. his heartache Harry ploughed ahead with plans to attend the wedding of. his close friend, Guy Pelly, in the US. The pair were seen partying at a. nightclub in Miami in the early hours of the morning before taking a. private jet to Memphis for the weekend ceremony. Friends. have strongly suggested that Harry and Cressida’s separation is likely. to be temporary, however, and predict that the pair will rekindle their. romance. Opera singer. Camilla Kerslake, who has sung for Prince Charles and other members of. the royal family, was wearing a Francesca Moretta gown. She said: 'It's. such an honour to be here to support the prince. I am a huge fan of the. royal family.' Prince Harry shakes hands with an old friend, Mutsu Potsane, six, in the grounds of the Mants'ase children's home, while on a return visit to Lesotho in southern Africa as he launched his charity called Sentebale, which means 'Forget me not' in memory of his mother Diana, Princess of Wales. Diana, pictured in 1990, was a tireless campaigner for Aids victims. The evening opened with an enchanting performance by the Basotho Choir who sung a selection of traditional songs punctuated with warbling cries Prince Seeiso opened proceedings and talked of his 'beautiful, mountainous landlocked country' - but one that had been ravaged by poverty and disease.He spoke about Harry's first visit to Lesotho and how they had travelled to the 'furthest reaches' of the country to visit children orphaned by Aids. 'Harry and I know what it is like to lose a parent, or parents in my case, and it is a combined desire to carry on our mothers' legacy of work that formed Sentebale,' he said. He also revealed that Harry had been given a Lesotho name on the day he arrived in the country - Mohale, which means hero. In his speech Harry highlighted the ravages of the HIV/Aids epidemic which has left Lesotho with the third highest infection rate in the world and one in three of its children orphans. He admitted: 'At times the severity of severe poverty can be overwhelming. 'However it is through the dedication, passion and commitment of the Sentebale team, our community partners, local government - the children's longing to learn - and you tonight that we are battling with these issues and giving these children a chance of a happier future.' The prince highlighted the case of a young girl called Mpolokeng, whom he met in 2001 and whose mother died of Aids shortly afterwards leaving her to care for her siblings. Thanks to Sentebale's help she has been receiving a £250 annual  bursary to attend school.'That really is a small price to pay to change a little girl's life,' he said. 'What a difference we can make if we all work together.' Guests at the event dined on rump of lamb with cauliflower brûlée, minted pea with baby gem and braised lamb pie and a trio of flaming vanilla creme brûlée, mango sorbet and strawberry pavlova. Westlife singer Kian Egan said of the night: 'Let's face it, if you get an invite from Prince Harry you don't say no. But my wife and I are hugely proud to be here to support his work. It's a remarkable charity.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Prince Harry attended a summer party at the Dorchester Hotel in London to celebrate the 10th anniversary of his charity, Sentebale, which works with AIDS orphans and disadvantaged children in Lesotho. The charity was co-founded by Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso, a member of Lesotho's ruling family. The event featured performances by singer Joss Stone, magician Troy, and singer Beverley Knight. Prince Harry gave a speech and handed out awards recognizing key supporters of Sentebale. The charity's name is a tribute to Princess Diana and represents Prince Harry's drive to ensure that her memory and the children of Lesotho are not forgotten. Sentebale has a nationwide program of education and support and is also raising funds to build the Mamohato Children's Centre to support children affected by HIV and AIDS."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Problem: Solve -12*v - 45*v + 377 = 816 - 5227 for v. And the answer is...","output":"Okay, first you must know that 'v' here stands for a unknown value, like a hidden treasure we must find! We start by combining all the 'v's together.  So -12*v - 45*v would become -57*v , like if you have lost 12 toys and then lost 45 more, you have lost 57 toys in total. Then we simplify 816 - 5227 which is negative number because 5227 is bigger than 816. So it will be -4411, like if you had 816 candies but ate 5227, you would owe 4411 candies. So, now we have -57*v + 377 = -4411. Let's take 377 to the other side by subtracting 377 from both sides, like when you give away 377 of your toys. Then you will have -57*v = -4411 - 377, which is -4788. Now, to get the value of 'v', imagine you have -57 pieces of a big cookie that equal -4788 crumbs, and we want to know how many crumbs is one piece of cookie worth. We divide -4788 crumbs by -57 pieces of cookie. So, 'v' is 4788 divided by 57, which is approximately 84.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Traders will watch this, but Fed can't rewrite history Read More Why oil could revisit its lows and then some Markets, however, will hear from another Fed speaker Wednesday. San Francisco Fed President John Williams speaks at 2 p.m. on the outlook. The markets were preoccupied last month by the potential timing of the Fed's first rate hike, but now have switched gears to worrying about China and Greece. As those events have became perceived as potentially more negative, traders added to bets in the futures market that the Fed would not hike rates until early next year. At this point, Briggs said RBS calculates the market is expecting the first full rate hike in January, and sees just a 22 percent chance of a rate increase in September. The Fed minutes shouldn't change the perception of the market, but Yellen's talk on the economy at midday Friday might. Briggs said the Fed statement after that June meeting was neutral, and the minutes should be as well. \\"I think it's going to sound like a watch and wait Fed,\\" he said. Read More This list of 'junk' companies keeps getting longer Stock futures were lower Wednesday, after another nearly 6 percent rout in Chinese stocks overnight. European equities reversed earlier losses after Greece submitted new proposals seeking a debt deal. Wall Street staged a big reversal Tuesday with equities closing higher, after a choppy day of trading on news related to Greece. The fact the euro group will meet Sunday and look at Greek debt sustainability gave the markets encouragement. \\"It was wild and woolly and some of it was technical,\\" said Art Cashin, director of floor operations at the New York Stock Exchange for UBS. Cashin said the reversal of a sharp intraday drop in oil also helped stocks, but developments on Greece became the bigger driver, including an unsubstantiated rumor that it was being given a 30-day reprieve. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is expected to submit a loan request and reform proposals Wednesday, and the proposals will be reviewed to see if Greece can receive some short term funding. Read More Grexit would be 'beginning of the end' of euro: Piketty Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said stocks are caught in a volatile pattern while investors await the outcome for Greece and China. \\"We may be within a 24-hour window of having a little more information on Greece. That would at least partly answer one of those questions and uncertainties,\\" she said. China could be the more difficult situation to read. The Shanghai stock market sold off again Tuesday, even after the government took steps to stop it. That spooked the oil market and commodities in general, as traders feared a bigger economic slowdown spreading out from the equities meltdown. \\"Some of what they're doing is a little bit scary,\\" said Sonders. Read More Oil rout dashes hopes of reprieve for some drillers \\"They say they want to go to a more market based set of principles, especially around the stock market,\\" she said. \\"You get a 30 percent drop in the stock market and they step in, in command and control mode. They ban shorting and actually are exacerbating the problem…It just shows as reform minded as they like to be, when faced with a near term crisis, their default is to step in and micro manage.\\" Sonders said the situation in China could turn into a bullish story if it signals the leadership that they have to move more quickly on reforms. \\"This could be the pause that refreshes,\\" she said. But it could also spread. \\"A continued plunge in Chinese stocks is a negative for the U.S. market,\\" she said. Sonders said Schwab is neutral on the market this year, expecting it to make much smaller gains than prior years. But she recommends investors keep a position in equities, both domestic and international. The upcoming earnings season will be important, but the fact that the dollar has been driven higher by European events and oil has been slammed by China and Greece are negatives.

Pepsico follows on Thursday, and then a flood of reports are scheduled for next week. \\"We're back in some of the same factors that caused a rumble in Q1 earnings,\\" Sonders said. While it will not impact the earnings reports for the second quarter, company comments for the third quarter or beyond could be negative because of the oil plunge or strong dollar. \\"So then the earnings recession story gets legs again,\\" she said. Stocks should trade in a volatile way but she does not see a panic from any of the catalysts. \\"Barring a more significant catalyst, other than this torture of news that we're getting out of both Greece and watching China scramble…I think it's more of the same in the market,\\" she said. As for oil, West Texas International crude futures closed down just 20 cents Tuesday at 52.33 per barrel, after falling to a key psychological level just above 50. \\"I think it could be a short covering rally,\\" said John Kilduff of Again Capital. Oil fell nearly 8 percent Monday as traders watched for developments on China and Greece. Iran was also a catalyst, as negotiations on its nuclear program continue, even as it appeared the latest deadline of July 9 would not be met. An agreement would mean an end of sanctions that could eventually put up to one million barrels of Iranian oil onto an already oversupplied market.

Answer a question about this article: In Majorcan, unstressed vowels reduce to four: /a e ɛ/ follow the Eastern Catalan reduction pattern; however /o ɔ/ reduce to [o], with /u/ remaining distinct, as in Western Catalan. What other pattern do other vowels follow?","output":"This article primarily discusses the vowel reduction patterns in the Majorcan dialect of Catalan, specifically focusing on the unstressed vowels. It provides information on how the unstressed vowels reduce to four distinct sounds by following different reduction patterns in Eastern and Western Catalan. In Majorcan, the unstressed vowels /a e ɛ/ follow the Eastern Catalan vowel reduction pattern, which leads to a distinctive pronunciation in this dialect. Eastern Catalan vowel reduction involves the merging of /a/, /e/, and /ɛ/ into a centralized vowel [ə] in unstressed positions. This process produces a schwa-like sound, which is commonly found in many other languages. Eastern Catalan, therefore, focuses more on the reduction of front and central vowels. On the other hand, the unstressed vowels /o ɔ/ in Majorcan reduce to [o] and /u/ remains distinct, as seen in Western Catalan. Western Catalan vowel reduction, as opposed to its Eastern counterpart, concentrates more on the harmonization and reduction of back vowels, which include /o/, /ɔ/, and /u/. The article does not explicitly provide information on other patterns that unstressed vowels follow in other Catalan dialects or languages. However, it is important to note that vowel reduction is a common phenomenon across various languages and dialects, and different languages may have their own unique patterns and rules for how unstressed vowels are affected. In summary, this article discusses the vowel reduction patterns in the Majorcan dialect of Catalan. The unstressed vowels /a e ɛ/ follow the Eastern Catalan reduction pattern, while /o ɔ/ reduce to [o] and /u/ remains distinct according to the Western Catalan pattern. Although the article does not offer specific information on other reduction patterns in other dialects or languages, it highlights the unique characteristics of the Majorcan dialect that set it apart from the other dialects within the Catalan language family."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Eddie Mansius, left, Cullen McMillian, Nick Rhyne, Duncan Rule and Maddie Moore have had 4.5 million views of their 10 installments of “The Hunger Games.” Cullen joined the original four North Carolina high school students after the first video. (John W. Adkisson / For the Los Angeles Times / )      CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Duncan Rule discovered \\"The Hunger Games\\" shortly after the novel came out four years ago. He recommended it to Eddie Mansius, his best friend since seventh grade. Eddie urged Nick Rhyne and Maddie Moore to read it.      Maddie devoured the book, which meshes a teenage coming-of-age story with reality TV and war, in three days.      \\"It was like I never wanted it to end,\\" said Maddie, who went to YouTube and was disappointed to find a movie hadn't been made.      She and her three friends, high school sophomores at the time, decided to make their own.      Maddie played Katniss, the 16-year-old heroine who is forced to fight other children to the death for the entertainment of a vapid futuristic society. Nick played Gale, the heroine's love interest; Eddie portrayed Peeta, a former schoolmate of Katniss' who teams up with her in the arena. Friends and family members were enlisted to round out the cast.      Their budget starting out: 30.      When they needed to shoot interiors, they used Duncan's home in Charlotte's Eastover neighborhood. Exteriors were shot at Maddie's family farm an hour north of Charlotte, or at the park down the street from Eddie's house. Costumes came from Goodwill or their own closets.      After their first video and subsequent installments went live on the Internet, they were on their way to becoming celebrities.      These days, the friends — minus Duncan, who is camera shy — get stopped in all sorts of places; outside the Sprint store, at Wendy's and at summer camp. Nick was recognized while on vacation with his family in Turks and Caicos Islands in the Bahamas.      Even the new girl at their school who arrived from Ireland last year had seen the videos. \\"Don't I know you from somewhere?\\" she said to Eddie and Maddie in an honors French class.      Last spring Eddie, Maddie and Nick were invited to ConCarolinas, a science fiction convention in Charlotte, to sit on panels including \\"Film Directing 101\\" and \\"Everything You Wanted to Know About Filmmaking.\\" Then they entered an overflowing screening room and watched their videos on a big movie screen for the first time.      It was billed as their North American premiere.      On a recent Saturday evening, Eddie and his friends gathered outside Duncan's house to shoot a sequence from \\"Catching Fire,\\" the second book in the trilogy. The scene involves Katniss stumbling up the steps of the house and falling into Gale's waiting arms.      Duncan lighted the scene with a 40 LED video light. Cullen McMillian, a friend of Eddie's, held a makeshift boom built from a shotgun microphone attached to a broken camera tripod.      Eddie, who directs the videos, looked down at his camera. \\"This isn't going to work,\\" he said. \\"Duncan, make sure to follow her with the light. Cullen, you don't need to do boom because there is no dialogue in this scene. Maddie, walk slower this time.\\"      Two more takes and the scene was done. They put it on YouTube on Jan. 4. The feature film version is scheduled to come out in November.      So far, the group has written, produced, edited and starred in 10 videos based on the \\"Hunger Games\\" trilogy, each about eight minutes long and posted on YouTube under the name L4gMast3Rz. The teenagers posted their first video in December 2010, more than a year before Hollywood's first film came out. That episode was quickly picked up by the \\"Hunger Games\\" fan site Mockingjay.net and in less than a week was viewed 6,000 times.      The friends were so excited they filmed a video thanking their fans for watching it.      It has become easier for amateur productions to find an audience beyond indulgent friends and relatives. Sites such as YouTube and Vimeo give even the most amateur backyard auteur access to millions of viewers.      Today, the friends' DIY videos altogether have been viewed more than 4.5 million times. Their videos are popular, but the friends haven't made any money from them.      \\"YouTube said they would send us a check when we hit a certain threshold from the advertising on our videos, but that hasn't happened yet,\\" Eddie said.      It's not unusual for high school friends to make home movies. Steven Spielberg made his first film as a teenager in 1958. He used a Super 8 camera. Soon the family camcorder became popular. Now, inexpensive digital cameras and desktop editing software can let any teen produce polished videos.      The friends are embarrassed by their early videos, shot with their parents' camcorders in fall 2010. The sound is a bit muffled, and the picture quality isn't great, but there are moments of beauty — the shots of nature that run behind the credits, a close up of Maddie's fingers worrying the rim of a water bottle as her character contemplates her next move.      \\"Production value doesn't matter if a video captures the spirit of the books,\\" says Crystal Watanabe, an administrator at Mockingjay.net. \\"Our audience just wants to relive the feeling they had when they were reading the books for the first time.\\"      With homework, extracurricular and family commitments, the friends, now seniors at Charlotte County Day School, don't have a lot of time to shoot these movies. Filming goes quickly when it's just Maddie, Eddie or Nick in a scene, but with guest actors, the results can be mixed. Eddie was directing a somber scene on a Sunday morning from the second book with Maddie's mother and 10-year-old sister, who play Katniss' mother and sister. They were watching President Snow, the villain, announce that 24 previous victors, including Katniss, would be heading back to the arena to fight, once again, to the death. But whenever Eddie pointed the camera at Maddie's mom and sister, they started to giggle.      \\"Imagine your cat dying,\\" Eddie said, trying to get them to look appropriately depressed.      \\"Stare off at a point and try to blur it with your eyes,\\" Maddie said.      It took 20 minutes, but finally Eddie ended up with footage he could use. Then he shot Maddie looking grave. She nailed it in one take.      Over the years the group has learned that their fans — mostly tween girls — demand adherence to the source material.      \\"When we started we were writing the scripts from memory, and our fans would write in if even one word was different from the book,\\" Eddie said. Now he will re-shoot a scene if one of his actors misses even a single word.      The friends are graduating high school in June and hope to make at least one more \\"Hunger Games\\" video from the third book, \\"Mockingjay,\\" before they head their separate ways in the fall.      Their venture has been rewarding in many ways: Eddie was admitted early to Brown University, and he thinks his essay on making the videos made a difference.      Maddie had an especially exciting payoff: She was cast as an extra in the Hollywood version of \\"The Hunger Games,\\" which was being filmed a few hours away from Charlotte, when several people on the set, including director Gary Ross, recognized her.      \\"You're the girl from YouTube,\\" Ross said. Then he moved her to stand shoulder to shoulder with Jennifer Lawrence, who played Katniss, in the reaping scene where a group of gray-faced children gather to see who will be selected to fight in the arena.      \\"You can see almost my whole body in profile except my face,\\" Maddie said. \\"Although you can see my face for half a second.\\"      Her friends were thrilled.      deborah.netburn@latimes.com ||||| North Carolina State Archives and State Library of North CarolinaArchive-It Partner Since: Sep, 2005Organization Type: State Archives & LibrariesOrganization URL: http://webarchives.ncdcr.gov The mission of the North Carolina Office of Archives and History is to collect, preserve, and utilize the state's historic resources so that present and future residents may better understand their history.

Q:Background: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  At the court in Ferrara, a collection of ladies skilled in music inspired the composer Luzzasco Luzzaschi and caught the Duke's interest. This group, which led to the formation of the concerto delle donne, performed within the context of the Duke's musica secreta, a regular series of chamber music concerts performed for an exclusive audience. This preliminary group was originally made up of talented but amateur members of the court: the sisters Lucrezia and Isabella Bendidio, Leonora Sanvitale, and Vittoria Bentivoglio. They were joined by bass Giulio Cesare Brancaccio, who was specifically brought to the court in 1577 for his singing ability. The preliminary ensemble was active throughout the 1570s, and its membership solidified in 1577. Only later did professionals replace these original singers. The Duke did not announce the creation of a professional, all-female ensemble; instead, the group infiltrated and gradually dominated the musica secreta, so that after the dismissal of Brancaccio for insubordination in 1583, no more male members of the musica secreta were hired. Even when Brancaccio was performing with the consort it was referred to as a ladies' ensemble, because women singing together was the most exciting aspect of the group. This new ensemble, the concerto delle donne, was created by Alfonso in part to amuse his young new wife, Margherita Gonzaga d'Este (she was only fourteen when they wed in 1579), and in part to help the Duke achieve his artistic goals for the court. According to Grana, a contemporary correspondent, \\"Signora Machiavella [Lucrezia], Signora Isabella, and Signora Vittoria have abandoned the field, having lost the backing of Luzzaschi\\". The first recorded performance by the professional ladies was on November 20, 1580; by carnival season in 1581, they were performing together regularly.This new \\"consort of ladies\\" was viewed as an extraordinary and novel phenomenon; most witnesses did not connect the second period of the concerto delle donne with the group of ladies who sang in...

First question: What are some things new employees should know going into their first day at Mortgage Guaranty Insurance? Second question: What are some things new employees should know going into their first day at Guaranty? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First question answer: When starting your first day at Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation (MGIC) as a new employee, there are several essential things you should know. MGIC is the nation's leading private mortgage insurance company, having served mortgage lenders and homebuyers for over six decades.

Make sure to bring a team-player mindset and willingness to contribute to company growth. 2. Core Values: Understand MGIC's core values, which include customer service, integrity, excellence, teamwork, and diversity and inclusion. Align yourself with these values and exhibit them in your daily work. 3. Business Overview: Learn about the company's business, specifically how mortgage insurance works, and the role it plays in the home-buying process.

Networking: Be open to creating new connections with your coworkers in your department and throughout the organization. Attend any welcome events or team gatherings that will help you foster relationships and better integrate into the company culture. Second question answer: Entering Guaranty as a new employee requires a similar approach to the one mentioned previously, as the term \\"Guaranty\\" could be referring to a type of insurance or financial institution where you'd offer some type of guarantee. However, without knowing the specific company you are referring to, we will outline general aspects that new hires should be aware of when starting at a guaranty-related company. 1. Company Culture: Familiarize yourself with the organization's overall culture and values. Be prepared to contribute with a positive attitude and a commitment to collaboration. 2. Core Values: Research and understand the company's core values, such as customer service, integrity, innovation, and workplace diversity. Embrace and adhere to these values to succeed in your new role. 3. Business Overview: Learn about what the organization does, what types of guarantees they offer, the clients they serve, and the industry they're in.

Networking: Engage with coworkers and aim to establish strong professional relationships throughout the organization. Attend company events and team building activities to meet new colleagues and enhance your experience within the company. In conclusion, these two questions are not identical, but they do share similarities. The first question specifically refers to starting a new job at Mortgage Guaranty Insurance, whereas the second question refers to a more general guaranty company that might provide various types of guarantees, without mentioning a specific organization. Both questions involve advice for someone starting a new job in a financially focused institution requiring a good understanding of the company, its products/services, as well as its culture and values."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the background: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue.  and the situation: After the second world war Germany and France took two different policies in respect to taxation. After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries.  Answer the following question: Which country would have higher labor supply in response to their taxation? A:","output":"Based on the background information and the situation provided, the country that would have higher labour supply in response to their taxation would be Germany. The reasoning behind this lies in the Laffer curve theory.  According to the Laffer curve, there is a certain tax rate above which the labour supply and thus, government revenue starts to decline. The idea is that if the tax rate is too high, people may feel discouraged from working overtime, or might seek to evade taxes, thus reducing the overall tax revenue for the government.  In the cases of Germany and France post-World War II, you noted that Germany has chosen to implement a tax rate below this critical rate, while France chose a pro-socialist policy with a tax rate above the critical rate. Consequently, as per the theory of the Laffer curve, Germany would have created a more favourable climate for its labour market. The lower taxation rate would be more encouraging for workers to supply their labour, which would in turn potentially lead towards an increase in the government's tax revenue. On the contrary, in France, with its tax rate above the so-called 'critical rate', labour supply could have decreased as workers might feel their efforts are not being rewarded due to the heavy taxes, hence they may work less or find means to evade taxes.  Therefore, based on the Laffer curve theory, Germany would presumably have a higher labour supply in response to their taxation policies than France."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It tells of a Hebrew prophet named Jonah son of Amittai who is sent by God to prophesy the destruction of Nineveh but tries to escape the divine mission. Set in the reign of Jeroboam II (786746 BC), it was probably written in the post-exilic period, sometime between the late 5th to early 4th century BC. The story has an interesting interpretive history (see below) and has become well-known through popular children's stories. In Judaism it is the Haftarah for the afternoon of Yom Kippur due to its story of God's willingness to forgive those who repent.  - VeggieTales is an American series of children's computer animated films featuring anthropomorphic fruits and vegetables in stories conveying moral themes based on Christianity.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What place did Daniel Defoe visited in 1724?  Chat Moss may be named after St Chad, a 7th-century bishop of Mercia, but as it was once part of a great tree-edged lake, as evidenced by the numerous wood remains in the lower levels of the peat, it is perhaps more likely that the name stems from the Celtic word ced, meaning wood. Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English personal name and mos, a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the local name for a peat bog.Daniel Defoe visited the area in 1724, on his way from Warrington to Manchester: From hence (Warrington), on the road to Manchester, we pass'd the great bog or waste call'd Chatmos, the first of that kind that we see in England ... The surface, at a distance, looks black and dirty, and is indeed frightful to think of, for it will bear neither horse or man, unless in an exceeding dry season, and then not so as to be passable, or that any one should travel over them ... What nature meant by such a useless production, 'tis hard to imagine; but the land is entirely waste, excep ... for the poor cottagers fuel, and the quantity used for that is very small. Peat bogs sometimes burst their boundaries, particularly after being subjected to heavy rainfall, and this seems to have happened with Chat Moss in the 16th century. John Leland, writing during the reign of King Henry VIII, described one such event: Chat Moss brast up within a mile of Mosley Haul, and destroied much grounde with mosse thereabout, and destroyed much fresh-water fishche thereabout, first corrupting with stinkinge water Glasebrooke, and so Glasebrooke carried stinkinge water and mosse into Mersey water, and Mersey corrupted carried the roulling mosse, part to the shores of Wales, part to the isle of Man, and some unto Ireland. Chat Moss presented a significant challenge to the engineers constructing the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1826 because of the difficulty in providing a solid base... Answer:","output":"In 1724, Daniel Defoe visited Chat Moss, a peat bog located between Warrington and Manchester, while he was on his way from Warrington to Manchester."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Qomolangma Mount Qomolangma, also known as Mount Everest, has long been revered as the highest peak in the world. Towering above all others, the mountain has always been a symbol of purity, standing tall as a testament to the unspoiled land where it resides. It is here, amidst the breathtaking vistas and awe-inspiring landscapes, that one can truly appreciate the untouched beauty of our planet. The name Qomolangma has Tibetan roots, translating to \\"Mother Goddess of the Earth.\\" With its soaring height, eternal snow, and the challenge it presents to climbers, the mountain has rightfully earned this esteemed moniker. For centuries, it has been a sacred site for the Sherpa people and Tibetan Buddhists, who regard it as a sanctuary of the earth goddess, Chimy-ma-ri. As the world vies to conquer its peaks, the locals continue to uphold the sanctity and ritualistic practices that abound in this holy land. As various expeditions attempt to scale the mountain's heights, several measures have been taken to preserve its pristine nature. The Nepalese government, for instance, enforces strict rules and permits for climbers, ensuring that only those adequately equipped and prepared can embark on the risky ascent. Additionally, there is a powerful emphasis on the conservation and cleanliness of the mountain environment to protect its ecological balance. Every year, climbers from across the globe flock to the base of Qomolangma, each driven by their reasons and ambitions to reach its summit. However, true success does not lie merely in the physical accomplishment of conquering the peak. It is in the communion with nature, the respect for the mountain's history, and the insight into human limitations and potential. Climbers inevitably return with a renewed understanding of their place in the universe and the sanctity of the world's most revered peak. Moreover, the efforts to share and educate the world about the significance of preserving the purity and sanctity of Mt. Qomolangma have been a boon to both mountaineering and environmental conservation. Documentaries, movies, and literature have all sought to capture the mystique and allure of the mountain while also bringing awareness to the importance of maintaining its untouched splendor. In conclusion, Mt. Qomolangma, or Mount Everest, is far more than just the tallest peak on Earth. It stands as an enduring symbol of our planet's unblemished beauty, inspiring climbers and dreamers alike with its awe-inspiring magnificence. Let us continue to cherish and preserve the pure land that is Mount Qomolangma, and in doing so, we revere the Mother Goddess of the Earth and the majesty of our planet as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

And this was the case for basketball star Yao Ming, who hosted a television show in Shanghai that raised US  300, 000 to help researchers find a cure for SARS. Fund-raising, or charity, is an act of goodwill towards others.  Charities in the West have more ways. Look at a typical day for Ruth, a wealthy woman in the UK, for example. Ruth wakes up in the morning and collects her post. There's a letter addressed to her with a picture of a half-dead, beaten horse. It's from a charity asking Ruth to donate money to save the animals. The door bell rings and there, on Ruth's doorstep, is an old woman asking for money to help the aged. She turns on the television, hears sad music and sees a picture of a wide-eyed child dying of hunger in Africa with an appeal for money to help the child. Ruth then goes shopping for a dress to wear to that evening's large party for the rich and famous. The tickets for charity shows often cost her a large sum of money, but she doesn't mind because most of the money is going to a charity that fights AIDS. She feels good about going because she's helping the sick.  Edna, a little old lady, looks after an old secondhand shop. Any profit it has made goes to a cancer charity. Now that she has retired, she has plenty of spare time to offer her services for free.  www.ks5u.com For people like Yao Ming, Ruth and Edna, charity is a virtue that holds the same importance in life as faith and hope. \\"As you look back on your life, the moments that stand out are the moments when you have done things for others,\\" said Scottish author Henry Drummond. What's the writer's attitude towards charity? A) It's something only people like Ruth can afford to do. B) The writer only informs us of the ways to perform charity.

The path goes through Linear Park, on through the disused Devonshire and Combe Down railway tunnels, and over the Tucking Mill Viaduct. At over a mile long, the Combe Down tunnel will be the longest cycling tunnel in Britain and will feature an interactive light and sound installation. The Two Tunnels Group - a team of 11 cycling, walking and railway enthusiasts - first kicked off the plan to reopen the tunnels for public use seven years ago. Frank Tompson, chair of the group, has worked with cycling charity Sustrans - who built the route - and Bath and North East Somerset Council to create the path. \\"It's been a long journey since some of us stood between the bricked-up Devonshire and Combe Down tunnels and said, 'wouldn't it be a good idea if…',\\" he said. \\"I am really pleased that we are finally in a position to open the route to the public and estimates suggest that up to a million people might use the path each year.\\" The project is part of Sustrans five-year project to extend the National Cycle Network into the heart of communities.

Question: Information:  - The VIC-20 (Germany: VC-20; Japan: VIC-1001) is an 8-bit home computer that was sold by Commodore Business Machines. The VIC-20 was announced in 1980, roughly three years after Commodore's first personal computer, the PET. The VIC-20 was the first computer of any description to sell one million units.  - The IBM System/360 introduced byte-addressable memory with 8-bit bytes, as opposed to bit-addressable or decimal digit-addressable or word-addressable memory, although its general purpose registers were 32 bits wide, and addresses were contained in the lower 24 bits of those addresses. Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time.  - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.  - The Commodore PET (Personal Electronic Transactor) is a line of home/personal computers produced starting in 1977 by Commodore International. A top-seller in the Canadian and United States educational markets, it was Commodore's first full-featured computer, and formed the basis for their entire 8-bit product line, including the Commodore 64. The first model, which was named the PET 2001, was the third personal computer ever made available to retail consumers, after the Apple II and TRS-80.  - The Commodore 128 , also known as the C128 , C - 128 , C = 128 , or occasionally CBM 128 , is the last 8 - bit home computer that was commercially released by Commodore Business Machines ( CBM ) . Introduced in January 1985 at the CES in Las Vegas , it appeared three years after its predecessor , the bestselling Commodore 64 . The C128 is a significantly expanded successor to the C64 , with nearly full compatibility . The newer machine has 128 kB of RAM in two 64 kB banks , and an 80 - column color video output . It has a redesigned case and keyboard . Also included is a Zilog Z80 CPU which allows the C128 to run CP / M , as an alternative to the usual Commodore BASIC environment . The presence of the Z80 and the huge CP / M software library it brings , coupled with the C64 's software library , gives the C128 one of the broadest ranges of available software among its competitors . The primary hardware designer of the C128 was Bil Herd , who had worked on the Plus / 4 . Other hardware engineers were Dave Haynie and Frank Palaia , while the IC design work was done by Dave DiOrio . The main Commodore system software was developed by Fred Bowen and Terry Ryan , while the CP / M subsystem was developed by Von Ertwine .  - Commodore International (or Commodore International Limited) was a North American home computer and electronics manufacturer. Commodore International (CI), along with its subsidiary Commodore Business Machines (CBM), participated in the development of the homepersonal computer industry in the 1970s and 1980s. The company developed and marketed one of the world's best-selling desktop computers, the Commodore 64 (1982) and released its Amiga computer line in July 1985.  - The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, C-64, C= 64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64 in Sweden, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units. Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its of RAM. It had superior sound and graphical specifications compared to other earlier systems such as the Apple II and Atari 800, with multi-color sprites and a more advanced sound processor.  - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.  - A microcomputer is a small, relatively inexpensive computer with a microprocessor as its central processing unit (CPU). It includes a microprocessor, memory, and minimal input/output (I/O) circuitry mounted on a single printed circuit board. Microcomputers became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors. The predecessors to these computers, mainframes and minicomputers, were comparatively much larger and more expensive (though indeed present-day mainframes such as the IBM System z machines use one or more custom microprocessors as their CPUs). Many microcomputers (when equipped with a keyboard and screen for input and output) are also personal computers (in the generic sense).  - The IBM System/360 Model 30 was a low-end member of the IBM System/360 family. It was announced on April 7, 1964, shipped in 1965, and withdrawn on October 7, 1977.  - The IBM System/360 (S/360) is a mainframe computer system family that was announced by IBM on April 7, 1964, and delivered between 1965 and 1978. It was the first family of computers designed to cover the complete range of applications, from small to large, both commercial and scientific. The design made a clear distinction between architecture and implementation, allowing IBM to release a suite of compatible designs at different prices. All but the incompatible model 44 and the most expensive systems used microcode to implement the instruction set, which featured 8-bit byte addressing and binary, decimal and (hexadecimal) floating-point calculations.

At least 17 dead in Russian republic after suicide car bombing The injured included 10 people in critical condition and 90 in serious condition, health officials said. Investigators said the explosive device contained the equivalent of 40 kilograms of TNT. The bomb was placed inside a vehicle parked at the entrance to the central market in downtown Vladikavkaz, with a suicide bomber sitting inside the car, said the Investigative Committee of the Russian Prosecutor's Office, which qualified the attack as a \\"terrorist act.\\" The device detonated at 11:20 a.m. (3:20 a.m. ET). The committee also said the bomb was stuffed with various pieces of metal to increase the human damage. A natural gas canister, stored in the car's trunk, also detonated, the committee said. The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry is sending special medical planes to Vladikavkaz to airlift heavily injured patients to Moscow's leading trauma clinics. Friday was declared a day of national mourning in North Ossetia, according to a local government decree. Flags on all regional buildings will fly at half-staff and all entertainment programs on local TV will be cancelled as well as concerts and theater performances. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, speaking on national TV, pledged that all organizers of the deadly bombing will be identified and punished -- or killed. \\"We will do all we can to catch these monsters and animals ... who have committed a terror attack, a barbaric terror attack, against ordinary people. We will do all we can to find and punish them in accordance with the laws of our country, and we will destroy them if they offer resistance or in other circumstances,\\" Medvedev said. Meanwhile, the owner of the car used in the bomb attack has been identified and arrested, a local police official told the Interfax news agency. The detainee claims that he sold it to an unknown buyer on Wednesday, the policeman said. The Russian government announced each family of those killed will receive 1 million rubles in compensation (more than 32,000). Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin also condemned the bombing, saying, \\"The crimes like the one that was committed in the North Caucasus today are aimed at sowing enmity between our citizens. We have no right to allow this.\\" North Ossetia and the rest of the Caucasus region have been plagued with violence and political instability. The market has seen other terrorist attacks in the past. In November 2008, a suicide bomber blew up a bus at a nearby bus station, killing 12 people and wounding more than 40.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: At age 11, Ghulam was married off to 40-year-old Jaiz in a rural Afghan village, making her only one of more than 10 million young girls who are being forced to wed men old enough to be their fathers of grandfather every year. In an effort to start a global conversation about the devastating effects of early marriages, which are currently practiced in more than 50 developing countries, the United Nations designed October 11 as International Day of the Girl Child this year. Although child marriage is against the law in many countries, and international treaties forbid the practice, it is estimated that about 51 million girls below age 18 are currently married, often under the cover of darkness and in secret. In Afghanistan alone, it is believed that approximately 57 percent of girls wed before the legal age of 16. Various factors drive parents of child bridges to marry off their daughters, from the community's pressure to confirm to age-old cultural customs to economic considerations. In poor, developing nations, it is not uncommon for families to settle debts by offering their daughters as payment. Experts agree that early marriage denies the girl education and robs them of their childhood because most young wives, burdened by grownup responsibilities, do not get a chance to interact with their peers or carry on friendships outside the household. In many cases, the girls are lorded over by their husbands and in-laws, leaving them vulnerable  to domestic violence as well as physical, sexual and verbal abuse. Underage wives who are lucky enough to escape from their husbands end up living in poverty, or worse. Most girls who enter early marriages are expected to get pregnant right away, which often leads to tragedy for both the mothers, who are still children themselves, and their babies. Unless international organizations take steps to reverse the troubling trend, it is estimated that over the next decade, 100 million more girls--or about 25,000 girls a day ---will marry before they turn 18. To learn more about... The answer is:","output":"Question: What are the consequences and contributing factors of child marriage, as discussed in the article? A. Child marriage is driven by cultural customs, economic considerations, and community pressure, and often denies girls education and childhood experiences. B. Child marriage occurs only in Afghanistan, and is mainly driven by the need to settle family debts. C. Child marriage has no significant impact on the lives of young girls, as they are well-prepared for adult responsibilities. D. Child marriage is encouraged by international treaties and is legal in most developing countries. Correct Answer: A. Child marriage is driven by cultural customs, economic considerations, and community pressure, and often denies girls education and childhood experiences. Explanation: According to the article, child marriage is practiced in over 50 developing countries, affecting more than 10 million young girls every year. The factors that contribute to child marriage include community pressure to conform to age-old cultural customs and economic considerations, such as settling debts by offering daughters as payment. The consequences of child marriage are often devastating, as it denies girls education and robs them of their childhood. Most young wives do not get a chance to interact with their peers or carry on friendships outside the household, which can lead to vulnerability to domestic violence, and physical, sexual, and verbal abuse."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Six-Day War (Hebrew: מלחמת ששת הימים , \\"Milhemet Sheshet Ha Yamim\\"; Arabic: النكسة , \\"an-Naksah\\", \\"The Setback\\" or حرب ۱۹٦۷ , \\"Ḥarb 1967\\", \\"War of 1967\\"), also known as the June War, 1967 Arab–Israeli War, or Third Arab–Israeli War, was fought between June 5 and 10, 1967 by Israel and the neighboring states of Egypt (known at the time as the United Arab Republic), Jordan, and Syria. Can we draw the following conclusion? The war caused much destruction.","output":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that the Six-Day War caused much destruction. The war was characterized by its short duration but intense combat, leading to significant losses in terms of human lives, infrastructure, and territorial changes. The conflict affected all the participating countries and their people, as well as the regional dynamics in the Middle East. Firstly, human lives were lost in substantial numbers during the war. It is estimated that around 20,000 soldiers from the Arab countries (Egypt, Jordan, and Syria) were either killed or wounded. Israel, despite its victory, also suffered casualties, with approximately 800 soldiers killed and over 2,000 wounded. In addition to military casualties, hundreds of civilians were killed or wounded in the crossfires, bombings, and military operations. Secondly, the war caused extensive damage to the infrastructure and economy of the involved countries. Israel's airforce targeted and destroyed multiple airfields in Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, along with their aircraft and other military equipment, significantly weakening their military capabilities. Additionally, damage was inflicted on other infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, telecommunications, power plants, and water supplies. These damages crippled the economies of the affected countries, diverting resources to try and compensate for the destruction. Thirdly, the territorial changes brought about by the war played a significant role in shaping the Middle East's landscape. As a result of its victory, Israel captured the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria. These territorial gains had far-reaching consequences, notably, the displacement of thousands of Palestinians and Syrians from their homes. The occupation of these territories created a new source of tension and conflict in the region, contributing to numerous subsequent clashes and negotiations. Lastly, the Six-Day War had significant political consequences, leading to a change in power dynamics in the region. Israel's swift victory over much larger and seemingly more powerful Arab armed forces led to the perception of its military invincibility, changing the Arab-Israeli balance of power in Israel's favor. The war also magnified the animosity between Arab countries and Israel. Furthermore, it intensified the regional rivalry between Israel's primary military and political supporter, the United States, and the Soviet Union, which backed Egypt and Syria, further fueling the tensions associated with the Cold War. In conclusion, the Six-Day War caused much destruction in various aspects, including human lives, infrastructure, territorial changes, and political dynamics in the Middle East and beyond. The consequences of the war have had lasting effects on the region, shaping its ongoing conflicts and struggles for peace."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Jafar, the Grand Vizier of the Sultan, and his parrot Iago, seek the lamp hidden within the Cave of Wonders but is told that only a âdiamond in the roughâ may enter. Jafar identifies a street urchin named Aladdin as worthy. Aladdin and his pet monkey Abu cross paths with Princess Jasmine, who has run away from the palace, unwilling to be married off to another snobbish suitor. Aladdin and Jasmine become friends and fall in love, but Jafar has Aladdin apprehended, tricking Jasmine into thinking that he was decapitated. Disguised as an old man, Jafar frees Aladdin and Abu, taking them to the Cave and promises to reward them if they retrieve the lamp. Inside, Aladdin befriends a magic carpet. Abu greedily tries to steal a jewel, despite the Caveâs request, and it collapses. Trapped underground, Aladdin rubs the lamp, releasing the Genie trapped inside, who explains Aladdin has become his master and will grant him three wishes. Aladdin tricks the Genie into freeing them from the Cave without wasting a wish, and then uses his first to become a prince to be near Jasmine.

Despite his friends advising him to tell Jasmine the truth, Aladdin refuses, believing she would never fall âfor some street ratâ. He takes Jasmine on a worldwide flight on the carpet, where she deduces his identity, though Aladdin says that he dresses as a peasant to escape the stresses of royal life, which convinces her.

He also described the music video for \\"Good-Day Ray\\" as being one of the better videos the band had made.Internationalist's third single was \\"Already Gone\\", released on 12 February 1999. The song was a tribute to the Beatles and their influence on Powderfinger's music. The fourth and final single from the album was \\"Passenger\\", released on 9 August 1999.  \\"Passenger\\" was influenced by Elvis Presley, and included a big horn section, as well as backing vocals from folk group Tiddas. \\"Passenger\\" won the ARIA Award for \\"Song Of The Year\\" in 1999. The song's music video was one of Powderfinger's first to feature computer graphics, and was produced by Fifty Fifty Films. \\"Passenger\\" spent 11 weeks on the ARIA Charts, peaking at #30. It appeared at #48 on Max's top 100 songs from the 1990s list.  Guess a valid title for it!

U's right-back Phil Edwards handled Ademola Lookman's deep free-kick and Jackson calmly planted the spot-kick straight into the middle of the goal as Simon Eastwood dived to the right. That was the first goal Oxford had conceded for over five and a half hours. However, they equalised on a swift counter-attack in the 67th minute as substitute Kane Hemmings picked out Maguire making a run to his right, and Maguire drove beyond Declan Rudd from 14 yards. Both teams produced some free-flowing passing football in the first half. Rudd saved superbly to turn Chey Dunkley's header for a corner and Marvin Johnson twice went close with angled shots. Eastwood raced off his line to block Lookman's shot with his legs and late in the game the U's goalkeeper brilliantly tipped over Josh Magennis' point-blank header.

Baku is the capital of a country named Azerbaijan. The Swiss embassy is like a little office where people from Switzerland work and help other people who want to visit or learn about their country. Now, this man really wanted to go to the embassy, but he wanted to look different while doing it. So, he decided to change the way he looked! Do you remember how Clark Kent turns into Superman by just changing his clothes and taking off his glasses? Just like that, this man also decided to change his hair color. He had beautiful dark hair, but he wanted to look more like people from Europe, so he dyed his hair blond. Have you ever seen people with different hair colors like red, blue, or pink? Sometimes people change their hair color to look cool or just for fun. This man did it to look more European while going to the Swiss embassy. So, with his new blond hair, the man went to the Swiss embassy in Baku. You might be wondering what happened when he got there. Did the people in the embassy believe he was European? We are not sure about that, but we know for sure that this man became famous for trying to change his appearance just to visit the Swiss embassy. In conclusion, this story teaches us that sometimes, people do unusual things, like changing their hair color or the way they look, for different reasons.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who collaborated with the fascist Franco regime?  The movie opens with shots from the Spanish Civil War, and a line of Spanish refugees crossing the border into France after defeat by the Francoists. Republican guerrilla fighter Manuel Artiguez turns away from the border and back towards Spain. His friends stop him, saying \\"Manuel, the war is over!\\". The story returns twenty years later, to a young boy named Paco, who asks a man named Pedro why Artiguez, who is legendary for his fierce resistance to Franco even after the defeat of the Republicans, has stopped his guerrilla raids against the Francoists in Spain. Pedro sends Paco into France to find his uncle and Artiguez. Paco tells Artiguez that he wants him to kill Viñolas, a Guardia Civil officer, for killing his father. Paco lets Artiguez know that his father was killed because he wouldn't tell the police where to find Artiguez, whom Viñolas must capture if he is to retain his rank in the Guard.  Meanwhile, Viñolas has learned that Artiguez's mother is dying, and sets a trap at the hospital in San Martín to capture Artiguez, presuming that he will come to see his mother. Like all Republican sympathizers, she is contemptuous and deeply suspicious of all Catholic clergy, who collaborated with the fascist Franco regime, both during and after the war. In return for information about the layout of the hospital and surrounding area, Paco tells Artiguez to \\"bump into Viñolas\\" for him.

Based on the given review \\"Open source,\\" it is challenging to provide a rating on a scale of 1-5, as there is minimal information and context. However, let's try to analyze the given review based on the available information. 1. Length: The review consists only of two words, \\"Open source.\\" It is quite short and does not give any additional information beyond mentioning that the subject is open source. 2. Depth of analysis: Due to its brevity, there's no explicit analysis of the subject, be it a product, service, or idea. The review lacks any elaboration on the pros, cons, or features of the subject being discussed. It also doesn't mention the reviewer's personal experience or opinion. 3. Relevance: The review seems to mention the open-source nature of the subject, which, in some cases, can be a significant factor when evaluating it. Open source usually implies that the source code is accessible to the public and can be freely used, modified, and redistributed. For some people, this can be viewed as a positive attribute, while others may not find it importantly crucial or to have any significant bearing on their evaluation. 4. Overall quality: With only two words, the review does not provide enough information for someone to make a decision or form an opinion on the subject. The lack of context and details make it impossible to discern whether the reviewer considers the open-source nature as a positive or a negative factor. Given all these factors, it seems fair to give this review a rating of 1 (least favorable) on a scale of 1-5. This rating is mainly because the review is too short to provide any valuable insight or assistance to someone looking for feedback on the subject. A more comprehensive review that includes context, in-depth analysis, and personal opinions would allow for a higher rating on the scale."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The children's mother remarries in less than a year, going to a strict Bishop Edvard Vergerus' (Jan Malmsjö) house with none of her furniture, none of the children's toys, and an optimism that she can make a good thing of it despite his powerfully controlling personality. Alexander learns from the ghost of the Bishop's first wife that she and her children died trying to escape after having been locked up for days. They climbed out a window but failed to make it across the cold fast-flowing stream that separates the back of the house from the town. Alexander tells this to a servant who repeats it to the Bishop.

Prepubertal children and early adolescents with bipolar disorders (PEA-BP) who participate in the ongoing study \\"Phenomenology and Course of Pediatric Bipolar Disorders\\" have a high prevalence of ultradian (within 24-hour periods) rapid cycling. Based on a case-control finding reported in bipolar (BP) adults of an association between rapid and ultradian rapid cycling with the low-activity allele of catechol-O-methyltransferase (l-COMT), study of linkage and linkage disequilibrium of l-COMT in the PEA-BP population seemed warranted.', \\"Genotypes on a subset of the larger PEA-BP sample, for whom trio blood collection was complete (i. e., probands and both of their biological parents), were used to perform transmission disequilibrium tests (TDTs).

This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up.  Two competing countries used different energy sources to produce their electricity. Turkey used mostly fossil fuels, while Greece used nuclear power.  Which country used more radioactive elements? The answer to this question is:","output":"Greece used more radioactive elements because they relied on nuclear power for their electricity production. Nuclear power plants utilize radioactive elements, such as uranium or plutonium, to generate electricity through a process called nuclear fission. In contrast, Turkey relied mostly on fossil fuels, which do not contain radioactive elements, for their electricity production.

They were large dogs, and they attacked my legs, knocking me down. I knew it was very dangerous to be down on the ground, as I was most vulnerable. I covered my genitalia, my neck and my face, as I struggled to regain my feet. Fortunately, during my fall, I saw a large tree branch on the ground near me.

When she saw me hitting her dogs with a stick, she called the dogs off of me. I asked her why her dogs attacked me, and why she laughed at me. She said that she had just given her dogs a big steak bone and they were upset when I came near and attacked me. I asked her why she would set me up in this way when she knew I was on the way over. She admitted that she wanted to see what happened, and she said that when she saw what happened she thought that it was funny. I did not keep the appointment with her.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it.

Cary Grant (born Archibald Alec Leach; January 18, 1904 - November 29, 1986) was an English-American actor, known as one of classic Hollywood's definitive leading men. He began a career in Hollywood in the early 1930s, and became known for his transatlantic accent, debonair demeanor, and light-hearted approach to acting and sense of comic timing. He became an American citizen in 1942. Born in Horfield, Bristol, Grant became attracted to theatre at a young age, and began performing with a troupe known as \\"The Penders\\" from the age of six. Biographers Morecambe and Stirling believe that Cary Grant was the \\"greatest leading man Hollywood had ever known\\". Schickel stated that there are \\"very few stars who achieve the magnitude of Cary Grant, art of a very high and subtle order\\", and thought that he was the \\"best star actor there ever was in the movies\\". David Thomson and directors Stanley Donen and Howard Hawks concurred that Grant was the greatest and most important actor in the history of the cinema. He was a favorite of Hitchcock, who admired him and called him \\"the only actor I ever loved in my whole life\\", and remained one of Hollywood's top box-office attractions for almost 30 years. Wansell wrote: \\"To millions of movie-goers around the world, Cary Grant will forever epitomize the glamour, and the style, of Hollywood in its golden years. With his dark hair, and even darker eyes, mischievous smile and effortless elegance, he was, is, and always will be indelibly one of the great movie stars. Since his death in 1986, the incandescence of his screen image has not dimmed for a single moment\\". Kael stated that the world still thinks of him affectionately, because he \\"embodies what seems a happier time-a time when we had a simpler relationship to a performer.\\"  Grant was nominated for two Academy Awards, for Penny Serenade (1941) and None But the Lonely Heart (1944), but never won a competitive Oscar; he received a special Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1970. The inscription on his statuette read \\"To Cary Grant, for his unique mastery of the art of screen acting with respect and affection of his colleagues\\". On being presented with the award, his friend Frank Sinatra announced: \\"It was made for the sheer brilliance of acting ... No one has brought more pleasure to more people for so many years than Cary has, and nobody has done so many things so well\\".  At the Straw Hat Awards in New York in May 1975, Grant was awarded a special plaque which recognized the city's appreciation of him as a \\"star and superstar in entertainment\\". The following August, he was invited by Betty Ford to give a speech at the Republican National Convention in Kansas City and to attend the Bicentenary dinner for Queen Elizabeth II at the White House that same year. He was later invited in 1978 to attend a royal charity gala at the London Palladium. In 1979, Grant hosted the American Film Institute's tribute to Alfred Hitchcock, and presented Laurence Olivier with his honorary Oscar.  In 1981, Grant was accorded the Kennedy Center Honors. Three years later, a theatre on the MGM lot was renamed the \\"Cary Grant Theatre\\". In 1995, when over a hundred leading film directors were asked to reveal their favorite actor of all time in a Time Out poll, Grant came second only to Marlon Brando. On December 7, 2001, a statue of Grant was unveiled in Millennium Square, a regenerated area next to Bristol Harbour, Bristol, in the city where he was born.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How is \\"Regarding the latter, Ban said a sustainable solution remains elusive.\\" said in Romanian?","output":"In Romanian, \\"Regarding the latter, Ban said a sustainable solution remains elusive.\\" is translated as \\"Referitor la acesta din urmă, Ban a declarat că o soluție durabilă rămâne greu de găsit.\\" Let's breakdown this translation for a better understanding: - \\"Regarding\\" translates to \\"Referitor la\\". In Romanian, \\"Regarding\\" refers to something that has already been mentioned before and it is usually followed by the preposition \\"la\\". - \\"The latter\\" translates to \\"acesta din urmă\\", which refers to the last of a mentioned series. In Romanian, it is not uncommon for the verb to be closer to the end of the sentence, thus changing the order of some phrases. Hence, \\"The latter\\" is translated after \\"Regarding\\". - \\"Ban\\" remains the same as it's a proper noun. Note, Semantically, \\"Ban\\" could refer to an individual's name, or an organization such as the United Nations Ban Ki-moon. - \\"Said a\\" can be translated to \\"a declarat că\\". While \\"said\\" directly translates to \\"a spus\\", in this context, the statement seems to be formal so using \\"a declarat că\\" (declared that) is more appropriate in Romanian. - \\"Sustainable\\" translates to \\"durabilă\\". \\"Sustainable\\" is an adjective and in Romanian it agrees in gender and number with the noun it modifies. In this case, it modifies \\"soluție\\" which is feminine singular, so we use \\"durabilă\\". - \\"Solution\\" translates to \\"soluție\\". This noun remains relatively the same in both languages, but remember Romanian nouns have genders and \\"soluție\\" is feminine, which influenced our earlier translation of \\"sustainable\\". - \\"Remains elusive\\" translates to \\"rămâne greu de găsit\\". The verb \\"remains\\" could directly translate to \\"rămâne\\", while the adjective \\"elusive\\" is not directly translated but replaced by the phrase \\"greu de găsit\\" that suggests something is \\"hard to find\\". This is done to preserve the overall meaning of the sentence, as an elusive solution is one that is difficult to obtain or find.  So, in a romanian sentence constructions, the above translations is \\"Referitor la acesta din urmă, Ban a declarat că o soluție durabilă rămâne greu de găsit.\\""},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Two brothers Syd and Dan went to college. Syd studied plate tectonics and mantle melting. His brother Dan got to study types of soil and pedology.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which brother studied more about rising temperatures influencing mantle melting?  Hint: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.

William Taylor (July 24, 1921 - December 28, 2010) was an American jazz pianist, composer, broadcaster and educator. He was the Robert L. Jones Distinguished Professor of Music at East Carolina University in Greenville, and from 1994 was the artistic director for jazz at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. A jazz activist, Taylor sat on the Honorary Founders Board of The Jazz Foundation of America, an organisation he started in 1989, with Ann Ruckert, Herb Storfer and Phoebe Jacobs, to save the homes and the lives of America's elderly jazz and blues musicians, later including musicians who survived Hurricane Katrina. Taylor was also a jazz educator, who lectured in colleges, served on panels and travelled worldwide as a jazz ambassador. In 1952 Taylor composed one of his most famous tunes, \\"I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free\\", which achieved more popularity with the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Nina Simone covered the song in her 1967 album Silk & Soul. The tune is widely known in the UK as a piano instrumental version, used for BBC Television's long-running Film... programme. He made dozens of recordings in the 1950s and 1960s, notably the album with Cuban percussionist Candido Camero, entitled Billy Taylor Trio with Candido, My Fair Lady Loves Jazz, Cross Section and Taylor Made Jazz.  Taylor's broadcast career also thrived. In 1961, he founded New York's Jazzmobile, which provides an arts education program via workshops, master classes, lecture demonstrations, arts enrichment programs, outdoor summer mobile concerts, special indoor concerts and special projects. In 1958, he became the Musical Director of NBC's The Subject Is Jazz, the first ever television series focusing on jazz. The 13-part series was produced by the new National Educational Television Network (NET) and hosted guests including Ellington, Aaron Copland, Bill Evans, Cannonball Adderley, Jimmy Rushing and Langston Hughes.  Taylor also worked as a DJ and program director on radio station WLIB in New York in the 1960s. During the 1960s, the Billy Taylor Trio was a regular feature of the Hickory House on West 55th Street in Manhattan. From 1969 to 1972, he served as the music director for The David Frost Show and was the first African American to lead a talk-show band. Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Benny Goodman and Buddy Rich were just a few of the musicians who played on the show.  In 1981, Jazzmobile produced a jazz special for National Public Radio, for which the program received the Peabody Award for Excellence in Broadcasting Programs. Jazzmobile's 1990 Tribute Concert to Dr. Taylor at Avery Fisher Hall, part of the JVC Jazz Festival, featured Nancy Wilson, Ahmad Jamal Trio and Terence Blanchard Quintet.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a question about this article: The multiple churches that form the Anglican Communion and the Continuing Anglican movement have different views on Marian doctrines and venerative practices given that there is no single church with universal authority within the Communion and that the mother church (the Church of England) understands itself to be both \\"catholic\\" and \\"Reformed\\". Thus unlike the Protestant churches at large, the Anglican Communion (which includes the Episcopal Church in the United States) includes segments which still retain some veneration of Mary. What is the answer to this question: What branch of Christianity does the Angican Communion fall under?","output":"The Anglican Communion falls under the Anglican branch of Christianity. Originating in the Church of England, the Anglican Communion is a worldwide family of autonomous churches that maintain a shared heritage and common ties in theological, liturgical, and ecclesiological practices.  Anglicanism came into existence following the English Reformation in the 16th century when King Henry VIII separated the English Church from the authority of the Roman Catholic Church. This split resulted in the formation of a distinct theological and liturgical identity that has continued to evolve over the centuries. While maintaining many aspects of Roman Catholicism, the Anglican Communion also incorporates elements of Protestantism and emphasizes the authority of scripture, reason, and tradition in the development of its beliefs and practices. Overall, the Anglican Communion stands as a unique and diverse branch of Christianity, situated on the spectrum between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. This positioning is due in part to the Church of England's self-understanding as both \\"catholic\\" and \\"Reformed,\\" as mentioned in the article. This dual nature allows for a wide range of views within the Anglican Communion on various doctrines and practices, including the veneration of Mary. While certain segments of the Anglican Communion still uphold Marian doctrines and practices that align with Roman Catholic traditions, other segments lean more towards Protestant understandings of Mary's role in the Christian faith. In summary, the Anglican Communion is a distinct branch of Christianity that encompasses a diverse range of beliefs and practices, rooted in both \\"catholic\\" and \\"Reformed\\" traditions. This theological diversity is reflected in the varying views on Marian doctrines and venerative practices within the Anglican Communion and the Continuing Anglican movement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","output":"Bernie Madoff was selling a fraudulent investment scheme known as a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme is a type of investment fraud that relies on the constant inflow of new investors' money to pay returns to earlier investors. This creates the illusion of a legitimate and profitable business when, in reality, there is no actual profit being generated. Madoff claimed to be using a proprietary trading strategy called \\"split-strike conversion\\" to generate consistent high returns for his clients. He attracted thousands of investors, promising them steady returns with low risk. However, instead of investing the money properly, Madoff used the new investments to pay out returns to previous investors, essentially robbing Peter to pay Paul. Your statement, \\"Madoff said he began the Ponzi scheme in the early 1990s,\\" would be a reasonable answer to when his fraudulent activities started. Bernie Madoff confessed in 2008 that he had been running the Ponzi scheme since the early 1990s, although some evidence suggests that it may have begun even earlier. Ultimately, Madoff's scheme collapsed under the weight of mounting redemptions requests during the 2008 financial crisis. Madoff confessed to his sons, who then alerted authorities to his massive fraud. In 2009, he was convicted and sentenced to 150 years in prison.

The detailed long answer is as follows: The Critical Text of the Book of Mormon Project is a significant undertaking aimed at restoring, to the extent possible, the original English language text of the Book of Mormon. This project, led by Royal Skousen, utilized the gathered fragments of the Original Manuscript of the Book of Mormon and applied advanced photographic techniques to obtain fine readings from otherwise unreadable pages and fragments. The original manuscript of the Book of Mormon was written by various scribes as Joseph Smith dictated his translation. Over time, parts of the manuscript experienced damage or were lost due to various factors such as exposure to the elements and improper storage. The remaining fragments, some of which are in private hands or held by institutions, have been vital in enabling this project to restore the text of the Book of Mormon. The availability of these fragments has enabled researchers to understand better the textual changes that may have occurred through copying, editing, and printing processes. The project's use of advanced photographic techniques allows for a greater understanding of the text, even when the physical condition of the manuscript fragments is not optimal. These techniques include ultraviolet photography, which can reveal text that is invisible to the naked eye due to ink deterioration or other factors. By applying these techniques, researchers can glean valuable information from the fragments and establish a clearer understanding of the text's wording, spelling, and punctuation. In conclusion, the Critical Text of the Book of Mormon Project utilized the gathered fragments of the Original Manuscript of the Book of Mormon and employed advanced photographic techniques to obtain fine readings from otherwise unreadable pages and fragments.

Article: Most bacterial species are either spherical, called cocci (sing. coccus, from Greek kókkos, grain, seed), or rod-shaped, called bacilli (sing. bacillus, from Latin baculus, stick). Elongation is associated with swimming. Some bacteria, called vibrio, are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma-shaped; others can be spiral-shaped, called spirilla, or tightly coiled, called spirochaetes. A small number of species even have tetrahedral or cuboidal shapes. More recently, some bacteria were discovered deep under Earth's crust that grow as branching filamentous types with a star-shaped cross-section. The large surface area to volume ratio of this morphology may give these bacteria an advantage in nutrient-poor environments. This wide variety of shapes is determined by the bacterial cell wall and cytoskeleton, and is important because it can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape predators.

The trial of Anders Behring Breivik was interrupted briefly Friday when the brother one of his 77 victims hurled a shoe at the confessed mass killer and yelled, \\"Go to hell,\\" before being escorted from the court room, police and witnesses said.      Anders Behring Breivik, who has admitted to the July 22, 2011 massacre and a bombing in Oslo that killed eight people earlier that day, stands with a police woman in court in Oslo Thursday May 10, 2012.... (Associated Press)      It was the first outburst from the normally subdued crowd watching the terror trial in Oslo's district court since the proceedings began in mid-April.      Breivik _ a self-styled, anti-Muslim militant _ has been charged with terrorism, admitting he carried out a bomb-and-shooting rampage that stunned Norway on July 22.      On Friday, forensic experts were going through autopsy reports for some of the 69 victims killed in the shooting massacre at a youth camp that day, when a man in the second row suddenly stood up, said Mikaela Akerman, a Swedish journalist who was in the court room.      \\"He threw one of his shoes at the desk where Breivik sits with his defense lawyers,\\" Akerman told The Associated Press. He shouted, 'You killer, go to hell.' And repeated it several times.\\"      She said Breivik remained calm and \\"smiled a little\\" as he watched security guards apprehend the man and lead him out of the court room.      \\"He keeps shouting and is crying heavily as he's being led out,\\" Akerman said. \\"Some of the spectators clapped their hands. Some yelled 'Bravo.' Many others started crying.\\"      Breivik addressed the court as proceedings resumed after a 10-minute break. \\"If someone wants to throw something at me, you can do it when I walk in or when I leave, thank you,\\" he said, according to Akerman.      Throwing of shoes to insult someone has long been a form of protest in many countries, but the practice gained widespread attention when an Iraqi threw his shoes at then-U.S. President George W. Bush at a televised news conference in Baghdad in 2008 during the Iraq war.      Police didn't identify the shoe-thrower in Oslo but said he was the brother of one of the victims.      Police operations leader Rune Bjoersvik downplayed the outburst, calling it a \\"spontaneous and emotional reaction\\" that didn't pose a \\"serious security risk.\\"      The incident was a sharp break with the polite atmosphere that has reigned inside the court room, even as Breivik explained his killing of 77 people in a bomb-and-shooting rampage on July 22.      The far-right fanatic has admitted to the attacks but pleaded innocent to terror charges, saying the victims were traitors for embracing multiculturalism.      ___      Associated Press writer Karl Ritter in Stockholm contributed to this report. ||||| A police officer looks at far right mass killer Anders Behring Breivik (R) in court in Oslo May 10, 2012.      OSLO (Reuters) - The brother of a man gunned down by Anders Behring Breivik hurled a shoe at the mass killer in court on Friday, shouting \\"Go to hell, go to hell, you killed my brother.\\"      The outburst followed days of harrowing testimony from survivors of Norway's worst peacetime massacre.      The shoe missed Breivik but struck his co-defense lawyer, Vibeke Hein Baera, who was seated closest to the public gallery, during the presentation of an autopsy report.      Police said the attacker, who was quickly escorted from the court, was a brother of one of the 69 people Breivik methodically shot dead on the small island of Utoeya last July during a youth camp organized by the ruling Labour Party.      Breivik admits the killings but denies criminal responsibility, saying he was defending Norwegian ethnic purity from Muslim immigration and the multiculturalism policies of the governing Labour Party.      The Aftenposten newspaper named the man who threw the shoe as Hayder Mustafa Qasim, an Iraqi whose asylum seeker brother was killed on the island by Breivik.      \\"I took off my shoe, stood up, shouted at the killer, got eye contact with him and threw the shoe,\\" Qasim told Aftenposten. \\"Go to hell killer! I shouted. He looked right into my eyes. I felt that he had understood my message.\\"      \\"My brother was killed on Utoeya. He was alone in Norway, without family. The killer took his life. And he ruined my life and my family's life.\\"      The incident evoked the gesture by an Iraqi reporter who hurled his shoes at former U.S. President George W. Bush in 2008. Hitting someone with a shoe is considered particularly insulting in the Middle East because footwear is regarded as unclean.      Some in the courtroom applauded Qasim's gesture, some said \\"finally\\" and others started to cry. Police, removed him from the court and increased their presence to avoid further interruptions of the trial, which is expected to last 10 weeks.      Local media quoted Breivik, 33, as saying after the incident: \\"If anyone wants to throw something, you can throw it at me when I'm entering or leaving the court.      \\"Don't throw things at my lawyers.\\"      Friday's outburst was the first interruption of proceedings. Many observers have been surprised by the cool Nordic civility on display in the courtroom despite a killing spree which traumatized this nation of five million.      GRIEF      Friday's incident came at the end of a week of harrowing testimony from survivors of Breivik's killing spree. As well as those shot dead, eight others died in a massive car bomb Breivik detonated outside the prime minister's offices in central Oslo.      Police played down the shoe throwing incident.      \\"We regard this as a spontaneous emotional outburst,\\" Rune Bjoersvik, the police officer charge of police operations in the court, told Reuters.      \\"We wish it hadn't happened, but we don't regard this a dramatic breach of safety.\\"      Throughout his trial Breivik has listened calmly to the descriptions of his killings and shown little emotion, except when hearing descriptions about how he was said to have let out \\"cries of joy\\" and laughed while shooting, which he has denied.      During Friday's hearing Breivik said one person at Utoeya had thrown an object at his face as he went about the small island shooting his victims. But he gave no more details.      Breivik has said he should either be executed or acquitted, calling the prospect of a prison sentence \\"pathetic\\" and an insanity ruling \\"worse than death\\". Ahead of his trial, court-appointed psychiatrists concluded he was psychotic but a second team came to the opposite conclusion.      If deemed sane, Breivik faces a 21-year jail sentence with indefinite extensions for as long as he is considered dangerous.

The controversial Channel 4 show prompted a furore in January from viewers who claimed it was 'poverty porn' which misrepresented benefit claimants across Britain. But broadcasting watchdog Ofcom ruled the show about James Turner Street, Birmingham, was clearly a portrayal of one street and not wider society. Scroll down for video. Furore: The Channel 4 show Benefits Street, which included controversial welfare claimant 'White' Dee Kelly (pictured), has been cleared of breaching Ofcom's guidelines despite sparking more than 900 complaints. The watchdog admitted parts of the show would offend some viewers but said: 'The beginning of every episode in the. series included an introduction in which the narrator stated: \\"James. Turner Street in Birmingham is not your average street…and most of the. residents are claiming benefits.\\" 'The aim of the series was therefore. presented as being a record of the daily lives of some of the residents. of this particular road to inform viewers about their lives and their. community. 'Ofcom’s view was that it would have been clear to viewers,. over the course of the series, that this was an observational. documentary about the experiences of one community. 'Therefore, after careful consideration, we. concluded that overall Channel 4 ensured there was sufficient context. over the course of the series to justify the offence and that it applied. generally accepted standards.' The series was a ratings hit for. Channel 4 but drew criticism for allegedly demonising those living on. the breadline. It caused a stir when it was screened. and prompted discussion in Parliament as well as public meetings in the. area where some of those featured claimed they were misrepresented. Ruling: Ofcom said the portrayal of James Turner Street (pictured) was not meant to reflect all of Britain. The vast majority of complaints - 887 - were about the way. those on benefits were portrayed. Some 23 viewers also raised fears about. children and young people featured in the show and the care which was. given by programme makers for their welfare and dignity. Ofcom also ruled in Channel 4's favour on these complaints, none of which were from those featured in the show, saying: 'After a thorough assessment of the evidence,. Ofcom found sufficient steps were taken before, during and after. production to protect the welfare of the children that appeared in the. programme and that any potentially offensive material was justified by. the context in which it was presented. 'Ofcom has therefore concluded. that the series did not breach its rules.' There. were also 40 complaints about the programmes demonstrating criminal. techniques, including shoplifting. But Ofcom said it was. satisfied that there was an editorial justification for their inclusion. and there were not enough details for people to copy the techniques. Controversy: James Turner Street in Birmingham became the subject of a national debate in January. A Channel 4 spokesman said: 'We welcome Ofcom's finding that Benefits Street did not breach the code in any respect. 'We are proud that our robust duty of care protocols for the child contributors have been praised for \\"demonstrating best practice\\", and for the recognition that we 'ensured the interests of the under-18s who featured in Benefits Street were protected and that due care was applied before, during and after production. 'Ofcom noted that the series \\"illustrated important issues facing some children living in contemporary Britain\\" and that \\"the children's welfare was at the heart of the production\\".' Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Benefits Street was a TV show about people living on a street called James Turner Street in Birmingham, where most of the residents were getting help from the government, like money, because they did not have jobs or enough money to take care of themselves. Some people complained that the show was making fun of poor people and not showing the truth about people who need help from the government. But the group that checks if TV shows are following the rules, called Ofcom, said that the show was just telling the story of this one street and not trying to say that everyone in similar situations was the same.

Here is a news article: The fourth debate of the 2012 Republican presidential race is in the books!            After live-blogging the proceedings, we turn to our favorite part of any debate night: looking at who won and who lost.      Our take is below. Agree or disagree with our picks? Leave a question or comment for today’s Fix Face-off video Q&A, or in the comments section below.      WINNERS      * Mitt Romney: Four debates. Four times Romney has wound up in the winner’s circle. It’s not a coincidence. Romney proved yet again that he is the best debater in this field with another solid performance in which he effectively downplayed his liabilities on health care and accentuated his strengths on jobs and the economy. Romney played more offense than he has in previous debates, taking the fight to Texas Gov. Rick Perry on Social Security. He also got a major assist from Rep. Michele Bachmann (Minn.) and former senator Rick Santorum (Pa.), both of whom relentlessly bashed Perry. But that’s how debates work. Romney also, smartly, ignored the tea party audience in the hall — who occasionally booed him — and focused his messaging on the much broader audience of people watching the debate on CNN.      * Newt Gingrich: The former House Speaker was at his populist best tonight, repeatedly delivering one-liners that had the crowd on his side. This was the Gingrich that many Republican strategists predicted would be a major player in the GOP race when 2011 began. Unfortunately for Gingrich, he lacks the sort of campaign organization in early states that would allow him to capi­tal­ize on what was clearly a good night for him.      * Michele Bachmann: The Minnesota Congresswoman did a lot with not all that much time. Picking a fight with Perry on the HPV vaccination issue was smart and seemed to energize her for the final 30 minutes or so of the debate. There was no game-changer for Bachmann in this debate but she was far more relevant to the conversation than her no-show last week in California. Small victories.      * The Santorum-Gingrich Alliance: Who says there is no love lost between these Republican contenders? Time after time Gingrich and Santorum praised one another for their work on issues — cementing a sort of alliance that makes for an interesting (if minor) storyline going forward. Could Santorum and Gingrich be the next great tag team of the 2012 Republican race? Which bring us to....      * Professional wrestling fans: The opening of the CNN debate felt exactly like the beginning of a pay-per-view wrestling match. (Not that we would spend our hard-earned money on such things. Ahem.) From the descriptions of the candidates — “The Businessman”....”The Libertarian” — to Wolf Blitzer giving each candidate their own introduction onto the stage, it felt like a theatrical production. Which, of course, it was.      LOSERS      * Rick Perry: The frontrunner didn’t get it done tonight. After surviving the expected back and forth with Romney over Social Security, Perry seemed to let his guard down a bit when the subject turned to his executive order on the HPV vaccine. Big mistake. Bachmann lit into him and Santorum jumped on too. (Romney said nothing but had to be thrilled with the development.) Perry tried to emphasize that he was acting to save lives but it didn’t sell. Following that exchange, he looked flustered and missed a chance to go after Romney in a more meaningful way on health care. And Perry’s answer on illegal immigration drew boos from the audience. Looking for a silver lining for Perry? He demonstrated a willingness to clean up self-created messes on both Social Security and his “treasonous” remark about Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.      * Jon Huntsman: The former Utah governor started with a Kurt Cobain joke....and went downhill from there. After a very solid performance in California last week, Huntsman regressed badly — bouncing between bad one-liners and outright snark. At times he seemed to disappear from the debate completely and when he did get a chance to speak, Huntsman seemed more interested in winning a laugh from the audience than making a point. Not good.      * Ron Paul: We wrote earlier today that the tea party debate might be a moment for Dr. Paul. Or not. Paul often felt like an afterthought and when the conversation turned to foreign policy Paul got lustily booed by the crowd — and attacked by Santorum — for his views on the post-September 11 landscape. Paul’s answer — and his refusal to back down — made clear that he simply isn’t within the mainstream of Republican thought on the issue, making any growth beyond his base very difficult.      * 90-minute debate fans: Is two hours the new normal for debates? The Fix is no spring chicken and these long debates are robbing us of our precious beauty sleep.      More on PostPolitics      Perry, Romney clash on Social Security      Romney uses Boeing issue to appeal to tea party      Florida GOP debate      Perry, Romney spar on Social Security ||||| TAMPA, Fla. — This did not feel like your father’s presidential debate.      A triumph for a movement born just over two years ago, the first-ever tea party presidential debate was a clear departure from the four previous ones this cycle — or before.      Text Size -      +      reset POLITICO 44      Inside a dusty warehouse on a fairground, instead of a marbled presidential library, the crowd was rabidly partisan, bursting with boisterous applause that served as a live dial meter for the candidates to measure — and adjust to — in real time.      Afterward, instead of whisking away in their black SUVs, most of the contenders headed across the street for a mix and mingle afterparty with those who served up the questions.      The crowd is, after all, expecting to be in charge from here on out.      “We are going to choose the next Republican nominee for president, not the Republican Party,” said Amy Kremer, chair of the Tea Party Express, which partnered with CNN for the two-hour event to the audience just minutes before the eight GOP contenders took the stage.      The substance wasn’t all that different as the candidates were pelted with questions from tea party activists around the country and via satellite in addition to CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer: Aside from the Federal Reserve and the Fair Tax, Monday covered typical issues like immigration, health care and job creation.      But unlike in other debate settings where the crowds refrain from jolting reactions, this gathering was humming with emotion, releasing almost instantaneous bursts of audible approval or dissatisfaction.      The real message being delivered was a shot across the bow: Any contender who wants a realistic shot at winning back the White House will need the tea party’s fervor to make it happen.      “I definitely think the energy and enthusiasm in this debate from the people in the audience, there was way more of it,” said Kremer in an interview after. “They should feel it. What we have is the passion, the fire in the belly. That’s organic. It can’t be bought and can’t be created.”      The process wasn’t always pretty.      Ron Paul was booed when he tried to explain what he sees as America’s role in the root causes of the Sept. 11 attacks. So was Rick Perry — for his defense of a Texas law that gave in-state college tuition to children of illegal immigrants.      Jon Huntsman got perhaps the coldest reception. Several times the former Utah governor attempted to charm over an unnatural constituency with humor. But he barely earned a golf clap, and by the conclusion, the look of bewilderment on his face marked a man who looked like he’d seen a ghost.      The intensity even sparked a darker moment — custom-made for Democrats to use down the road— when audience members shouted “Yeah!” in response to a question from Blitzer about whether a 30-year-old man without health insurance should be left to die. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The 2012 Republican presidential race held its fourth debate, garnering significant attention and discussion. Among the winners of the debate were Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, and Michele Bachmann.

Gingrich delivered crowd-pleasing one-liners and showcased his populist appeal, while Bachmann managed to stay relevant despite limited speaking time.  On the other hand, Rick Perry failed to impress and looked flustered when challenged on the HPV vaccine by Bachmann and former senator Rick Santorum. Jon Huntsman struggled with humor and snark, often disappearing from the debate and delivering a weak performance. Ron Paul was criticized for his views on the post-September 11 landscape and failed to win the support of Tea Party debate fans.

To get to the tennis court, Conner Stroud has to push his wheelchair there.  The 15-yea-old from North Carolina, US was born without legs. But when he picks up his racquet and begins to hit a ball, you quickly see that the young man just want to win.  Stroud began playing tennis at age 5 at the small tennis club his parents own. For years, he played against able-bodied players by putting rubber on the stumps of his legs. Though he was a foot (30.48cm) or two shorter than many of the players he played against, he won a number of matches. He became well-known enough that he got to meet Rafael Nadal, his favorite player at the US Open in 2013.  \\"The most important thing is that he's happy,\\" Nadal told reports about Stroud after that 15-minute meeting. \\"He's playing tennis... That's a great example of being happy even if life doesn't give you everything.\\"  Stroud started playing wheelchair tennis at 13 and now he is No 1 in the US.  Earlier this summer, he played for the US in the world's biggest junior wheelchair team tennis event --- the World Team Cup. He played six matches and won five of them as the US won the cup for the first time since 2000.  \\"He is a polite boy , but he will rip your heart out trying to beat you,\\" Jason Harnett, a United States Tennis Association coach, said of Stroud. \\"You see that attitude in a lot of the best players, whether they are able-bodied or disabled.  Teenage players can often get disappointed and angry. Racquets sometimes get thrown. Players shout at themselves after missed shots. Stroud never does that.  \\" I just try to stay positive,\\" Stroud said. \\"After every point, I try to say I'm going to win the next point, or the next game, or the next game, or the whole match.  \\" There's always room to be positive .

Pick from:  a). Yes;  b). It's impossible to say;  c). No; Hypothesis: Lebanon is feeling joyous.","output":"c). No;  The hypothesis that \\"Lebanon is feeling joyous\\" is not true based on the paragraph provided. The paragraph explains that Lebanon is in a period of mourning following a devastating event; this strongly suggests a state of sadness and loss rather than joy. A massive car bomb resulted in the death of the former Prime Minister, Rafik Hariri, which is a tragic event likely leading to grief and sorrow across the nation.  The atmosphere during periods of mourning typically involves feelings of sorrow, loss, grief, anguish, and, at times, anger or confusion. It is a time when people collectively express their sadness and pay their respects to someone who has died. In this case, the person who has died is a former Prime Minister, a figure of national importance, implying that the mourning would be widespread across the country.  Therefore, it is very unlikely that the mood in Lebanon would be characterized as joyous following such a tragic event, refuting the hypothesis. Mourning and joy are significantly contrasting emotional states, and it seems improbable that these sentiments would be experienced simultaneously in this context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - Chemotherapy (often abbreviated to chemo and sometimes CTX or CTx) is a category of cancer treatment that uses one or more anti-cancer drugs (chemotherapeutic agents) as part of a standardized chemotherapy regimen. Chemotherapy may be given with a curative intent (which almost always involves combinations of drugs), or it may aim to prolong life or to reduce symptoms (palliative chemotherapy). Chemotherapy is one of the major categories of medical oncology (the medical discipline specifically devoted to pharmacotherapy for cancer).  - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.  - Menopause, also known as the climacteric, is the time in most women's lives when menstrual periods stop permanently, and they are no longer able to bear children. Menopause typically occurs between 49 and 52 years of age. Medical professionals often define menopause as having occurred when a woman has not had any vaginal bleeding for a year. It may also be defined by a decrease in hormone production by the ovaries. In those who have had surgery to remove their uterus but they still have ovaries, menopause may be viewed to have occurred at the time of the surgery or when their hormone levels fell. Following the removal of the uterus, symptoms typically occur earlier, at an average of 45 years of age. Before menopause, a woman's periods typically become irregular, which means that periods may be longer or shorter in duration or be lighter or heavier in the amount of flow. During this time, women often experience hot flashes; these typically last from 30 seconds to ten minutes and may be associated with shivering, sweating, and reddening of the skin. Hot flashes often stop occurring after a year or two. Other symptoms may include vaginal dryness, trouble sleeping, and mood changes. The severity of symptoms varies between women. While menopause is often thought to be linked to an increase in heart disease, this primarily occurs due to increasing age and does not have a direct relationship with menopause. In some women, problems that were present like endometriosis or painful periods will improve after menopause. Menopause is usually a natural change. It can occur earlier in those who smoke tobacco. Other causes include surgery that removes both ovaries or some types of chemotherapy. At the physiological level, menopause happens because of a decrease in the ovaries' production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. While typically not needed, a diagnosis of menopause can be confirmed by measuring hormone levels in the blood or urine. Menopause is the opposite of menarche, the time when a girl's periods...  - Radiation therapy or radiotherapy, often abbreviated RT, RTx, or XRT, is therapy using ionizing radiation, generally as part of cancer treatment to control or kill malignant cells and normally delivered by a linear accelerator. Radiation therapy may be curative in a number of types of cancer if they are localized to one area of the body. It may also be used as part of adjuvant therapy, to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor (for example, early stages of breast cancer). Radiation therapy is synergistic with chemotherapy, and has been used before, during, and after chemotherapy in susceptible cancers. The subspecialty of oncology concerned with radiotherapy is called radiation oncology.  - Lobular carcinoma is a form of tumor which primarily affects the lobules of a gland.  - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.  - Bone pain (also known medically by several other names) is pain coming from a bone. It occurs as a result of a wide range of diseases and/or physical conditions and may severely impair the quality of life for patients who suffer from it. Bone pain belongs to the class of deep somatic pain, often experienced as a dull pain that cannot be localized accurately by the patient. This is in contrast with the pain which is mediated by superficial receptors in, e.g., the skin. Bone pain can have several possible causes ranging from extensive physical stress to serious diseases such as cancer. For many years it has been known that bones are innervated with sensory neurons. Yet their exact anatomy remained obscure due to the contrasting physical properties of bone and neural tissue. More recently, it is becoming clear what types of nerves innervated which sections of bone. The periosteal layer of bone tissue is highly pain-sensitive and an important cause of pain in several disease conditions causing bone pain, like fractures, osteoarthritis, etc. However, in certain diseases the endosteal and haversian nerve supply seems to play an important role, e.g. in osteomalacia, osteonecrosis, and other bone diseases. Thus there are several types of bone pain, each with many potential sources or origins of cause.  - The breast is one of two prominences located on the upper ventral region of the torso of female primates. In females, it serves as the mammary gland, which produces and secretes milk and feeds infants. Both females and males develop breasts from the same embryological tissues. At puberty, estrogens, in conjunction with growth hormone, cause breast development. Males do not develop pronounced or physiologically matured breasts because their bodies produce lower levels of estrogens and higher levels of androgens, namely testosterone, which suppress the effects of estrogens in developing breast tissue. The breasts of females are typically far more prominent than those of males.  - Raloxifene (marketed as Evista by Eli Lilly and Company) is an oral selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that has estrogenic actions on bone and anti-estrogenic actions on the uterus and breast. It is used in the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and in postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer.  - Canadian football is a form of gridiron football played in Canada in which two teams of 12 players each compete for territorial control of a field of play long and wide attempting to advance a pointed prolate spheroid ball into the opposing team's scoring area (end zone).  - The Atlanta Falcons are a professional American football team based in Atlanta, Georgia. The Falcons compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) South division. The Falcons joined the NFL in 1965 as an expansion team, after the NFL offered then-owner Rankin Smith a franchise to keep him from joining the rival American Football League (AFL). The AFL instead granted a franchise to Miami (the Miami Dolphins). The Falcons are tied with the Dolphins (who also began play in 1966) for being the second-oldest NFL franchise in the Deep South, and are the second-oldest NFC team in that region, after the Dallas Cowboys.  - A quarterback (commonly abbreviated to QB) is a position in American and Canadian football. Quarterbacks are members of the offensive team and line up directly behind the offensive line. In modern American football, the quarterback is usually considered the leader of the offensive team, and is often responsible for calling the play in the huddle.  - Breast-conserving surgery (BCS, also known as breast conservation surgery and segmental mastectomy) is a less radical cancer surgery than mastectomy. Breast-conserving surgery, as in a lumpectomy removes part of the breast tissue during surgery, as opposed to the entire breast.  - In physics, radiation is the emission or transmission of energy in the form of waves or particles through space or through a material medium. This includes:  - A hormone (from the Greek participle ) is any member of a class of signaling molecules produced by glands in multicellular organisms that are transported by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behaviour. Hormones have diverse chemical structures, mainly of 3 classes: eicosanoids, steroids, and amino acid derivatives (amines, peptides, and proteins). The glands that secrete hormones comprise the endocrine signaling system. The term hormone is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell (autocrine or intracrine signalling) or nearby cells (paracrine signalling).  - Shortness of breath, also known as dyspnea, is a feeling like one cannot breathe well enough. The American Thoracic Society defines it as \\"a subjective experience of breathing discomfort that consists of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity\\", and recommends evaluating dyspnea by assessing the intensity of the distinct sensations, the degree of distress involved, and its burden or impact on activities of daily living. Distinct sensations include effort/work, chest tightness, and air hunger (the feeling of not enough oxygen).  - The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC). The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, and the highest professional level of American football in the world. The NFL's 17-week regular season runs from the week after Labor Day to the week after Christmas, with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week. Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, played between the champions of the NFC and AFC.  - Deanna Tynes Favre ( born December 28 , 1968 in Kiln , Mississippi ) is an American activist and the wife of NFL quarterback Brett Favre . She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004 , and later became an activist in the fight against the disease . She founded the Deanna Favre Hope Foundation to raise money and awareness for women around the country .  - A biopsy is a medical test commonly performed by a surgeon, interventional radiologist, or an interventional cardiologist involving extraction of sample cells or tissues for examination to determine the presence or extent of a disease. The tissue is generally examined under a microscope by a pathologist, and can also be analyzed chemically. When an entire lump or suspicious area is removed, the procedure is called an excisional biopsy. When only a sample of tissue is removed with preservation of the histological architecture of the tissues cells, the procedure is called an incisional biopsy or core biopsy. When a sample of tissue or fluid is removed with a needle in such a way that cells are removed without preserving the histological architecture of the tissue cells, the procedure is called a needle aspiration biopsy. Biopsies are most commonly performed for insight into possible cancerous and inflammatory conditions.  - Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is any form of hormone therapy wherein the patient, in the course of medical treatment, receives hormones, either to supplement a lack of naturally occurring hormones or to substitute other hormones for naturally occurring hormones. Common forms of hormone replacement therapy include:  - Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, or a red scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin. Risk factors for developing breast cancer include being female, obesity, lack of physical exercise, drinking alcohol, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, early age at first menstruation, having children late or not at all, older age, and family history. About 510% of cases are due to genes inherited from a person's parents, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 among others. Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that supply the ducts with milk. Cancers developing from the ducts are known as ductal carcinomas, while those developing from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas. In addition, there are more than 18 other sub-types of breast cancer. Some cancers, such as ductal carcinoma in situ, develop from pre-invasive lesions. The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a biopsy of the concerning lump. Once the diagnosis is made, further tests are done to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments it may respond to. The balance of benefits versus harms of breast cancer screening is controversial. A 2013 Cochrane review stated that it is unclear if mammographic screening does more good or harm. A 2009 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force found evidence of benefit in those 40 to 70 years of age, and the organization recommends screening every two years in women 50 to 74 years old. The medications tamoxifen or raloxifene may be used in an effort to prevent breast cancer in those who are at high risk of developing it. Surgical removal of both breasts is another preventative measure in some high risk women. In those who have been diagnosed with...  - A lymph node or lymph gland, is an ovoid or kidney-shaped organ of the lymphatic system, and of the adaptive immune system, that is widely present throughout the body. They are linked by the lymphatic vessels as a part of the circulatory system. Lymph nodes are major sites of B and T lymphocytes, and other white blood cells. Lymph nodes are important for the proper functioning of the immune system, acting as filters for foreign particles and cancer cells. Lymph nodes do not have a detoxification function, which is primarily dealt with by the liver and kidneys.  - A census-designated place (CDP) is a concentration of population defined by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes only. CDPs have been used in each decennial census since 1980 as the counterparts of incorporated places, such as cities, towns, and villages for the purposes of gathering and correlating statistical data. CDPs are populated areas that generally include one officially designated but currently unincorporated small community, for which the CDP is named, plus surrounding inhabited countryside of varying dimensions and, occasionally, other, smaller unincorporated communities as well. CDPs include small rural communities, colonias located along the U.S. border with Mexico, and unincorporated resort and retirement communities and their environs.  - Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), also known as intraductal carcinoma, is a pre-cancerous or non-invasive cancerous lesion of the breast. DCIS is classified as Stage 0. It rarely produces symptoms or a breast lump one can feel, and is usually detected through screening mammography. In DCIS, abnormal cells are found in the lining of one or more milk ducts in the breast. \\"In situ\\" means \\"in place\\" and refers to the fact that the abnormal cells have not moved out of the mammary duct and into any of the surrounding tissues in the breast (\\"pre-cancerous\\" refers to the fact that it has not yet become an invasive cancer). In some cases, DCIS may become invasive and spread to other tissues, but there is no way of determining which lesions will remain stable without treatment, and which will go on to become invasive. DCIS encompasses a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from low-grade lesions that are not life-threatening to high-grade (i.e. potentially highly aggressive) lesions. DCIS has been classified according to the architectural pattern of the cells (solid, cribriform, papillary, and micropapillary), tumor grade (high, intermediate, and low grade), and the presence or absence of comedo histology. DCIS can be detected on mammograms by examining tiny specks of calcium known as microcalcifications. Since suspicious groups of microcalcifications can appear even in the absence of DCIS, a biopsy may be necessary for diagnosis. About 2030% of those who do not receive treatment develop breast cancer. It is the most common type of pre-cancer in women. There is some disagreement as to whether, for statistical purposes, it should be counted as a cancer: some include DCIS when calculating breast cancer statistics while others do not.  - In sport, a huddle is an action of a team gathering together, usually in a tight circle, to strategize, motivate or celebrate. It is a popular strategy for keeping opponents insulated from sensitive information, and acts as a form of insulation when the level of noise in the venue is such that normal on-field communication is difficult. Commonly the leader of the huddle is the team captain and it is the captain who will try to inspire his fellow team members to achieve success. Similarly after an event a huddle may take place to congratulate one another for the teams success, or to commiserate a defeat. The term \\"huddle\\" can be used as a verb as in \\"huddling up\\".  - The Green Bay Packers are a professional American football team based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The Packers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) North division. They are also the third-oldest franchise in the NFL, organized and starting play in 1919. It is the only non-profit, community-owned major league professional sports team based in the United States. Home games are played at Lambeau Field.  - Surgery (from the \\"cheirourgik\\" (composed of , \\"hand\\", and , \\"work\\"), via , meaning \\"hand work\\") is an ancient medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate and/or treat a pathological condition such as disease or injury, to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas (for example, a perforated ear drum).  - Targeted therapy or molecularly targeted therapy is one of the major modalities of medical treatment (pharmacotherapy) for cancer, others being hormonal therapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy. As a form of molecular medicine, targeted therapy blocks the growth of cancer cells by interfering with specific targeted molecules needed for carcinogenesis and tumor growth, rather than by simply interfering with all rapidly dividing cells (e.g. with traditional chemotherapy). Because most agents for targeted therapy are biopharmaceuticals, the term \\"biologic therapy\\" is sometimes synonymous with \\"targeted therapy\\" when used in the context of cancer therapy (and thus distinguished from chemotherapy, that is, cytotoxic therapy). However, the modalities can be combined; antibody-drug conjugates combine biologic and cytotoxic mechanisms into one targeted therapy.  - Breast reconstruction is the rebuilding of a breast, usually in women. It involves using autologous tissue or prosthetic material to construct a natural-looking breast. Often this includes the reformation of a natural-looking areola and nipple. This procedure involves the use of implants or relocated flaps of the patient's own tissue.  - Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health. People are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height, is over , with the range defined as overweight. Some East Asian countries use lower values. Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases, particularly heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, and osteoarthritis. Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental illness. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not generally supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their thin counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass. Obesity is mostly preventable through a combination of social changes and personal choices. Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat and sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Medications may be taken, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or bowel length, leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food. Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing rates in adults and children. In 2014, 600 million adults (13%) and 42 million children under the age of five were obese.

Ionizing radiation is made up of energetic subatomic particles, ions or atoms moving at high speeds (usually greater than 1% of the speed of light), and electromagnetic waves on the high-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum.  - Brett Lorenzo Favre (born October 10, 1969) is a former American football quarterback who spent the majority of his career with the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL). He was a 20-year veteran of the NFL, having played quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons (1991), Green Bay Packers (19922007), New York Jets (2008), and Minnesota Vikings (20092010). Favre was the first quarterback in NFL history to pass for 500 touchdowns, throw for over 70,000 yards, over 6,000 completions, and over 10,000 pass attempts.  - American football, referred to as football in the United States and Canada, and also known as gridiron, is a sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The offense, the team with control of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball, while the team without control of the ball, the defense, aims to stop their advance and take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs, or plays, or else they turn over the football to the opposing team; if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins.  - The New York Jets are a professional American football team located in the New York metropolitan area. The Jets compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The team is headquartered in Florham Park, New Jersey. In a unique arrangement for the league, the Jets share MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey with the New York Giants. The franchise is legally and corporately registered as New York Jets, LLC.  - Breast cancer screening is the medical screening of asymptomatic, apparently healthy women for breast cancer in an attempt to achieve an earlier diagnosis. The assumption is that early detection will improve outcomes. A number of screening tests have been employed, including clinical and self breast exams, mammography, genetic screening, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging.  - The Minnesota Vikings are an American football team based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Vikings joined the National Football League (NFL) as an expansion team in 1960, and first took the field for the 1961 season. The team competes in the National Football Conference (NFC) North division; before that, the Vikings were in the NFC Central, and before that they were in the NFL's Western Conference Central Division. The team has played in four Super Bowl games, but lost each one. The team plays its home games at U.S. Bank Stadium in the Downtown East section of Minneapolis.  - Mastectomy (from Greek \\"breast\\" and \\"ektomia\\" \\"cutting out\\") is the medical term for the surgical removal of one or both breasts, partially or completely.  - Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Not all tumors are cancerous; benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body. Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss and a change in bowel movements. While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they may have other causes. Over 100 types of cancers affect humans. Tobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths. Another 10% is due to obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity and drinking alcohol. Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants. In the developing world nearly 20% of cancers are due to infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human papillomavirus (HPV). These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell. Typically many genetic changes are required before cancer develops. Approximately 510% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person's parents. Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests. It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy. Many cancers can be prevented by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, not drinking too much alcohol, eating plenty of vegetables, fruits and whole grains, vaccination against certain infectious diseases, not eating too much processed and red meat, and avoiding too much sunlight exposure. Early detection through screening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer. The benefits of screening in breast cancer are controversial. Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Pain and symptom management are an important part of care. Palliative care is particularly important in people with advanced disease. The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment.

Photographer: Richard Vines/Bloomberg      Bubbledogs owners Sandia Chang and James Knappett met while working at Per Se a decade ago, when he was a chef and she waited tables. They worked for Keller again when he opened the pop-up French Laundry at Harrods in London in 2011. The husband-and-wife team regularly invites chefs to create hot dogs for Bubbledogs.      \\"We went Americana for this dog,\\" Keller said. It combines an American hot dog and a New England lobster roll.      \\"We start with a traditional buttered brioche, like you’d find in a New England lobster roll. We layer the bun with house-made dill pickles, and then, for the 'relish,' we top the dog with chilled lobster salad and garnish it all with micro celery leaves.      \\"I am a fan of both hot dogs and lobster rolls - childhood favorites, staples of sun-splashed picnics and afternoons spent at the ballpark.\\"      This isn't Keller's first dog. He has also developed the Yountwurst, which takes its name from the town of Yountville, home of the French Laundry as well as his Bouchon bakery and Ad Hoc casual restaurant.      Chang said Keller has always been supportive, showing up within two weeks of Bubbledogs and its sister restaurant Kitchen Table opening in 2012. Other fans include Shake Shack founder Danny Meyer, who visits when in London.      \\"I always do my best to support our alumni when they light out on their own,\\" Keller said.

More accurately, she had hurled it to the floor in a fit of disillusionment, her small protest against the slow creep of mediocrity and missed cues during a four-hour dinner at Per Se that would cost the four of us close to 3,000. Some time later, a passing server picked up the napkin without pausing to see whose lap it was missing from, neatly embodying the oblivious sleepwalking that had pushed my guest to this point.      Such is Per Se’s mystique that I briefly wondered if the failure to bring her a new napkin could have been intentional. The restaurant’s identity, to the extent that it has one distinct from that of its owner and chef, Thomas Keller, is based on fastidiously minding the tiniest details. This is the place, after all, that brought in a ballet dancer to help servers slip around the tables with poise. So I had to consider the chance that the server was just making a thoughtful accommodation to a diner with a napkin allergy.      But in three meals this fall and winter, enough other things have gone awry in the kitchen and dining room to make that theory seem unlikely. Enough, also, to make the perception of Per Se as one of the country’s great restaurants, which I shared after visits in the past, appear out of date. Enough to suggest that the four-star rating it received from Sam Sifton in 2011, its most recent review in The New York Times, needs a hard look.      With each fresh review, a restaurant has to earn its stars again. In its current form and at its current price, Per Se struggled and failed to do this, ranging from respectably dull at best to disappointingly flat-footed at worst. ||||| Chef Thomas Keller’s woes don’t seem to be abating. After a scathing New York Times review for his New York City restaurant Per Se in January (and a similar review from Eater), Keller, as well as The French Laundry in Napa Valley, and the Thomas Keller Restaurant Group are all being sued for pregnancy discrimination.      Filed last month in Napa Superior Court, the Napa Valley Register reports that the lawsuit alleges that Vanessa Scott-Allen was prevented from working at The French Laundry because of her pregnancy. According to the Napa Valley Register, the complaint alleges that the restaurant group had approved a transfer of her job from Per Se to The French Laundry, but when TFL found out about her pregnancy, they terminated the offer — after she had left her five-year-old serving position at Per Se and moved her family out to California.      According to the Napa Valley Register, Scott-Allen claims that after a visit to TFL in January when general manager Michael Minnillo (also named in the suit) told her that the restaurant “would love” to have her work there, she approached her Per Se manager Antonio Begonja about wanting to transfer, and notified him of her pregnancy. Reportedly, the managers worked out the transfer, and Scott-Allen said she was set to work at TFL starting on April 1, before which time she terminated her lease in New York, bought a car, and found a place to live in California.      Scott-Allen’s start date was allegedly pushed back to April 4, when she claims that TFL manager Olivia Wallace asked her several questions about her pregnancy and plans for maternity leave, such as her due date, how long she would work until giving birth, and how long she planned for maternity leave. After that encounter, Scott-Allen was told the position was no longer available, nor was any other position (despite there being three positions open), according to the Napa Valley Register’s account of the lawsuit.      The Napa Valley Register reports that on April 21, Scott-Allen filed a complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing and received a notice of case closure and right to sue, after which she filed the lawsuit in Napa Superior Court on September 26. The article states that she is seeking 5 million in damages for fraud and deceit, sex discrimination, violation of pregnancy disability leave law, negligent misrepresentation, breach of implied contract, wrongful termination, failure to prevent discrimination, and violations of labor codes and the California Family Rights Act. A case management conference is scheduled for March 7, 2017. Scott-Allen is reportedly demanding a jury trial.      Eater SF has reached out to both The Thomas Keller Restaurant Group and Scott-Allen’s attorney for comment, with no immediate response.

He went to the local consumer electronics store to find himself a good camera. Two cameras caught his eye, camera A and camera B. Camera A had a very small pinhole, but camera B had larger aperture. David needs to decide which camera should he buy.  Hint: In practice, the diameter of the aperture is chosen based on the focal length of the lens, the diameter and quality of the input beam, and its wavelength (longer wavelengths require larger apertures). If the hole is too small, the beam quality is greatly improved but the power is greatly reduced. If the hole is too large, the beam quality may not be improved as much as desired.  The size of aperture that can be used also depends on the size and quality of the optics. To use a very small pinhole, one must use a focusing lens with a low f-number, and ideally the lens should not add significant aberrations to the beam. The design of such a lens becomes increasingly more difficult as the f-number decreases.

For the second time in three weeks, the Patriots went on the road to square off against an undefeated team; the 10-0 Saints entered the game with the most points scored in the league. After the Patriots deferred the opening coin toss, the Saints returned the opening kickoff to their own 35-yard line before a 33-yard pass from Drew Brees to wide receiver Devery Henderson on the game's first play put the Saints quickly in Patriots territory. However, the Patriots defense stopped the Saints on a 3rd-and-4 from the 15-yard line, setting up a 30-yard John Carney field goal. The Patriots responded by holding the ball for nearly eight minutes, advancing 80 yards on a 14-play drive that ended in a 4-yard touchdown run by Maroney on 4th-and-1, the second such conversion of the drive. The score put the Patriots ahead 7-3. The Saints did not reach midfield on their next drive and punted; however, the Patriots turned the ball back over when on the ensuing play Brady was intercepted by cornerback Mike McKenzie, who returned it eight yards to the Saints' 41-yard line. Seven plays later, early in the second quarter, the Saints took a 10-7 lead when a Brees dump-off pass to running back Pierre Thomas resulted in an 18-yard touchdown. The Patriots could not reach midfield on their next possession and punted. On the ensuing play, Brees connected with Henderson on a 75-yard touchdown pass that extended the Saints' lead to 17-7. The Patriots faced a 3rd-and-12 early on their next drive, but Brady threw a 33-yard pass to Aiken to move the Patriots into Saints territory. The drive stalled at the Saints' 18-yard line, forcing a 36-yard Gostkowski field goal to cut the Saints' lead to 17-10. Four plays later, Brees hit former Patriots tight end David Thomas on a 25-yard pass before wide receiver Robert Meachem caught a 38-yard touchdown pass to give the Saints a 24-10 lead with just under two minutes left in the half. The Patriots' offense was able to reach the Saints' 32-yard line on first down with 35 seconds left, but advanced no further, setting up a 50-yard Gostkowski field goal attempt on fourth down that fell wide left. With possession to begin the second half, the Patriots lost it when a 6-yard pass to Maroney, the first play of the half, resulted in a fumble by Maroney at the Patriots' 26-yard line. Saints defensive tackle Sedrick Ellis recovered the fumble and returned it seven yards before he too fumbled; Welker recovered the ball for the Patriots at that spot. Later in the drive, on 3rd-and-9 from their own 42-yard line, Brady hit Aiken on an 11-yard pass to convert; on the play, Brady passed Drew Bledsoe as the Patriots' all-time passing leader. Two plays later, Brady connected with Moss on a 47-yard pass down to the Saints' 2-yard line, setting up a 2-yard Maroney touchdown run that cut the Saints' lead to 24-17. However, the Saints responded on their next play with a 68-yard pass from Brees to wide receiver Marques Colston, setting up a 2-yard touchdown catch by tight end Darnell Dinkins two plays later, re-establishing a 14-point Saints lead. The Patriots moved down to the Saints' 10-yard on their next drive, but attempted to convert on 4th-and-4 from that spot instead of kicking a field goal; Brady's pass attempt to Moss fell incomplete. The Saints' next drive spanned into the fourth quarter but ended on a punt from the Saints' own 35-yard line. The Patriots fared no better, going three-and-out on their ensuing possession. The Saints continued to build a lead when Brees ended a 9-play, 75-yard drive with a 20-yard touchdown pass to Colston. Down 38-17 with under eight minutes to go, the Patriots tried to mount a drive but two plays in, Brady was intercepted by safety Darren Sharper on a deep pass; Sharper returned it 38 yards to the Patriots' 25-yard line. However, the Saints could not convert a first down and Carney missed a 37-yard field goal wide right. With 5:26 remaining in the game and down 21 points, the Patriots replaced Brady with his backup, Hoyer, on their next possession; the Patriots went three-and-out. After a Saints punt, the Patriots held the ball for the final 1:52 of the game, ending it on an 8-yard sack of Hoyer. With the loss, the Patriots dropped to 7-4 on the season, and 1-4 in road games.

'Humans of New York' creator writes touching tribute to his dog \\"Humans of New York\\" creator Brandon Stanton's dog Susie, who inspired hundreds to adopt senior dogs, passed away this week at age 16. In a tribute posted to the HONY Facebook page, Stanton wrote about Susie's powerful influence on his life — starting with her unexpected adoption. \\"I was photographing in Brooklyn one evening when I saw the coolest little dog sitting on a stoop,\\" Stanton wrote. \\"I sat down to pet her, and after a few minutes, her owner told me that he was unable to care for her anymore. He asked if I could take her.\\" Despite having little money at the time, Stanton took 12-year-old Susie in. \\"It was one of the best decisions I ever made,\\" he wrote. Susie proved to be a loyal companion not only for Stanton, but also for his fiancée Erin O'Sullivan, founder of senior dog advocacy nonprofit Susie's Senior Dogs. \\"Thank you to everyone who has regularly followed Susie's senior journey and cared so much about her,\\" O'Sullivan wrote in a post of her own. \\"Most important, thank you to everyone who has been inspired by Susie to adopt an old dog of your own.\\" Several Facebook commenters have chimed in with their own senior dog adoption stories — including Jillian Stoddard, who said Susie inspired her to adopt her own dog, Cinder. \\"...she [Cinder] wouldn't be snuggled on my couch right now if it weren't for Susie,\\" she wrote.

Solve this problem.","output":"To solve the equation 57*d - 65*d - 8 = 0 for d, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms.  Both 57*d and -65*d have the same variable part, d. Therefore, we can combine these terms: (57*d - 65*d) - 8 = 0 Step 2: Subtract the coefficients of the like terms. 57 - 65 = -8, so the equation becomes: -8*d - 8 = 0 Step 3: Isolate the variable (in this case, d). We can do this by adding 8 to both sides of the equation: (-8*d - 8) + 8 = 0 + 8 -8*d = 8 Step 4: Solve for d by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of d, which is -8: (-8*d) / -8 = 8 / -8 d = -1 So, the solution for the equation 57*d - 65*d - 8 = 0 is d = -1."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","output":"No."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction. By bringing a charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object can also be charged using a method called charging by induction . This process allows a change in charge without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near the knob, but not touching. If we place a finger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body, instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction. Notice that charging by induction causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object, while charging by conduction gives them both the same charge.  Now, I have a new situation: John wanted to charge his electronic gadgets remotely. To that end, he first conducted two experiments, case A and case B. In case A he used conduction, and in case B he used induction. In both cases he used same two objects. Finally, John tried to  charge his phone remotely. He called this test as case C.  Answer this question please: Would the objects be closer to or farther from each other in case A than in case B? Answer:","output":"The objects would be closer to each other in case A than in case B. In case A (charging by conduction), the objects need to physically touch each other for the charge transfer to occur. In case B (charging by induction), the objects do not touch each other and charging occurs by influencing the charge distribution on the uncharged object by bringing the charged object close to it."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Verstappen is just 16-years-old and has just earned his superlicence. Superlicence necessary for drivers to compete in Formula One.","output":"Title: The Prodigy on Track: Young Phenom Max Verstappen to Drive for Toro Rosso  In a shifting tide of expectations and emerging talents, Red Bull junior team, Toro Rosso, makes a truly groundbreaking announcement for the upcoming season. The Formula One circuit will be graced by the prodigious talent of Max Verstappen, making him the youngest professional driver in the history of the elite competition. Born on September 30, 1997, Verstappen is barely 16-years-old, making his selection by Toro Rosso a testament to an unprecedented level of confidence in the young driver’s skills and potential. Given the challenges and demands of Formula One racing, this decision speaks volumes about Verstappen's extraordinary abilities and commitment to the sport. Verstappen has already orchestrated a resounding performance in a stunningly small amount of time, having just earned his superlicence, a prerequisite for those desiring to compete in the gruelling and prestigious Formula One Championships. The superlicence, administered by the International Automobile Federation (FIA), serves as the highest racing license issued by the body. That Verstappen has managed to secure it at such a tender age showcases his burgeoning talent, a talent poised to reshape limits and redefine norms in the world of Formula One racing.  Being awarded a superlicence necessarily implies the driver's capability and readiness to compete at the Formula One level. The procedure to earn this benchmark includes various stringent parameters like driving a current car consistently at racing speeds, demonstrating understanding of racing theory, and showcasing practical knowledge like signalling an intent to overtake, among others. The FIA doesn’t award this badge of honor lightly; it is a bragging right reserved only for those who exhibit exceptional skills, technical know-how, sportsman spirit, and relentless commitment. Piloting a Formula One car requires not only an ability to drive fast but also a deep technical understanding of the car, strategic application of speed and endurance, and an ability to respond swiftly and calmly under high-pressure situations. This all-encompassing readiness is what Verstappen has demonstrated, outpacing his peers to secure a spot at the starting line of the world’s highest-level of open-wheel car racing. Verstappen's success marks a landmark moment for Toro Rosso and Red Bull's driver programme, which aims at nurturing young talents and preparing them for the top tier of motorsports. His signing represents a triumph for talent scouting and youth development in motorsports, reinforcing the notion that age is merely a number when it comes to talent, hard work, and achieving victory at the pinnacle of sport. Expectations are high for Verstappen, but this is territory he is familiar with. Now, armed with his FIA superlicence, the trust and backing of Toro Rosso, and an innate ability to deliver on track, this Dutch teenager is set to make his mark on Formula One. As the motorsport world prepares for the roar of the engines in the upcoming season, all eyes will be on Verstappen, the 16-year-old prodigy, redefining what's possible on the F1 circuits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Liberia: In 1822, the American Colonization Society began sending African-American volunteers to the Pepper Coast to establish a colony for freed African Americans. By 1867, the ACS (and state-related chapters) had assisted in the migration of more than 13,000 African Americans to Liberia. These free African Americans and their descendants married within their community and came to identify as Americo-Liberians. Many were of mixed race and educated in American culture; they did not identify with the indigenous natives of the tribes they encountered. They intermarried largely within the colonial community, developing an ethnic group that had a cultural tradition infused with American notions of political republicanism and Protestant Christianity.

Write a question about the following article: Reagan significantly increased public expenditures, primarily the Department of Defense, which rose (in constant 2000 dollars) from 267.1 billion in 1980 (4.9% of GDP and 22.7% of public expenditure) to 393.1 billion in 1988 (5.8% of GDP and 27.3% of public expenditure); most of those years military spending was about 6% of GDP, exceeding this number in 4 different years. All these numbers had not been seen since the end of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War in 1973. In 1981, Reagan significantly reduced the maximum tax rate, which affected the highest income earners, and lowered the top marginal tax rate from 70% to 50%; in 1986 he further reduced the rate to 28%. The federal deficit under Reagan peaked at 6% of GDP in 1983, falling to 3.2% of GDP in 1987 and to 3.1% of GDP in his final budget. The inflation-adjusted rate of growth in federal spending fell from 4% under Jimmy Carter to 2.5% under Ronald Reagan. This was the slowest rate of growth in inflation adjusted spending since Eisenhower. However, federal deficit as percent of GDP was up throughout the Reagan presidency from 2.7% at the end of (and throughout) the Carter administration. As a short-run strategy to reduce inflation and lower nominal interest rates, the U.S. borrowed both domestically and abroad to cover the Federal budget deficits, raising the national debt from 997 billion to 2.85 trillion. This led to the U.S. moving from the worlds largest international creditor to the worlds largest debtor nation.

Most books written for a pre-k listening level take place in a realistic setting, like school. Not so with the magic tree house, it takes Jack and Anne throughout time and space: from the time of the dinosaurs to the future when men have colonized the moon. The books are exciting to read: Jack and Anne are often in real danger, though you know they will always make it back home. These books are also available in an audio format. I recommend reading at least the first four books. If you, the adult reader, gets bored, try playing the audio versions.I also think this box set makes a great birthday present for 4 and 5 year olds. At first the child can be read aloud to, and when they start reading, they can use it as an early reader.The audio version of these books (read aloud by the author) is also worthwhile.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Thursday pushed back against a North Korean state media report that U.S. President Donald Trump agreed during this week’s Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un to gradually lift sanctions against Pyongyang, saying Trump had been very clear about the sequence of steps in the process. The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Trump offered to lift sanctions against it as relations improve, indicating a phased-in approach where concessions would be provided at various stages of the denuclearization process. Speaking at a news conference in Seoul alongside South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa and Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, the U.S. secretary of state said the Trump administration would not repeat the mistakes made by past presidents that rewarded Pyongyang for denuclearization promises. “When we refer to the mistakes of the past. They were providing economic and financial aid relief before the complete denuclearization had taken place. That is not going to happen. President Trump made that clear,” Pompeo said. President Trump described his meeting with Kim as a resounding success and in a tweet said, “There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.” But the U.S.-North Korea joint declaration was vague on details, providing no clear definition on what constitutes denuclearization, set no timeline for the dismantlement process, and said nothing about outside verification requirements. Pompeo, however, pointed out that in the Singapore statement both countries reaffirmed the inter-Korean Panmunjom declaration from April, in which both South and North Korea agreed to uphold all past agreements that did specify detailed nuclear prohibitions and verification requirements. The secretary of state and his counterparts in Seoul and Tokyo said they are united in support of the U.S.-North Korea agreement, and in agreement on the goal of complete, irreversible, verifiable dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program.

Nigeria, who failed to qualify for the last two editions of the tournament, fell to their first competitive defeat to South Africa, losing 2-0 in Uyo in the Group E match. Second-half goals from Tokelo Rantie and Percy Tau sealed a deserved win for Bafana Bafana against three-time African champions Nigeria. Rantie opened the scoring with a brilliant close-range header in the 54th minute. Tau broke free in a swift counter-attack, putting the ball around goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi before slotting home in the 81st minute. Nigeria fluffed chances in the first half as Wilfred Ndidi, Oghenekaro Etebo and Simon Moses failed to score. It was second time lucky for coach Stuart Baxter who was in charge when Bafana beat Nigeria 2-1 in the 2004 Nelson Mandela challenge at home. The twelve group winners plus the best three group runners-up will qualify for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations along with the hosts Cameroon. Seydou Doumbia's brace was not enough for Ivory Coast as the Elephants were beaten 3-2 at home by Guinea in Group H. Doumbia gave the home side a 15th minute lead, before Guinea equalised in the 32nd minute. Naby Keita's shot was spilled by goalkeeper Sylvain Gbohouo and Abdoulaye Sadio Diallo pounced on the rebound to put the visitors level. Doumbia grabbed his second goal in the 62nd minute, but four minutes later France-based Francois Kamano made it 2-2. However, the impressive Naby Keita sealed the stunning win for Guinea in the 79th minute to complete a bad start for new Ivory Coast manager Marc Wilmots. The defeat for Ivory Coast in Bouake came just five days after the death of former Ivorian international Cheick Tiote. In Ndola, former winners Zambia were left stunned by a late goal as they lost 1-0 to Mozambique at home in Group K. Mozambique left it until the 89th minute to earn their first ever win over Chipolopolo with Germany-based Stanley Ratifo scoring the goal. 2012 African champions Zambia dominated the encounter for long spells but failed to turn their superiority into goals. The Mambas made them pay for their profligacy when Ratifo finished brilliantly from a cut-back to stun the home side. Elias Pelembe should have doubled the lead in added time but goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene rushed out of his box to stop the Bidvest Wits winger. Coach Abel Xavier and the Mambas held on to celebrate a first triumph over Zambia in 18 attempts. In the other Group K game, Guinea-Bissau beat visitors Namibia 1-0 thanks to a powerful header from Jerson in the 24th minute. Veteran striker Aristide Bance scored twice as Burkina Faso beat Angola 3-1 in Group I. Bance's opening goal in the 22nd minute was quickly cancelled out by Gelson Dala a minute later. Bance then restored the lead from the penalty spot just before half-time with Chelsea winger Betrand Traore scoring the third in the 79th minute. Also in Group I, Mohamed Abdellahi Soudani's second-half strike sealed a famous 1-0 win for Mauritania away to Botswana. Senegal hammered Equatorial Guinea 3-0 in Dakar in Group A on Saturday after Moussa Sow scored in both halves and Idrissa Gana Gueye added a late third. Elsewhere on Saturday, Gerald Phiri Junior scored the only goal as Malawi began their Group B campaign with a 1-0 home win over Comoros in Lilongwe. The South Africa-based winger hit a free-kick from outside the 18 yard box which flew over the wall and into the right corner on 31 minutes . The flames had several chances but failed to punish a resolute Comoros. It is a first competitive win for Malawi's coach Ronny Van Geneugden who took over in April. Malawi have taken an early advantage in the group after hosts Cameroon beat Herve Renard's Morocco 1-0 in Yaounde. A 29th minute goal from Vincent Aboubakar gave the Indomitable Lions the victory which puts Morocco bottom of Group B after the opening round of matches. Cameroon qualify automatically as hosts for the 2019 Nations Cup, but their group matches still count as qualifiers for their opponents. After the victory, Cameroon's coach Hugo Broos confirmed that defender Oyongo Bitolo would definitely miss the Fifa Confederations Cup later this month. The player was stretchered off the pitch after suffering a knee ligament injury which Broos said would keep him out of the game for seven months. Mali fought back with second-half goals from Kalifa Coulibaly and Yves Bissouma to beat Gabon 2-1 in Bamako in Group C. Lorient midfielder Denis Bouanga had given the visitors a shock early lead. Burundi stay top of Group C after their impressive 3-0 win over South Sudan. The Swallows secured all three points with first half goals. Cedric Amissi set the tone with the opening goal in the 15th minute. Gael Duhayinnavyi added the second ten minutes later before Fiston Abdul Razak made it three in the 30th minute. In Freetown, goals from Julius Woobay and and Umaru Bangura penalty helped Sierra Leone make a winning start to their Group F campaign as they beat Kenya 2-1.

Review: I bought the packaged deal with the Vacuum hose, Hose Adaptor and the Weighted Butterfly Pool Head. Got the box and NO BUTTERFLY VACUUM HEAD!! Very poor customer service here!!! Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"There is a negative tone to this product review. Firstly, the title \\"BEWARE!!\\" clearly indicates a warning to potential customers and sets a negative tone for the review. This exclamation signals that the customer is likely to have had an unfavorable or dissatisfying experience with the product and/or the company. Furthermore, the content of the review elaborates on the negative experience the customer faced. The customer states that they bought a packaged deal but did not receive one of the items they paid for – the Weighted Butterfly Pool Head. This demonstrates that the customer's expectations were not met, leading to their dissatisfaction with the product and the company. Additionally, the customer highlights the \\"very poor customer service\\" they encountered while dealing with this issue. This negative statement emphasizes their frustration and discontent with not only the product but also the company's response to their problem. Overall, the tone of this product review is decidedly negative, as the customer shares their adverse experience with the product and the company, specifically citing issues with a missing item and poor customer service. The use of capital letters, exclamation points, and negative statements further reinforces the negative tone of the review, which may discourage potential customers from purchasing the product or engaging with the company."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Question: What will telling many people about someone's escapades lead to? Options: - annoyance - notoriety - emotional distress - religion - riot  Explain why a human would choose \\"notoriety\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"notoriety\\" to answer the question above because telling many people about someone's escapades, which are usually daring, exciting, or unusual adventures, can make that person widely known, especially for those escapades. Notoriety refers to the state of being famous or well-known for a negative reason or a particular quality, which in this case would be the person's escapades. The more people who know about these events, the more likely the person's actions and reputation will spread, resulting in notoriety. While the other options may have some relevance in specific situations, they are generally less applicable as general outcomes in comparison to notoriety: - Annoyance: This may be a possible outcome, but it depends on the person hearing about the escapades and their personal opinion. Not everyone will be annoyed by this information, so it's not the most appropriate general outcome. - Emotional distress: It's possible that the subject of the stories may experience emotional distress, but again, it's not a universal consequence and would depend on the specific context and the person involved. - Religion: This is unrelated to the scenario of telling people about someone's escapades and would not be an expected outcome. - Riot: While people might become impassioned or agitated upon hearing about someone's escapades, it would take a much more significant event or issue to provoke an entire riot. Therefore, notoriety is the most fitting answer given the context of the question, as it is the most likely outcome of widely sharing someone's escapades among many people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

All is going as planned until Connie's sister, Kate, her investment broker husband, Roman Craig, and their twin daughters, Mara and Cara, crash the vacation. Ghost stories at the family BBQ include one of a man-eating grizzly bear that Chet met face-to-face when he was younger. Chet says that while he and Connie were honeymooning at the same lake, he was attacked by a giant grizzly bear. When he fired at it with a shotgun, the buckshot shaved the hair off the top of the bear's head and from that day on, it was known as the \\"Bald-Headed Bear\\" of Claire County. After Roman pulls Chet around the lake on an impromptu water ski ride with his rented speedboat, tensions between the families erupt. Chet is ready to pack up and go home, even as his teenage son Buck tries to romance a local girl, Cammie. The budding romance goes well until Chet is challenged to eat the Old 96'er (a 96-ounce steak) at a family dinner which causes Buck to break their date. Buck tries to apologize to Cammie for being late, but Cammie refuses to speak to him. Connie and Kate bond at a local bar when the conversation drifts to Kate's challenges of being wealthy. Later, just at the peak of tension between families, it emerges that Roman has made a bad investment and is broke. He has not told Kate and was planning to hit up Chet for the cash. Later, during a thunderstorm, the twins wander off and fall into a mine shaft. Chet and Roman find them, but the claustrophobic Roman is reluctant to descend into the tiny mine shaft.

It offers an experience of ancient Greek and Roman art in a setting that replicates that in which it would originally have been displayed, a Roman villa of the first century AD. On April 18, after three years of work, the galleries of the Villa reopen with an entirely new arrangement of the collection, one that situates art in its cultural and historical context. Since 2006, when the Getty Villa opened as a museum dedicated to the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, the collection has been presented along thematic lines, with galleries dedicated to subjects such as ancient theater, athletes and competition, and gods and goddesses. This approach was useful in illuminating social life in the ancient classical world, but it prioritized objects’ subject matter over their stature as works of art and removed them from their broader artistic and cultural context. Reenvisioning how the antiquities were displayed at the Villa was one of my top priorities when I joined the J. Paul Getty Museum as director in 2012. As a specialist in ancient art, my priority is to help visitors to see these great treasures as beautiful and fascinating works of art, and sparking their curiosity to understand them in the context of their place in human culture. Starting April 18 our Villa galleries offer a new journey through ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art. The visitor’s path begins on the first-floor rooms devoted to Neolithic and Bronze Age (Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean) Greek art. The journey continues through the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, when the Greeks developed the first fully naturalistic vision of the human figure. And it culminates in the dramatic skylit halls of ancient Roman sculpture. In all there are 33 spaces on two floors, with 3,000 more square feet of gallery space than before. The visitor’s path winds through the galleries, gardens, and fountains, offering views onto the spectacular landscape and Pacific Ocean. Question: When does the visitor see Neolithic art?

It is a pleasure to report that it is possible to do both of these things without feeling deprived or overwhelmed. Just add these two little extras for help with weight-loss success. Add a Little Extra Exercise to Your Daily Routine A simple way to increase the level of exercise during your week is by adding a little more effort into your daily activities – the things you are going to do anyway. For example, we all have to do housework right? So, that is an easy one! Instead of taking your time and working at a leisurely pace, work faster. As you sweep and mop the kitchen floor, put some oomph into it. Work at a steady, brisk pace. Stretch your arms and use your muscles. This will definitely increase your heart rate, and burn more calories. When it’s time to clean the windows, reach up as high as you can – stretch to the top of the windows and be sure to get into the corners. Then, buff the glass to a high sheen, which will involve a little more elbow grease than normal. When you scrub out the tub and the shower, do it with energy and a song – make those tiles shine. Play fun music and dance when you sweep, mop or vacuum. Work for longer periods of time – 20 to 30 minutes of active cleaning is much better than 5 minutes here and 5 minutes there. It gives you more time to get your heart rate going and a better boost to your metabolism. These are things you can do to keep your house sparkling and build the new you. So, start throwing in an abundant amount of gusto for extra calorie burning and body shaping. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why does the author recommend sweeping and mopping at a brisk pace? Options:  A. More calories will be burned  B.

It is a strip or sheet of transparent plastic film base coated on one side with a gelatin emulsion containing microscopically small light-sensitive silver halide crystals. The sizes and other characteristics of the crystals determine the sensitivity, contrast and resolution of the film. The emulsion will gradually darken if left exposed to light, but the process is too slow and incomplete to be of any practical use. Instead, a very short exposure to the image formed by a camera lens is used to produce only a very slight chemical change, proportional to the amount of light absorbed by each crystal. This creates an invisible latent image in the emulsion, which can be chemically developed into a visible photograph. In addition to visible light, all films are sensitive to X-rays and high-energy particles. Most are at least slightly sensitive to invisible ultraviolet (UV) light. Some special-purpose films are sensitive into the infrared (IR) region of the spectrum.  - Serbia, officially the Republic of Serbia, is a sovereign state situated at the crossroads of Central and Southeast Europe, covering the southern part of the Pannonian Plain and the central Balkans.

Precise scholarly definitions of the movement differ in their emphasis, largely as a result of its highly eclectic structure. Although analytically often considered to be religious, those involved in it typically prefer the designation of \\"spiritual\\" and rarely use the term \\"New Age\\" themselves. Many scholars of the subject refer to it as the New Age movement, although others contest this term, believing that it gives a false sense of homogeneity to the phenomenon. As a form of Western esotericism, the New Age movement drew heavily upon a number of older esoteric traditions, in particular those that emerged from the occultist current that developed in the eighteenth century. Such prominent occult influences include the work of Emanuel Swedenborg and Franz Mesmer, as well as the ideas of Spiritualism, New Thought, and the Theosophical Society. A number of mid-twentieth century influences, such as the UFO religions of the 1950s, the Counterculture of the 1960s, and the Human Potential Movement, also exerted a strong influence on the early development of the New Age movement. Although the exact origins of the movement remain contested, it is agreed that it developed in the 1970s, at which time it was centred largely in the United Kingdom. It expanded and grew largely in the 1980s and 1990s, in particular within the United States. Despite its highly eclectic nature, a number of beliefs commonly found within the New Age movement have been identified. Theologically, the movement typically adopts a belief in a holistic form of divinity which imbues all of the universe, including human beings themselves. There is thus a strong emphasis on the spiritual authority of the self. This is accompanied by a common belief in a wide variety of semi-divine non-human entities, such as angels and masters, with whom humans can communicate, particularly through the form of channeling....

She studied acting under the tutelage of Austrian theatre director Max Reinhardt. Her acting career began with uncredited bit parts before eventually landing a minor supporting role in the film \\"Santa Fe Trail\\" (1940). Her performance in \\"Tish\\" as another supporting character led to her signing a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1942, a major film studio well-known for its influence on the entertainment industry. It is clear that Susan Peters acted in various films, stage plays, and television shows. Although her career seems to have had a promising start, particularly with signing a contract with MGM, the information given does not indicate the extent of her legacy in terms of acting accomplishments, awards, influence, or impact on future actors and actresses. To determine whether Susan Peters left a large legacy after her death, one would need additional information such as her filmography, achievements in acting, collaborators, critical acclaim, and overall contribution to the entertainment industry. At this stage, given the limited data available, it is inconclusive to confirm if the hypothesis of Susan Peters leaving a large legacy after she died is true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who was holding hands with Gavin?, using the article: In 1993, Michael Jackson was accused of sexually molesting 13-year-old Jordan Chandler. Jackson denied the claims and settled the civil case out of court for a payment of 15 million plus legal fees; the settlement included a nondisclosure agreement. No criminal charges were filed. In 2005, following further allegations, prompted by the 2003 documentary Living with Michael Jackson in which he was holding hands with a boy named Gavin Arvizo and talked about his sleepovers with children, Jackson was acquitted of child sexual abuse charges.In 2013, choreographer Wade Robson filed a civil lawsuit alleging that Jackson had sexually abused him for seven years, beginning when he was seven years old. In 2014, a case was filed by James Safechuck after seeing an interview with Robson, alleging sexual abuse over a four-year period from the age of ten. Both had previously testified in defense of Jackson — Safechuck as a child during the 1993 investigation, Robson both as a child in 1993 and as a young adult in 2005. In 2015, Robson's case against Jackson's estate was dismissed on the grounds that it had been filed too late, and in 2017 it was ruled that neither of the corporate entities formerly owned by Jackson could be held accountable for Jackson's alleged actions.In the film, Robson, Safechuck, and their respective families describe their relationship with Jackson.

Liza Irizarry, best known for her work on popular Spanish-language network Telemundo, was allegedly assaulted by Ebanks when the latter observed her giving Ebanks' boyfriend, Terence J, a friendly peck on the cheek. The incident has sparked conversations regarding escalating tensions and outbursts of violence within the nightlife scene. The Incident: According to various sources present at the club, Liza Irizarry approached Terence J, a former E! News host and close associate, to greet him with a customary and innocent peck on the cheek. Irizarry's friendly gesture reportedly incensed Selita Ebanks, who, allegedly inebriated, confronted the actress, ultimately leading to a physical confrontation in which Ebanks supposedly punched Irizarry in the face. The Bystanders’ Perspectives: Witnesses claim that the Miami nightclub was abuzz with shocked patrons witnessing the exchange between Irizarry and Ebanks and have corroborated the unfolding of events that led to the brawl. Some onlookers have even attested to seeing a visibly inebriated Ebanks reacting furiously to what many interpreted as a friendly interaction between Irizarry and Terence J. Several bystanders also recollected other attendees at the venue attempting to diffuse the situation, albeit to no avail. The Aftermath: As a result of the incident, Liza Irizarry purportedly sustained a facial injury on her nose and experienced considerable distress following the altercation with Selita Ebanks. While Irizarry has not issued a formal statement regarding the situation, sources close to her have asserted that she was deeply shaken and upset by the unexpected altercation. Selita Ebanks, a renowned model who has graced the Victoria's Secret runway and appeared in numerous ad campaigns for major fashion brands, has also remained silent on the matter. Representatives for both Irizarry and Ebanks have not provided any official response or comment concerning the events at the Miami nightclub. Terence J, who was purportedly present during the scuffle, has yet to address or acknowledge the incident publicly. Conclusion: The alleged altercation between Liza Irizarry and Selita Ebanks has elicited mixed reactions, with many condemning Ebanks' supposed violent behavior and lamenting the rapid escalation of what should have been an innocuous encounter. Critics cite the incident as symptomatic of the underlying issues within the fast-paced world of celebrities, where indulgence and excess often give rise to such altercations. As the story continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether both parties will address the situation and what legal ramifications, if any, may ensue. Until then, the Miami nightclub incident involving Telemundo actress Liza Irizarry and model Selita Ebanks will serve as a cautionary tale for those involved in the high-stakes, glamorous, and sometimes tumultuous realm of celebrity nightlife."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This will give you a clear idea of the distance and elevation of the ground before you putt. Set the ball near your front foot. By examining the putting surface from these different angles, you are able to understand the various slopes and subtle changes in elevation that can affect the path of your putt. Once you have assessed the terrain around the hole, approach your ball and take your stance with the ball near your front foot. This position facilitates a smooth, slightly upward stroke, which can help maintain a consistent roll on the green. As you focus on your stroke mechanics, be mindful of your grip pressure and alignment, ensuring that they remain consistent throughout your putting routine. Take practice swings to feel the tempo and rhythm of your putting stroke. Trust in the information gathered from your initial assessment of the green and visualize a specific target line for your putt. When you are ready to make the actual putt, maintain your focus and commit to your intended line. Keep your head and body still as you execute a smooth, controlled stroke, allowing the putter to follow through naturally. Watch the ball roll along the target line and observe its behavior as it nears the hole. Once your putt is complete, take a moment to evaluate the outcome. Did the ball follow your intended line? Did it stop short or roll past the hole? Use this information to adjust your strategy and approach as necessary for future putts.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -2*p = -4*p for p.","output":"To solve the equation -2*p = -4*p for the variable p, we will follow these steps: 1. Start with the given equation:    -2*p = -4*p 2. Our goal is to isolate the variable p. In order to do that, first, we'll identify the terms with the variable p on both sides of the equation. We have -2*p on the left side and -4*p on the right side. 3. Now, we'll move all the terms with the variable p to one side of the equation to form a new equation. In this case, let's move the term -4*p to the left side by adding 4*p to both sides of the equation:    -2*p + 4*p = -4*p + 4*p 4. Simplify both sides of the equation:    2*p = 0 5. Now we are left with the equation 2*p = 0. To solve for p, we need to isolate the variable p by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:    (2*p) / 2 = 0 / 2 6. Simplify once more:    p = 0 So, the solution to the equation -2*p = -4*p is p = 0. This means that if p is equal to 0, the equation holds true and is balanced."},{"instruction":"Context: Even before they reached town , they could hear a sound like corn popping.

Question: What concerned the populice? Context: By 287 BC, the economic condition of the average plebeian had become poor. The problem appears to have centered around widespread indebtedness. The plebeians demanded relief, but the senators refused to address their situation. The result was the final plebeian secession. The plebeians seceded to the Janiculum hill. To end the secession, a dictator was appointed. The dictator passed a law (the Lex Hortensia), which ended the requirement that the patrician senators must agree before any bill could be considered by the Plebeian Council. This was not the first law to require that an act of the Plebeian Council have the full force of law. The Plebeian Council acquired this power during a modification to the original Valerian law in 449 BC. The significance of this law was in the fact that it robbed the patricians of their final weapon over the plebeians. The result was that control over the state fell, not onto the shoulders of voters, but to the new plebeian nobility.","output":"The economic condition of the average plebeian, specifically widespread indebtedness and lack of relief from the senators, concerned the populace."},{"instruction":"Write a title for this sentence: by the end , the world itself was too small to support the vast ponzi scheme constructed by bernard l. madoff .

The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to rowcropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: Paragraph: Dan, a renowned pedologist, visited two farms near his home town. Grape farm had depleted soils and a low crop production, while Fruit farm, having parcels with depleted soils in the past, established an agroforestry system starting a decade ago which helped stabilize soil and increase production.

It is reported that the 14-year-old's mother contacted the police after discovering that a group of teenagers had used the boy's phone to film themselves dumping urine, feces, and spit on him, and passing it off as part of the challenge. The Cleveland Plain Dealer states that the reward offered by Drew Carey more than tripled as other celebrities followed suit last night. Former host of \\"The View,\\" Jenny McCarthy pledged 10,000 and her new husband, Donnie Wahlberg, offered another 10,000, while Montel Williams also promised to contribute to the cause. Carey, a Cleveland native, says he'll give money to the Autism Speaks group if the reward isn't needed, and it is great to see more celebrities rallying around this issue. The twisted version of the challenge that the teenagers forced the boy to endure is nothing short of disgusting and inhumane, and is not what the original challenge was intended for. Although the challenge represented a fun way for people to come together to raise awareness and money for ALS research, twisted challenges such as this one are not acceptable, and need to be punished. The reward being offered is a motivating factor in finding the group of teenagers who committed this crime, and it is worth noting that the reward continues to grow as celebrities stand up to voice their support for the autistic boy who was victimised. The victim's mother has expressed her appreciation for the outpouring of support and hopes that justice will be served. The incident has sparked a wave of outrage throughout the nation, with people from all walks of life coming together to condemn the actions of the teenagers. Drew Carey's efforts in particular, are a great indication of how celebrities can use their platform to bring attention to issues such as this, and how they can set an example for others to follow.

This control organ plays a special role in evolution—it is the spearhead of evolution. The goals bring the purpose into the world.

In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers.

The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers. Now, I have a new situation: Two students learned about soils in school.

Many engines (older motorcycle engines in particular) do not require any fuel pump at all, requiring only gravity to feed fuel from the fuel tank or under high pressure to the fuel injection system. Often, carbureted engines use low pressure mechanical pumps that are mounted outside the fuel tank, whereas fuel injected engines often use electric fuel pumps that are mounted inside the fuel tank (and some fuel injected engines have two fuel pumps: one low pressure/high volume supply pump in the tank and one high pressure/low volume pump on or near the engine). Fuel pressure needs to be within certain specifications for the engine to run correctly. If the fuel pressure is too high, the engine will run rough and rich, not combusting all of the fuel being pumped making the engine inefficient and a pollutant. If the pressure is too low, the engine may run lean, misfire, or stall. Having read that, could you tell me does a carbureted engine have a fuel pump?","output":"Yes, carbureted engines often use low pressure mechanical pumps that are mounted outside the fuel tank."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: Adult frogs are characterized by long hind legs, a short body, webbed fingerlike parts, and the lack of a tail.

Kim and Jane inherited some land. Kim inherited some grassland, while Jane inherited a forest. They both took good care of their properties. Hint: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil.

Context: Portugal's colonial history has long since been a cornerstone of its national identity, as has its geographic position at the southwestern corner of Europe, looking out into the Atlantic Ocean. It was one of the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories (among them Angola and Mozambique in 1975), turning over the administration of Macau to the People's Republic of China at the end of 1999. Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and/or personal reasons. Portugal, long a country of emigration (the vast majority of Brazilians have Portuguese ancestry), has now become a country of net immigration, and not just from the last Indian (Portuguese until 1961), African (Portuguese until 1975), and Far East Asian (Portuguese until 1999) overseas territories. An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975. By 2007, Portugal had 10,617,575 inhabitants of whom about 332,137 were legal immigrants.
