Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas met alone behind closed doors for more than an hour and a half Thursday in a State Department room just outside Clinton's office.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  the radicle is also growing and producing the primary root. As it grows downward to form the tap root, lateral roots branch off to all sides, producing the typical dicot tap root system. In monocot seeds (Figure 32.21), the testa and tegmen of the seed coat are fused. As the seed germinates, the primary root emerges, protected by the root-tip covering: the coleorhiza. Next, the primary shoot emerges, protected by the coleoptile: the covering of the shoot tip. Upon exposure to light (i. when the plumule has exited the soil and the protective coleoptile is no longer needed), elongation of the coleoptile ceases and the leaves expand and unfold. At the other end of the embryonic axis, the primary root soon dies, while other, adventitious roots (roots that do not arise from the usual place – i. the root) emerge from the base of the stem.

The ideal way to describe this low-budget 70's gem is like a shameless copy of Hammer's \\"The Quatermass Xperiment\\" ...only a thousand times filthier! Astronaust Steve West is the only survivor of a disastrous space-mission, but turns out the carrier of a horrible disease that makes him radioactive and ... causes him to melt! In shock after seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?), Steve busts out of the hospital, leaving a trail of sticky pus and fallen off body parts behind. Doctor Ted Nelson has to find him urgently, as the disease also set Steve up with an insatiable appetite for human flesh. The premise may sound utterly stupid but this flick is enormously entertaining and contains great make-up effects from the hand of Rick Baker. The melting dude's face looks like a rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like Darth Vader! Another big advantage is that William Sachs' screenplay doesn't waste any time on tedious scientific explanations or emotional speeches. The repulsiveness starts right away and lasts until the very last moment of the film.

In this case, Christine is described as having a sickly nature. This could perhaps mean that Christine tends to get sick frequently or that she has a chronic medical condition that often makes her weak or ill. Extended periods of illness often require the sick person to be cared for by someone else, especially if the illness drastically affects their daily life or activities. In this context, caring could involve a lot of tasks; it could mean that Emily helped Christine with daily chores that she couldn't carry out herself due to her illness, like cooking, washing, and tidying up. It could also mean Emily took Christine to her doctor's appointments, helped manage her medication, or was just there as moral support, offering companionship and comfort. Caring for a sick person also often involves maintaining their basic hygiene and well-being. However, it's important to realize that Emily's motivation or reasons for looking after Christine aren't entirely clear. She could have been a close friend, a relative, a neighbor, a professional carer, or even a really kind-hearted and selfless person willing to care for others.

In addition, the surgeon also washes the wrists and lower arms by taking particular care to scrub all surfaces, including the inside of the elbows and the area just below the surgical gown's cuffs. After completing the handwashing process, the surgeon rinses his hands, wrists, and arms thoroughly under running water, ensuring that any remaining soap or debris is washed away. He allows the water to flow from the fingertips toward the elbows, avoiding touching the water faucet or sink with his clean hands to prevent recontamination. Once the surgeon's hands and forearms are rinsed thoroughly, he gently shakes off excess water and proceeds to dry them using a sterile towel. The towel is often provided in a sterile pack, and the surgeon takes care not to touch anything else other than the towel, to maintain the sterile field. He then dries each hand and arm separately, starting from the fingertips and moving up towards the elbows, ensuring that they are completely dry before putting on sterile gloves. The process of donning sterile gloves is equally important in maintaining surgical hygiene. The surgeon opens the sterile glove package using aseptic technique and carefully picks up the first glove by its folded cuff, taking care not to touch the outer surface of the glove with his bare hands. He slides his hand into the glove, ensuring that the glove fits properly and securely.

If the myth regarding broken mirrors would be accurate, everybody involved in this production would now face approximately 170 years of bad luck, because there are a lot of mirrors falling to little pieces here. If only the script was as shattering as the glass, then \\"The Broken\\" would have been a brilliant film. Now it's sadly just an overlong, derivative and dull movie with only just a handful of remarkable ideas and memorable sequences. Sean Ellis made a very stylish and elegantly photographed movie, but the story is lackluster and the total absence of logic and explanation is really frustrating. I got into a discussion with a friend regarding the basic concept and \\"meaning\\" of the film. He thinks Ellis found inspiration in an old legend claiming that spotting your doppelganger is a foreboding of how you're going to die. Interesting theory, but I'm not familiar with this legend and couldn't find anything on the Internet about this, neither. Personally, I just think \\"The Broken\\" is yet another umpteenth variation on the theme of \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" but without the alien interference. \\"The Broken\\" centers on the American McVey family living in London, and particularly Gina. When a mirror spontaneously breaks during a birthday celebration, this triggers a whole series of mysterious and seemingly supernatural events. Gina spots herself driving by in a car and follows her mirror image to an apartment building. Whilst driving home in a state of mental confusion, she causes a terrible car accident and ends up in the hospital. When dismissed, Gina feels like her whole surrounding is changing. She doesn't recognize her own boyfriend anymore and uncanny fragments of the accident keep flashing before her eyes. Does she suffer from mental traumas invoked by the accident or is there really a supernatural conspiracy happening all around her? Writer/director Sean Ellis definitely invokes feelings of curiosity and suspense in his script, but unfortunately he fails to properly elaborate them. \\"The Broken\\" is a truly atmospheric and stylish effort, but only after just half an hour of film, you come to the painful conclusion it shall just remain a beautiful but empty package. There's a frustratingly high amount of \\"fake\\" suspense in this film. This means building up tension, through ominous music and eerie camera angels, when absolutely nothing has even happened so far. By the time the actually mysteriousness kicks in, these tricks don't have any scary effect on you anymore. Some of my fellow reviewers around here compare the film and particularly Sean Ellis' style with the repertoires of David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick and even Alfred Hitchcock, but that is way, way  WAY too much honor.

Michael Gerard Tyson was born in Brownsville, Brooklyn, New York on June 30, 1966. He has an elder brother named Rodney (born c. 1961) and had an elder sister named Denise, who died of a heart attack at age 24 in February 1990. Tyson's biological father is listed as \\"Purcell Tyson\\" (who was from Jamaica) on his birth certificate, but the man Tyson had known as his father was Jimmy Kirkpatrick. Kirkpatrick was from Grier Town, North Carolina (a predominantly black neighborhood that was annexed by the city of Charlotte), where he was one of the neighborhood's top baseball players. Tyson made his professional debut as an 18-year-old on March 6, 1985, in Albany, New York. He defeated Hector Mercedes via a first round knockout. He had 15 bouts in his first year as a professional. Fighting frequently, Tyson won 26 of his first 28 fights by KO or TKO; 16 of those came in the first round. The quality of his opponents gradually increased to journeyman fighters and borderline contenders, like James Tillis, David Jaco, Jesse Ferguson, Mitch Green and Marvis Frazier. His win streak attracted media attention and Tyson was billed as the next great heavyweight champion. D'Amato died in November 1985, relatively early into Tyson's professional career, and some speculate that his death was the catalyst to many of the troubles Tyson was to experience as his life and career progressed.  Tyson's first nationally televised bout took place on February 16, 1986, at Houston Field House in Troy, New York against journeyman heavyweight Jesse Ferguson. Tyson knocked down Ferguson with an uppercut in the fifth round that broke Ferguson's nose. During the sixth round, Ferguson began to hold and clinch Tyson in an apparent attempt to avoid further punishment. After admonishing Ferguson several times to obey his commands to box, the referee finally stopped the fight near the middle of the sixth round. The fight was initially ruled a win for Tyson by disqualification (DQ) of his opponent. The ruling was \\"adjusted\\" to a win by technical knockout (TKO) after Tyson's corner protested that a DQ win would end Tyson's string of knockout victories, and that a knockout would have been the inevitable result.  On November 22, 1986, Tyson was given his first title fight against Trevor Berbick for the World Boxing Council (WBC) heavyweight championship. Tyson won the title by second round TKO, and at the age of 20 years and 4 months became the youngest heavyweight champion in history. Tyson's dominant performance brought many accolades. Donald Saunders wrote: \\"The noble and manly art of boxing can at least cease worrying about its immediate future, now [that] it has discovered a heavyweight champion fit to stand alongside Dempsey, Tunney, Louis, Marciano and Ali.\\"  Tyson intimidated fighters with his strength, combined with outstanding hand speed, accuracy, coordination and timing. Tyson also possessed notable defensive abilities, holding his hands high in the Peek-a-Boo style taught by his mentor Cus D'Amato to slip under and weave around his opponent's punches while timing his own. One of Tyson's trademark moves was a right hook to his opponent's body followed by a right uppercut to his opponent's chin. Lorenzo Boyd, Jesse Ferguson and Jose Ribalta were each knocked down by this combination. Who was he fighting?","output":"Michael Gerard Tyson, also known as Mike Tyson, was a famous boxer. When he was just 18, he started fighting professionally, which means he got paid to box. He was really strong and fast, and because of that, he won a lot of fights by knocking his opponents down. People thought he would become a great champion, and he did! When he was only 20, he became the youngest heavyweight champion in history. In the text, Tyson fought against many boxers, like Hector Mercedes, Jesse Ferguson, and Trevor Berbick. He even became the champion when he won the fight against Trevor Berbick. People were really impressed by how good Tyson was at boxing.

Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.  - Combat Rock is the fifth studio album by the English rock band The Clash. It was released on 14 May 1982 through CBS Records.

It was released as a double album in the United Kingdom on 14 December 1979 by CBS Records, and in the United States in January 1980 by Epic Records. \\"London Calling\\" is a post-punk album that incorporates a range of styles, including punk, reggae, rockabilly, ska, New Orleans R&B, pop, lounge jazz, and hard rock.  - Give 'Em Enough Rope is the second studio album by the English punk rock band the Clash. It was released on 10 November 1978 through CBS Records. It was their first album released in the United States, preceding the US version of \\"The Clash\\". The album was well received by critics and fans, peaking at number two in the United Kingdom Albums Chart, and number 128 in the \\"Billboard\\" 200.  - Paul Gustave Simonon (born 15 December 1955) is an English musician and artist best known as the bassist for the punk rock band The Clash. More recent work includes his involvement in the project \\"The Good, the Bad & the Queen\\" in 2007 with Damon Albarn, Simon Tong and Tony Allen and the Gorillaz album, \\"Plastic Beach\\" in 2010, which along with Albarn saw him reunite with Mick Jones.  - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Water enter the body - Bloodstream - Food and water enter the pancreas - The pancreas breaks down carbs - Helps digest other foods and liquids. Answer:","output":"The missing first step in the process is ingestion, which involves the consumption of food and liquids containing essential nutrients and water. This step enables the body to obtain the necessary substances for energy, growth, and maintenance of its various functions. Ingestion is the first part of the overall digestive process and plays a vital role in setting the stage for the rest of the steps mentioned. Here is a revised and more detailed outline of the process, including the missing step: 1. Ingestion: The individual consumes food and liquids containing nutrients and water. This process typically involves the mechanical breakdown of solid foods through processes like chewing and the incorporation of saliva in the mouth. 2. Digestion and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract: As the ingested substances pass through the digestive system, they are further broken down by enzymes and acids in the stomach and small intestine. Nutrients and water are absorbed into the bloodstream through the walls of the digestive system. 3. Water entering the body: Water absorbed into the bloodstream from the gastrointestinal tract helps regulate body temperature, transports nutrients and oxygen to cells and tissues, and aids several important biochemical reactions. 4. Nutrients and water enter the pancreas: Once in the bloodstream, nutrients like carbohydrates and absorbed water are carried to the pancreas. The pancreas is responsible for producing enzymes and hormones, such as insulin and glucagon, that regulate blood sugar levels and aid in the digestion of nutrients. 5. The pancreas breaks down carbohydrates: Enzymes in the pancreas, such as amylase and glucosidase, catalyze the breakdown of complex carbohydrates into simpler compounds like glucose and other monosaccharides, which can be utilized by cells for energy. 6. Helps digest other foods and liquids: Besides carbohydrates, the pancreas also produces various enzymes responsible for breaking down proteins (such as trypsin and chymotrypsin) and fats (lipase). These enzymes aid in the digestion of food, allowing the body to absorb and utilize essential nutrients more efficiently."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Q:Given the following passage  \\"Birds that employ many strategies to obtain food or feed on a variety of food items are called generalists, while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists. Birds' feeding strategies vary by species. Many birds glean for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds. Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch. Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programs. Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers. Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches. Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey.

Government standards for airplane seat strength -first set more than 60 years ago---require that the seats be made for a passenger weighing 170 pounds(77kg).Today, the average American man weighs nearly 194 pounds(88kg) and the average woman 165 pounds(75kg).Negroni reports: \\"If a heavier person completely fills a seat ,the seat is not likely to behave as intended during a crash,\\"Robert Salzar,the leading scientist at the Center for Applied Biomechanics at the University of Virginia. \\"The energy absorption(,) that is built into the aircraft seat is likely to be overpowered and the passengers will not be protected properly\\". \\"Nor would the injury be limited to that passenger only,\\" Dr. Salzar said. \\"If a seat or a seat belt fails,\\"he said, \\"those people who are seated nearby could be endangered from the uncontrolled movements of the passenger.\\" Most complaints about airplane seats focus on their lack of comfort and high ticket price, and whether overweight passengers should be made to buy two seats.

The 49ers will travel to Seattle to face the Seahawks for a third time this season. The teams split the regular season series. NFC championship game set. Seahawks-49ers next Sunday at CenturyLink Field for a trip to the Super Bowl.— John Boyle (@johnpboyle) January 12, 2014 SF-Seattle: there will be blood…— Andrew Brandt (@adbrandt) January 12, 2014 The 49ers ran the football well. Anquan Boldin was tough to cover all afternoon. Newton eventually got rattled. All these these reasons contributed to the 49ers’ victory, but the Panthers’ approach to the game hampered them from the start. The lack of poise & composure shown by the @Panthers young players has been costly. Too many \\"macho\\" penalties to win a big game.— Bucky Brooks (@BuckyBrooks) January 12, 2014 The 49ers are now getting to Newton on a regular basis. Newton is obviously rattled by the pressure. It eventually resulted in an interception. It's amazing how the #49ers can line up in Nickel personnel and play vanilla defense all night. Superior talent allows them win w/simplicity— Bucky Brooks (@BuckyBrooks) January 12, 2014 If there's anyone in his area code, Cam's eyes are on rush. Panthers not dead yet, but a bad sign.— Travis Haney (@TravHaneyESPN) January 12, 2014 Bad throw by Newton, but also credit pass rush by 49ers. Really collapsing pocket this entire drive.— Smart Football (@smartfootball) January 12, 2014 SF 23, CAR 10: 49ers add three points and kill the clock. San Francisco wasn’t able to find the end zone after driving the football for an extended period of time. But that’s secondary to adding more points while running down the clock. Phil Dawson's 3rd FG in 3 tries pushes #49ers lead to 23-10 with 7:41 left— Cam Inman (@CamInman) January 12, 2014 49ers got the ball with just over 15 minutes left. They will have run nearly half of the time remaining off the clock on this drive.— KC Joyner (@KCJoynerTFS) January 12, 2014 The 49ers handed the ball to RB Frank Gore to finish the game, but the 49ers’ offensive line deserves as much credit as Gore for their ability to control the line of scrimmage.

Big bodies moving all over the place w/a tough, downhill RB attacking seams— Bucky Brooks (@BuckyBrooks) January 12, 2014 Frank Gore rushing … First half: 17. Second half: 67. #49ers— Eric Branch (@Eric_Branch) January 12, 2014 One cue, the 49ers sacked Newton on back-to-back plays. Navorro Bowman got to the quarterback first followed by Ahmad Brooks. The two plays were instrumental in taking points off the board. Those two sacks were basically three points. Panthers went from field goal range to punting.— Michael David Smith (@MichaelDavSmith) January 12, 2014 If the 49ers are going to put the game away, they need to apply more pressure on Newton. Newton is far too comfortable in the pocket. Niners are getting very little pass rush today. Great pass blocking by Carolina.— KC Joyner (@KCJoynerTFS) January 12, 2014 Kaepernick and Newton may be friends, but the 49ers’ quarterback had a little fun impersonating the Panthers’ quarterback after his touchdown run. Kap celebrates as the #49ers extend the lead. #SFvsCAR http://t.co/EEqQGkg3GK— San Francisco 49ers (@49ers) January 12, 2014 SF 20, CAR 10: Anquan Boldin takes over for the 49ers. Kaepernick may have capped the 49ers’ initial drive in the second half with a touchdown run, but it was Boldin who set up the score. The Panthers are having a difficult time covering the veteran receiver. #49ers Anquan Boldin (6 catches, 122) has his fourth 100-yard performance in past 7 postseason games.— Eric Branch (@Eric_Branch) January 12, 2014 Colin Kaepernick: 4th career postseason TD run (5th career postseason game) for 49ers— ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) January 12, 2014 The visiting San Francisco 49ers are leading 13-10 headed into halftime of their divisional-playoff game against the Carolina Panthers. Here’s what each team needs to do in the second half. For the 49ers to win: Keep converting on third down The Panthers’ defense is one of the stingiest in the NFL, and for San Francisco to have a chance in this game, it has to sustain drives. In the game’s opening series, San Francisco converted 3-of-4 third-downs. San Francisco was 2 of 13 on third downs against Carolina in first game. The 49ers converted 3 of 4 on first drive today.— Steve Reed (@SteveReedAP) January 12, 2014 One of those was because of a penalty. In the rest of the half, however, San Francisco had a much more difficult time moving the chains on third downs, failing to convert on three chances. The key will be making sure they face third-and-shorts and not third-and-longs. Otherwise, San Francisco will continue to struggle to keep drives moving. Disrupt Cam Newton and bring a pass rush The 49ers had one of the best defenses in the NFL during the regular season, and much of their success was dependant on a disruptive pass rush. In the first half against the Panthers, San Francisco sacked Newton only once. The Panthers’ offensive line gave Newton time to make plays and find his wide receivers. If the 49ers want to hold on to their lead, they will have to bring pressure, but keep Newton in the pocket to throw him off-balance. Outside linebacker Aldon Smith will be key in that objective. He was very quiet in the first half and needs to be more aggressive the rest of the game. For the Panthers to win, they have to: Keep playing with emotion, but rein it in It’s only natural for young players to be emotional come playoff time. That sometimes leads to forced plays. Newton fired his passes with too much velocity and tried to squeeze in several throws during his opening drive. It led to a tipped interception. On defense, Carolina was called for four penalties that extended San Francisco’s first two drives. They resulted in 49ers field goals. The Panthers need to keep bringing that emotion and physical play but not get carried away with it. The second quarter showed how dangerous Carolina can be when it plays comfortable and assertive. Carolina scored 10 points and held the 49ers scoreless. If the Panthers can keep up the physical play, expect much of the same in the second half. Let Cam Newton do what he wants with the offense The Panthers are at their best when Newton is in a rhythm, throwing darts and taking off when he sees an opening. After a shaky start, Newton settled down and led the Panthers offense. Not surprisingly, Newton targeted wide receiver Steve Smith early. Newton is the dynamic play-maker on the offense, but Smith is the veteran leader. His fiery style of play helps give Carolina confidence. In the first half, Smith had four targets, all of which were caught, for 74 yards and one touchdown. Besides the early interception, Newton was effective in the first half, running for 40 yards on seven carries and throwing for 136 yards and a touchdown. Carolina needs to stay aggressive and allow Newton to keep attacking. A few read-option plays showed the Panthers can add wrinkles to keep San Francisco off-balance. Expect more of the same in the second half. SF 13, CAR 10: 49ers awarded touchdown after review. Kaepernick’s accuracy has been highly inconsistent. But as halftime neared, Kaepernick was able to complete multiple passes, including a touchdown throw in the corner of the end zone. Davis’ catch originally wasn’t ruled a touchdown. Review showed Davis dragged both feet, and the call was reversed. Most TDs by a TE in NFL postseason history: T1. Dave Casper 7, T1. Vernon Davis 7. #49ers— Eric Branch (@Eric_Branch) January 12, 2014 CAR 10, SF 6: Panthers settle for a field goal. Newton was clearly in a rhythm. The zone read and options off the play really opened up the 49ers defense and had them on the ropes. The Panthers weren’t able to deliver the knockout blow. They instead settled for a field goal. #Panthers Gano kicks 24 yard FG to go up 10-6 on #49ers— Cam Inman (@CamInman) January 12, 2014 Panthers have run 7 plays inside the 49ers' 8-yard line. Have gained 10 yards.— Joe Person (@josephperson) January 12, 2014 Cam Newton is best player on field right now, option has opened up everything— Jim Corbett (@ByJimCorbett) January 12, 2014 Newton is such a unique talent, it allows the Panthers to do more on offense, particularly when Carolina goes to its zone-read packages. The @Panthers are the only team that can run multiple versions of read-option because Newton's size allows him to run between tackles.— Bucky Brooks (@BuckyBrooks) January 12, 2014 Newton combo of size/speed is unreal. He's 6-5 245. In other words, he's the same size as Michael Strahan…as a QB.— Andrew Siciliano (@AndrewSiciliano) January 12, 2014 CAR 7, SF 6: Newton drops a dime. The Panthers were stuffed at the 1-yard line on fourth down. Yet, the 49ers weren’t able to take advantage of the momentum swing. After a punt return from Ted Ginn to give the Panthers tremendous field position, Panthers WR Steve Smith easily beat the cornerback off the line of scrimmage. And Newton threw a perfectly placed ball 31 yards for the game’s first touchdown. Wow what a throw.. No defense for a perfect throw… Cam's pretty sharp so far 7-8.— Bruce Feldman (@BFeldmanCBS) January 12, 2014 That throw from Newton shouldn't be overlooked. Not that many QBs make it as consistently as him.— Cian Fahey (@Cianaf) January 12, 2014 Steve Smith now has 8 career TD catches in postseason (in 9 games)— ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) January 12, 2014 That last TD throw by Cam was a display of Rivera’s expectations: This team believes Newton can handle his 1st truly meaningful NFL moment.— Jeff Darlington (@JeffDarlington) January 12, 2014 SF 6, CAR o: Dawson strikes again Dawson continues to prove he’s one of the most reliable kickers in the game. The 49ers may be setting themselves up for failure by not converting for more points, though. Update: Phil Dawson has made 34 of past 35 FG attempts. Analysis: He's having a better season than David Akers did in 2012. #49ers— Eric Branch (@Eric_Branch) January 12, 2014 FGs are good, but the @49ers needed TDs on those drives to put a ton of pressure on the @Panthers . Need to put up 7's in playoffs to win.— Bucky Brooks (@BuckyBrooks) January 12, 2014 49ers WR Michael Crabtee was injured during the first series of the game, and he’s not been the same since. Crabtree opens up the offense for the 49ers. If he’s hampered or not on the field, it would be a major loss. Michael Crabtree doesn't look quite right. Something wrong with his shoulder— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 12, 2014 Crabtree does not look right. Seems to be dealing with an arm/shoulder injury stemming from that Captain Munnerlyn tackle on opening drive.— Matt Barrows (@mattbarrows) January 12, 2014 The first turnover of the game came on the Panthers’ first offensive series. 49ers LB Patrick Willis rode Panthers TE Greg Olsen wide and was then in perfect position to pluck a poorly thrown ball from Newton out of the air. Back leg throw for Cam Newton…who was forced into a mistake under pressure from Aldon Smith.— Matt Miller (@nfldraftscout) January 12, 2014 That is Patrick Willis' 1st interception since Week 16, 2012 against the Seahawks— ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) January 12, 2014 Will Tukuafu is a massive fullback at 293 pounds. The 49ers have really relied on him the last few weeks of the season. Takuafu was injured during the 49ers’ first series of the game. He has been ruled out for the rest of the game. If Tukuafu is out, look for Dixon to take the FB snaps (there will be FB snaps) and maybe DT Ian Williams in short-yardage situations.— Chase Stuart (@fbgchase) January 12, 2014 SF 3, CAR 0: 49ers strike first Kaepernick completed a pair of third down throws. The 49ers benefited from a personal foul. And Phil Dawson remains true. Phil Dawson drills 49-yard FG. He's 6 of 6 in his career in postseason. #49ers 3, Panthers 0.— Eric Branch (@Eric_Branch) January 12, 2014 Late hit on Davis was good call folks. He let up & ball is on the ground. It makes no difference pass was tipped — close, but a foul.— Mike Pereira (@MikePereira) January 12, 2014 The 49ers are moving the football with a little help from a hit on a defenseless receiver. But the Panthers are attempting to set the tone of the game during the initial drive. #Panthers playing very physical in coverage. Kuechly and co. hitting Niners' receivers early and often.— Matt Miller (@nfldraftscout) January 12, 2014 Kaepernick is already playing at a higher level than he did during the team’s previous meeting with the Panthers. The 49ers’ quarterback completed a pair of third down passes. He is breaking out of the pocket and still looking to make plays down field. Like the way Kap kept his eyes downfield on that. Could have run but was still looking for a pass— Andrew Garda (@Andrew_Garda) January 12, 2014 Kaepernick is looking very poised so far.— KC Joyner (@KCJoynerTFS) January 12, 2014 The Carolina Panthers and the San Francisco 49ers possess the two most athletically gifted quarterbacks in the NFL.

Article:Already 3-0 up from the away tie in Belfast, the Glasgow side extended their lead through Efe Ambrose's powerful 16th-minute header. But it took until the 70th minute for their pressure to bring a second, a close-range Georgios Samaras header. While Cliftonville's hard work avoided the feared rout, it is Celtic who will host Swedes Elfsborg next Wednesday. Elfsborg, who have on-loan Celtic striker Mo Bangura and former Portsmouth forward James Keene in their squad, had earlier completed their own demolition of Daugava. Already 7-1 up from the home leg, they showed they will be a tough hurdle to overcome for Neil Lennon's side, hopeful of matching the £23.5m earned from last season's march to the last 16, winning 4-0 in Latvia. Despite striker Gary Hooper's recovery from a groin strain, Northern Irishman Lennon named an unchanged side from the one that won in his homeland. Last season's top scorer was on the bench even though he has been the subject of a transfer bids from Norwich City and, most recently, QPR. Cliftonville manager Tommy Breslin had voiced his determination not to leave Scotland with a humiliating scoreline and not surprisingly named a more defensive formation, with former Werder Bremen striker Liam Boyce on his own up front. The expected onslaught began with a Samaras shot being beaten away by goalkeeper Conor Devlin. It was clever play by Sweden full-back Mikael Lustig that finally prised open the visiting defence, setting up Anthony Stokes to deliver a cross that was dispatched past Devlin by Nigeria defender Ambrose. Part-timers Cliftonville battled away gallantly and threatened momentarily when Marc Smyth had a close-range effort blocked after a rare corner for the Northern Irish champions, while Ciaran Caldwell fired wide. Media playback is not supported on this device That was a brief respite as Kris Commons and James Forrest threatened a second goal from range, with the latter's effort clipping the top of the crossbar. Celtic's intensity dipped after the break, but Stokes forced a fine fingertip save from Devlin with a clever drive the Irishman steered towards the far corner. Stokes was not so smart when presented with an easier chance after being set up by Scott Brown, the striker curling his shot wide of Devlin and the post. Just as Cliftonville appeared to be tiring, a desperate clearance from Kelvin Wilson prevented a cross presenting Boyce the chance of a surprise tap-in equaliser. Minutes after Hooper came off the bench, Celtic extended their lead when a fine Commons cross found the head of Samaras eight yards from goal. Hooper fired an effort against the base of the post and summer signing Amido Balde headed just wide on his debut from the bench, but Cliftonville managed to restrict Celtic to a two-goal victory.

You might not mean to but you do. One out of three people collects tangible things such as cats, photos and noisy toys. There are among some 40 collections that are being shown at \\"The Museum Of\\"--the first of several new museums which, over the next two years, will exhibit the objects accumulated by unknown collectors. In doing so, they will promote a popular culture of museums, not what museums normally represent. Some of the collections are fairly common--records, model houses. Others are strangely beautiful--branches that have fallen from tree, for example. But they all reveal  a lot of things: ask someone what they collect and their answers will tell you who they are. Other on the way include \\"The museum of Collectors\\" and \\"The Museum of Me.\\"These new ones, it is hoped, will build on the success of \\"The Museum Of.\\" The thinkers behind the project want to explore why people collect, and what it means to do so. They hope that visitors who may not have considered themselves collectors will begin to see they, too, collect. Some collectors say they started or stopped making collections at important point: the beginning or end of adolescence--\\"it's a growing-up thing; you stop when you grow up,\\"says one. Other painful times are mentioned, such as the end of a relationship. For time and life can seem so uncontrollable that a steady serial arrangement is comforting. How will the new museums promote a popular culture of museums? A) By collecting more tangible things. B) By showing what ordinary people have collected. C) By correcting what museums normally represent. D) By accumulating 40 collections two years from now. A:","output":"The new museums will promote a popular culture of museums by B) showing what ordinary people have collected. This approach differs from the traditional representation of museums, which often showcase art, artifacts, and items of historical or cultural significance. By focusing on the collections of everyday individuals, these museums aim to make visitors feel more connected and engaged with the concept of collecting itself, as they can relate to the personal stories and motivations behind each collection. The Museum Of, The Museum of Collectors, and The Museum of Me all plan to exhibit the objects accumulated by unknown collectors, revealing insights into their personalities, interests, and life experiences. Through this approach, the museums aim to explore why people collect and what it means to do so. By showcasing collections of common and less conventional items, such as records, model houses, branches from trees, and others, the museums will offer a broader perspective on the diverse and even quirky world of collecting. The thinkers behind these museum projects hope that visitors who may not have considered themselves collectors will start to see that they, too, indeed collect something in their lives. By highlighting the personal significance of collecting during different stages of life, such as adolescence or after the end of a relationship, the museums will provide a more inclusive and relatable perspective on collecting as an activity that a significant portion of the population engages in, intentionally or not. In conclusion, these new museums will promote a popular culture of museums by focusing on showcasing the tangible collections of ordinary people, emphasizing the personal stories behind them, and demonstrating how collecting is a universal aspect of human experience. This approach will not only broaden the appeal of museum culture but also encourage more people to engage with museums and better understand the value and meaning behind the act of collecting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Process:  - Cells obtain glucose and oxygen - The glucose and oxygen create carbon dioxide - The cells release energy - The cells don't have enough oxygen to repeat this - The cells obtain more oxygen from the air - The cells repeat this process.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose not enough carbon dioxide is produced happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen reaching the body.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that not enough carbon dioxide is produced in the process. This could have an indirect effect on the process. If not enough carbon dioxide is produced, it may indicate that there is less glucose and oxygen being utilized in cellular respiration. This could potentially lead to an imbalance in the exchange of gases in the body. Since carbon dioxide is one of the primary triggers for the body to take in more oxygen (through increasing the breathing rate), a lower carbon dioxide production might result in the body not feeling the need to breathe as deeply, or as often as it should. This could lead to less oxygen being taken in and transported to the cells for cellular respiration. Overall, the proposed perturbation has an indirect effect on the process, as lower carbon dioxide production could impact the body's ability to obtain oxygen through breathing. This, in turn, might result in less oxygen being available for cells to carry out cellular respiration and release energy, which could disrupt the entire process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences.

To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers, use the Order Reprints tool at the bottom of any article or visit www.djreprints.com ||||| By Paul Cruickshank      CNN Terrorism Analyst      There may be a link between what sources tell CNN is evidence of final-stage planning for an attack against U.S and Western interests by al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen and the reported recent appointment of the affiliate's leader as the new general manager of the global al Qaeda network.      Seth Jones, a senior analyst at the Rand Corporation, told CNN's Barbara Starr on Friday that there are indications that Nasir al Wuhayshi, the Yemeni leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), had recently been appointed into the role by al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri.      The appointment would effectively thrust Wuhayshi, a Yemeni national, into the No. 2 position in the global al Qaeda terrorist network, a position previously held by the Libyan Abu Yahya al Libi before his death in a drone strike in Pakistan in June 2012.      It would also provide a broader foundation to al Qaeda's top leadership at a time when the center of gravity of the group has shifted from the Afghanistan-Pakistan region to the Arab world. And it would potentially allow the group to retap fund-raising opportunities for the group in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries where Wuhayshi is more popular than Zawahiri, al Qaeda's less charismatic and sometimes divisive Egyptian leader.      Wuhayshi's appointment would almost certainly have required back-and-forth communication between the AQAP and al Qaeda Central. Given al Qaeda's past track record, that would most likely have involved couriers traveling back and forth between Yemen and Pakistan, where Zawahiri is presumed to be hiding.      This would have given Wuhayshi plenty of opportunity to inform Zawahiri of any plan in the works to hit American targets in the region. This possible foreknowledge in turn may explain Zawahiri's impassioned plea in a message posted on jihadist websites earlier this week for followers to hit American targets in the Middle East and beyond.      A high-profile attack orchestrated by Wuhayshi would cement the Yemeni's new position in the al Qaeda hierarchy.      \\"What I'm told by sources is - take all this together: you have got the naming of the chief from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, you have got the video [from Zawahiri], plus you have got the intelligence, all of this comes together in the last couple of weeks that leads them to take this extraordinary step of closing 21 embassies,\\" CNN National Security Analyst Fran Townsend said on CNN's \\"AC360\\" on Friday.      A U.S. global travel alert remained in place Saturday amid fears that al Qaeda may launch attacks in the Middle East, North Africa and beyond in coming weeks.      The threat prompted the United States to announce that nearly two dozen embassies and consulates will be closed on Sunday, including in Yemen, which was a focus of concern.      The Next bin Laden?      Nasir al Wuhaysi who is known by his fighters as \\"Abu Basir,\\" has a long pedigree in the global jihadist movement despite only being 36 years old. He is seen within jihadist circles as somebody with the credibility and charisma to one day fill Osama bin Laden's shoes as al Qaeda's paramount leader.      Wuhayshi was bin Laden's private secretary during the time al Qaeda was based in Taliban-run Afghanistan and, according to former al Qaeda insiders, he rarely left his side. After the U.S. military offensive to topple the Taliban, Wuhayshi fled to Iran, where he was arrested and eventually extradited to Yemen in 2003.      He was subsequently imprisoned in a high security jail in Sana'a with several other al Qaeda operatives who had been arrested in a crackdown on the group in Yemen after 9/11. But in February 2006, Wuhayshi and several other al Qaeda operatives escaped from the prison by digging a tunnel. Over the next several years Wuhayshi and the other escapees rebuilt al Qaeda's operations in the country and began launching attacks on Yemeni security services and foreign tourists.      In September 2008, Wuhayshi orchestrated a sophisticated multi-phase attack on the U.S. embassy in Sana'a involving gunmen with rocket propelled grenades and suicide bombers in cars packed with explosive. Although the attackers failed to breach the embassy perimeter, six Yemeni guards and four civilians were killed in the attack.      The following summer, Wuhayshi authorized an attempt to kill Saudi Arabia's then head of counter-terrorism, Mohammed bin Nayef. The plan was engineered by AQAP's ingenious chief bomb-maker Ibrahim al Asiri, who planted a bomb inside the rectum of his own brother. The operative gained an audience with the Saudi prince by pretending to defect and duly set off the bomb. But Nayef survived the attack.      Although nearly all AQAP's attacks have been directed against targets in Yemen, Wuhayshi made clear he supported bin Laden's campaign of attacks against the United States.      In late 2009, he green-lighted a plan by al Asiri and the American terrorist cleric Anwar al Awlaki to destroy a U.S. bound plane. On Christmas Day 2009, the Nigerian militant they recruited into the plot - Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab - came close to blowing up an airliner coming into Detroit with an explosive device hidden in his underwear.      Bin Laden, determined to once again strike the United States, signaled his approval in correspondence sent to Wuhayshi. In August 2010, the Saudi sent a message from Abbottabad praising Wuhayshi for his \\"qualified and capable\\" leadership of the group and urging him to remain in his position.      Two more thwarted plots against U.S bound aviation followed: an attempt to blow cargo planes coming into the United States with bombs hidden inside printer cartridges in October 2010 and a plot involving an even more sophisticated underwear device built by al Asiri, which was thwarted by a British-Saudi double agent in April 2012.      In September 2012, three Yemeni AQAP operatives took part in the terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi several sources told CNN. It is not clear whether they were dispatched by Wuhayshi to take part in the attack or happened to be in the city and joined in.      Despite green-lighting plots against the United States homeland, Wuhayshi never made them the group's priority. He only seconded a small number of operatives - perhaps a dozen - to AQAP's external operations outfit run by al Asiri and Awlaki.      Wuhayshi wants Islamic rule in Yemen      Wuhayshi's overriding focus, according to a former group insider, has been toppling the government in Sana'a and creating an Islamic state in Yemen.      In 2011, Wuhayshi's group took advantage of political turmoil in Sana'a to capture large areas of Yemen's southern tribal areas. He enlisted the support of some tribal factions by renaming the group \\"Ansar al Shariah\\" and casting its mission as one of restoring Islamic rule to the country.      Letters discovered in the Abbottabad compound revealed bin Laden had initially argued against the push to capture territory in Yemen fearing, rightly as it turned out, the group would not be strong enough to hold onto it, but Wuhayshi proceeded anyway. Bin Laden's opposition eventually softened.      Wuhayshi himself set up his headquarters in the town of Jaar in Yemen's southern tribal areas. For 16 months, al Qaeda effectively governed the area, taking on responsibility for electricity, water and other utilities, but also inflicting brutal medieval justice on those it judged to have broken Islamic law.      Wuhayshi was the commander at the heart of it all and his rule over territory in the heart of the Arab world further enhanced his reputation in jihadist circles worldwide.      According to former group insiders - in much the same way as bin Laden - he was extremely popular with rank and file al Qaeda fighters. He projected the same softly-spoken humble air as his mentor.      In spring 2012, the Yemeni military launched a major offensive which eventually drove al Qaeda out of several towns of the tribal areas of Yemen. But most of the group's leadership, including Wuhayshi, fled into the countryside and regrouped. In recent months, the group has been responsible for a rising number of bombings against Yemeni security services.      Is a revenge factor at work?      This week's terror threat warning may signal Wuhayshi has decided to attach greater priority to hitting U.S. and Western interests, which would be a worrying scenario for U.S. counter-terrorism officials because of the group's still significant capabilities, access to resources and expertise. Al Qaeda affiliates throughout the Middle East also have a new recruiting tool because of rising anger among the group's supporters because of what they perceive to be a U.S.-backed military coup in Egypt.      Wuhayshi's appointment as al Qaeda's de facto No. 2 will increase the pressure on him to show results in targeting U.S. interests in the Middle East.      Letters discovered from Abbottabad indicated that his boss Zawahiri disagreed with bin Laden over the relative priority that should be given to attacking the U.S. homeland.      According to the Washington Post, the correspondence indicated the Egyptian believed launching attacks against the U.S. interests in the Middle East was a more effective way of removing U.S. support for secular regimes in the region.      Wuhayshi likely also has several other motivations for ordering a strike now on U.S. interests.      In recent months U.S. drone strikes have killed several senior AQAP, including Said al Shehri, Wuhayshi's deputy last winter, and the group has signaled it wants revenge.      A successful high-profile attack may also re-energize the group after the setbacks of losing control of territory in Yemen's tribal areas last year. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"There is evidence of final-stage planning for an attack against U.S and Western interests by al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen, which may be linked to the reported recent appointment of the affiliate's leader, Nasir al Wuhayshi, as the new general manager of the global al Qaeda network.

They'd been busy with work and taking care of their kids, and this was their much-needed break. Little did they know that their relaxing trip would soon turn into a chilling, unforgettable tragedy. As they eagerly set off on their journey, Amrita's parents came across a local boy who warned them about a dangerous path that had been destroyed by a recent storm. Heeding the boy's advice, they decided to steer clear of the perilous route and take a detour on their way to the nearby village. They thanked the boy for looking out for them and continued on their way, grateful for the stranger's kindness. At the same time, Amrita was wandering around the area, taking in the beauty of the surrounding countryside. She was startled when she was suddenly stopped by a teenager, who was driving a young woman named Athidhi to her hostel. Athidhi was an introverted girl who was always keen on making new friends, and she seized the opportunity to make Amrita's acquaintance. The two girls immediately hit it off and chatted away as the teenager drove them toward the hostel. The girls' happy chatter was suddenly interrupted by the loud noise of a gunshot ringing through the air. Nearby witnesses hurried to the source of the sound and froze in horror as they saw Amrita's parents, lifeless on the ground, and Athidhi standing firmly with a gun in her hand. Panic-stricken, Athidhi protested her innocence, arguing that she had just found the weapon lying next to the bodies of Amrita's parents. While Amrita was devastated by her unexpected loss, she believed in her newfound friend and chose to stand by her side. Without much choice left, the two girls decided to work together in seeking out the real murderer, who they believed was a psychopath stalking the village unnoticed. Embarking on a perilous journey to bring justice to Amrita's parents, the duo began their search for the psychopath, determined to uncover the truth. Along the way, the village girl and the hostel resident encountered several obstacles and threats, coming face-to-face with danger at every turn. However, they never strayed from their mission, despite the escalating stakes and the suspicion that weighed heavily upon them. As they delved deeper into the dark corners of the village, the two girls unravelled a web of conspiracy and corruption that had been festering for years. As the truth began to emerge, they found themselves tangled within a sinister network of intrigue and terror, horrified by the reality that the seemingly peaceful village hid a murderous secret. Despite the odds stacked against them, Athidhi and Amrita grew more courageous and resourceful, driven by an unwavering desire to avenge the deaths of Amrita's parents. The two girls forged an unbreakable bond, with Amrita providing sensitivity and empathy, while Athidhi offered her determination and steeliness. As they finally closed in on the psychopath murderer, they not only found redemption and justice but also discovered the strength of an unbreakable friendship, built amidst adversity and grief. The ordeal they faced had made them inseparable, and together, they had chased the darkness away from a village that had long been engulfed in fear. The story of Athidhi and Amrita continued to be passed down through the generations, inspiring the villagers to remain vigilant and stand united against the shadows that threatened to engulf their lives."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral.

Zinthrop has been able to extract enzymes from the royal jelly of the queen wasp that can reverse the aging process. Janice agrees to fund further research, at great cost, provided she can serve as his human subject. Displeased with the slowness of the results, she breaks into the scientist's laboratory after hours and injects herself with extra doses of the formula. Zinthrop becomes aware that some of the test creatures are becoming violent and goes to warn Janice, but before he can reach anyone, he gets into a car accident. He is thus temporarily missing and Janice goes through great trouble to find him, eventually taking over his care. Janice continues her clandestine use of the serum and sheds 20 years in a single weekend, but soon discovers that she is periodically transformed into a murderous, wasp-like creature. Eventually, Zinthrop throws a jar of carbolic acid at her face, and another character uses a chair to push her out of a window, killing her. Answer:","output":"Janice died when Zinthrop threw a jar of carbolic acid at her face, and another character pushed her out of a window using a chair."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: Who falls for the real estate agent?, using the article: Jordan Sands is an awkward and nerdy 17-year-old girl with a bad case of allergies, who just became the woman of the house after the recent death of her mother. Her father David is struggling to make ends meet, while her 14-year-old brother Hunter drives the family crazy with gory pranks. They inherit their deceased mother's Great-Uncle Dragomir's castle in Wolfsberg, Romania after getting a package in the mail. After arriving in Wolfsberg, they meet the strange and steely castle housekeeper, Madame Varcolac. Varcolac discourages David from selling the property, but he ends up going on dates with and falling for the real estate agent Paulina von Eckberg. One day while snooping around Dragomir's lab, Jordan steps on a vial of strange liquid. Hunter manages to pull the pieces out from her foot, but Jordan's behavior changes, such as her allergies disappearing, seeing without glasses, and smelling things very far away. Hunter's friends explain that Jordan's behaviors are akin to those of a werewolf's, and that she is one either because of a bloodline curse, a bite from an infected person, or from getting blood of a werewolf. In Jordan's case, it was revealed to have been LB-217, which is short for \\"Lycanthrope Blood\\". Jordan continues to succumb to the changes, having behavioral changes. After her date with Goran, the young butcher, Jordan turns into a werewolf, which Hunter witnesses. She flees and Hunter contacts his friends for help. They reveal that there is no cure they know of other than shooting a werewolf dead with silver. Hunter refuses to do this to his sister. His friends warn that if Jordan is not cured by the next sunrise, she will always be a werewolf, cursed to shift every night until the end of her life., what would be the answer ?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a goal: Organize game pieces. Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"Organizing game pieces can be accomplished in various ways, depending on the specific game, the pieces involved, the storage options available, and personal preferences. Below are two different methods of organizing game pieces, each with its advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, the better approach should be based on the specific needs and context of the individuals involved in organizing and playing the game. Method 1: Categorizing by Game Element This method entails organizing game pieces according to the particular element or role they play within the game. This can include grouping pieces by type, color, use, or other categories relevant to the game's mechanics, objectives, or theme. For example, in a game like Monopoly, you could group all the property cards together, all the money by denomination, the tokens, the houses, and the hotels. Advantages: - Easy to locate specific pieces: When playing, it's convenient to have all the same types of pieces together, as you can quickly locate and distribute the pieces needed for gameplay. - Simplifies setup & cleanup: This method simplifies the setup and cleanup process, as each category of pieces has its designated area, making it easy to prepare the game and pack it away afterward. - Reduces confusion: Keeping the same types of pieces together helps players avoid confusion, especially during gameplay when quick decisions need to be made. Disadvantages: - May be challenging with complex games: For games with numerous types of pieces or complex categories, this method may become time-consuming or challenging to maintain. - Storage solutions may differ: Based on the game's storage design, this method might require additional containers or labels to accommodate the game elements' categorization. Method 2: Categorizing by Player This method involves organizing game pieces according to the player they belong to, generally by color or other distinguishing features, so each player has their set of game pieces. An example for this method would be a game like Risk, where each player has an army represented by different color tokens. Advantages: - Personal organization: Players can manage and organize their pieces throughout gameplay more easily, fostering a sense of responsibility and personal control. - Quicker setup: With each player's pieces stored together, setting up the game can be quicker, as players can access their pieces when needed during the game's initial setup. - Encourages engagement: Players feel more involved and engaged since they focus on the pieces that directly correspond to their gameplay. Disadvantages: - Not applicable to all games: This method doesn't apply well to games where pieces are shared or not specific to individual players. - Possible storage limitations: Some games may not have storage solutions readily available to separate pieces by player, requiring additional resources. Ultimately, both methods have advantages and disadvantages, and the most efficient way to organize game pieces for a particular game will depend on that game's unique characteristics, storage options, and player preferences. In some cases, a hybrid approach that combines elements of both methods might be the best solution. Evaluate the game at hand and consider the players' needs and preferences to settle on the most effective organization method."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's the step-by-step analysis: 1. Identify the main subject: \\"The security patrol\\" is the main subject of the sentence. 2. Look for actions or intentions attributed to the main subject: \\"searched the land for survivors\\" and \\"not interested in saving them\\" are two actions or intentions attributed to the security patrol. 3. Determine which actions or intentions are most relevant to the pronoun: \\"not interested in saving them\\" involves a pronoun (\\"them\\") and is directly connected to the earlier action of searching for survivors. 4. Make the connection: Since both actions or intentions are attributed to the same subject (the security patrol), it's reasonable to conclude that \\"they\\" refers to the security patrol. Therefore, \\"they\\" in the sentence refers to the security patrol, meaning they were searching for survivors but were not interested in saving them."},{"instruction":"Available options: 1). watch television next 2). teach her the proper steps 3). learn the dance next Q: I heard that Addison put Jesse's hand on Jesse's hips and showed her the steps of the dance.

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. Tocqueville asserted that the values that had triumphed in the North and were present in the South had begun to suffocate old-world ethics and social arrangements. Legislatures abolished primogeniture and entails, resulting in more widely distributed land holdings. This was a contrast to the general aristocratic pattern in which only the eldest child, usually a man, inherited the estate, which had the effect of keeping large estates intact from generation to generation. In America, in contrast, landed elites were less likely to pass on fortunes to a single child by the action of primogeniture, which meant that as time went by, large estates became broken up within a few generations which, in turn, made the children more equal overall. It was not always a negative development, according to Joshua Kaplan's interpretation of Tocqueville, since bonds of affection and shared experience between children often replaced the more formal relation between the eldest child and the siblings, characteristic of the previous aristocratic pattern. Overall, in the new democracies, hereditary fortunes became exceedingly difficult to secure and more people were forced to struggle for their own living. This rapidly democratizing society, as Tocqueville understood it, had a population devoted to \\"middling\\" values which wanted to amass, through hard work, vast fortunes. In Tocqueville's mind, this explained why America was so different from Europe. In Europe, he claimed, nobody cared about making money. The lower classes had no hope of gaining more than minimal wealth, while the upper classes found it crass, vulgar, and unbecoming of their sort to care about something as unseemly as money; many were virtually guaranteed wealth and took it for granted. At the same time in America, workers would see people fashioned in exquisite attire and merely proclaim that through hard work they too would soon possess the fortune necessary to enjoy such luxuries. Despite maintaining with Aristotle, Montesquieu, and others that the balance of property determined the balance of power, Tocqueville argued that, as America showed, equitable property holdings did not ensure the rule of the best men. In fact, it did quite the opposite. The widespread, relatively equitable property ownership which distinguished America and determined its mores and values also explained why the American masses held elites in such contempt.  Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"They could make money via hard work versus in europe no one cared about making money\\" correctly answer the question \\"How were the American lower class's views of wealth and fine possessions different from those of the European lower class?\\"?

The response \\"They could make money via hard work versus in Europe no one cared about making money\\" correctly answers the question \\"How were the American lower class's views of wealth and fine possessions different from those of the European lower class?\\". According to Tocqueville's observations, the American lower class believed that through hard work, they could acquire wealth and fine possessions, while the European lower class had no hope of gaining more than minimal wealth and did not care about making money. The belief in hard work and the opportunity for upward mobility distinguished the American lower class from their European counterparts."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug. When the group travelled by train to Bangor, Wales in 1967 for the Maharishi Yogi's Transcendental Meditation seminar, a policeman did not recognise her and stopped her from boarding.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Chemicals like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen are released into the air - These substances rise into the high atmosphere - They react with water and oxygen - This creates a more acidic rain - The rain with the high acid content falls.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more substances rise into the high atmosphere happens, how will it affect more substances rise into the high atmosphere.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you've provided suggests that if more substances, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen, rise into the high atmosphere, how would it affect the process and does this perturbation have any direct or indirect effect? To answer this question, let's first break down the process of acidic rain formation and then discuss the consequences of the hypothesized increase in substances rising into the high atmosphere. Process of Acidic Rain Formation: 1. Emission of pollutants: Chemicals like sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are released into the air, mainly from human activities such as burning fossil fuels, industrial processes, and vehicle emissions. 2. Rising pollutants: These substances rise into the high atmosphere, where they are dispersed over large areas due to wind and other atmospheric processes. 3. Chemical reactions: In the high atmosphere, these pollutants react with water and oxygen, as well as other substances present in the atmosphere, forming acidic compounds such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). 4. Formation of acidic rain: When these acidic compounds mix with rainwater, they create a more acidic rain with increased hydrogen ion (H+) content. Suppose the perturbation hypothesis comes true, and more substances like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides rise into the high atmosphere. In that case, we can expect the following consequences: 1. Increased chemical reactions: With more substances present in the high atmosphere, the rate of chemical reactions leading to the formation of acidic compounds would likely increase. 2. Higher acid content in rain: As more acidic compounds are formed, the rain will have a higher acid content, leading to more acidic rainwater. 3. Worsened air quality: An increased quantity of atmospheric pollutants can lead to deteriorating air quality, posing health risks for humans and animals. Exposure to high levels of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides can cause respiratory problems, aggravate existing heart and lung conditions, and lead to higher rates of related illnesses. 4. More extensive environmental damage: Acidic rain can have several negative effects on the environment. It can leach essential nutrients from the soil, affecting agriculture and plant growth. Moreover, it can harm aquatic ecosystems by increasing the acidity of water bodies, causing harm to fish and other aquatic organisms. The increased acidity can also accelerate the corrosion of buildings, monuments, and other infrastructure. 5. Climate change implications: Additional chemicals in the high atmosphere could also have implications for the Earth's climate, particularly if greenhouse gases are among the additional substances. An increase in greenhouse gases would lead to more heat being trapped in the atmosphere, exacerbating global warming and climate change. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation of having more substances rising into the high atmosphere, particularly sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, would indeed have significant direct and indirect effects on the acidic rain formation process. The consequences could include worsened air quality, more extensive environmental damage, and potential implications for climate change. Efforts to reduce emissions of these pollutants are essential in mitigating these negative effects and protecting the environment and human health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A. yes B. no Does \\"This resulted in an exodus of civilians from Egyptian cities along the Suez Canal's western bank.\\" correctly answer the question of Who would get to attack Israel from Lebanon?","output":"The statement \\"This resulted in an exodus of civilians from Egyptian cities along the Suez Canal's western bank\\" does not correctly answer the question of Who would get to attack Israel from Lebanon. The statement is unrelated to the topic at hand, as it discusses the movement of civilians in Egypt in connection to the Suez Canal, whereas the question is about a party or group attacking Israel from Lebanon. Let's provide a comprehensive response to the question: Lebanon is a country that shares a border with Israel to the north and has experienced multiple conflicts throughout history, often involving Israel and various militant groups. Given the context of the initial question, we can infer it's seeking information about groups or parties that would carry out attacks on Israel from Lebanese territory. Multiple entities might be involved or have been involved in attacking Israel from Lebanon. Some of them are: 1. Hezbollah: Hezbollah is a Lebanese Shiite political party and militant group that was established in the early 1980s. This organization is considered the most powerful non-state actor in the region and one of Israel's primary enemies. Hezbollah has been responsible for many high-profile attacks against Israel, including rocket assaults and cross-border incidents. It derives its support from Iran and Syria, and its military wing is considerably well-armed and highly trained. 2. Palestinian militant groups: Various Palestinian armed factions have operated from Lebanon, particularly during the Lebanese Civil War, which took place between 1975 and 1990. These factions, which included the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), were involved in attacks targeting Israel from southern Lebanon. Palestinian militant organizations, like Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, have also been accused of operating from Lebanon to mount attacks on Israel. 3. Lebanese Nationalists: Throughout history, certain Lebanese nationalist factions that were opposed to Israeli occupation or perceived Israeli aggression have also executed attacks targeting Israel. An example is the Lebanese National Resistance Front, which was active during the early 1980s and collaborated with other groups like Hezbollah and various Palestinian factions to combat Israeli military presence in Lebanon. It is important to note that the current official position of Lebanon does not involve attacking Israel, and the Lebanese Armed Forces are generally committed to maintaining peace and stability along the border region with Israel. However, this delicate balance is often threatened by ongoing tensions between Israel and Lebanese non-state actors like Hezbollah. In conclusion, the entities that would likely carry out attacks on Israel from Lebanon include Hezbollah, Palestinian militant groups, and historically, certain Lebanese nationalist factions. Current circumstances on the ground may change, and various actors may be influenced by regional dynamics, but these groups have been the primary parties involved in attacks on Israel from Lebanese territory in recent history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Establish your total repayment.\\"","output":"Title: Understanding Your Loan: Calculating Total Repayment, Loan Terms, and Interest Introduction: Loans have become an essential part of our lives today – especially considering the rise of major financial decisions such as financing a car, paying for education, and purchasing a house. In seeking a loan, it is crucial to understand the terminologies involved, how to compute the interest, and most importantly, how to establish your total repayment. By doing so, you'll be better-equipped to ensure you have chosen the most cost-effective loan available and significantly reduce your chances of being burdened by excessive debt. In this article, we will explore how you can determine your loan's total amount, identify the loan term, calculate interest, and ultimately establish your total repayment. 1. Determine the Total Amount of Your Loan: The initial step to understanding your loan is to determine the total amount you're borrowing. This amount reflects the principal, which is the original sum borrowed. Keep in mind that lenders may also charge a variety of fees and costs that relate to the loan—such as origination fees, processing fees, and insurance fees. Ensure to ask your lender about these charges and factor them into the total loan amount. Having a comprehensive understanding of the amount you're borrowing sets a strong foundation for accurately determining the loan term, interest, and total repayment costs. 2. Find the Loan Term: After determining the total loan amount, it's time to identify the loan term, which refers to the duration of time given to fully repay the borrowed amount. The loan term length can directly affect your interest rates and monthly payments—typically, a longer loan term results in lower monthly payments but higher overall interest rates (and vice versa for short-term loans). Loan terms can range from short-term (months to a few years) to long-term (usually 15 to 30 years). The most appropriate loan term depends on your financial situation, goals, and capability to afford monthly payments. It is critical to balance the term in a manner that allows you to comfortably make payments while also avoiding excessive interest rates. 3. Calculate Your Interest: Interest is the cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage of the loan amount. There are two types of interest rates: fixed and variable. Fixed rates remain constant throughout the loan term, while variable rates may fluctuate according to the market or decisions made by the lender. To calculate the interest on a loan, you'll need three key components: the interest rate, the principal, and the loan term. You can use the following formula for calculating interest: Interest = Principal x Interest Rate x Loan Term Make sure to divide the annual interest rate by the number of payments per year (usually 12 for monthly payments) before calculating the interest. Remember to convert the loan term into the number of payments as well. When comparing loan offers, explore the various interest rates and evaluate how these rates impact the total cost of the loan. Be sure to also consider the various loan terms and decide which option best aligns with your financial situation. 4. Establish Your Total Repayment: Finally, after determining the loan amount, loan term, and interest, you can establish your total repayment. The total repayment is the entire amount you will pay the lender by the end of the loan's term, consisting of principal, interest, and any other fees or charges. To calculate your total repayment, add the interest you have calculated to the principal amount: Total Repayment = Principal + Interest Keep in mind also that loan repayments are a combination of principal and interest payments. As you make payments, your balance reduces, and you begin paying less interest while paying more towards the principal. This structure is known as an amortizing loan. Conclusion: Understanding your loan and its terms is essential in making an informed financial decision. By carefully scrutinizing loan offers, calculating interest, and identifying the best possible loan term for your financial situation, you can save money while still achieving your borrowing goals. Total repayment should factor in all costs, helping you choose an affordable and suitable loan plan according to your needs. Stay vigilant, informed, and diligent—and you will be well-equipped to navigate the world of loans successfully."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question: Question: \\"What is a helpful driver of evolution?\\"  Context: \\"Chapter I covers animal husbandry and plant breeding, going back to ancient Egypt. Darwin discusses contemporary opinions on the origins of different breeds under cultivation to argue that many have been produced from common ancestors by selective breeding. As an illustration of artificial selection, he describes fancy pigeon breeding, noting that \\"[t]he diversity of the breeds is something astonishing\\", yet all were descended from one species of rock pigeon. Darwin saw two distinct kinds of variation: (1) rare abrupt changes he called \\"sports\\" or \\"monstrosities\\" (example: ancon sheep with short legs), and (2) ubiquitous small differences (example: slightly shorter or longer bill of pigeons). Both types of hereditary changes can be used by breeders. However, for Darwin the small changes were most important in evolution.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"Artificial selection, also referred to as selective breeding, is a helpful driver of evolution. This process has played a significant role in shaping the diversity and adaptability of various species, both in the animal and plant kingdoms. Charles Darwin's observations in Chapter I of \\"On the Origin of Species\\" provide important context and support for this claim, as he discusses animal husbandry, plant breeding, and the remarkable diversity among breeds, despite their shared origins. Through careful manipulation and breeding practices, humans have been able to guide the evolutionary paths of various species, enabling the development of specific traits and characteristics that are deemed desirable or advantageous. One of the prime examples Darwin used to illustrate artificial selection is the breeding of fancy pigeons. Darwin noted the astonishing variety of breeds, all of which descended from a single species of rock pigeon. This diversity was made possible through generations of strategic breeding, selecting individual pigeons with desired traits, such as size, color, and feather type, and breeding them together to produce offspring with those specific characteristics. Over time, these cumulative changes have created numerous distinct breeds, demonstrating the power of artificial selection as a driver of evolution. In his observations, Darwin identified two types of hereditary changes that could result from breeding: (1) rare, abrupt changes, which he referred to as \\"sports\\" or \\"monstrosities,\\" and (2) ubiquitous small differences. An example of the first category is the ancon sheep, which exhibits short legs due to a rare genetic mutation. While the breeding of such animals can produce distinct and noticeable changes, Darwin believed that the small, incremental variations were most significant in shaping evolution. These small differences, such as slight variations in the shape or size of a pigeon's bill, can provide the foundation for more significant changes over generations of selective breeding. As desirable traits are identified and passed down, gradual alterations accumulate to produce more pronounced differences between breeds. Over time, these differences can become so great that new species may emerge. Artificial selection has not only allowed humans to guide the evolution of domesticated species but has also shed light on the broader mechanisms of evolution. By observing how targeted breeding can enhance specific traits and give rise to new breeds, we gain insight into how natural selection works in the wild. In nature, similar processes occur as organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their genes to future generations. In conclusion, artificial selection is a helpful driver of evolution as it allows humans to direct the development and diversification of various species. Through selective breeding, we are able to produce desired traits and characteristics in both animals and plants. This process provides an invaluable insight into the workings of natural selection and evolution, demonstrating that even small, incremental changes can have a profound cumulative effect over time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

More funds were also put towards recruitment, which had been dwindling throughout the 1980s and '90s, possibly because the Canadian populace had come to perceive the CAF as peacekeepers rather than as soldiers, as shown in a 2008 survey conducted for the Department of National Defence. The poll found that nearly two thirds of Canadians agreed with the country's participation in the invasion of Afghanistan, and that the military should be stronger, but also that the purpose of the forces should be different, such as more focused on responding to natural disasters. Then CDS, Walter Natynczyk, said later that year that while recruiting has become more successful, the CF was facing a problem with its rate of loss of existing members, which increased between 2006 and 2008 from 6% to 9.2% annually.

A soccer referee who was fatally punched by a player during a recreational game in suburban Detroit did not expect the attack, one of the player's teammates testified on Wednesday. Dr. Jamal Saleh testified during a probable-cause hearing for Bassel Saad, who is charged with second-degree murder in the death of referee John Bieniewicz. The 44-year-old referee 'did not see the punch coming,' said Saleh, who played for Saad's team during the over-30 men's league game at Mies Park in Livonia on June 29. Bieniewicz, a dialysis technician at a local hospital, had a wife and two sons. Defendant Bassel Saad sobs during a probable-cause hearing on Wednesday afternoon in Livonia, Michigan. Saad is charged with second-degree murder in the death of soccer referee John Bieniewicz. John Bieniewicz (pictured), who was punched in the head on June 29 while refereeing an adult-league soccer match in the Detroit-area, died on July 1. Two players from the opposing team also testified that Saad knocked Bieniewicz to the turf with one punch after the referee indicated he planned to eject Saad from the game. The punch, which Saleh said landed around the head and neck area, caused Bieniewicz to 'fall back without any control of his body.' Saleh said he rushed toward Bieniewicz, who was on his back grasping a yellow card in one hand and a red card in the other. In soccer, a yellow card is held aloft by the referee to caution a player following a foul or other misconduct. A red card is shown by the referee when a player is being thrown out of the game. Two yellow cards given in the same game equal a red card. Witness Scott Herkes, left, demonstrates with defense attorney Ali Hammoud how he said Bassel Saad punched soccer referee John Bieniewicz, during a court hearing on Wednesday in Livonia, Michigan. In this case, the players testified that Saad had been issued a yellow card following a foul in the first half, and Bieniewicz was giving him a second yellow for being verbally abusive. That's when he was struck, the three players said. A skirmish erupted between players following the attack. Saleh said he quickly checked on Bieniewicz and the referee initially was not breathing but had a pulse. Saleh said he performed CPR and told the unconscious Bieniewicz: 'Wake up, buddy. You're going to be OK.' Player Scott Herkes testified that Saad removed his jersey and left the field with another man as Bieniewicz was being tended to. Herkes said he followed the men into the parking lot and took down the license plate number of the vehicle in which they left. Prosecutors showed a photograph in which Saad appeared to be making an obscene gesture while seated in the vehicle. A man who was punched in the head on June 29 while refereeing an adult-league soccer match in the Detroit-area has died. John Bieniewicz, who was attacked on Sunday at a park in Livonia, Michigan died at Detroit Receiving Hospital on Tuesday, said hospital spokesman Alton Gunn. Saad, a 36-year-old auto mechanic from Dearborn, had been charged with assault with intent to do great bodily harm before Bieniewicz died on July 1. That charge was formally dropped, and prosecutors issued the murder charge. The probable-cause hearing in Livonia District Court, which will determine whether to send the case to trial, resumed today. It ended with Judge Kathleen McCann denying prosecutors' motion to bring up an alleged 2005 incident in which Saad is said to have been involved in an altercation with another player at a soccer game. Defense lawyer Ali Hammoud said his client's past has nothing to do with this case, and prosecutors' interest in bringing it up shows that 'their case is extremely weak on second-degree murder.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"A soccer referee named John was working at a game when a player named Bassel got angry and punched him very hard.

Keith needed to know pros and cons of both designs.  Would case B take less or more time for the force to act than case A? Answer:","output":"In Keith's observations, he labeled two types of car seat designs: Case A: Car seats without padding Case B: Car seats with padding To determine if Case B (car seats with padding) would take less or more time for the force to act than Case A (car seats without padding), we need to understand the role of padding in a car seat. Padding in car seats serves several purposes: 1. Comfort: Provides a comfortable seating surface for the occupant. 2. Shock absorption: Reduces the impact of forces acting on the occupant during incidents such as accidents or sudden stops. 3. Force distribution: Spreads the forces acting on the occupant's body over a larger area, reducing localized pressure and potential injuries. Now, let us analyze the time it takes for the force to act on both types of car seats during an impact: In Case A (car seats without padding), the force from the impact will be transferred to the occupant more directly and rapidly since there's no cushioning to act as a barrier. This means that in an impact, forces will act on the occupant quicker in case A compared to case B. In Case B (car seats with padding), the padding provides an additional layer that can absorb and redistribute the force from the impact. This will take more time as the force must first compress the padding before reaching the occupant. Therefore, the time for the force to act on the occupant in Case B is longer than in Case A. In conclusion, Case B (car seats with padding) would take more time for the force to act on the occupant than Case A (car seats without padding). This extra time can contribute to a reduced risk of injuries sustained during impacts, providing increased safety and comfort for the user."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The United Kingdom, one of the very few stable nations with a functioning government, is deluged by asylum seekers fleeing the chaos and war which have taken hold around the world. In response, the UK has become a militarized police state as British government forces round up and detain immigrants. Theo Faron, a former activist turned cynical bureaucrat, is kidnapped by the Fishes, a militant immigrants' rights group. They are led by Theo's estranged wife, Julian Taylor, from whom he separated after their son Dylan's death during a 2008 flu pandemic. Julian offers Theo money to acquire transit papers for a young refugee named Kee, which Theo obtains from his cousin Nigel, a government minister who runs a state-sponsored collection of salvaged art from around the world. The transit papers require that the bearer must be accompanied, so Theo agrees to escort Kee in exchange for a large sum. Luke, a Fishes member, drives them and former midwife Miriam towards the coast to a boat. They are ambushed by an armed gang, and Julian is killed. Luke kills two police officers who stop their car, and they bury Julian in the forest as Theo breaks down crying over her death, as the group ditches their car for another to escape to a Fishes safe house. Kee reveals to Theo that she is pregnant, as Julian had told her to trust only Theo. Julian had intended to hand Kee to the \\"Human Project\\", a supposed scientific group in the Azores dedicated to curing infertility; however, Luke persuades Kee to stay, and he is later voted as the new leader of the Fishes.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that released Off the Wall? , can you please find it?   Jackson explored genres including pop, soul, rhythm and blues, funk, rock, disco, post-disco, dance-pop and new jack swing. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. Its tracks included the ballads \\"The Lady in My Life\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", the funk pieces \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and the disco set \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\".With Off the Wall, Jackson's \\"vocabulary of grunts, squeals, hiccups, moans, and asides\\" vividly showed the singer's maturation into an adult, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \\"oddball\\" music personas: \\"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\\" With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\". In \\"Billie Jean\\", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child, and in \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" he argues against gossip and the media. \\"Beat It\\" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey. He also observed that the title track \\"Thriller\\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years. In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity anthem \\"We Are the World\\"; humanitarian themes later became a recurring theme in his lyrics and public persona.

Question: \\"Where did the Japanese word for Zen come from?\\"  Context: \\"Zen Buddhism (禅), pronounced Chán in Chinese, seon in Korean or zen in Japanese (derived from the Sanskrit term dhyāna, meaning \\"meditation\\") is a form of Buddhism that became popular in China, Korea and Japan and that lays special emphasis on meditation.[note 12] Zen places less emphasis on scriptures than some other forms of Buddhism and prefers to focus on direct spiritual breakthroughs to truth.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"The Japanese word for Zen (禅) actually originated from the Chinese word Chán (禪), which in turn was derived from the Sanskrit term dhyāna, meaning \\"meditation.\\" Zen Buddhism emphasizes meditation as a crucial aspect of the spiritual journey, and it became popular in China, Korea, and Japan. The transmission of Zen from India to China occurred when the Indian monk Bodhidharma traveled to China in the late 5th or early 6th century. His teachings evolved and merged with Chinese thought, forming the basis of Chán Buddhism. Later, Chán Buddhism was transmitted to Korea and Japan, where it is known as Seon and Zen, respectively. In essence, Zen is a form of Buddhism that focuses on direct spiritual breakthroughs to truth rather than relying heavily on scriptures. While it values the teachings found in Buddhist texts, Zen emphasizes personal experiences, meditation, and moment-to-moment awareness. This transmission of ideas through the adaptation of words from different languages highlights the international and fluid nature of Buddhist thought."},{"instruction":"Q:Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: It may sound a little counterproductive to dwell on your stress in a journal, but it's actually healthy if you learn to deal with stress. Keep a journal with you at all times and write in it whenever you feel stressed. In your journal, jot down:  What caused the stress (if you're unsure, take an educated guess). How you felt/feel, either physically or emotionally. How you responded to the stress immediately. What you did in order to make the stress go away. Being in a stressful situation can make you feel like you're alone on an island. Luckily, you're not. Sharing your thoughts and feelings with other people, whether they are friends, family, co-workers, or acquaintances, can make you feel like a burden has been lifted from your shoulders. Sharing your thoughts may make you feel vulnerable, but vulnerability can be a good thing. It helps you open up, which can make you feel more honest and less closed up. When your body is running low on fuel, or is only running on the wrong kind of fuel, it's hard to muster up energy to fight stress. During this time, stress can seem particularly frightening and be particularly exhausting. Therefore, it's important to get a healthy diet of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, fiber, and healthy fats. Here are the foods you should generally try to avoid in order to reduce the effects of stress:  High-fat foods. Foods high in trans and saturated fats, like butter, certain cheeses, and fast foods, can sap our energy while increasing our risk of heart attack. Not a good way to fight stress. Simple carbohydrates. Carbs like white bread, white rice, and baked goods (cakes, muffins, etc.) are processed quickly by the body and stored as fat. Better to stick with complex carbohydrates instead — foods like whole wheat bread and pasta, as well as brown rice. Sugar. Sugars are simple carbs which enter and leave the body quickly, meaning they give us a quick jolt and then cause us to crash. This crashing can contribute to a sense of anxiety or stress. Caffeine. We supplement much of our diet with caffeine from coffee, tea, soda, and energy drinks. Like sugar, caffeine can cause us to crash if the body experiences a sudden drop-off. Having too much caffeine can also impair the body's natural sleep cycle. Stress and inadequate sleep can form a vicious cycle. On the one hand, a survey said that 2/3 of subjects associated their sleep problems with stress. On the other hand, another study found that for each hour of sleep you lose during the night, your risk of stress increases 14%. In other words, stress causes sleeplessness, and lack of sleep causes stress. It's okay to reward yourself when you manage to do something stressful. This gives us an incentive to work through difficult situations in order to do what we know is right. But don't rely on incentives in order to get you through stressful times. It can be unhealthy to always need an incentive. Sometimes you buckle down and do something because you want to do it or you know you should do it. Actively solicit the advice of others and entertain their ideas. You never know when another perspective will really hit home. Asking for help may mean putting aside your ego, but it's worth it. People are generally keen on lending a helping hand. (It makes them feel good about themselves.) Learn take advantage of that largesse. In some cases, chronic stress takes hold and doesn't let go. It can lead to anxiety and depression, which spawn a host of other problems. These need to be dealt with promptly in order to make sure stress levels don't hit an unbearable level.  If you feel like your stress is causing you to undergo significant lifestyle changes or is keeping you from doing things you would otherwise do, seek out the help of a professional.  If you feel like your stress is causing you to self-medicate with drugs and/or alcohol, seek out the help of a professional.

Eating healthy foods can give us energy to fight stress, while avoiding high-fat foods, simple carbs, sugar, and too much caffeine. Getting enough sleep is important too since stress can cause lack of sleep, and not sleeping enough can make us more stressed.

Not at all, No, Maybe, Yes, or Definitely? A:","output":"Based on the review provided: \\"Excellent camera App I just wish that my mobile supported the extra features that are available such as manual mode,\\" I would recommend this app to a friend with a strong \\"Yes.\\" The primary reason for recommending this app is the reviewer's positive experience, indicating it to be an excellent camera app. This signifies that the app has great functionality, features, ease of use, and user satisfaction. However, the reviewer also expressed a desire for their mobile device to support additional features, such as manual mode, which suggests that the app might offer a range of advanced options not available on all devices. This could imply that users with modern or higher-end phones can potentially take full advantage of the app's sophisticated features, turning the camera app into a valuable tool for photography enthusiasts, social media aficionados, or anyone interested in enhancing their mobile photography experience. That said, it would be essential to consider the specific needs and preferences of the friend you plan to recommend the app to, as well as the compatibility of their mobile device, before making the recommendation. If your friend has a compatible mobile device that can utilize the advanced features of the app and is keen on mobile photography, the app would be a definite recommendation. For friends who may not have the latest phone or have more basic photography needs, you could still suggest the app to them given its excellent quality, but they may not benefit from all the available features. In these cases, the recommendation would still stand as a strong \\"Yes\\" but with the caveat that they might not enjoy the full range of features the app has to offer. In conclusion, the review suggests that the camera app is of high quality, and the additional features make it even more appealing for those with compatible devices. Thus, recommending it to a friend with a strong \\"Yes\\" is a suitable course of action, provided you take the compatibility and preferences of your friend into account."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: A Battery's Nightmare Portable electronics that can be carried about easily are only as good as their batteries   and, let's face it, batteries aren't very good, especially when compared with, say, petrol, which packs 100 times a battery's energy into an equal space. That's why a large group of mechanical engineers (centered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but with partners at other universities and companies) are hard at work in an effort to replace batteries with a tiny engine that runs on fuel. Imagine a battery-free life! When the fuel runs out in your mobile phone, you just fill up and go. The engine---about the size of a ten-cent coin---starts with a combustion chamber   that burns hydrogen. Its tiny parts are etched   onto silicon wafers   in the same manner that computer parts are etched onto integrated circuits  . The first engine is made up of five wafers. And since these wafers could be produced in much the same way as computer chips, they could probably be produced quite cheaply. But the _ in all this nice detail is efficiency. Tiny engine parts don't always behave like the bigger parts of the first engine. Something between the parts can slow down the works, according to Columbia University Professor LucFrechette, one of the engine's designers. Extreme heat from the combustion chamber is also a problem, often leaking to other parts of the engine. The scientists' goal is to create an engine that will operate 10 times better than batteries operate. Frechette says that a complete system, with all parts in place and working, will be set up in the next couple of years, but commercial models aren't likely until at least the end of the next ten years. According to the passage, the title suggests that   _   . A) batteries should be greatly improved B) petrol will be used instead of batteries C) the time of batteries will be gone forever D) pollution problems caused by batteries must be solved Answer:","output":"C) the time of batteries will be gone forever"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: What is the full name of the wife of the man Sue is involved with?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Sue Fleming's suitcase opens by accident, dropping her clothes from a double-decker bus onto Norman Winthrop. She retrieves her belongings and enters the New York City bus terminal. Intrigued, he follows her and returns a garter belt she overlooked. Steve Borden, the man she is involved with, calls her on the phone (though he is also in the terminal) and tells her to buy a ticket to San Francisco. Afterward, she sees him with another woman. They board the bus too. Norman, who is supposed to go to San Francisco by train, decides to travel by bus instead. Murphy has orders from Norman's father to keep him away from women. To Murphy's satisfaction, Sue rebuffs Norman's initial attempts to become better acquainted. May gives all her money to a friend, but manages to charm the bus driver, various relief drivers and Willy, a talkative, know-it-all passenger, into letting her ride for free. When the bus stops in Poughkeepsie, Steve and Nita Borden prove to be con artists, selling bibles at inflated prices to those who have lost loved ones recently, claiming they were specially ordered by the deceased. Nita, suspecting what is going on, later chats with Sue and introduces her husband, Steve. A disgusted Sue breaks up with Steve. She then makes a date with the persistent Norman at Niagara Falls. While Norman is getting ready, Murphy steals his clothes, but Norman goes with Sue to see the Falls wearing a raincoat provided by the tour company. When a tour employee demands the raincoat, Norman is shown to have only a bath towel on underneath. Norman arranges a candle-lit dinner for two in Chicago, but Murphy invites all the other passengers. When the bus later has engine trouble, the passengers go to a nearby carnival, where Norman challenges Sue to a bow and arrow contest; the prize, if he wins, is a kiss, but she proves to be a much better shot. Later, though, Sue finally lets him kiss her. Answer:","output":"Based on the given context, the full name of the wife of the man Sue is involved with is Nita Borden.

Write an article based on this summary: – An elderly alum of Boy Meets World foiled an intruder Saturday night, illuminating the suspect both literally and (hopefully) metaphorically. Entertainment Weekly reports that William Daniels, 91, who played Mr. Feeny on the hit sitcom, was at the San Fernando Valley, Calif., home he shares with his wife, 89-year-old actress Bonnie Bartlett, when someone tried to break in through the back door. KABC notes Daniels had a quick reaction that scared the suspect away: He turned on the lights. \\"Luckily, Mr. Daniels was able to frighten away the person and the LAPD quickly responded,\\" the actor's rep said in a statement, per USA Today, adding that both Daniels and his wife are OK. Police don't think they were specifically targeted. Daniels' BMW co-star Will Friedle had just one thing to say on Twitter about his former colleague's crime-busting skills: \\"Don't ever mess with Mr. Feeny!\\" (\\"Topanga\\" took issue with comments on her weight after her wedding.) Article:","output":"Once upon a time, there was a very kind and smart man named William Daniels. He used to act as Mr. Feeny on a popular TV show called \\"Boy Meets World.\\" Now, Mr. Daniels is 91 years old and lives in a house in San Fernando Valley, California, with his lovely wife, Bonnie Bartlett, who is 89 years old and also acts. One night, when Mr. Daniels and Mrs. Bartlett were at home, a not-so-nice person tried to sneak into their house through the back door. But Mr. Daniels was very clever and thought quickly. He turned on the lights to show the intruder that someone was at home. By turning on the lights, Mr. Daniels scared the unwelcome visitor away. The police officers, who protect and help everyone, arrived really fast to make sure everything was okay. Thankfully, Mr. Daniels, and his wife, Mrs. Bartlett, were both safe and sound. The police don't think the bad person had planned to target them specifically. Mr. Daniels' friend, Will Friedle, who acted with him in \\"Boy Meets World,\\" heard about what happened and praised him on Twitter, saying, \\"Don't ever mess with Mr. Feeny!\\" So, the moral of the story is, it's good to be wise and think fast in times of trouble, just like Mr. Daniels did when turning on the lights to scare away the intruder."},{"instruction":"Question: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil.

Translate to English","output":"Mr. Chou had no chance of getting a promotion with a comment like that. In this situation, it seems that someone named Mr. Chou, a professional in his field, made a comment that has negatively impacted his chances of receiving a promotion in his workplace. Comments and actions at work can be scrutinized by supervisors and co-workers, and sometimes even the smallest misstep can lead to consequences that an individual might not initially anticipate. In a professional environment, it is crucial to maintain appropriate behavior and communication that is in line with the expectations and culture of the workplace. This often includes avoiding controversial topics, refraining from using inappropriate language, and being mindful of the feelings and perspectives of colleagues. Situations like Mr. Chou's can serve as a learning opportunity for others, as it underscores the importance of self-awareness and good judgment in the workplace. Moreover, various factors come into play when it comes to promotions, such as work performance, attitude, and communication skills. A single negative event or comment, like the one in this case, could potentially overshadow a person's achievements and hard work. To recover from a setback in the professional space, an individual may consider openly apologizing and acknowledging the error, if appropriate, and working diligently to rebuild their reputation. This could involve consistently demonstrating exceptional performance, being proactive in supporting teammates, and contributing positively to workplace culture. Furthermore, it is crucial for Mr. Chou to learn from this experience and consider how he can improve his communication and decision-making skills. This may involve seeking guidance from a mentor, considering professional development opportunities, or even engaging in self-reflection on a regular basis. In summary, Mr. Chou's situation serves as a reminder that even the tiniest remark can significantly impact one's professional life, and thus, our actions and words must be carefully chosen in the workplace. Should a misstep lead to consequences, it remains crucial for individuals to learn from their errors, improve, and continue to grow in their professional journey."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: (a). because he was dirty and snotty,; (b). not enough information; (c). because he wore old clothes; (d). because he liked his shadow,; It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

Is \\"Libération also reported that it had been accused of bias by the Chinese media.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What other newspaper was accused of bias?\\"","output":"Although the statement \\"Libération also reported that it had been accused of bias by the Chinese media\\" implies that there is another newspaper besides Libération that was accused of bias, it doesn't provide a comprehensive answer to the question \\"What other newspaper was accused of bias?\\". To produce a detailed and long answer, more context and information is needed. Here's an example of a more elaborate response: The question seeks to know which additional newspapers have faced accusations of bias. One such example, as mentioned in the statement, is the French newspaper Libération. Libération has reported that it was accused of bias by the Chinese media. To understand the context of this accusation, it's crucial to consider the reporting and portrayal of certain events, such as international relations, politics, or cultural aspects that might have led to the claims of bias. However, Libération is not the only newspaper to have been accused of bias in various instances throughout history. Many newspapers and media outlets around the world have faced similar accusations at times, depending on their editorial stances, ideologies, or ownership. Some noteworthy examples include: 1. The New York Times: The prominent US-based newspaper has often been accused of having a liberal bias in its news content and editorial decisions, especially by conservative-leaning critics and publications. 2. Fox News: On the other side of the spectrum, Fox News, a cable news channel, has been accused of conservative bias in its reporting and analysis by liberal-leaning critics. 3. The Guardian: Based in the United Kingdom, this newspaper has faced accusations of left-leaning bias in its coverage of news events and political commentary. 4. The Daily Mail: Also based in the United Kingdom, this tabloid-style newspaper has been criticized for right-wing bias in its portrayal of news events and opinions. It's important to note that identifying bias in media can often be a subjective process, as it may involve interpreting the intentions behind reporting, selection of news stories, or representation of facts. Nonetheless, keeping an eye out for potential biases in news sources is crucial to maintaining a well-rounded understanding of current events and fostering critical thinking. In conclusion, while the statement about Libération being accused of bias does address the question partially, a thorough answer should encompass a wider range of newspapers including their origins, the nature of the accusations, and the context in which these accusations were made. This broader perspective helps to clarify the answer and provide a richer understanding of media bias in general."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, another new U2 song, the single \\"Invisible\\", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS.

Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).The uneven solar heating (the formation of zones of temperature and moisture gradients, or frontogenesis) can also be due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation.  Higher altitudes are typically cooler than lower altitudes, which the result of higher surface temperature and radiational heating, which produces the adiabatic lapse rate. In some situations, the temperature actually increases with height. This phenomenon is known as an inversion and can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below. Inversions can lead to the formation of fog and often act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development. On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or man-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content.  Dee and Ann were two cousins. Ann lived in a mountain village at 8000 ft altitude, while Dee lived in a coastal town at sea level.

Step 1: Consider the effect of temperature inversions - Mountains typically exhibit a higher likelihood of temperature inversions, which can act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development. In Ann's mountain village, there could be a higher chance of experiencing inversions, leading to a reduced occurrence of thunderstorms. Step 2: Consider the effect of moisture content - Thunderstorms require moisture for their formation, as warm, moist air rises and cools, condensing into clouds. Coastal towns tend to have a relatively higher humidity level due to their proximity to the ocean. Dee's coastal town would generally have more moist air, which would increase the likelihood of thunderstorm formation. Based on these considerations, it is likely that Dee, living in the coastal town at sea level, experiences more thunderstorms than Ann, who lives in the mountain village at 8000 ft altitude. The increased moisture content in the coastal town, combined with the reduced likelihood of temperature inversions suppressing thunderstorm development, would contribute to a higher number of thunderstorms in Dee's location."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He changes when he meets winsome Gracie Williams (Joan Leslie), and works night and day at strenuous odd jobs to accumulate the payment for a certain good farm so she'll marry him. On the very day payment is due, he wins the final needed amount at a target-shooting contest, but on being told that the farm has just been sold to his romantic rival, he returns to his dissolute ways. Late that night, he is struck by lightning during a rainstorm while en route to attack the man who had cheated him. Finding himself outside the meeting house where a revival is going, he goes in and undergoes a religious awakening and vows never to get angry at anyone ever again. He makes amends with the men who cheated him out of the land, and tries to with Gracie. When the U.S. declares war in World War I, York tries to avoid induction into the Army as a conscientious objector because of his religious beliefs, but is drafted nonetheless. His status as a conscientious objector is rejected since his church has no official standing, and he reluctantly reports to Camp Gordon for basic training. His superiors discover that he is a phenomenal marksman and decide to promote him to corporal. York still wants nothing to do with the Army and killing. Major Buxton (Stanley Ridges), his sympathetic commanding officer, tries to change York's mind, citing sacrifices made by others all throughout the history of the United States. He gives York a leave to go home and think it over. He promises York a recommendation for his exemption as a conscientious objector if York remains unconvinced.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Have you ever imagined what human beings will look like in the future? Well, now you don't have to. According to AsapScience, a Canada-based video channel that touches on many different science topics, humans will be very different creatures 1,000 years from now. Artificial intelligence, genetic engineering and climate change will work together to change our bodies greatly, according to a video recently published by the channel. We could, for instance, develop red eyes as our DNA changes, and have darker skin because of global warming. The video painted a picture of a future world in which our bodies are part human, part machine. Nanobots, or tiny robots, will be put into our bodies, improving our abilities. \\"No longer will we be limited by our own physiology. We will truly become a mixture of biology and machine on the inside,\\" says the video. Meanwhile, designer babies will cause future generations to grow into intelligent, attractive people. As global warming takes hold, humans will also be skinnier and taller, as this body shape deals with heat better. In fact, Cadell Last, a researcher at the Global Brain Institute located in Belgium, believes change may happen even faster than this. As he said in a paper recently published in Current Aging Science, mankind is already going through a major evolutionary change. In less than four decades, Last claims, we will live longer, have children in old age and need artificial intelligence to finish daily tasks. \\"Your 80 or 100 is going to be so radically different than your grandparents,\\" Last said. Instead of living fast and dying young, he believes humans will live slow and die old. \\"The biological clock isn't going to be around forever,\\" he added, and said that people could pause it for some time using future technology. Just a few hundred years ago, most humans were working in the fields, while nowadays more and more are getting an education.

On Christmas Eve, the submarine USS Copperfin, under the command of Captain Cassidy, departs San Francisco on a secret mission. At sea, Cassidy opens his sealed orders, which direct him to proceed first to the Aleutian Islands to pick up meteorologist Lt. Raymond, then to Tokyo Bay to obtain vital weather intelligence for the upcoming Doolittle Raid. On the way, two Japanese planes attack; both are shot down, but one pilot manages to parachute into the water. When Mike goes to pick him up, he is stabbed to death. New recruit Tommy Adams shoots the pilot, but because he was slow to react, Tommy blames himself for Mike's death and volunteers to defuse an unexploded bomb stuck under the deck. When Mike is buried at sea, Greek-American \\"Tin Can\\" (Dane Clark) does not attend the service, which angers the other men until he explains that every Allied death causes him great pain.  Meanwhile, Raymond, who lived in Japan, discusses how the Japanese people were led into the war by the military faction. As the submarine nears Tokyo Bay, the Copperfin has to negotiate its way through protective minefields and anti-torpedo nets. When a Japanese ship enters the bay, Cassidy follows in its wake. That night, a small party, including the ship's womanizer, \\"Wolf\\" (John Garfield), goes ashore to make weather observations. Meanwhile, Tommy is diagnosed with  appendicitis. \\"Pills\\", the pharmacist's mate, has to operate following instructions from a book, using improvised instruments, and without sufficient ether to last throughout the procedure.  The operation is a success, and \\"Cookie\\" Wainwright begins to prepare the pumpkin pie he had promised to bake for Tommy.

Look for bird food that has high quality seeds that are hulled and bound together with supplements that contain vitamins and minerals, such as pellet foods. The average lovebird should have 2-3 teaspoons of pellet or seed based bird food a day.  You can also give your bird seed mixes. But keep in mind loose seed mix allows your lovebird to pick and choose what seeds it eats. Nutri-berries, Avi-cakes, and Pellet-berries require your lovebird to work to pry off a piece, so your bird is more likely to get a variety of seeds.  Look for seed mixes from your local pet store that contain canary seed, millet, rice, oats, safflower and a small amount of sunflower seeds. Corn is often a big hit with lovebirds, as well as sprouted seed. Pellet foods and seed mixes should be given to your bird on a daily basis, but should not be the only food you give your bird as they do not provide proper nutrition. About 5-10% of your bird’s diet should be bite-sized fruits and vegetables. Give your bird healthy fruits like apples, grapes, berries, papaya, and mango. You should also feed your bird vegetables like carrots, broccoli, zucchini, squash, cooked sweet potatoes, and dark leafy greens like kale and romaine. These include cooked whole grains, like brown rice, whole grain pasta, multigrain breads, and sugar free cereals. When you feed your bird fresh foods, make sure you remove anything in their cage that is uneaten so the food does not spoil. You should also wash the bowls in their cage before using them again. It’s fine if your lovebird shares many of the foods you eat. But limit her consumption of fried, greasy, sugary, and salty foods so she stays healthy. Do not give your bird tap water or unfiltered water. Most cages come with a water attachment so your bird has access to water all the time. These substances can kill your lovebird, even in small amounts. You should also avoid giving your bird avocados, rhubarb, asparagus, onions, raw legumes like beans and peas, and dairy products.","output":"To feed your lovebird, look at the picture on the bird food label to find the right size.

Kansas City, Missouri, may not have access to the ocean, but for local resident Georgianna Reid, every day is a beach day. After three decades spent mowing and watering the lawn around her house on East Meyer Drive, the elderly resident decided to draw a line in the sand, literally, by replacing the greenery with grit. ‘I would say I'm putting in the largest litter box in the world,' said Ms Reid of her unusual approach to landscaping.

Burying her head in the sand: Georgiana Reid does not care that some of her neighbors think her property has become an eyesore. Fast-forward to 2014, the woman has turned the land in front of her home into a giant sandbox with outdoor furniture off to one side and garden sculptures of gnomes for decoration. To execute her design, Ms Reid spent around 4,000 to cart in 80 tons of sand, which she then enclosed with a small fence. Reid used to have an oversize chess set in the yard and a volleyball net, but someone had stolen them. Not everyone has embraced the desert-like front yard. Some of the homeowner's neighbors expressed concern that Reid's sandbox has become an eyesore, which could lower their property values. 'I think the house looks revolting with all that is out there,' neighbor Edwin Bisby told the station KCTV.

Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€. It’s a nice cool 14°C (57°F) down there, a lovely break from the hot summer weather above. It is damp in places and the ground can be slippery so watch your step as you walk.

Julia Stafford, 20, a University of British Columbia student, smartly played dead after the bear knocked her - and a male colleague - over and on to the ground. Attacked: Julia Stafford was working for a Canadian mining company in Alaska when she - and a male colleague - were attacked by a grizzly bear. 'It bit my hand and kind of dragged me 20 feet over the rocks and just left me,' Stafford told The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner from her hospital bed while ironically holding - you guessed it - a teddy bear. 'I was worried I was going to die briefly, but it was fine once she let me go and ran away...It happened really quick.' The hair-raising encounter reportedly occurred about 1:30 p.m. Sunday afternoon - just two days after another grizzly bear ate a hiker in Denali National Park and Preserve. Dangerous Encounter: Stafford was reportedly dragged some 20 feet by the beast after it knocked her over - and then just as suddenly meandered away. It happened when Stafford and Kerry - his last name was not available - were collecting rock samples in the rain near a foggy ravine for Pure Nickel Inc., a Canadian company. 'The bear sort of walked out of the fog and it had two cubs with it,' Stafford told the News-Miner. 'We started walking uphill to get away from it and it started walking toward us. 'We stopped once we saw it was following us and tried to get the bear spray out but by then it was already running toward us. Striking Twice: The attack on Stafford and her colleague came only two days after hiker Richard White of San Diego was eaten by a bear in Denali National Park and Preserve. 'I was wearing gloves and they were wet and it was confusing,' she reportedly added. 'There was just not enough time to get the bear spray out.' Stafford, a geological engineering student, suffered cuts to her right hand and scratch marks on her back that required stitches. She told the News-Miner she will need surgery for a broken bone in her hand, as well. The attack happened two days after a lone backpacker in Denali  was killed by another grizzly bear that has since been fatally shot by an Alaskan state trooper. It was the first fatal bear mauling in the park's 95-year history, officials have said. Richard White, 49, of San Diego was killed after he brazenly violated the quarter-mile berth that hikers at the park are required to give bears.

It is important to consider various factors that could have potentially influenced Kidman's decision to be a part of the play. For example: 1. Artistic challenge: Kidman might have been drawn to the opportunity of portraying multiple characters in a single play, pushing her versatility as an actress. 2. Stage experience: As an accomplished film actress, Kidman may have wanted to expand her range and gain additional experience on the stage, allowing her to further develop as a performer. 3. Personal interest: Kidman could have been genuinely interested in the subject matter and historical significance of \\"La Ronde.\\" As an actress, she may have been intrigued by the story's exploration of relationships and sexuality through different societal lenses. 4. Collaboration with co-star and director: The chance to work with a talented co-star like Iain Glen and a skilled director could have been an enticing factor in Kidman's decision to participate in the play. 5. Potential for controversy: Although the play may no longer be considered as daring as it once was, controversy can still draw attention and generate conversation. It is possible that Kidman was aware of potential controversies surrounding the play and considered this as a factor, albeit not the sole reason for her involvement. In conclusion, based solely on the premise provided, we cannot definitively say that Nicole Kidman agreed to appear in \\"La Ronde\\" with the sole intention of generating publicity through a banned movie. There are multiple factors that could have contributed to her decision, and any claim about her motivations would be speculative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In other words, it represents the position, role, or prestige that an individual or object holds within a certain framework. This can include career progression, peer recognition, social authority, or achieved milestones, among other factors. 2. \\"Achieved\\": Achieving means attaining success, realizing a goal, or accomplishing a task that required effort, dedication, and perseverance. It signifies that you have put in the necessary work and surmounted challenges, resulting in a favorable outcome or transformation. In essence, achieving something means that you have reached it, accomplished it, or made it happen intentionally and purposefully. 3. \\"Reached\\": The word \\"reached\\" in this context refers to arriving at or attaining a specific point or conclusion. It suggests a sense of accomplishment, as well as indicating that a particular objective was targeted, approached, and eventually obtained. This term conveys growth and evolution in the journey from one point to another, establishing the individual in their new space or situation. 4. \\"New status\\": This phrase represents a change in your previous status - something fresh, different, or elevated. A person or entity experiences growth and ascends to a new level, thereby expanding their position or role within the given context.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Every autumn, as families across the United States get ready to send their kids to college, the economics of higher education receive renewed attention. College is expensive and becoming more so in the U. S. The situation raises two questions: Why does it cost so much, and how can students and their families afford it? Several studies published in the past few weeks reflect on these questions. The findings provide comfort to poor families. First, it appears that only the minority actually pay the \\"high price\\". A study by the US Education Department's National Center for Education Statistics found that 55 percent of college students last year received some forms of help--scholarships, loans or jobs. Other factors are also at work. The government has increased the size of its grants  to lower-income students. Grants, unlike loans, don't have to he repaid and are awarded only to college students who have not earned a bachelor's or professional degree. At the same time, most colleges are spending more on undergraduate education than they are collecting in tuition fees. A study, which is part of the Williams College Project on the Economics of Higher Education, reaches the conclusion that on average colleges \\"subsidize  \\" their students. The results of these studies, however, leave unanswered the questions of whether educational costs are higher than they need to be. Some experts argue that much of the college cost results from educational competition for fame, students and facilities. This puts upward pressure on tuition, hut many colleges feel that good fame will enable them to attract students even if they charge them more. Therefore, until something important changes in the marketplace, costs seem likely to continue rising. And American families will continue to beat down the doors of the high price \\"college in the end.

Anarchy 99 has a biochemical weapon named \\"Silent Night,\\" missing since the fall of the Soviet Union, and NSA Agent Augustus Gibbons believes the only way to get close is to recruit an agent that would not have any ties to the United States government. He selects Xander Cage, also known as X, an extreme sports professional and host of his own television show, who was recently captured by the FBI for stealing and destroying a prominent California senator's car as an act of protest. Gibbons puts Cage through two testsÂ â stopping a staged diner robbery and escaping from a drug cartel's plantation in ColombiaÂ â and offers Cage the mission. Cage reluctantly agrees when Gibbons offers to wipe his criminal record. Cage goes to Prague and meets with the NSA support team including Czech agent Milan Sova. While scouting an Anarchy 99 party, Cage purposely reveals Sova's cover, which allows him to gain the confidence of Anarchy 99's leader, Yorgi. Through Yorgi's brother Kolya, who is a fan of Cage's show, Cage gains critical information on the military background of Anarchy 99's members. Cage is attending a car deal with Yorgi at his invitation when Sova shows up and starts a firefight. Cage shoots Sova with a fake blood-splatter round to make it look like he is dead, which causes Yorgi to fully accept Cage as a member of Anarchy 99. Cage returns with Yorgi to their headquarters, a castle outside of the city, where he meets Yorgi's girlfriend Yelena. Cage finds Yelena trying to break into Yorgi's safe and tells her he is an American agent. Yelena gets a call from Kirill, a sniper working for Yorgi, who reveals they know of Cage's true identity before he starts firing on them.

While silicone works best on fresh scars, it can also soften and reduce the appearance of older scars. For the best results, cover your scar with silicone gel or a silicone sheet for 8-24 hours a day over the course of several months. You can buy silicone gel or silicone scar sheets at most pharmacies. You can also order these treatments online. A variety of over-the-counter creams and ointments are available on the market that may be able to help reduce the appearance of scars. Follow the ingredients on the packaging carefully and talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns. Look for ointments that include ingredients such as:  Retinol creams. These are particularly effective for treating acne scars.  Glycolic acid. This ingredient has also been shown to be effective for reducing acne scars, especially when combined with retinoic acid.  Protective or moisturizing ingredients, such as oxybenzone (a sunblock), petroleum jelly, or paraffin. Chemical peels can be helpful for scars that are not too thick or deep, such as acne scars or chicken pox scars. Ask your doctor or dermatologist about getting a medical peel done in their office. You can also buy over-the-counter peels that you can use at home.  Over-the-counter peels are not usually as effective as peels done by a medical professional, but they may help reduce the appearance of light scaring. Peels containing glycolic acid or salicylic-mandelic acid may be particularly effective. If you have a deep or indented scar, a soft-tissue filler may help reduce its appearance. For this treatment, your doctor or dermatologist will inject a soft substance, such as fat or hyaluronic acid, into the tissue under the scar to fill it in. Talk to your doctor about whether this treatment might be right for you. Fillers are a temporary solution since the injected substance breaks down after a while. You may need to repeat this treatment once every 6 months. Much like chemical peels, dermabrasion is typically used to give skin a smoother surface. This treatment involves the use of a motorized wire brush. Your surgeon will use the brush to safely wear down scar tissue. The procedure is typically quick, but you will be awake and may experience some discomfort.  Your doctor may ask you to stop taking certain medications, such as aspirin and some skin care products, before the procedure. You should also avoid smoking for as long as possible both before and after the procedure. As you recover from dermabrasion, protect your skin by wearing sunscreen, cleaning the area regularly, and using ointments as recommended by your doctor to promote healing. While laser treatments can’t actually get rid of a scar, they can seriously reduce its appearance and improve other complications associated with scar tissue, such as pain, itching, and stiffness. If you have a severe scar, ask your doctor about getting light or laser therapy.  The effectiveness of this treatment will depend on a lot of factors, including any medical conditions you have and any medications you are currently taking. Give your doctor or dermatologist detailed information about your health before attempting laser therapy. Follow your doctor’s home care instructions carefully to maximize the effectiveness of the treatment. For example, you’ll need to protect the area from the sun after the treatment until it fully heals. If you have a bothersome scar and other treatments aren’t working, talk to your doctor about surgical treatment options. With surgery, scars can be thinned, shortened, disguised, or even hidden in places like wrinkles and hairlines.  If you choose to get surgical revision for a scar, it’s important to keep your expectations realistic. This treatment may not completely eliminate the scar, and you may also need multiple procedures in order to get the best results. Not all scars are good candidates for surgical correction. Ask your doctor, dermatologist, or plastic surgeon if this treatment is a good option for you. Scar revision surgery works best on scars that are at least 12-18 months old. In this procedure, your surgeon will take a small piece of normal, healthy skin and use it to replace your scar tissue. They will cut away the scarred tissue and graft the healthy skin into its place. Ask your doctor if a punch graft is appropriate for your type of scar.  The skin for the graft is typically taken from behind your ear lobe. You may need a resurfacing treatment a few weeks after the surgery to correct any differences in color and texture between the grafted skin and the skin around it. Follow your doctor’s care instructions for treating your skin both before and after the surgery for the best results. In cryosurgery, your doctor will inject liquid nitrogen into the scar to freeze the scar tissue. This will cause the tissue to die and eventually fall off. You will need to treat the resulting wound carefully to ensure that it heals properly.  It may take several weeks for the scar tissue to come off, and several more weeks for the area to heal. Follow your doctor’s home care instructions carefully. They will show you how to dress the wound and keep it clean. Your doctor will probably also provide medications to help you manage any pain during and after the treatment. Cryosurgery may affect your skin color or pigmentation. These steroid injections help shrink and flatten tough scars. They are especially good at reducing hypertrophic scars and keloids, which are scars that result from an overly aggressive healing process. In most cases, you’ll need to get cortisone injections every 4 or 6 weeks until the treatment takes effect. Ask your doctor if this treatment is a good option for you.  Cortisone injections often work best when combined with other treatments, such as cryosurgery.  Your doctor may combine the steroid injection with a local anesthetic to reduce pain. Cortisone injections could possibly lead to skin atrophy, skin ulcers, as well as hypo- or hyperpigmentation. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article reviews various treatments to reduce the appearance of different types of scars. Silicone gel or sheeting is suggested as a useful home treatment, with application recommended for 8-24 hours a day over several months. Other over-the-counter options include creams and ointments with ingredients like retinol and glycolic acid. Chemical peels and soft-tissue fillers provide alternatives for lighter scars and deep or indented scars respectively. More invasive procedures such as dermabrasion, laser therapies, and surgery are also discussed, each with their own set of pre- and post-treatment considerations. Additionally, less conventional methods, such as punch grafts and cryosurgery, are also mentioned. For certain types of scars, cortisone injections are recommended.

Review: After the departure of sideman instrumentalist David Galas, who contributed significantly to their previous two albums _Cold_ and _The Burning Circle And Then Dust_, Lycia are now just Mike and Tara. Tara has taken up some of the slack, although not in the same capacity; her swooning, blissful lyrics and vocals lead more than half of the songs, up from 3 on _Cold_ and just 2 on _Burning Circle_. They also demonstrate an increased stylistic range and clarity, as on the Dead Can Dance-ish \\"Tongues\\" and stark \\"El Diablo\\". Meanwhile, Mike returns with his bare, unique single-string guitar parts, thoughtful instrumentals (\\"Clouds In The Southern Sky\\", \\"Distant Fading Star\\"), and haunting, whispered vocals, as well as bringing back the simpler rhythmic forms of the earliest Lycia material. All in all, enrapturing and very satisfying, as only Lycia can be. Count yourself lucky, as I do, if you know and love them.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the place that was closed in 1970? is inside the article: Before the 1760s, Westgate consisted of only a farm, a coastguard station (built 1791 and still standing in Old Boundary Road) and a few cottages for the crew that surrounded it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the upper to middle-classes. A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and the land divided into plots to be sold for what would become an exclusive development by the sea for wealthy metropolitan families  within a gated community, rather than for occasional tourists. The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population, which reached 2,738 by 1901. The demands of the increasing population led to the building of the parish churches of St. James in 1872 and St. Saviour in 1884. St. Saviour's was designed by the architect C.N. Beazley. In 1884 it was reported that Essex, on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a tremor so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring. In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to Coutts Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.Around twenty schools were opened during the late 19th century, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.Wellington House was established in 1886 by two clergymen, the Bull brothers. It closed in 1970 and was demolished in 1972. Notable old boys included Doctor Who actor Jon Pertwee and..., can you guess it ?

Article: The best that can be said about the House-Senate budget deal announced late Tuesday is that it includes no tax increases, no new incentives for not working, and some modest entitlement reforms. Oh, and it will avoid another shutdown fiasco, assuming enough Republicans refuse to attempt suicide a second time.      The worst part of the two-year deal is that it breaks the 2011 Budget Control Act's discretionary spending caps for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. The deal breaks the caps by some 63 billion over the two years and then... ||||| 2013 has not been a pleasant year if you work for the federal government. You’ve been subject to pay freezes, furloughs and shutdowns. One of you got yelled at by a Tea Party Republican at the World War II memorial. And if Congress passes the budget deal announced Tuesday night by Rep. Paul Ryan and Sen. Patty Murray – a big if – you will get a final Christmas present: You’ll have to pay more into your pension, an effective wage cut that just adds to the 114 billion, with a \\"B,\\" federal employees have already given back to the government in the name of deficit reduction.      The deal between House and Senate negotiators Ryan and Murray would reverse part of sequestration for 2014 and 2015, itself a major source of pain for federal workers. But negotiators want to pay for that relief in future years, with the overall package cutting the deficit by an additional 23 billion. And one of the major “pay-fors” is an increase in federal employee pension contributions. President Obama’s 2014 budget included such a proposal, which would have raised the employee contribution in three stages, from 0.8 percent of salary to 2 percent. Congress had already made this shift for new hires; the Obama proposal would affect all workers hired before 2012.      That proposed increased contribution translated to a 1.2 percent pay cut, and a total of around 20 billion in givebacks over 10 years. Negotiators were pressured by the powerful Maryland Democratic delegation, including Minority Leader Steny Hoyer, House Budget Committee ranking member Chris Van Hollen and Senate Appropriations Committee chairwoman Barbara Mikulski, into softening the blow on federal employees, many of whom live in their districts. According to Sen. Murray, the increase in contributions now equals about 6 billion over 10 years. But negotiators traded some of the cuts to federal employee pensions with different cuts to military pensions, also totaling 6 billion. So whatever the occupation, people who work for the government will bear the brunt of the pain.      A small pay cut doesn’t sound like much. But you have to add that to the pile of hits federal workers have taken over the past several years. Government pay has been frozen since January 2010. The only way you’ve gotten a raise over the last four years if you work for the government is if you received a promotion or a similar advance. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this has reduced the purchasing power of a government salary by over 7 percent since 2010. The deal to avoid the government shutdown in October finally broke this fever with a 1 percent pay raise starting in January. This budget deal would wipe much of that out.      Pay freezes are just the beginning. In February, hundreds of thousands of federal workers were forced into unpaid furloughs in accordance with sequestration’s across-the-board budget cuts. In virtually every federal agency, workers had to take as many as 15 unpaid days off during the last fiscal year. Then, when the government shutdown occurred, workers were again sent home without knowing if they would ever get paid for the missed time. The lack of cash flow stressed workers and made it difficult to pay bills on time. Fortunately, Congress did provide back pay for the 6.6 million work days missed during the shutdown. However, that comes out of agency budgets, and workers have to still complete their tasks without the ability to hire additional personnel to make up the time.      The Federal Workers Alliance, a coalition of unions representing federal employees, estimated in a message to the budget negotiators that between the pay freeze and furloughs, federal employees have sacrificed 114 billion in pay cuts over the past three years, an average of over 50,000 per employee. Yet somehow, budget negotiators are going to the well again.      It’s notable that this attack targets public pensions, which have been under assault all over the country. Last week, a federal bankruptcy judge allowed Detroit to enter bankruptcy and impair pensions for city workers and retirees, and Illinois passed a sweeping law that would cut pensions significantly. Both of those states have constitutional protections preventing cuts to pensions, but no matter. Now, under the proposed budget deal, federal pensions would be subject to higher employee contributions. The Federal Workers Alliance notes that the average annual pension benefit for federal employees is just 12,800 per year. The proposed increased costs amount to close to hundreds of dollars a year in lost take-home pay without any increase to that meager benefit. Moreover, they represent a weakening of public pensions generally, at a time when the loss of pensions in the private sector, in favor of shaky 401(k)-style plans, has contributed to a retirement crisis. The threat to a dignified end of life is now coming to government workers, who explicitly forgo wages in exchange for the promise of a modest retirement benefit.      Sequestration in 2014 was scheduled to squeeze agency budgets even more. The budget cuts are larger, particularly on the military side. Cuts from 2013 sequestration have not been fully implemented, and agencies were able to shuffle around money to lessen the pain in ways that would not be available to them next year. All this means that a full sequestration in 2014 would have, in all likelihood, lead to layoffs. Now, just as Congress closes in on limited relief from sequestration, workers are told they’ll have to pay for some of that relief themselves.      You could probably find some federal workers to blame for the economic predicament in which we find ourselves, but those would be members of Congress. By contrast, federal employees, who inspect our food, work in veterans hospitals, investigate crimes at the FBI and generally ensure the smooth functioning of essential government services, have been blasted over and over again, as if their pay and benefits packages are a cookie jar to be repeatedly raided by Congress. This has led to terrible morale for federal workers, and a difficulty in finding and recruiting new talent. Federal retirements have risen as workers cash out rather than subject themselves to more stings. If you wanted to devalue the role of government from the inside out, what we’ve done to federal employees over the past few years would be the perfect blueprint.      President Obama just gave a speech highlighting inequality as “the defining challenge of our time.” If he signs a budget deal that knocks federal employees once again, he will have contributed to the continued hollowing out of the middle class, which after all is one of the biggest causes of inequality. If you cannot secure the promise of a decent living and an honest retirement even by working for the government, then there’s little hope that we can arrest this growing split between the ultra-rich and everybody else. |||||Summary:","output":"The House-Senate budget deal announced in late 2013 features no tax increases and modest entitlement reforms while avoiding a government shutdown.

Write some highlights for the following article: Prince Andrew faces international censure after flying out yesterday on a secret visit to meet the controversial president of Azerbaijan. The Queen's son flew out of the UK on a private jet for talks with billionaire despot Ilham Aliyev, who has been repeatedly accused of appalling human rights abuses. It is understood that the royal will stay in the capital, Baku, until Sunday and his 'private' four-day trip includes at least one face to face meeting with the leader. When visiting Azerbaijan Andrew is known as 'the dear guest'. Close ties: Prince Andrew and Azerbaijan president Ilham Aliyev during one of their meetings in 2009. His visit was not publicised in the list of official royal engagements in advance and last night Buckingham Palace would only say: 'By long standing convention we do not confirm or comment on private travel by members of the Royal Family.' However it is understood that taxpayers are not being forced to foot the bill for the jolly, aside from the cost of security. Details of the trip only emerged after a British Government source tipped off the pressure group, Platform, which campaigns against social and environmental abuses associated with the energy industry. Its spokesman, Emma Hughes, accused the prince of having a 'cosy relationship' with President Aliyev and demanded to know in what capacity he was visiting Azerbaijan. Andrew was forced to give up his globe-trotting royal role as a UK trade envoy in 2011 after years of public criticism. While his efforts were lauded by some respected names in the business community, he was also repeatedly accused of wasting taxpayers' money on chartering costly private jets and helicopters - including £387,000 in his last few months in the job. Some of his business trips were also noted to coincide with golfing trips or private holidays. The prince also faced scrutiny over claims he was 'cashing in' on connections he had developed through his role including the sale of his Berkshire home for £15 million - £3million over the asking price - to the son-in-law of the controversial Kazakhstan president, a personal friend and goose hunting partner. The final nail in the coffin was the furore over his close friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire US financier who was convicted and jailed for soliciting prostitution from underage girls. The pair were photographed together in New York after Epstein had been released from prison. During his decade as the UK's Special Representative for Trade and Industry he also forged a close relationship with the President of Azerbaijan, an oil and gas-rich former Soviet state. The  Duke of York speaking at World Economic Forum in Baku, Azerbaijan, at the dinner hosted by Mr Aliyev. Officially, he has now met with him on 12 occasions, although it is believed that he has also enjoyed numerous private encounters too. In June 2009 Andrew spent an estimated £60,000 of public money on chartering a luxury private jet for a three-day visit. And in November 2012 the Mail revealed how the prince had even made a covert stop-off to visit the president en route to an official tour of the Middle East. On another earlier stay he was reported to have visited a luxury spa owned by President Aliyev, which employs a blind Russian masseur described as having the best hands in the world. And in 2013 this newspaper also revealed that Andrew had been given a valuable ornamental sword and a box of caviar by Aliyev when was guest of honour at his dinner table. The Prince is also friendly with the president's wife Mehriban, and her two glamorous daughters, one of whom, Leyla, is married to the son of a Russian oligarch and lives in a penthouse overlooking Hyde Park in London. The disclosures have added to the disquiet over the prince's relationships with the leaders of dubious regimes, as Azerbaijan is considered to be one of the most corrupt countries in the world. The regularity of his visits have also led media in the former Soviet state to speculate that the Queen's son may have business links to the oil-rich state, including a golf resort on the Caspian Sea. Buckingham Palace has vehemently denied this. News of his latest trip has attracted condemnation from pressure groups concerned by Azerbaijan's appalling human rights record. Aliyev, who inherited the presidency from his father, has been accused of torturing his political opponents, rigging elections and curtailing media freedom. Last October presidential elections were held in the country which saw 143 political campaigners jailed. Videos also emerged of ballot boxes allegedly being stuffed by regime supporters. Prince Andrew is not the only high profile British figure who has close links with the Aliyev regime. This August it was announced that Tony Blair is being paid to advise the Azerbaijani government and several oil companies - including BP - on the PR challenges they face in building the Euro-Caspian Mega Pipeline, a huge gas infrastructure that will run from Azerbaijan to Italy. Emma Hughes, Energy Campaigner at campaign group Platform said: 'It's shameful that both Prince Andrew and Tony Blair are so chummy with the Azerbaijani autocrat. 'There are hundreds of brave people in Azerbaijan fighting for democracy, yet our representatives are more concerned with caviar and gas deals.'","output":"Prince Andrew has faced international criticism after secretly flying out to meet Azerbaijan's controversial president, Ilham Aliyev.

Title: Porky's Movie plot: A group of Florida high school students plan on losing their virginity. They go to Porky's, a nightclub out in the Everglades, believing that they can hire a prostitute to satisfy their sexual desires. Porky takes their money but humiliates the kids by dumping them in the swamp. When the group demands their money back, the sheriff, who turns out to be Porky's brother, arrives to drive them away, but not before his minions extort the rest of their money and cause them more embarrassment. After Mickey (who returned to Porky's for revenge) is beaten so badly he has to be hospitalized, the gang becomes hellbent on exacting revenge on Porky and his brother, eventually succeeding in sinking his establishment in the swamp. Porky and his men, joined by the sheriff, chase after the group, but they make it across the county line (out of Porky's brother's jurisdiction), where they are met by a group of the local police officers, one of whom is Mickey's older brother Ted, and the high school band. After Ted repeatedly damages Porky's car, he says that all charges against Porky for driving an unsafe vehicle will be dropped if the night's events are forgiven. Because the boys were too young to be legally allowed in Porky's in the first place, Porky and his brother have no choice but to agree. The film ends with the group getting their revenge and Pee Wee finally losing his virginity. In a subplot, the boys also peep on female students in their locker room shower. After (apparently) several unsuccessful attempts, Tommy, Billy and Pee Wee finally see several girls showering, but Pee Wee gives them away when he shouts at a particularly fat girl (who has been blocking his view) to move so he can see.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Police, citing ‘ongoing riot,’ use water cannons on Dakota Access protesters in freezing weather Police sprayed water cannons in freezing temperatures on protesters just north of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota Nov. 20. In a Facebook post, law enforcement officials said they were involved in an \\"ongoing riot.\\" (Zoeann Murphy,McKenna Ewen/The Washington Post) Tensions over the Dakota Access oil pipeline flared again Sunday when North Dakota law enforcement used water cannons to disperse a group of about 400 protesters trying to move past a barricaded bridge toward construction sites for the project. As temperatures in Cannon Ball, N.D., dropped into the 20s, police in riot gear sprayed activists with a hose mounted atop an armored vehicle and formed a line to prevent them from advancing up the road, according to the Bismarck Tribune. Protesters also reported being pelted with rubber bullets, tear gas and concussion grenades during the standoff, which lasted until late Sunday night. A grainy Facebook Live video from the scene shows throngs of people gathered around the Backwater Bridge on Highway 1806, with flood lights shining down on the grass and road below and a haze of smoke and water vapor rising near police vehicles. The clashes began around 6 p.m., when protesters tried to remove burned out trucks that had been blocking the bridge since authorities and activists faced off there in late October. Police have since set up wire and concrete barriers on the bridge, which is about a mile south of where the pipeline developer plans to drill. Protesters, who call themselves “water protectors,” have argued that the barricade prevents emergency services from reaching the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and a nearby camp they have used as a staging ground for demonstrations. The protest of an oil pipeline that is being constructed close to the Standing Rock Indian reservation has become a rallying point for Native Americans across the United States. Here's what you need to know. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) Authorities responded after protesters moved one of the trucks blocking the roadway. The Morton County Sheriff’s Department said that by 8:30 p.m. an estimated 400 people had arrived to try to “breach” the bridge and had set dozens of fires in the area. The department called the situation an “ongoing riot,” saying protesters were “very aggressive” and were trying to “flank and attack the law enforcement line.” At least one person was arrested, the sheriff’s department said. One of the protest organizers, Dallas Goldtooth, said protesters started small fires in the area to help warm people who had been sprayed with water in the freezing cold. He told the Tribune that some activists tried to remove the burned out trucks to expose the heavily armed authorities behind them. “Folks have a right to be on a public road,” Goldtooth said. “It’s absurd that people who’ve been trying to take down the barricade now have their lives at risk.” [U.N. officials denounce ‘inhuman’ treatment of Native American pipeline protesters] Another organizer, Tara Houska, told the Tribune that more than 200 people had been hit with tear gas, pepper spray or water from the hose. “They’re using everything and anything,” she said. “This has been weeks and weeks of those vehicles on the road for no apparent reason, and it’s a huge public safety risk. It’s putting enormous pressure on the Standing Rock Sioux community and people who live and work in the area.” Organizers said the Cannon Ball gym was being used for emergency relief, with medics from the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes treating people who were injured in the standoff. Physicians and tribal healers with the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council called on authorities to stop using water cannons against the protesters, saying the below-freezing weather could cause hypothermia and criticizing the “potentially lethal use of these controversial methods against people peacefully assembled,” CNN reported.

They are using their fire hoses to put out the fires, wet the land around so fires don’t spread, and they are also using water as crowd control.” The sheriff’s department told the Tribune that the bridge has been closed since October because transportation officials were concerned about its structural integrity. The 3.8 billion pipeline is scheduled to carry crude oil nearly 1,200 miles from North Dakota to Illinois. Construction is nearly complete, but a planned segment of the project that crosses under the Missouri River has been a source of contention for months. The Standing Rock Sioux argue that the pipeline cuts within a mile of their reservation and could pollute water and disrupt cultural sites. The tribe has challenged the project in court, and protesters have camped out near the Missouri River site for months. Energy Transfer Partners, the project developer, says the pipeline transports oil more safely than trucks and will not harm sacred lands. In October, a group of activists tried to set up a second protest camp closer to the area where drilling is planned. They blocked the roadway with scrap wood, bales of hay and tires and used abandoned trucks to block the Backwater Bridge. After repeatedly ordering them to leave, authorities stormed the camp, using pepper spray, high-pitched warnings and rubber bullets against those who refused to leave.

It's not that easy, right? That's because when you try to make something very long, it can become weak and wobbly. Now, imagine the real world. England and France are two countries that are separated by a big body of water called the English Channel. This water is about 21 miles wide at the shortest distance between them. Building a bridge that long is difficult because it would need to be very strong to support people and vehicles. Plus, it needs to be high enough for big ships to pass under it. Also, the cost of building such a long bridge would be super expensive.

If you’re new to doing a 180 on your skateboard or haven’t done the trick in a while it’s a good idea to get your body used to being in the proper position. Practice skating around for a bit by pushing off and then situating your body into the right position. The ollie is the most fundamental skateboard trick and it’s incorporated into pretty much every trick you’ll do. And the 180 is an ollie where you turn your board and body 180-degrees. For the 180 you’ll be turning around either behind you for a backside 180, or in front of you for a frontside 180. Once you have the ollie down, you’re well on your way to doing a 180 skateboard trick!  If you ride “regular” you will have your right foot in the back positioned on the tail of the board. If you ride “goofy” then your left foot will be in back on the tail. You want to position your back foot on the tip of the tail. To do a 180 on the skateboard, you’ll want to position your back foot on the corner of the tail. For a straight ollie your front foot will be centered about halfway up the board or slightly back.  You also want to put more pressure on the outer edge of your foot (the side your pinky toe is on). To help you with turning, plant your front foot so its slightly hanging over the opposite edge of board from your back foot. This may feel awkward but it will help to keep your board balanced when you’re in the air. Your shoulders and your upper body is where most of the work will come from when you perform your 180.  By setting your shoulders correctly you will be able to turn your body quickly enough and this should allow your legs and the board to follow. You might be tempted to try and force the board to turn using mostly your legs, but you won’t get enough torque this way. For a backside 180, position your front shoulder slightly in front of your chest and dip it down so when you pull up you have more momentum to work with. For a frontside 180, you want to position back shoulder in front of your chest and dip it down as well so you can pull up and create momentum. You don’t want too much of a bend so that you end up crouching too low as that won’t allow you to pop high enough. You should stand with relaxed knees like you’re getting ready to hop slightly. If you are bending correctly you should be able to slide your front forward up the board with ease.","output":"This article explains the process of performing a 180 skateboard trick, emphasizing the importance of mastering the ollie, proper foot positioning, and using the upper body for turning momentum."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: In their new book, \\"Pump and Dump: The Rancid Rules of the New Economy,\\" sociology professors Robert H. Tillman and Michael L. Indergaard say that recent corporate scandals such as Enron and WorldCom are symptoms of corporate governance problems that began in the 1990s. Using a financial fraud theory called \\"pump and dump,\\" corporate elite artificially inflated stocks and securities in order to sell their shares at higher prices, leaving any fall-out and responsibility on naive investors. Tillman and Indergaard, who both teach at St. John's University in New York City, were online Wednesday, Feb. 22 at 1 p.m. ET to answer questions about their book. Michael L. Indergaard: Hello and thanks for joining us to discuss the problem of corporate corruption. In our book, \\"Pump and Dump: the Rancid Rules of the New Economy\\", we show why recent financial scandals implicate the U.S. system of corporate governance and a host of politicians who have cashed in on the public trust. Our hope is that citizens will take a closer look at the business and political elites who hide behind free market mantras. Robert H. Tillman: Welcome. We're looking forward to your comments. Rockville, Md.: I am curious why two sociology professors would be writing a book on business. What are your backgrounds that you would feel comfortable addressing these issues? Have either of you worked in the finance area? While many of the problems that have emerged over the past 10 years have been pretty egregious, I find that enforcement of our laws is much better today than it was in earlier eras. The Rockefellers, Mellons, Goulds, Kennedys and Morgans of those eras got away with quite a bit and never had much in the way of negative repercussions. Even in the 70's and 80's there were plenty of businessmen whose activities today would justify prison time, but who got away with it. Sure, there are problems today, but at least now there are ramifications. Robert H. Tillman: Good question. My specialty in sociology is white-collar crime and my colleague's is primarily in economic sociology. Many of the issues we explore in our book can get technical but at their root are not that difficult to understand. We focus on cases of blatant frauds where it is clear that those involved intended to deceive investors, employees, etc. You're probably right that there were many violations in the past but one of the differences is that today there are so many more opportunities to commit corporate crimes. With new financial instruments, IPOs, etc. Bethesda, Md.: In your book, do you offer-up any solutions on how to avoid messes like Enron or WorlCom? Are there regulations in place to stop \\"pump and dump\\" schemes and if not what should be done by the SEC or Congress? Michael L. Indergaard: Thanks for the question. Sarbanes-Oxley addressed some problems but there have been attempts to water it down. More generally, strong resistance to reform is threatening to bring it to a halt. We propose that there has been little recognition of larger problems of governance and policy. Robert H. Tillman: Some of the necessary reforms have been implemented, like requiring companies to expense stock options--which has finally been put in place after much wrangling. But others have not. Such as requiring boards of directors to have outside members. I worry that as memory of the scandals fades people will be less vigalent about seeing that reform measures stay in place Philadelphia, Pa.: I asked this same following to John Bogle earlier. I would please appreciate your reaction this query: I was in an Ivy League business school in the 1970s. I recall being the only person in one class who felt that American businesses operating in foreign countries should follow the business laws of the countries within which they operate even if no American laws were broken by breaking the foreign law. I felt this was not only a moral question but also one that shows we respect the cultures of the people with whom we do business. This is just one example of what I found to be a rampant problem among my classmates. What I observed among my classmates was a cut-throat drive for personal success at nearly any cost. I can verify the tales that many college students have heard as being correct: library readings for classes were often missing (this was the days before the Internet), cheating was rampant and indeed widely boasted, and I learned never to work in a group. The object of learning groups was to stab others in the back in order to lower the class average. From all this, I did learn one valuable lesson: never hire anyone from my class to work for me. Over time, as I watched and read about many of my classmates in the news taken away from their jobs in handcuffs, I was not in the least bit surprised. The question I have always wondered though is, if I could tell within minutes that I would never want these greedy cheaters working for me, how did they get hired and kept at these brokerage houses and businesses? Do many businesses themselves actually seek out cheating greedy people? Or do they worm their way into these businesses, in which case I feel sorry for the businesses when they find the personal spending accounts of these employees inflated and the business deals they made turned out to be ethically questionable. Is there a business culture among some companies that attracts these people? If so, shouldn't there be a means for this culture to recognize when mistakes are made and can then to respond to correct itself and its own behavior? Did businesses never learn to look for warning signs and self-correct their own problems? Michael L. Indergaard: Interesting issue. Leading figures in fraud often surrounded themselves with people who were willing to collaborate in dubious activities. They often selected people who were drawn to risk-taking and the prospects of high rewards. Importantly, the ringleaders also created organizational routines and cultures that socialized people into going along with suspect activities. They used a mix of bribery and bullying to normalize corruption. Columbus, Ohio: I've long felt that an prime but unspoken motivation for privatizing social security was to create coerced artificial demand for stocks, to the benefit of those who already owned them. Am I alone in this view? Robert H. Tillman: I think there's more than a little truth to your observation. Clearly Wall St and corporate American would have profited tremendously with the privatization of Social Security. It is truly amazing that the administration could have proposed this in the wake of massive corporate scandals in which investors were betrayed by the very people who would under privatization have access to more of their funds Hopefully, this proposal is dead and gone. Minneapolis, Minn.: The cases of Enron and Worldcom, among others, are classic examples of why government oversight is essential to protect investors. Do you see any real push by Congress and the SEC to strengthen the integrity of the Market beyond window dressing? Also, will this become an increasingly large concern as the Boomers retire and are even more dependent upon their portfolios for retirement income? Michael L. Indergaard: We see some substance and a whole lotta damage control. One thing that troubles us is that there has been little repudiation of the blind faith in markets that abetted the gutting of regulations. And there has been little, if any accountability for politicians who cashed in on positions of public trust. Annapolis, Md.: I'm on Amazon concurrently with this post ordering your book. Recently, I was re-reading an old economics text book I have. It almost seems as if some of the basics (supply/demand curve analysis in particular) are changing as the markets become global in combination with rapid M&A activity plus this vertical and horizontal integration momentum. I get the impression we are in uncharted territory. From your perspective, how did the globalized economy emerge? Was it a result of random factors? Or were certain people/organizations responsible? Michael L. Indergaard: We stress the role of neoliberal ideologies and political mobilizations in weakening regulations during the 1990s. Certainly, these same forces have been vigorously promoting a certain type of globalization during the same period. Enron, for example, was at the forefront of promoting privatization of energy industries in developing countries and in exploiting such shifts. In this they were assisted by a host of U.S. government agencies and international bodies which provided Enron with something like 7 billion in support. Washington, D.C.: Are there any other techniques that corporate big-wigs use along with \\"pump and dump\\" to manipulate investors? Robert H. Tillman: Yes. The variations seem endless. One of the frauds that we explore in the book involved the outrageous rip-offs of electrical energy consumers in California in the late 1990s. These scams cost Californians an estimated 9 billion. Its useful to think about how many people could have been educated, housed or fed with that money. The most galling aspect of this was the fact that under deregulation, many of these practices were not illegal and very few of those responsible were ever punished. Outside of California, recent revelations about standard practices in the insurance industry also make one wonder if there's any area of the corporate world that is free from corruption. Munich, Germany: There's a fair amount of hype being published on the Internet by PR firms, trying to establish interest in a company stock, which is often deceptive, especially for small investors. Would you agree, that while the Internet has empowered small investors to a certain degree by providing access to previously unattainable information, the Internet has also become the domain of large organizations that are well versed in presenting potentially misleading information? Michael L. Indergaard: Nice to hear from Europa. I'm not sure that much of the info on the Internet is much more helpful than the many emails I get which want to give hot stock tips. The new economy, based as it is on network forms of organization, provides countless opportunities to hide information from investors. There are lots of unresolved issues about the Silicon Valley system which relies on insider ties. Their linkages with the financial system makes their privileged access to information, and ability to shape impressions, all the more problematic. Arlington, Va.: Just curious -- what does \\"neoliberal\\" refer to ideologically? Does this mean \\"third way\\" Democrats? Michael L. Indergaard: It is because of the third-way Dems that one could state that the embrace of neoliberal ideas is bi-partisan. Members of Congress and Presidents from both parties have \\"starring\\" roles in our book's scrutiny of promiscous deregulation and free market ideologies. Thanks for bringing the issue up. Arlington, Va.: Have there been any class action suits or complaints from investors about this practice? Or is it legal and allowed? Robert H. Tillman: If you're asking about the California energy scams, yes, there have been a number of class action suits, some of which have been successful and have recovered some money for the consumers. The problem is the difference between obtaining a judgement and obtaining cash from these companies. In order to get any money out of Enron California energy consumers will have to join a long line of people trying to get their hands on a dwindling pool of assets. Arlington, Va.: The executives are not just inflating stock prices for their own greed, they are also helping lots of investors make money. I don't think Wall Street cares about high executive compensation packages, for example, as long as total shareholder return is high. The tragedy with an Enron or Worldcom is that the employees who couldn't dump the stocks were punished. Michael L. Indergaard: We argue that there were multiple motivations for those who participated in dubious or fraudulent actitivities. One of the basic examples of \\"New Economy rules\\" was the doctrine that a firm could become a first mover and dominate new markets if it turned its stock into a currency with which it could make acquistions. A lot of dot-com start-ups were playing the IPO game not to gain riches but to gain crediblity as New Economy players. In many cases, executives tried to play the New Economy game and then found themselves trapped. Then they engaged in fraudulent accounting or other ruses to try to keep things afloat. Bethesda, Md.: As a small-investor what kind of protection can I take from mistrusting the wrong people? Because I still feel like I'm in the learning stages, I look towards those in the know for guidance. Am I just being naive? Robert H. Tillman: It's easy to be cynical in these situations--distrusting everybody. At the same time not all stocks are backed by phony information--indeed, most are perfectly honest and straightforward. But even trying to make prudent investment decisions under legitimate circumstances is difficult enough. the only advice I can offer is to be careful not get caught up in the next wave of \\"irrational exuberance\\" or to be on the quest for \\"the next big thing.\\" NW DC: You used the term 'massive' to describe corporate scandals: Can you elaborate upon that? ENRON and WorldCom were large companies, but they were an infinitesimal operator in a massive economy. What other evidence do you have that fraud was pervasive in business, rather than pervasive at an immaterial number of large organizations? Robert H. Tillman: Very good question. There is a tendency to see the whole barrel as rotten. We are now working on a more systematic study to try to arrive at some more precise estimates of the scope of corporate fraud, specifically, accounting fraud, and its costs. For now, we can rely on a study by the GAO which found that between 1997 and 2002, over 800 public companies issued restatements of their financial conditions. This represented 10% of all companies listed on the major exchanges during that period. while this leaves 90% that did not file restatements, we think that 10% is a fairly large proportion. Hopefully, we'll have a more precise answer in the future. Washington, DC: For the high-profile cases that we've heard about in the media (Enron, etc) aren't these the exceptions rather than the rules? There are millions of corporations in the U.S. and thousands of publicly traded companies... Are you asserting that these few bad apples are proof that the entire crop is spoiled? Michael L. Indergaard: Bob is answering a very similar question so I will address some big picture issues raised by your question. The magnitude of false finanical statements and of the frauds committed suggest a systemic problem. Our investigation of the politics behind deregulation--and the obstruction of regulators and reformers--speaks of issues that bridge the world of economics and politics. In the 1990s, the power of the corporate elite over Congress and regulators was such that they gained the ability to both make and break the rules. Some powerful executives and professionals have been held accountable by the courts but there has been little recognition of the flaws in our governance system that abetted their misdeeds. Ultimately, what is at stake is whehter we as democracy still have the ability to reflect critically on our system and correct it. Michael L. Indergaard: We'll conclude with the thoughts we ended our book's introduction with. \\"Our study suggests that unregulated markets spur the formation of rogue entrepreneurs who feed on moral society--cashing in on social resources, such as relationships, reputation, and trust. 'Caveat emptor' is a sensible guideline in any era, but when it is the only norm that stands between ordinary investors and predatory insiders, \\"buyer beware\\" is the most rancid rule of all.\\" Editor's Note: washingtonpost.com moderators retain editorial control over Live Online discussions and choose the most relevant questions for guests and hosts; guests and hosts can decline to answer questions. washingtonpost.com is not responsible for any content posted by third parties.","output":"In simple words, the article is about two teachers who wrote a book called \\"Pump and Dump.\\" Their book talks about how some big companies and important people tricked others into thinking certain stocks were worth more than they really were.

Answer the following question: -  The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid - As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve - Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen - The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together - They form iron oxide, which is rust -   What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the rusting process, also known as corrosion, begins when water comes into contact with metal, specifically iron or iron-based materials. As water combines with carbon dioxide (CO2) present in the air, it leads to the formation of a weak carbonic acid (H2CO3). This acidic environment initiates the dissolution of iron atoms, which sets the stage for the subsequent events leading to the formation of iron oxide, commonly known as rust. In this step, water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) react to form carbonic acid, which can be represented by the following chemical equation: H2O + CO2 → H2CO3 The formation of carbonic acid consequently leads to the reduction of the pH levels around the metal surface, making it more acidic and thus promoting the corrosion process. This conversion of water and carbon dioxide into carbonic acid is crucial in setting the conditions necessary for the subsequent chemical reactions that contribute to the overall rusting process. As a result, the first step of the process, which is the combination of water and carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid, plays an essential role in understanding the fundamental mechanism behind the corrosion of iron and related materials."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person Luis is in love with?  The film tells of two very different individuals who share a prison cell in Brazil during the Brazilian military government: Valentin Arregui, who is imprisoned (and has been tortured) due to his activities on behalf of a leftist revolutionary group, and Luis Molina, a transgender woman in prison for having sex with an underage boy. Molina, who self-identifies as \\"she,\\" passes the time by recounting memories from one of her favorite films, a wartime romantic thriller that's also a Nazi propaganda film. She weaves the characters into a narrative meant to comfort Valentin and distract him from the harsh realities of political imprisonment and separation from his lover, Marta. Valentin encourages Molina to have self-respect and opens her up to political commitment. Despite Valentin's occasionally snapping at Molina over her shallow views of film watching and unrealistic romance, an unlikely friendship develops between the two. As the story develops, it becomes clear that Valentin is being poisoned by his jailers to provide Molina with a chance to befriend him, and that Molina is spying on Valentin on behalf of the secret police. Molina has apparently been promised parole if she succeeds in obtaining information that will allow the secret police to break up the revolutionary group. When Molina declares herself in love with Valentin, a physical consummation of that love occurs on Molina's last night in prison. Molina is granted parole in a surprise move by the secret police. Valentin provides Molina with a telephone number and a message for his comrades. Molina at first refuses to take the number, fearing the consequences of treason, but she relents, bidding Valentin farewell with a kiss. Answer:","output":"The last name of the person Luis (Molina) is in love with is not explicitly mentioned in the article. However, we know that Luis Molina falls in love with Valentin Arregui.

Please write a short summary for the following article: New York Yankees' Alex Rodriguez delivers grand slam to power Bombers over Twins, 8-4 BY Peter Botte Daily News Sports Writer Originally Published:Friday, May 14th 2010, 9:28 PM Updated: Saturday, May 15th 2010, 12:01 PM Alex RodriguezÂ was bound to bust out and eventually start carrying the depleted Yankees. It seemed that everyone, except for maybe Twins manager Ron Gardenhire, saw it coming when the slugger strode to the plate Friday night in the seventh inning. Following an intentional walk to Mark Teixeira to load the bases with his team down by one run, A-Rod did more than just improve on his already-gaudy numbers against Minnesota reliever Matt Guerrier. Rodriguez's 587th career homer and 19th grand slam propelled the Yanks to an 8-4 win over the Twins at the Stadium - and perhaps jolted them out of a few days of offensive doldrums just when they needed the middle of their order to start doing so. \\"For me, that's why I hit fourth and my team is expecting me to get big hits in those situations,\\" said Rodriguez, who entered with just three homers in 125 at-bats this season. \\"(Teixeira and I) hit third and fourth for a reason and we know we have a responsibility in the middle of the order to do damage and I feel like we're going to improve in that category.\\" Even before Rodriguez's heroics, there weren't too many managers in either league commiserating with Joe Girardi, whose banged-up team still entered Friday night having scored the most runs in the majors. Still, the previous few days in Detroit proved that even the Yanks' loaded lineup will not be immune to dead patches this season. With regulars Curtis Granderson and Nick Johnson on the disabled list, with Derek Jeter skidding and with Rodriguez searching for his first true groove of the season, the Yanks (23-12) were shut out twice in the final three games of their four-game set with Tigers. That marked the first time that the Bombers had been blanked twice in the same series since May 1999 against the Angels. \\"We've had some tough injuries, and we have to battle through it,\\" Rodriguez said. \\"Three (wins) and four (losses) was not what we expect, definitely, on any road trip. We expect to do better. This was a good start to the home stand.\\" Girardi had suggested before the game that simply returning to the Stadium figured to spark his lineup; the Yanks began the weekend tied with Colorado with an average of 6.0 runs per game this season at home. The arrival of the Central-leading Twins - whom the Yanks have now defeated 11 straight times, including the 2009 AL division series - made for a perfect storm. A.J. Burnett survived poor command in the early innings, and left with a 3-2 lead when Girardi summoned lefty reliever Damaso Marte to face lefty sluggers Joe Mauer and Justin Morneau with a runner on second and two outs in the seventh. Both smacked run-scoring hits to put the Twins ahead by one. Until, that is, Rodriguez got Marte off the hook in the bottom half. A-Rod had been 4-for-6 with three homers in his career against the righthanded Guerrier, but Gardenhire called for an intentional walk to Teixeira to load the bases to set up that matchup with one out in the seventh. Rodriguez clubbed an 0-1 pitch into the left-field seats and let out a hearty scream as he circled the bases, before Joba Chamberlain (1-1) and Mariano Rivera retired the final six batters. \\"I have the utmost respect for their manager over there,\\" A-Rod said of Gardenhire. \\"He's one of my favorite guys in baseball. They play the game really well, and in that situation, it's a numbers game and he was looking for a two-ball.\\" The Yankees got four, instead. Summary:","output":"In a baseball game, a player named Alex Rodriguez from the New York Yankees helped his team win. He hit a very important home run, and his team ended up beating the other team, the Twins, with a score of 8-4. Everybody was very excited and happy for his success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Anosmia is the loss of what? Answer:","output":"Anosmia is the loss of the sense of smell. It can be a temporary or permanent condition, depending on its underlying cause. The sense of smell, also known as olfaction, is an essential and complex sensory function that allows humans and animals to detect odorants present in their surrounding environment. Smell plays a significant role in various aspects of daily life, including taste perception, food selection and appreciation, identification of potential hazards, and even emotional and social interactions. There are several reasons why an individual may experience anosmia, and they can be broadly categorized into two groups – conductive and sensorineural. Conductive anosmia occurs when there is a physical obstruction or blockage in the nose preventing odorants from reaching the olfactory receptor neurons. This type of anosmia could be caused by: 1. Nasal congestion due to colds, allergies, or sinus infections 2. Nasal polyps or tumors 3. Deviated nasal septum 4. Inflammation of the nasal mucosa, such as rhinitis 5. Intranasal drug use or exposure to harmful chemicals Sensorineural anosmia, on the other hand, involves the damage or dysfunction of the olfactory receptor neurons, olfactory nerve, or the brain's smell-processing regions. Possible causes of sensorineural anosmia include: 1. Viral infections, particularly those affecting the upper respiratory system 2. Head trauma or injury, leading to damage of the olfactory nerve or brain 3. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or multiple sclerosis 4. Age-related decline in olfactory function 5. Congenital anosmia or congenital absence of the olfactory bulbs, which is a rare hereditary condition 6. Exposure to toxic chemicals or medication side effects The diagnosis of anosmia involves a comprehensive evaluation of the individual's medical history, physical examination, and tests assessing the sense of smell, such as scratch and sniff tests or olfactory threshold tests. The treatment for anosmia depends upon the underlying cause. For instance, addressing the cause of nasal blockage or inflammation, such as through medications, surgery, or lifestyle changes, may help restore the sense of smell in conductive anosmia cases. However, in cases of sensorineural anosmia, the prognosis can be less favorable, and full recovery may not be possible depending on the degree of neuronal or brain damage. Anosmia can significantly affect an individual's quality of life, as it impairs their ability to taste and enjoy food, detect hazardous material or spoiled food, and can even impact personal relationships and emotional well-being. It is essential to seek medical advice for anosmia to determine its cause and explore appropriate treatment options."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Today, I want to share why I think you should interview real estate agents before hiring one. Why You Should Interview Real Estate Agents Truth be told, I have only purchased one house and I’m in the process of selling it. My husband and I thought long and hard about whether we would try to sell our property on our own or hire someone to represent us. In the end, we chose the latter. If you have ever shared with friends or family that you’re looking for a home or thinking of selling your own, most everyone says something along the lines of, “Oh! I know a realtor I can recommend!” Many of you may know a real estate agent personally as well. I still think it makes sense to interview any prospective agents because they are being paid by you. When you hire someone to do work on your home, you get estimates and gather information about how and when the work will be done. When you are looking for babysitters, you meet them and see how they’ll interact with your child. When you’re an employer, you interview any potential employees. Don’t Take The Easy Route with Previous Agents and Friends Just because a friend is a realtor, doesn’t mean they’ll be the best real estate agent for you. Just because a friend recommends their realtor to you, doesn’t mean you have to hire him/her. It’s business and nobody should take it personally. Interviewing real estate agents just makes sense. Oftentimes, people don’t. Why not just use the realtor that sold you the house you’re currently in? Well, you can. But do you know how that realtor handles business when they are the listing agent versus the buyer’s agent? Do you know if they’ll want to pursue the option to be a dual agent (and double their commission)? Why not interview them while interviewing others? It won’t hurt.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Doric order was one of the three orders of ancient Greek or classical architecture; the other two canonical orders were the Ionic and the Corinthian. The Doric is most easily recognised by the simple circular capitals at the top of columns. It was the earliest and in its essence the simplest of the orders, though still with complex details in the entablature above.  - The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age.  - The Ionic order forms one of the three classical orders of classical architecture, the other two canonic orders being the Doric and the Corinthian. There are two lesser orders: the Tuscan (a plainer Doric), and the rich variant of Corinthian called the composite order, both added by 16th-century Italian architectural writers, based on Roman practice. The Ionic columns are the thinnest and smallest columns out of the three canonic orders.  - Classical architecture usually denotes architecture which is more or less consciously derived from the principles of Greek and Roman architecture of classical antiquity, or sometimes even more specifically, from the works of Vitruvius. Different styles of classical architecture have arguably existed since the Carolingian Renaissance, and prominently since the Italian Renaissance. Although classical styles of architecture can vary greatly, they can in general all be said to draw on a common \\"vocabulary\\" of decorative and constructive elements. In much of the Western world, different classical architectural styles have dominated the history of architecture from the Renaissance until the second world war, though it continues to inform many architects to this day.  - Architecture (Latin \\"architectura\\", from the Greek  \\"arkhitekton\\" \\"architect\\", from - \\"chief\\" and  \\"builder\\") is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings and other physical structures. Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements.  - \\"\\"An Order in architecture is a certain assemblage of parts subject to uniform established proportions, regulated by the office that each part has to perform\\".\\" The Architectural Orders are the ancient styles of classical architecture, each distinguished by its proportions and characteristic profiles and details, and most readily recognizable by the type of column employed. Three ancient orders of architecturethe Doric, Ionic, and Corinthianoriginated in Greece. To these the Romans added, in practice if not in name, the Tuscan, which they made simpler than Doric, and the Composite, which was more ornamental than the Corinthian. The Architectural Order of a classical building is akin to the mode or key of classical music, the grammar or rhetoric of a written composition. It is established by certain \\"modules\\" like the intervals of music, and it raises certain expectations in an audience attuned to its language.  - The composite order is a mixed order , combining the volutes of the Ionic order capital with the acanthus leaves of the Corinthian order . The composite order volutes are larger , however , and the composite order also has echinus molding with egg - and - dart ornamentation between the volutes . The column of the composite order is ten diameters high . Until the Renaissance , the composite was not ranked as a separate order . Instead it was considered as a late Roman form of the Corinthian order . The Arch of Titus , in the forum in Rome , built in 82 AD , is considered the first example of a composite order . The composite order , due to its delicate appearance , was deemed by the Renaissance to be suitable for the building of churches dedicated to The Virgin Mary or other female saints . Sebastiano Serlio ( 1475 -- 1554 ) published his book I sette libri d'architettura in 1537 in which he was the second to mention the composite order as its own order and not just as an evolution of the Corinthian order as previously suggested by Leon Battista Alberti . Leon Battista Alberti in his De re aedificatoria ( English : On the Art of Building ) mentions the composite order , calling it \`\` Italic '' . Bramante ( 1444 -- 1514 ) used the composite order in the second order of the cloister of Santa Maria della Pace , Rome . For the first order , the Ionic order was used . Francesco Borromini ( 1599 -- 1667 ) developed the composite order in San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane , Rome ( 1638 ) . The interior of the church has 16 composite columns . The load - bearing columns placed underneath the arches have inverted volutes . This choice was highly criticised at the time , thinking it was a lack of knowledge of the Vittruvian orders that led him to his decision . The inverted volutes can also be seen in Borromini 's Oratorio dei Filippini in the lower order . There the controversy was even higher , considering that Borromini also removed the acanthus leaves , leaving a bare capital .  - The Tuscan order is in effect a simplified Doric order, with un-fluted columns and a simpler entablature with no triglyphs or guttae. It was not one of the three orders of classical architecture described by the Roman architect Vitruvius; these were the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. Instead the Tuscan order, presented as a standardized formal order, is an invention of Italian Renaissance writers largely motivated by nationalism. However, relatively simple columns with round capitals had been part of the vernacular architecture of Italy and much of Europe since at least Etruscan architecture.  - A column or pillar in architecture and structural engineering is a structural element that transmits, through compression, the weight of the structure above to other structural elements below. In other words, a column is a compression member. The term column applies especially to a large round support (the \\"shaft\\" of the column) with a capital and a \\"base\\" or pedestal and made of stone, or appearing to be so. A small wooden or metal support is typically called a post, and supports with a rectangular or other non-round section are usually called piers. For the purpose of wind or earthquake engineering, columns may be designed to resist lateral forces. Other compression members are often termed \\"columns\\" because of the similar stress conditions. Columns are frequently used to support beams or arches on which the upper parts of walls or ceilings rest. In architecture, \\"column\\" refers to such a structural element that also has certain proportional and decorative features. A column might also be a decorative element not needed for structural purposes; many columns are \\"engaged\\", that is to say form part of a wall.  - The Corinthian order is the last developed of the three principal classical orders of ancient Greek and Roman architecture. The other two are the Doric order which was the earliest, followed by the Ionic order. When classical architecture was revived during the Renaissance, two more orders were added to the canon, the Tuscan order and the Composite order. The Corinthian, with its offshoot the Composite, is the most ornate of the orders, characterized by slender fluted columns and elaborate capitals decorated with acanthus leaves and scrolls. There are many variations.    After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'composite order' exhibits the relationship of 'subclass of'. Find the answer from the choices below.

Choose the right sandpaper: First, pick the right type of sandpaper for your job. Sandpaper comes in different grit numbers, which show how rough or smooth the sandpaper is. A lower grit number (like 60 or 80) is more rough, while a higher grit number (like 180 or 220) is smoother. 2. Prepare the surface: Before you start sanding, make sure the surface you want to sand is clean and dry. Remove any dirt, dust, or loose paint. 3. Hold the sandpaper: Wrap the sandpaper around a sanding block (a small, flat piece of wood or foam). This helps you hold the sandpaper better and also helps to make a flat and even surface when you sand. 4. Sand in one direction: Start sanding the surface gently by moving the sandpaper in one direction. Imagine you're petting a cat, and you want to go in the direction of its fur. Going in one direction will help avoid scratches. 5. Check your progress: Periodically stop and check to see if the surface has become smoother and if any uneven areas have been removed. When you're happy with the result, you can stop sanding. 6. Clean up: After you've finished sanding, use a soft brush or cloth to clean the surface and remove any leftover dust. 7. If needed, repeat: If you started with a rougher sandpaper and need a smoother finish, switch to a higher grit number sandpaper and repeat the above steps. Remember, always be gentle when you sand, and take your time. Happy sanding!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Yes; In the Star Trek: Voyager series, the crew of the USS Voyager does ultimately reach home, returning to the Alpha Quadrant after spending seven years in the hostile and distant Delta Quadrant. Their successful journey home occurs in the last episode of the final series, titled \\"Endgame,\\" which originally aired on May 23, 2001. Throughout the series, Captain Kathryn Janeway and the crew of Voyager face numerous hardships and challenges, encounter various alien species, and experience personal growth. They frequently attempt to find a way to shorten their journey home to Earth, including exploring wormholes, subspace corridors, and forming alliances with powerful alien races that could potentially help them. While some of these efforts yield temporary gains and even speed up their journey, none of them provide a complete solution. Their ultimate return to Earth hinges on an alliance between the future version of Captain Janeway and the present-day crew. Armed with advanced technology and knowledge from the future, they manage to outmaneuver the seemingly invincible Borg Collective, which is a recurring antagonist throughout the series. In \\"Endgame,\\" the crew uses a Borg transwarp hub to travel back to the Alpha Quadrant, significantly shortening their journey and returning them to Earth decades ahead of schedule. As they approach the Earth, they are greeted by an impressive fleet of Starfleet vessels assembled to combat the Borg threat, which had been detected by Starfleet's early-warning systems. This emotional and triumphant moment marks the end of their nearly decade-long struggle to return home and reunite with their families and loved ones.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. The New York Times My five-plus years of nightly restaurant visits with guests in tow have exposed me to more than an array of amazing food. They’ve given me a special vantage point onto people’s temperaments and tics, especially (but not solely) in regard to eating and food. On top of a culinary education, I have gotten something of a psychological, sociological and anthropological one. I learned that the world is divided into the hoarders and the sharers, and into the perpetually slighted and the eternally grateful; that the diners who eat the least are the ones who pretend to eat the most; and that no manner of advance instruction can prevent guests from saying your real name and even referencing your last three reviews loudly, repeatedly and in direct earshot of the restaurant manager. There’s a reason most people don’t go into the spying business. They have no aptitude for it. I learned that the desire to turn everything into a competition runs just as deep as the impulse toward ownership, at least in America. “First, second, third, fourth” was a string of words I heard time and again, as someone at the table took it upon himself or herself to rank the appetizers in precise order of appeal — and then to do the same, 45 minutes later, with the entrees. For many tablemates, saying yea or nay to a dish wasn’t judgment enough. They itched to dole out medals: gold to the squid à la plancha, bronze to the beets. I learned, too, that there is little sense to the eating rules many people adopt and to the peeves and peccadilloes they nurse. My friend K. swore off veal, citing her sorrow for calves that would never grow to be (slaughtered) steers, but she ate young chicken and the littlest of lambs. She also ate foie gras, though animal rights advocates have protested the treatment of the ducks used to make it more vociferously than they have the lot of those calves. My frequent companion T. ordered foie gras whenever he had the chance and thrilled to the presence of calf’s liver on a menu, but he spurned sweetbreads, on account of their being organ meat. I had more than a few companions who rejected food based solely on its texture (eggplant dip), shape (tendrils of octopus) or color (uni). And while my friend M. had no complaint when duck, lamb or pork came to the table in slices, she fumed if her steak arrived as anything other than one solid slab of meat, feeling insulted and infantilized by the cutting of it before it reached her. People are as strange about eating as they are about love. They want what they want. Dining with a critic doesn’t exactly facilitate that. I typically ate out with three other people, so a large number of dishes could be tried, and began each meal by telling my guests which dishes should or shouldn’t be ordered, in accordance with my progress through the menu on any earlier visits. “So I can’t get the steak?” my friend R. said one night, his pout so pronounced he was like a male Jolie: Mangelina. I apologized. I explained: I’d capitulated to the last steak maniac, on the second visit to the restaurant, and there really, truly, honestly wasn’t any way to justify a third examination of the steak. “Oh, O.K., I understand,” he sighed, not sounding O.K. at all, and making me feel like the Grinch Who Stole Sirloin. Many guests, I could tell, experienced a kind of cognitive dissonance over being treated to a meal in a restaurant — which is, after all, a theater of pleasure — but having to follow the precise, constricting script of a petty culinary dictator (that would be me). Maybe the hoarders were just struggling with that confusion. When they liked the dish in front of them, they’d forget that they were supposed to eat no more than a quarter of it, to preserve enough for the other three diners, including me, to have a good taste. “Oh, I lost track!” they’d say as they passed a nearly empty plate. The sharers, in contrast, would be so frightened of consuming so much as a strand of angel hair beyond their allotment that they’d merely stare at the dish, visibly petrified. I’d say: “Please, please have some. You didn’t have any.” “But I did,” they’d usually protest. “Didn’t you see?” In fact I had been watching, and my observation, coupled with the survival of a full portion on the plate, was how I knew that nothing had been consumed. The pretend eaters who amused me the most, though, were the skinny men and women who had developed a whole theatrical routine — a pantomime of gluttony — to obscure their asceticism. It wasn’t enough for them to be thin; they had to pretend that it was a fluke of metabolism, magical and effortless. My friend A. was like that. I told her that we were going to a new steakhouse in Brooklyn. “Steak!” she exulted. “Excellent! You’re too good to me!” Reading the menu, she homed in on what promised to be the heftiest cut of beef: “Can we get the porterhouse for two? Oh please, oh please! And the fries? I’m dying to try the fries.” We got the porterhouse, we got the fries, she loaded up her plate, and then she commenced such frantic knife and fork movements that a veritable cloud of dust rose around her — I was reminded of a Road Runner cartoon. When the dust settled 15 minutes later, I took a close look at her plate, and almost nothing was missing. The food had just been reconstituted and rearranged, a Picasso of its former self. Some companions kept track and kept count. They noticed if the four restaurants they’d accompanied me to all wound up with one-star ratings, and they wondered whom I’d taken to the restaurant that just got three stars. Guilt more than girth is a critic’s fiercest enemy. But dining with a critic just as frequently brought out the protective, gallant side of friends. One frequent review accomplice noticed early on, and without my saying anything, that I felt abashed and anxious about my role as portion policeman. So he did the job himself, reprimanding hoarders and reassuring sharers. I, in turn, tried not to throw more one-star than two-star restaurants his way. Companions were fixated on stars, their obsessions underscoring a human itch to codify, categorize, rank and render a verdict. Often, toward the end of a meal, I’d catch one of them making odd, half-hidden hand signals in his or her lap, flashing one finger, then two — or two fingers, then three — while watching for me to shake or nod my head. The companion wanted to know what the star rating was likely to be. Sometimes I obliged, but usually not. But what fascinated me most was the inherent resistance to setting aside individual will for communal mission. When a meal began, I’d always explain that everything we ordered would be shared equally, so it didn’t matter who actually asked for the lobster versus who took charge of the vegetarian cassoulet. This explanation seldom made a difference. “Remember, I don’t eat pork,” L. said one night when I asked if she’d be the one to request the pork entree I needed to try. “Yes, yes, of course,” I sputtered apologetically. While the pork would rotate to her at some point, it seemed fair enough that she not begin with it. “You ask for the salmon. I’ll ask for the pork.” Then I turned to another tablemate and instructed him to order the nightly pasta special. “You’ve already tried the rib-eye on another visit?” he asked, clearly bummed to be missing the steak. No one ever, ever wanted to miss the steak. I told him that I had not, in fact, tried the rib-eye — “I saved it for all of you tonight!” I crowed — but was going to assign it to our fourth tablemate, who then piped up to say that he would be more than willing to trade it away for the pasta if that was best. He didn’t sound willing at all. “Remember, you’re all just temporary custodians of the dish you’re asking for,” I said, “and won’t eat more or less than a quarter of what’s randomly in front of you.” I was putting the hoarders on notice and the sharers at ease. I was also, apparently, bucking human nature. Each guest seemed to think that what he or she wound up ordering was a matter of identity, a reflection of self. And more often than not, he or she would go on to describe and defend that dish as the very best. Even if it wasn’t the steak.

A: support quinn  B: resent quinn  C: avoid quinn A:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"What will Tracy want to do next?\\" according to the context provided is answer A: \\"support Quinn.\\"  The context provided suggests a positive relationship between Tracy and Quinn, with Quinn being smart and thus likely to make good decisions, and Tracy in the role of providing advice indicates that Tracy is in a supportive or mentor-like role. Given no indications to the contrary, it is reasonable to infer from the information provided that Tracy would want to continue in this supportive role. Now, let's analyze each option: A: Support Quinn - This is the most logical continuation of the relationship as presented in the context. Tracy has provided advice, which Quinn has followed, suggesting a positive and possibly ongoing relationship of guidance or mentorship. As such, Tracy's next step would be to continue supporting Quinn. B: Resent Quinn - There is nothing in the context that suggests that Tracy would have any reason to resent Quinn. Tracy provided advice, and Quinn followed it, respecting Tracy's advice shows a positive interaction between the two. C: Avoid Quinn - Similarly to option B, there is no indication in the context that Tracy would want to avoid Quinn. On the contrary, the fact that Tracy offered advice suggests that they want to be involved in Quinn's decisions or life, and therefore, Tracy would not wish to avoid Quinn. Based on the context given, the situation seems to depict a relationship of trust and mutual respect. Following someone's advice often means that one recognizes the other person as wise or knowledgeable, and since Quinn chooses to follow Tracy's advice, it can be seen that Quinn trusts Tracy and Tracy would like to continue these acts of support or guidance.  Thus, from the context, answer A \\"support Quinn\\" makes the most sense as the most probable action for Tracy to take next, keeping in alignment with their earlier supportive behaviour of offering advice."},{"instruction":"Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who said Saint-Saëns's operas were \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s?\\", using the article: Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly.

Write an article based on this \\"Confirm the removal of the review.\\"","output":"Title: Understanding the Importance of Review Removal Confirmation Introduction In the online world, reviews play a crucial role in shaping the reputation of a product, service, or organization. This is because potential customers heavily rely on the feedback of other consumers to make informed decisions before making a purchase or signing up for a service. Thus, businesses ensure that they maintain a positive online presence. As a result, the process of moderating and, when necessary, removing reviews comes into play. In this article, we'll delve into the importance of confirming the removal of a review and the steps involved in doing so. Step 1: Identifying the Review in Question Before confirming the removal of a review, it is crucial to determine the legitimacy behind the request. There are several valid reasons for removing a review, such as it containing inappropriate language, sharing personal information, or the reviewer posting duplicate content across multiple platforms. Alternatively, the review may be flagged for removal in case a resolution has been reached between the reviewer and the business. Step 2: Evaluating the Review Removal Request Once the review in question has been identified, a thorough evaluation of the review removal request must be carried out. This step entails cross-referencing the review content with the guidelines set by the review platform and confirming that it indeed constitutes a violation. In cases where it does not, the request may be denied, and the review may remain online. Step 3: Notifying the Reviewer of the Decision In scenarios where the review violates the guidelines set forth by the review platform, the reviewer must be informed about the action being taken. Contacting the reviewer ensures that they are made aware of the rules and gives them an opportunity to modify or resubmit their review in compliance with the platform's policies. Step 4: Removing the Review Once the reviewer has been notified and given the opportunity to make changes, the inappropriate review can be removed from the online platform. This step protects not only the business in question but also maintains the credibility and integrity of the review platform by ensuring that it upholds community standards. Step 5: Confirming the Review Removal Finally, it is vital to confirm the removal of the review and update the relevant stakeholders, including the business owner or management team. This confirmation is especially important since it signifies that the platform has successfully adhered to its guidelines, ensuring a fair environment for all parties involved. Conclusion In conclusion, the process of confirming the removal of a review is critical in maintaining a healthy online reputation for businesses and review platforms alike. By adhering to guidelines and providing a fair environment for reviewers and businesses to express their opinions and experiences, review platforms ensure that consumers can trust the information shared and make well-informed decisions. Ultimately, review removal confirmation is but one aspect of the larger effort to foster a transparent and constructive online community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Anthony Burns case in 1854 was a notable event in the broader context of the Fugitive Slave Law, which is considered one of the main catalysts for the American Civil War. Anthony Burns was an African-American man who had escaped from slavery in Virginia and had settled in Boston, a city with strong abolitionist sentiments. His capture as a fugitive enslaved person led to a series of protests, legal battles, and eventually a trial championed by prominent abolitionists. Despite the vigorous defense offered by Burns's supporters, the court ruled in favor of the slaveholder, and Burns was returned to slavery in accordance with the Fugitive Slave Law. This ruling, however, did not go unchallenged. Outraged Bostonians staged a massive march with an effigy of President Pierce, labeling him the \\"Chief Slave Catcher of the United States.” The anti-slavery movement in Boston ultimately managed to buy Burns's freedom, and he later returned to the city as a free man. Throughout all of this, President Pierce was acutely aware of the negative perception of the Fugitive Slave Law and the impact it had on the political stability of the United States. His administration believed that enforcing the law would demonstrate the federal government's commitment to uphold the Constitution and maintain control over an increasingly divided nation. By attempting to use Boston as an example to the rest of the country, Pierce hoped to reinforce the idea that resistance to federal authority was futile and that compliance with the Fugitive Slave Law was essential for the preservation of the Union. However, as the case of Anthony Burns demonstrated, the deep divisions and tensions in the United States would not be so easily resolved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Problem:Article: As a boy I was always small for my age. I was also five years younger than one of my brothers and seven years younger than the other. As a result I often felt left out when their friends came over to play. I was either too small or too young for whatever they were doing and they didn't want their younger brother listening in on their conversations either. More often than not I found myself outside playing alone and feeling forgotten. I remember one spring afternoon feeling especially lonely as I sat in the yard behind our house. We lived miles from town and I rarely saw my own friends outside of school. I heard my brothers laughing from inside the house and felt a single tear coming down my cheek. At that moment I saw a large brown dog walking over to me. He looked happy and his tail was wagging as well. Even though he didn't know me he greeted me like a long lost friend, licking my chin and sitting beside me on the spring grass. It must have been at least an hour that I petted and talked to this four-legged angel. He let me pour out all my troubles and share my deepest thoughts before he kissed my cheek goodbye and ambled off either to Heaven or his home. I went back inside feeling happy, knowing that no matter what life may hold I was loved. Now over 40 years later I still remember that angel with a smile. I believe that God sent him in that moment of sadness to remind me just how much he loved me. There is nothing more important than knowing we are loved. When we are loved, we will learn to love others. Learning to love helps us to understand ourselves and other people better.   Answer: Lonely.

The Trump administration called on the U.S. Supreme Court to let bakers and potentially other wedding vendors to refuse on free-speech grounds to provide services for same-sex ceremonies.      Taking a side in one of the most hotly contested cases of the upcoming term, the administration urged the court to scale back Colorado’s equal-access law so that baker Jack Phillips isn’t forced to \\"create expression\\" against his will and his religious beliefs. The brief argues that his free-speech rights outweigh the state’s interest in preventing discrimination in commercial transactions. The court is set to hear arguments, probably in late November or early December. ||||| House and Senate Republicans are throwing their support behind the owner of a Colorado cake shop who refused to make a cake for a same-sex wedding in a case headed to the Supreme Court.      GOP lawmakers announced plans Thursday to send an amicus brief on behalf of Jack Phillips, the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop.      Phillips is challenging whether the state can force him to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding under its public accommodations law, arguing that his constitutional rights to freedom of speech and the free exercise of religion are violated if he is required to make a wedding cake for Charlie Craig and David Mullins's marriage.      The amicus brief, which has 86 signatures so far, will be filed with the court in the coming days.

The government cannot force you to speak where you would choose to remain silent. It cannot make a statement with which you firmly fundamentally disagree. These are foundational pillars of the American legal system and our Constitution.”      Phillips, who will appear before the Supreme Court later this term, said he has lost 40 percent of his business and most of his staff for standing up for what he believes.      His attorney, Kristen Waggoner, senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom, said Phillips should be able to retain his right to disagree and live consistent with his convictions.      “We know tolerance is a two-way street and dignity cuts both ways,” she said. “We need to protect the right of all Americans to live and work consistent with their religious beliefs and not force creative professions to create visual art that violates who they are.”      The Colorado Civil Rights Division, which is named in the suit along with the couple that was denied the cake, said in briefs there was no discussion between Phillips and the couple about what the cake should actually look like.      “Petitioners acted not based on the design of the requested cake or the message it might have conveyed, but based on a blanket policy of refusing to sell a wedding cake of any kind to any same-sex couple,” it said. |||||","output":"The Trump administration is urging the U.S. Supreme Court to allow bakers and other wedding vendors to refuse services for same-sex ceremonies on free-speech grounds.

Information:  - The Allan Cup is the trophy awarded annually to the national senior amateur mens ice hockey champions of Canada. It was donated by Sir Montague Allan of Ravenscrag, Montreal, and has been competed for since 1909. The current champions are the Bentley Generals of Alberta, who captured the 2016 Allan Cup in Steinbach, Manitoba.  - St. Moritz (also , , ) is a high Alpine luxury resort in the Engadine in Switzerland, at an elevation of about above sea level. It is Upper Engadine's major village and a municipality in the district of Maloja in the Swiss canton of Graubünden.  - Mean sea level (MSL) (abbreviated simply sea level) is an average level of the surface of one or more of Earth's oceans from which heights such as elevations may be measured. MSL is a type of vertical datuma standardised geodetic reference pointthat is used, for example, as a chart datum in cartography and marine navigation, or, in aviation, as the standard sea level at which atmospheric pressure is measured in order to calibrate altitude and, consequently, aircraft flight levels. A common and relatively straightforward mean sea-level standard is the midpoint between a mean low and mean high tide at a particular location.  - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time.  - The Engadin or Engadine (, , ; lit.: \\"Valley of the Inn people\\") is a long high Alpine valley region in the eastern Swiss Alps located in the canton of Graubünden in most southeastern Switzerland with about 25,000 inhabitants. It follows the route of the Inn from its headwaters at Maloja Pass in the southwest running roughly northeast until the Inn flows into Austria, one hundred kilometers downstream. The En/Inn subsequently flows at Passau into the Donau, as the only Swiss river. The Engadine is protected by high mountain ranges on all sides and is famous for its sunny climate, beautiful landscapes and outdoor activities.  - Ice is water frozen into a solid state. Depending on the presence of impurities such as particles of soil or bubbles of air, it can appear transparent or a more or less opaque bluish-white color.  - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities.  The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva.  - John Howard Louis Lecompte ( July 28 , 1914 -- February 21 , 1970 ) was a Canadian ice hockey player .

Lieutenant-General Michael J. Hood, , is the current Commander of the Royal Canadian Air Force and Chief of the Air Force Staff.  - The elevation of a geographic location is its height above or below a fixed reference point, most commonly a reference geoid, a mathematical model of the Earth's sea level as an equipotential gravitational surface (see Geodetic system, vertical datum). Elevation, or geometric height, is mainly used when referring to points on the Earth's surface, while altitude or geopotential height is used for points above the surface, such as an aircraft in flight or a spacecraft in orbit, and depth is used for points below the surface.  - The 1948 Winter Olympics, officially known as the V Olympic Winter Games (French: Les \\"Ves Jeux olympiques d'hiver\\") (German: \\"Olympische Winterspiele 1948\\") (Italian: \\"V Giochi olimpici invernali\\") (Romansh: \\"Gieus olimpics d'enviern 1948\\"), was a winter multi-sport event celebrated in 1948 in St. Moritz, Switzerland. The Games were the first to be celebrated after World War II; it had been 12 years since the last Winter Games in 1936. From the selection of a host city in a neutral country to the exclusion of Japan and Germany, the political atmosphere of the post-war world was inescapable during the Games. The organizing committee faced several challenges due to the lack of financial and human resources consumed by the war. These were the first of two winter Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Sigfrid Edström.  - The RCAF Flyers was a senior amateur Canadian ice hockey team, based out of Ottawa.

Information:  - In zoological nomenclature, a subphylum is a taxonomic rank below the rank of phylum.   - In biology, a phylum (plural: phyla) is a taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of \\"phylum\\", although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation \\"phylum\\". Depending on definitions, the kingdom Animalia contains approximately 35 phyla, Plantae contains about 12, and Fungi contains around 7. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla, which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta.  - Starfish or sea stars are star-shaped echinoderms belonging to the class Asteroidea. Common usage frequently finds these names being also applied to ophiuroids, which are correctly referred to as brittle stars or \\"basket stars\\". About 1,500 species of starfish occur on the seabed in all the world's oceans, from the tropics to frigid polar waters. They are found from the intertidal zone down to abyssal depths, below the surface.  - Tube feet are small active tubular projections on the oral face of an echinoderm, whether the arms of a starfish, or the undersides of sea urchins, sand dollars and sea cucumbers. They are part of the water vascular system.  - The term sand dollar (or sea cookie or snapper biscuit in New Zealand, or pansy shell in South Africa) refers to species of extremely flattened, burrowing sea urchins belonging to the order Clypeasteroida. Some species within the order, not quite as flat, are known as sea biscuits. Related animals include other sea urchins, sea cucumbers, and starfish.  - Echinoderm is the common name given to any member of the phylum Echinodermata (from Ancient Greek, , \\"echinos\\"  \\"hedgehog\\" and , \\"derma\\"  \\"skin\\") of marine animals. The adults are recognizable by their (usually five-point) radial symmetry, and include such well-known animals as sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea cucumbers, as well as the sea lilies or \\"stone lilies\\". Echinoderms are found at every ocean depth, from the intertidal zone to the abyssal zone. The phylum contains about 7000 living species, making it the second-largest grouping of deuterostomes (a superphylum), after the chordates (which include the vertebrates, such as birds, fishes, mammals, and reptiles). Echinoderms are also the largest phylum that has no freshwater or terrestrial (land-based) representatives.  - Eleutherozoa is a subphylum of echinoderms . They are mobile animals with the mouth directed towards the substrate . They usually have a madreporite , tube feet , and moveable spines of some sort , and some have Tiedemann 's bodies on the ring canal . All living echinoderms except Crinoidea belong here .  - The madreporite is a lightcolored calcareous opening used to filter water into the water vascular system of echinoderms. It acts like a pressure-equalizing valve. It is visible as a small red or yellow button-like structure, looking like a small wart, on the aboral surface of the central disk of a sea star. Close up, it is visibly structured, resembling a \\"madrepore\\" (stone coral, Scleractinia) colony. From this, it derives its name.  - Scleractinia, also called stony corals or hard corals, are marine animals in the phylum Cnidaria that live on the seabed and build themselves a hard skeleton. The individual animals are known as polyps and have a cylindrical body crowned by an oral disc with a mouth and a fringe of tentacles. Although some species are solitary, most are colonial. The founding polyp settles on the seabed and starts to secrete calcium carbonate to protect its soft body. Solitary corals can be as much as across but in colonial species the polyps are usually only a few millimetres in diameter. These polyps reproduce by budding but remain attached to each other, forming a multi-polyp colony with a common skeleton, which may be up to several metres in diameter or height according to species.  - Sea urchins or urchins, archaically called sea hedgehogs, are small, spiny, globular animals that, with their close kin, such as sand dollars, constitute the class Echinoidea of the echinoderm phylum. About 950 species of echinoids inhabit all oceans from the intertidal to deep. The shell, or \\"test\\", of sea urchins is round and spiny, typically from across. Common colors include black and dull shades of green, olive, brown, purple, blue, and red. Sea urchins move slowly, feeding primarily on algae. Sea otters, starfish, wolf eels, triggerfish, and other predators hunt and feed on sea urchins. Their roe is a delicacy in many cuisines.

In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish.  People in the coastal area naturally get more iodide from food items because the soil has more iodized salt. But farther we go inland, the soil lacks necessary iodine.

He called them Forest and Field. The Forest parcel was covered in old-growth pine, while Field one was covered in grass and wildflowers. Frank was very proud of his properties.  and a hint : Anemophilous pollen grains are light and non-sticky, so that they can be transported by air currents. They are typically 20–60 micrometres (0.0008–0.0024 in) in diameter, although the pollen grains of Pinus species can be much larger and much less dense. Anemophilous plants possess well-exposed stamens so that the pollens are exposed to wind currents and also have large and feathery stigma to easily trap airborne pollen grains. Pollen from anemophilous plants tends to be smaller and lighter than pollen from entomophilous ones, with very low nutritional value to insects. However, insects sometimes gather pollen from staminate anemophilous flowers at times when higher-protein pollens from entomophilous flowers are scarce. Anemophilous pollens may also be inadvertently captured by bees' electrostatic field. This may explain why, though bees are not observed to visit ragweed flowers, its pollen is often found in honey made during the ragweed floral bloom. Other flowers that are generally anemophilous are observed to be actively worked by bees, with solitary bees often visiting grass flowers, and the larger honeybees and bumblebees frequently gathering pollen from corn tassels and other grains.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"The information given is correct but it doesn't answer the question about how many decatherms are in a therm. A therm is a unit of heat energy, and one therm equals 100,000 British thermal units (BTU). On the other hand, a decatherm is also a unit of energy used primarily to measure natural gas, and one decatherm is equal to 10 therms or 1,000,000 BTU.  Therefore, there are 0.1 decatherms in a therm. If you're trying to convert from therms to decatherms, you would divide the number of therms by 10. So, for example, if you have 1 therm, then you have 0.1 decatherms, because 1 divided by 10 equals 0.1. If you have 2 therms, then you have 0.2 decatherms, because 2 divided by 10 equals 0.2.

Hint: Hydrogen bonds cause water to have a relatively high boiling point of 100°C (212°F). Because of its high boiling point, most water on Earth is in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state. Water in its liquid state is needed by all living things. Hydrogen bonds also cause water to expand when it freezes. This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower density (mass/volume) than liquid water. The lower density of ice means that it floats on water. For example, in cold climates, ice floats on top of the water in lakes.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Seabiscuit (May 23, 1933 - May 17, 1947) was a champion Thoroughbred racehorse in the United States. A small horse, Seabiscuit had an inauspicious start to his racing career, but became an unlikely champion and a symbol of hope to many Americans during the Great Depression. Seabiscuit has been the subject of numerous books and films including Seabiscuit: the Lost Documentary (1939); a Shirley Temple film, The Story of Seabiscuit (1949); a book, Seabiscuit: An American Legend (2001) by Laura Hillenbrand; and a film adaptation of Hillenbrand's book, Seabiscuit (2003) that was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Seabiscuit was foaled in Lexington, Kentucky, on May 23, 1933, from the mare Swing On and sire Hard Tack, a son of Man o' War. Seabiscuit was named for his father, as hardtack or \\"sea biscuit\\" is the name for a type of cracker eaten by sailors.  The bay colt grew up on Claiborne Farm in Paris, Kentucky, where he was trained. He was undersized, knobby-kneed, and given to sleeping and eating for long periods.  Initially, Seabiscuit was owned by the powerful Wheatley Stable and trained by \\"Sunny Jim\\" Fitzsimmons, who had taken Gallant Fox to the United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing. Fitzsimmons saw some potential in Seabiscuit but felt the horse was too lazy. Fitzsimmons devoted most of his time to training Omaha, who won the 1935 Triple Crown.  Seabiscuit was relegated to a heavy schedule of smaller races. He failed to win his first 17 races, usually finishing back in the field. After that, Fitzsimmons did not spend much time on him, and the horse was sometimes the butt of stable jokes. Seabiscuit began to gain attention after winning two races at Narragansett Park and setting a new track record in the second - a Claiming Stakes race. As a two-year-old, Seabiscuit raced 35 times (a heavy racing schedule), coming in first five times and finishing second seven times. These included three claiming races, in which he could have been purchased for 2500, but he had no takers.  While Seabiscuit had not lived up to his racing potential, he was not the poor performer Fitzsimmons had taken him for. His last two wins as a two-year-old came in minor stakes races. The next season, however, started with a similar pattern. The colt ran 12 times in less than four months, winning four times. One of those races was a cheap allowance race on the \\"sweltering afternoon of June 29\\", 1936, at Suffolk Downs. That is where trainer Tom Smith first laid eyes on Seabiscuit. His owners sold the horse to automobile entrepreneur Charles S. Howard for 8000 at Saratoga, in August. Did he win his first races?","output":"No, Seabiscuit did not win his first races.

Tsunku, however, decided to give five of the runners-up, Yuko Nakazawa, Natsumi Abe, Kaori Iida, Asuka Fukuda and Aya Ishiguro, a chance to become a group in their own right. The girls were set the task of selling 50,000 copies of their demo single \\"Ai no Tane,\\" in just five days. The girls sold the required number of copies in four days, and subsequently became an official group.  - Biography. Yuko Nakazawa was one of five runners-up in a 1997 talent contest for a new Japanese rock idol. After the contest, musician and producer Tsunku offered Nakazawa and the four other runners-up (Natsumi Abe, Kaori Iida, Aya Ishiguro, and Asuka Fukuda) the chance to be taken under his wing under one condition: they must sell 50,000 CDs of their debut song \\"Ai no Tane\\" with five days of live promotion. The quintet accomplished that task in four and thus Morning Musume was born. The group has since grown increasingly popular and is infamous for its fluctuating lineup, with members leaving and joining frequently.  - Overview. In 1997, Fukuda joined Morning Musume along with Yuko Nakazawa, Aya Ishiguro, Natsumi Abe, and Kaori Iida. Although she was the youngest member at that time, she was the first to graduate in April 1999. She left to continue her schooling and rumours of a return to a musical career have not been realized.

Yes The female symbol is commonly known as the Venus symbol, derived from the astrological symbol for the planet Venus, which is associated with the Roman goddess Venus. The symbol consists of a circle with a small cross below it, representing femininity and fertility. Your statement is indeed a reasonable answer. Carolus Linnaeus, the Swedish botanist, first used the Venus and Mars symbols in 1751 to indicate the gender of plants in crossbreeding experiments, as it was useful for documenting various plant characteristics in his groundbreaking system for biological classification, the Linnaean taxonomy. Although we usually associate the Venus symbol with women and the Mars symbol with men, these symbols were initially used to represent the female and male sexes of plants. Linnaeus' decision to utilize these two symbols was based on the fact that most plants are hermaphroditic, meaning they have both male and female reproductive structures in the same individual. By using these symbols, he was able to clearly document the process and results of his crossbreeding experiments, which often involved combining the genetic material of plants with different sexes in order to study inheritance patterns, traits, and variations. Since Linnaeus' time, the female (Venus) and male (Mars) symbols have become more broadly associated with the concepts of gender and sex.

Given the question: I have a new situation: To reenact James Watt's experiment, John sealed some water in a container. He called this stage of his experiment as stage A. Then he started heating the water in the sealed container. He labeled this stage as stage B. Once the temperature reached hundred degree centigrade, he added more heat to it. He called this stage as stage C. Once all the water has turned into steam, he kept adding heat to it. He called this last stage of is experiment as stage D.  But I can use this background: Continued heating of the water after the ice has completely melted will now increase the kinetic energy of the liquid molecules and the temperature will rise. Assuming that the atmospheric pressure is standard, the temperature will rise steadily until it reaches 100°C. At this point, the added energy from the heat will cause the liquid to begin to vaporize. As with the previous state change, the temperature will remain at 100°C while the water molecules are going from the liquid to the gas or vapor state. Once all the liquid has completely boiled away, continued heating of the steam (remember the container is closed) will increase its temperature above 100°C.  What is an answer for this question: In which stage the water would have more kinetic energy, stage A or stage B? The answer is:","output":"Stage B Justification: In stage A, the water is sealed in a container at room temperature, implying that the kinetic energy of its molecules is relatively low at this point. In stage B, John starts heating the water in the sealed container, which results in an increase in temperature. The increase in temperature causes the water molecules to gain more kinetic energy as they move faster.

Movie title: The Nutty Professor Context: At Wellman College, thousands of hamsters overrun the campus, due to the massively obese, yet loving and kind-hearted, professor Sherman Klump, who accidentally releases them. Meanwhile, Sherman has created an experimental formula that reconstructs the DNA of an obese person in a way that allows them to lose weight more easily. After class, Sherman meets and instantly falls in love with Carla Purty, a chemistry graduate student who is a big fan of his work. After dinner with his obese, impolite family, Sherman asks Carla out on a date, which she accepts, much to Sherman's surprise. The date begins well with Carla showing admiration for Sherman's work, but the club's obnoxious comic Reggie Warrington publicly humiliates him about his weight. Sherman becomes depressed and has a nightmare in which he becomes a rampaging giant and wrecks the city with a single fart that is ignited to cause an explosion. He tests his serum on himself and loses 300 pounds in seconds. Overwhelmed by his thinness, he goes out and buys copious amounts of normal-sized clothing to celebrate, and a 47,000 Viper sports car on his faculty expense account. To conceal his true identity, Sherman adopts a fake name, \\"Buddy Love\\", and invites Carla out on a date at the same club again (while the serum begins to wear off). Reggie is present again and Buddy takes revenge and heckles him mercilessly. Sherman's \\"Buddy\\" persona starts to develop an independent personality due to the heightened testosterone levels of the transformation, causing him to be overly assertive and confident. Klump's assistant Jason witnesses Buddy fleeing the scene after he is identified as the person who left Klump's credit card on the bar. Jason follows Buddy and witnesses the transformation back into Klump. The next morning, Dean Richmond has set up a meeting with wealthy Harlan Hartley at The Ritz to have Sherman explain the serum in the hopes of gaining Hartley's 10 million donation to the science department. However, Sherman arrives at The Ritz as Buddy with Carla....

Write a summary based on this article: The recovery from the Great Recession has hit a milestone: Total household debt climbed to 12.73 trillion in the first quarter to top the peak reached in 2008 before the housing market crash and severe economic downturn led to a historic reduction, according to government data released Wednesday.      But this time, Americans are doing much better handling their mortgages, credit cards, auto loans and other borrowing, the data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed.      Consumers were delinquent on 4.8% of total debt, a marked improvement from the 11.9% of debt that was at least 30 days late at the end of 2009.      Rising household debt — up from 12.58 trillion in the fourth quarter of last year — can indicate that Americans are confident in their jobs and the overall economy.      But, as it did in the years leading up to the Great Recession, the increased borrowing also could signal lower loan standards, predatory lending and eager consumers getting overextended.      “This record debt level is neither a reason to celebrate nor a cause for alarm,” said Donghoon Lee, research officer at the New York Fed.      “Borrowers look quite different today,” he said — older and more creditworthy than a decade ago.      But there are some potential warning signs in the latest data. Auto loan and credit card delinquencies have started trending up in recent months, and student loans delinquency rates “remain stubbornly high.”      Here are the key takeaways from the Fed’s quarterly report on household debt and credit.      A long climb back      In the fourth quarter of 2008, total household debt hit 12.68 trillion. It took “an unusually long time from a historical perspective” for debt to get back to that level, Fed researchers said.      The data are not adjusted for inflation or population growth, so it generally had been rising since officials began tracking it in the 1940s.      But borrowing increased sharply during the real estate boom in the mid-2000s. When the housing market crashed, leading to the Great Recession and the 2008 financial crisis, total debt fell off dramatically.      Some of the decline was involuntary as a wave of foreclosures and other loan defaults hit unemployed and overextended consumers. But some of it was voluntary as Americans tried to adjust to the struggling economy by reducing their borrowing.      From the peak in 2008, household debt sank 12% to its low point in the second quarter of 2013.      Since then, debt has risen 14% as the economy slowly recovered.      Growth in new mortgages slowed in the first quarter with origination balances of 491 billion, down from 617 billion in last year’s fourth quarter, the report said.      After a record year for auto loans in 2016, growth in that category slowed as well in the first quarter. The 132 billion in originations was down from the fourth quarter but up from the same period a year earlier.      Mortgages are a smaller share of debt      A home for sale in Mount Lebanon, Pa., in January. (Gene J. Puskar / AP)      Mortgages now are a much smaller percentage of total household debt than in 2008, the Fed said.      At the previous peak, mortgage debt accounted for 73% of the total. The figure now is down to 68%, in part because of tougher lending standards mandated by federal regulators.      At the same time, auto and student loans have increased their shares while credit cards have remained about the same.      In the first quarter, student loans accounted for 10.6% of household debt, more than double the 2008 figure. Auto loans accounted for 9.2%, up from 6.4%.      Delinquency rates are low for most debt      Household debt has been increasingly shifting toward older and more creditworthy borrowers, Fed researchers said.      The Fed said changing borrowing patterns have led to very low delinquency rates for most debt.      One measure, debt at least 90 days past due, was 3.4% in the first quarter of the year. That was up slightly from the fourth quarter of last year but still down significantly from the recent high of 8.7% in the first quarter of 2010.      “While most delinquency flows have improved markedly since the Great Recession and remain low overall, there are divergent trends among debt types,” Lee said.      Delinquency measures for auto loans and credit cards are trending up, he said. Student loan delinquencies remain high.      The report also broke down data for the largest states and those hit hardest by the Great Recession, including California, Arizona, Nevada and Florida.      California is doing the best of those states, with just 2.3% of debt at least 90 days delinquent. That is lower than the national figure.      Florida is doing the worst, with 4.8% of debt at least 90 days delinquent. Nevada’s figure was 3.8% in the first quarter, and Arizona’s was 3.4%.      Support our journalism Already a subscriber?

Still, while Americans have increased their borrowing over the past three years, the nature of what they owe has changed since the Great Recession. Mortgages and credit card debt remain below pre-recession levels, with student and auto loans make up a larger portion of the debt.      The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said Wednesday that household debt stood at 12.73 trillion in the first quarter. That's above the 12.68 trillion outstanding in the fall of 2008, the previous record. The figure includes auto loans and home equity lines of credit, and isn't adjusted for inflation or population size.      \\"This record debt level is neither a reason to celebrate nor a cause for alarm,\\" Donghoon Lee, research officer at the New York Fed said. \\"The debt and its borrowers look quite different today.\\"      Irina Ivanova/CBS MoneyWatch      Measured as a percentage of the overall U.S. economy, household debt is still smaller than in 2008. It is equivalent to 67 percent of the economy now, compared with 85 percent nine years ago.      And with interest rates low, Americans are better able to handle the loans they've taken out. The percentage of all household debt that is seriously delinquent — meaning payments are 90 days or more overdue — is 3.4 percent. That's down from the post-recession peak of 8.7 percent in early 2010.      Just 203,000 Americans declared bankruptcy in the first three months of this year, the lowest in the 18 years that the New York Fed has tracked the data.      Still, there were some areas of concern. Auto loans have ballooned 44 percent to 1.17 trillion since the last peak in household debt in 2008. And a greater percentage of those loans have fallen 90 days or more overdue: 3.8 percent now, up from 3.3 percent two years ago. Still, that's down from a recent peak of 5.3 percent in late 2010.      Student loans are also a potential trouble spot: They topped 1.3 trillion in the first quarter, soaring by 120 percent since 2008. Nearly 11 percent of that debt is 90 days overdue or more. The Fed estimates that the true figure could be double that amount, because many borrowers are able to defer loan payments if they are unemployed or continuing their studies.      But the overall picture also has many bright spots. More credit is held by older and more credit-worthy Americans, which should make defaults less likely. Older households generally have higher incomes and wealth than younger ones.      Americans aged 60 and older now hold 22.5 percent of all loans, up from 16 percent in 2008, the New York Fed said in a separate presentation in April.      The shift has been particularly dramatic in the case of mortgages, which have become much harder to obtain for Americans with lower credit scores.      Nearly 61 percent of new mortgages in the first quarter went to borrowers with credit scores of 760 or higher, according to the New York Fed's report -- an increase from just 36 percent in 2008. Only about a third of Americans have a score that high. |||||","output":"US household debt has reached a new peak, rising to 12.73tn during Q1 of 2017, according to government data.

The eastern area of the park, where the first developments took place at the end of the 19th century, was then under the local government control of Stretford Urban District; the west was controlled by the urban district of Barton-upon-Irwell. Tensions soon began to emerge between the Estates Company and Stretford Council over the provision of local services and infrastructure. In 1902, W. T. Glover & Co, a cable manufacturing company that had moved to the park from nearby Salford, built a power station next to their works to supply electricity to the rest of the park; the Estates Company had previously approached Manchester Corporation, but Stretford would not allow another local authority to supply electricity within its area.In 1901 Manchester Corporation formally proposed a merger with Stretford UDC, on the basis that Stretford's growth was due in large part to Trafford Park, the growth of which in turn was largely due to the Manchester Ship Canal. Manchester Corporation had provided one-third of the capital needed to build the ship canal, for which it had doubled its municipal debt, despite having also increased rates by 26 per cent between 1892 and 1895.

The international draw of its star players, the huge sums paid for rights to broadcast live action and the loyal nature of its consumers have long made the English Premier League an attractive home for investors. In recent years this has included a number of American billionaires who, having made their money with sport franchises in the United States, saw ownership of teams including Manchester United (Malcolm Glazer), Liverpool (Hicks and Gillett) and Aston Villa (Randy Lerner) as the best way to expand a global portfolio. Stan Kroenke -- owner of the Denver Nuggets basketball team, the National Hockey League's Colorado Avalanche and Major League Soccer's Colorado Rapids -- could be the next to join this elite group after a major shareholder at London-based Arsenal confirmed that she is looking to sell her stake. Kroenke already owns 29 percent of the Champions League quarterfinalists, and needs only one more percent to trigger a complete takeover. Blog: Should Stan Kroenke buy Arsenal? But with the economic downturn compounding both Liverpool and Manchester United's struggles with debt and growing fan unrest -- coupled with Kroenke's recent confirmation of a takeover bid for the St Louis Rams -- would it be wise for the American to aim his sights on owning Arsenal now? CNN's business correspondent Jim Boulden helps break down Kroenke's decision. Why invest in the English Premier League? The recent sale of their overseas television rights amounted to over 1.5 billion, while the domestic rights went for much more. This means the Premier League clubs can sign expensive players on big wages, according to Boulden. \\"A lot of the league's strength is to do with Sky and its multi-billion dollar deal to show the games around the world,\\" he said. \\"Sky gives an enormous amount of money to Premier League clubs.\\" Could Kroenke expect much profit from Arsenal? Boulden says the main way to maximize profit is to keep a club healthy, and deliver success on the pitch before selling it on down the line for a profit. He said: \\"I look upon Stan Kroenke like these other guys in America: the Glazers own a NFL team, the guys who own Liverpool own hockey clubs in America. They only make money if they hold onto them for a really long time and sell them.\\" Is Arsenal a financially healthy club? Yes, according to Boulden. He says the club had to take out a big loan to build its new stadium -- the Emirates, which opened in 2006 -- but that is being chipped away. He explained: \\"There is a small section of seats at Arsenal's new ground that generates as much money on a match day as the entire former ground did. All other seats are gravy, so the amount of money they make per game is phenomenal.\\" The site of the former ground has been turned into flats, which has also generated a considerable amount of money, Boulden said. Boulden believes Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger's model of investing time and money into youth players is also a shrewd move. \\"Arsene Wenger's theory is to buy someone when they are young and other clubs haven't even noticed them. By the time they come good, and most of them do, he would have to pay 20 million to get these guys.\\" He says these players can also be sold on for huge profit, like in the case of France striker Nicolas Anelka, who came through the Arsenal youth system before being sold to Real Madrid for 35 million. Would Kroenke put the club in debt to buy it, as did the owners of Manchester United and Liverpool? The Glazer family bought Manchester United by putting the debt onto the club, and their most recent accounts show they are over 1 billion in debt. Boulden says any similar move at Arsenal may not do the club any good. \\"Arsenal already has a debt from the building of the new stadium, so it would be hard to see how Kroenke would get a bank to agree to give them more debt,\\" he said. Does Kroenke's extra investment in the St Louis Rams limit his spending power? Boulden says Kroenke's purchase of the Rams makes it very unlikely he would also fight to acquire Arsenal at the same time: \\"The fact that he has just ingested the Rams -- one of the worst teams in the NFL -- means he is going to have to spend his time and effort trying to rebuild that club. It's hard to see that he would do that and try to take over Arsenal -- that would be a lot for one person to take on.\\" Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"- American billionaires have shown interest in investing in English Premier League clubs, including Manchester United, Liverpool, and Aston Villa. - Stan Kroenke, who owns 29% of Arsenal, may trigger a complete takeover if he acquires 1% more stake. - The English Premier League offers a lucrative market due to massive broadcasting rights deals. - Arsenal is considered financially healthy, with consistent revenue from their stadium and a strong youth investment model. - Unlikely Kroenke will put Arsenal in debt like Manchester United and Liverpool if he takes over. - Kroenke's investment in St Louis Rams may limit his focus and resources for acquiring Arsenal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: how ot make soap","output":"The process of making soap involves the use of oils, lye, and various other ingredients to create a solid, cleansing product. There are two primary methods for soapmaking: the cold process and the hot process. Both methods achieve the same purpose, but they vary in specific steps and techniques. I will provide a detailed overview of each method so that you can choose the better solution based on your preferences and resources. 1. Cold Process Soapmaking: The cold process method creates a smoother, more aesthetically appealing soap. It maintains the benefits of the natural ingredients and allows more control over the soap's design elements. Here's a step-by-step guide for cold process soapmaking: A. Ingredients & Equipment: - Oils and butters (e.g., olive oil, coconut oil, shea butter) - Lye (sodium hydroxide) - Distilled water - Essential oils or fragrance oils - Natural colorants (e.g., herbs, spices, clays) - Soap mold - Gloves, goggles, and apron for safety - Thermometer - Stick blender - Kitchen scale B. Cold Process Soapmaking Steps: 1. Prepare the workspace and wear protective equipment. 2. Measure and combine oils and butters in a heatproof container. Melt by microwaving or heating on a stovetop. 3. Measure the lye and distilled water in separate containers. Slowly pour the lye into the water (not the other way around), stirring until the lye dissolves. This mixture will heat up and release fumes. 4. Wait for the lye-water mixture and oils to reach the desired temperatures (usually between 100°F and 120°F). This is called \\"reaching trace.\\" 5. Carefully pour the lye-water mixture into the oils, stirring with a stick blender until the mixture thickens to a trace consistency. 6. Add essential oils, colorants, and any other additives to the soap batter. Blend carefully. 7. Pour the batter into the soap mold and tap it gently to release air bubbles. 8. Cover the mold and insulate it with a towel to keep the heat in. Allow the soap to rest for 24-48 hours to set. 9. Unmold the soap and cut it into individual bars. 10. Cure the soap for 4-6 weeks in a cool, dry area to harden and improve its quality. 2. Hot Process Soapmaking: The hot process method involves cooking the soap, which speeds up the curing process. The soap's appearance might be less uniform, but it's ready for use sooner. Here's a step-by-step guide for hot process soapmaking: A. Ingredients & Equipment: - Same as cold process; additional equipment includes a heatproof container (e.g., a slow cooker) and a wooden spoon for stirring. B. Hot Process Soapmaking Steps: 1. Follow steps 1-6 as outlined in the cold process method. 2. Instead of pouring the soap batter into a mold, transfer it to a slow cooker to cook on low heat for 1-2 hours. Stir occasionally to prevent the soap from burning. 3. Monitor the soap during the cooking process. When it reaches a gel-like consistency and the pH drops to a safe range (between 8-10), the soap is ready. 4. Add essential oils, colorants, and other additives to the cooked soap. Mix well. 5. Spoon the hot soap into the mold, tapping it gently to release air bubbles. 6. Allow the soap to cool and harden in the mold for 24 hours. 7. Unmold the soap and cut it into individual bars. 8. Allow the bars to cure for 1-2 weeks before use. In conclusion, the choice between cold and hot process soapmaking depends on your preferences and priorities. Cold process soapmaking requires more patience for the soap to cure, but it allows for more creativity and design. Hot process soapmaking is a quicker method that produces rustic-looking bars ready for use sooner. By evaluating these factors and considering the detailed guides provided, you can determine which method suits your needs and goals best."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As you distance yourself from the perpetrator, take note of details that would be helpful to law enforcement, such as their appearance, clothing, and distinguishing features. Be aware of your surroundings and look for other witnesses or people who may also be affected by this individual's actions. Speak to them and collaborate in reporting the incident to the authorities if they are also willing. At the earliest possible opportunity, contact the local police or security personnel within the vicinity, provide them with the necessary information, and request their assistance to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to address the issue. In the meantime, as you wait for the authorities to arrive, try to stay in a safe and populated area. This not only minimizes the risk of any further interaction with the individual but also increases the likelihood of additional witnesses or help if needed. Keep your phone nearby and be prepared to call for assistance if the situation escalates. Remember that it is not your job to handle the situation alone, as public indecency is a criminal offense and should be dealt with by trained professionals. While it is important to take necessary action to protect yourself and others from the discomfort and potential danger posed by the individual's actions, try to maintain a level-headed approach throughout the incident. Panicking or overreacting could create a negative impact on your ability to make rational decisions. By staying calm and focused, you are better equipped to handle the situation as it unfolds. In the aftermath of such an encounter, it is natural to feel a range of emotions, including anger, fear, or embarrassment. It is important to acknowledge your feelings and allow yourself the space to process the experience.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease.  I am facing a new situation today: Rob is testing the properties of gas. To that end, he experimented with a cylinder of gas in three stages, stage A, stage B, and stage C. In stage A he kept the gas in room temperature. In stage B he heated the gas up. And in stage C he cooled the gas down.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would stage B see increased of decreased pressure than stage C? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the details of Rob's experiment, we can understand the relationship between temperature and pressure in a gas. In stage A, Rob kept the gas at room temperature (300 K). In stage B, he heated the gas up, which will result in an increase in the gas's kinetic energy, leading to more forceful collisions with the walls of the container. As a consequence, the pressure of the gas will increase in stage B compared to stage A. In stage C, Rob cooled the gas down, which implies a decrease in temperature from stage B. According to the background article, decreasing the temperature of an enclosed gas would have the opposite effect on the pressure compared to heating it. So, the pressure of the gas in stage C will be lower than in stage B, as the cooling process reduces the kinetic energy of the gas molecules. In conclusion, stage B will see increased pressure compared to stage C due to the difference in temperature and the resulting effect on the gas's kinetic energy and collisions with the container's walls."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Subject: party                                                  Hi!

Information:  - Her Majesty's Government (HMG), commonly referred to as the UK government or British government, is the central government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  - A favourite or favorite (American English) was the intimate companion of a ruler or other important person. In medieval and Early Modern Europe, among other times and places, the term is used of individuals delegated significant political power by a ruler. It was especially a phenomenon of the 16th and 17th centuries, when government had become too complex for many hereditary rulers with no great interest in or talent for it, and political institutions were still evolving. From 1600 to 1660 there were particular successions of all-powerful minister-favourites in much of Europe, especially in Spain, England, France and Sweden.   - Elizabeth I (7 September 1533  24 March 1603) was Queen of England and Ireland from 17 November 1558 until her death. Sometimes called The Virgin Queen, Gloriana or Good Queen Bess, the childless Elizabeth was the last monarch of the Tudor dynasty.  - England and Wales is a legal jurisdiction covering England and Wales, two of the four countries of the United Kingdom, which form the constitutional successor to the former Kingdom of England and follow a single legal system, known as English law.  - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.  - American English (variously abbreviated AmE, AE, AmEng, USEng, en-US), also called United States English or U.S. English, is the set of varieties of the English language native to the United States. English is the most widely spoken language in the United States and is the common language used by the federal government, considered the \\"de facto\\" language of the country because of its widespread use. English has been given official status by 32 of the 50 state governments. As an example, while both Spanish and English have equivalent status in the local courts of Puerto Rico. Under federal law, English is the official language for any matters being referred to the United States district court for the territory.  - Gloriana, Op. 53, is an opera in three acts by Benjamin Britten to an English libretto by William Plomer, based on Lytton Strachey's 1928 \\"Elizabeth and Essex: A Tragic History\\".

The two-time Academy award winner, known for her incredible talent and passion in tackling social issues, will be at the epicenter of the film world's attention during the highly anticipated festival on the French Riviera taking place from May 8-19.  The announcement of Blanchett's appointment was made by Cannes top officials, Pierre Lescure and Thierry Fremaux, who praised the actress for her contributions to both screen and stage. \\"We are delighted to welcome such a rare and unique artist whose talent and convictions enrich both screen and stage,\\" they said in a statement. Blanchett, 48, rose to prominence not only for her exceptional acting skills but also for her unwavering support of women who have faced sexual assault and harassment. In the wake of the numerous allegations against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, she stood firmly behind the dozens of women who courageously came forward, lending her voice and influence to the fight against sexual harassment in the entertainment industry. Additionally, Blanchett has joined the Time's Up initiative alongside other high-profile actresses who are dedicated to addressing systemic inequality and injustice in the workplace. Despite being well-recognized for her activism against sexual harassment, Blanchett's appointment as the Cannes film festival jury president was not explicitly linked to her commitment to this cause. Cannes organizers made no mention of the Weinstein scandal or the actress's involvement in the fight against sexual harassment in their announcement. Cate Blanchett succeeds Spanish director Pedro Almodovar, who headed the jury for the 70th edition of the world-renowned festival last year. The actress reflected on her new role and her past experiences at Cannes, saying, \\"I have been to Cannes in many guises over the years; as an actress, producer, in the marketplace, the gala-sphere, and in competition. But never solely for the sheer pleasure of watching the cornucopia of films this great festival harbors. I am humbled by the privilege and responsibility of presiding over this year's jury.\\" The upcoming star-studded event holds great significance on multiple levels, particularly as voices like Blanchett's continue to shine a light on the disparities, injustices, and abuses taking place within the world of film. In 2017, juror Jessica Chastain called out Cannes, drawing attention to the lack of diversity and representation in the industry. As Blanchett takes the helm of this year's jury, her powerful presence and unyielding commitment to change will undoubtedly leave a lasting impact during one of the most celebrated cinematic events of the year."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

However, I have to acknowledge that no diet is perfect for every single person and Mediterranean diet is no exception to that rule. The Mediterranean Diet is not for everyone. There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more. The diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways. Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue. Let’s look at some of the potential difficulties. 1. The diet can be expensive. When you eat primarily fish, fresh (preferably organic) fruits and vegetables, nuts, etc. you will find that they are more expensive than grabbing a cheeseburger from a fast food joint or buying junk food from the vending machine at work. But . . . if you consider the health problems you may endure in the future and the cost of health care that goes with those problems, you may want to think twice about the actual cost. The healthy foods on the Mediterranean diet may not seem so expensive after all. How long does someone need to stay on the Mediterranean diet for? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. As long as they would like  B. not enough information  C. until it gets too expensive  D. on occasion Answer:","output":"A.

Angela Hammerly dedicated her life to becoming District Attorney. At 42, she had never been married, or even seriously dated. All she could think about, night and day, was her ultimate goal. And her dream finally came true, thanks to the death of 74-year-old Porter Strickley. She could not deny that she had learned the job well, working for that old pain-in-the-butt. He was 57 when she interviewed for the position of Assistant District Attorney. At the time, she thought he was 70. Two months ago, she had become the District Attorney. She loved seeing her name on the door. And she felt a rush of adrenaline every time a judge referred to her as 'The District Attorney' in open court. The D.A.'s office would be better than ever--now that she was running the show. There was a soft knock, and Andrea Newly opened the door just enough to peek in. \\"Come in, Andrea.\\" Angela sometimes wondered if she had made a mistake two weeks ago when she hired this timid young lady as her assistant. Angela had been impressed with her resume. But in person, Andrea was quiet, and seemed to be rather intimidated by Angela. But Andrea was enthralled with every word Angela spoke. And the new D.A. couldn't resist the prospect of being god to her assistant. She had hired her on the spot, even though she knew Andrea would stress her patience. But Angela was confident the 25-year-old could be molded into her mentor's image. And thereby, become a powerful force for justice in the D.A.'s office. Andrea took a chair across from the D.A. The furniture in the District Attorney's office was similar to that found in most old government offices-largely unchanged since the 1950s. Yet the hardwood chairs and desks were of such good quality that an exact replacement would be cost prohibitive in today's market. Angela planned to upsize her diminutive desk as soon as possible, even if the money came out of her own pocket. Question: Who was 57 when she interviewed for the position of district attorney?

Superficial reasons why Cairo citizens admired Barack Obama have faded. Some Egyptian activists say they miss the days of former president George W. Bush. Egypt's newly elected parliament only recently began its first session.","output":"Title: The Shift in Egyptian Political Engagement: From Obama to Bush Introduction The Egyptian revolution has significantly impacted the way Egyptian citizens engage with U.S. politics. Over time, the superficial reasons that once drove Cairo citizens to admire former U.S. President Barack Obama have faded. Interestingly, some Egyptian activists are now expressing their longing for the days of his predecessor, George W. Bush, as Egypt's newly elected parliament takes its first steps in a new era. This article explores the factors contributing to the shift in opinion and the underlying reasons for the changing political preferences among Egyptians. The Egyptian Revolution and Its Impact on U.S. Political Engagement The Egyptian revolution, which began in 2011, has fundamentally changed the way Egyptians view and engage with politics – both domestically and internationally. As a nation that was previously engrossed in U.S. politics, the revolution has had the unintended effect of diminishing their once-avid following. This is likely due to the immense social and political upheaval in Egypt taking precedence over following the intricacies of U.S. political developments. The Fading Admiration for Barack Obama During his presidential tenure, Barack Obama had a significant following in Egypt. Cairo citizens admired his progressive policies and the hope he represented for a fresh relationship between the United States and the Middle East. However, as time has passed and the dust of the revolution has settled, the superficial reasons for this admiration have waned. Egyptians have begun to critically assess the impact of U.S. foreign policy, particularly Obama's approach to the Middle East, which was considered by some as lacking in adequate support for the Arab Spring movement. Consequently, this has led to the fading admiration for the former president. A Surprising Nostalgia for George W. Bush In a surprising turn of events, some Egyptian activists have begun to express their appreciation for the days of George W. Bush's presidency. While his aggressive foreign policy may never have been popular in the region, Egyptians seem to have come to view it differently in the wake of the revolution. Some argue that Bush's assertiveness and strong stance provided stability, while others believe that his commitment to democracy promotion – even if misguided – at least demonstrated a clear direction that could have benefited Egypt through a more forceful U.S. presence. Egypt's Newly Elected Parliament: Navigating a Changed Landscape As Egypt's newly elected parliament conducts its first session, the shift in political preferences among its citizens stands out. Egyptians are navigating through a considerably changed landscape, where U.S. foreign policy no longer captures the same level of public interest, and previous affinities have been reevaluated. What remains to be seen is how this new political climate will impact Egypt's relationship with the United States and whether the new parliamentary session reflects a more discerning approach to international engagement in the years to come. Conclusion The Egyptian revolution has undoubtedly left a mark on the nation's political landscape, both in terms of domestic politics and international engagement, particularly with the United States. The diminished following of U.S. politics, fading admiration for Barack Obama, and the surprising appreciation for George W. Bush highlights a significant shift in political preferences in a post-revolution Egypt, where citizens now more critically evaluate the influence and impact of U.S. foreign policy on their nation's trajectory."},{"instruction":"Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Sonny (Duvall) is a charismatic Pentecostal preacher.

By Associated Press and Mail Online Reporter Flash-flooding in southern California claimed the life of at least one person on Sunday, as extreme rainfall wiped out dozens of homes and left thousands stranded by impassable roads. On Monday, the skies cleared and crews got to work clearing the roads and surveying and the damage done to some 30 homes in the Mount Baldy and Forest Falls area. Downpours punctuated with thunder and lightning dumped nearly 5 inches on Mount Baldy and as much as 3 1/2 inches on Forest Falls some 50 miles away, the National Weather Service said. In","output":"response to the severe flash-flooding in southern California on Sunday, emergency services, local authorities, and residents have been working tirelessly to rescue, recover, and rebuild. The sudden torrential rain and resulting flash-flooding caused significant damage to infrastructure, loss of property, and at least one fatality. This unexpected natural disaster has brought attention to the need for better flood preparedness and mitigation methods in the affected areas. Throughout this multifaceted recovery process, various organizations and individuals have united to provide aid to those affected. Specifically, search and rescue crews have focused on locating potential victims and assisting those who remained stranded on roads blocked by debris. Meanwhile, authorities have been tirelessly collecting data, mapping out the damage, and strategizing responses for both short-term recovery and long-term resilience against future environmental challenges. The extreme weather conditions experienced on Sunday and the widespread damage caused by flash flooding can be attributed to a powerful storm system that moved through the region, escalating rapidly and unleashing torrents of rain in just hours. The National Weather Service reported nearly 5 inches of rainfall on Mount Baldy and about 3 1/2 inches on Forest Falls, located 50 miles away. Given the severity of the situation and the intensity of the downpours, the area's terrain and lack of proper drainage infrastructure contributed to the widespread destruction, with many roads and pathways becoming obstructed with torrents of water, mud, and debris. This led to the extensive damage to over 30 homes in Mount Baldy and Forest Falls. Damage assessments have revealed that while some properties experienced relatively minimal damage, others have been completely destroyed. Many residents have had to evacuate their homes or relocate temporarily, while they await further assistance, possibly in the form of emergency housing or disaster relief funding. To provide support and relief for those affected, numerous organizations have come forward to donate money, goods, and services. Additionally, volunteers have traveled to the affected areas to assist in clean-up efforts and provide any help possible to homeowners and renters attempting to salvage their belongings and start rebuilding their lives. The southern California flash-flooding event has emphasized the dangers and unpredictability of extreme weather and serves as a reminder to everyone living in flood-prone areas to be prepared for such disasters. As climate change continues to cause unpredictable weather patterns and increasingly more intense and frequent storms, communities in high-risk regions must place a greater focus on improving infrastructure, implementing effective flood prevention and mitigation measures, and upgrading emergency response plans. In conclusion, the devastating flash-flooding event in southern California on Sunday has left a lasting impact on the affected communities. The widespread damage and loss of life highlight the increasing vulnerability of these areas to extreme weather events, as well as the need for better planning, infrastructure, and preparedness. Coordinated efforts among local authorities, emergency services, and the community will be necessary to help these regions recover while also working to ensure they are better equipped to face future environmental challenges."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Now is the best time to lay out the foundation for a good and pleasant relationship with your pet.","output":"Alright, little buddy! We're going to learn how to teach a puppy to use the bathroom properly, so they don't have accidents inside the house. Here's what you need to do: 1. Choose a special spot outside: Find a place in your yard where you want your puppy to go potty. Make sure it's an area easy for them to reach. 2. Make a schedule: Puppies need to go potty a lot! You'll need to take your puppy outside every two hours or so, especially after they eat, drink, play, or wake up from a nap. 3. Time for potty breaks: When it's time to go, take your puppy to their special spot. Wait there with them, and when they start to go potty, say \\"go potty\\" or another phrase you want to use. That way, your puppy knows they're doing the right thing! 4. Praise and reward: As soon as your puppy finishes going potty, give them lots of praise, like \\"Good potty!\\" and maybe even a small treat. This will make your puppy happy and they'll understand that going potty in their special spot is good. 5. Accidents happen: If your puppy has an accident inside the house, don't get mad. It's important to clean up the mess well, so your puppy won't be attracted to that spot in the future. Just keep an eye on them and try to catch them before they have an accident, then take them to their special spot outside. 6.

Solve this problem.","output":"To solve the equation -88*b + 77710 = 1054*b + 415*b + 488*b for the variable b, we'll perform the following steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on each side of the equation. On the right side of the equation, we have three terms with b: 1054*b, 415*b, and 488*b. We'll combine these terms. 1054*b + 415*b + 488*b = (1054 + 415 + 488) * b = 1957*b Now, the equation is: -88*b + 77710 = 1957*b Step 2: Get all the b terms on one side of the equation. To do this, we'll add 88*b to both sides of the equation to eliminate the -88*b term from the left side: -88*b + 88*b + 77710 = 1957*b + 88*b Which simplifies to: 77710 = 2045*b Step 3: Get the value of b by dividing both sides by the coefficient of b. The coefficient of b is 2045. So, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2045: 77710 / 2045 = 2045*b / 2045 This simplifies to: 38 = b So, the solution to the given equation is b = 38."},{"instruction":"Q: Title: Why order this separately?

Article: Sarah Outland's weeklong \\"staycation\\" gave her a chance to explore her new surroundings after moving to Chicago. A day after moving to the Windy City last year, Outland started a new job and never got a chance to explore her new surroundings. After nine months as a resident, she finally took a week off work to visit famous landmarks, museums and shopping centers that were right under her nose. If you glance through a newspaper or listen to a news broadcast recently, you may hear or spot a strange word, \\"staycation\\". Staycation is a new word the American press is employing to describe a vacation very close to your home, or simply staying at home during your vacation. It is a combination of words \\"stay\\"and \\"vacation\\". According to many news reports, these staycations are achieving great popularity among American families this year. When asked about the reason for their expected staycation, respondents stated \\"gas prices are too high\\" (61 percent), \\"travel in general is too expensive (44 percent). The high price of gas for cars and airplanes has made it very expensive for Americans to travel compared to past years. When you combine this with the weak American dollar, it all adds up to people deciding to stay close to home during their traditional summer vacations. For aggressive young Americans who are trying to balance family and work, a staycation can be a great concept. They want to enjoy their homes and the attractions in their area without the stress of packing or making reservation. They won't be paying high fuel prices either directly, at the pump, or indirectly, in airfare, other than the gas required to drive around town. Absolutely, it's friendlier on the environment when locals take trips to attractions in their own area, and not everyone is game for a vacation that involves staying on a hotel compound. Few people live close enough to a real destination to make this worth their while. Question: How long after moving to Chicago did Sarah Outland take a staycation?

Review: This so-called \\"documentary\\" tries to tell that USA faked the moon-landing. Year right. All those who have actually studied the case knows different. First of all: there is definitely proof. When the astronauts was on the moon, they brought back MANY pounds of rock from the moon - for geological studies. These where spread around the world to hundreds of labs, who tested them. And they all concluded that they came from the same planet, not earth: because the inner isotopes of the basic elements are different from those found on earth, but similar to those calculated to be on the moon. I.E. the conspiracy theorists never studies anything: they only take the thing that fit into their theory and ignores the rest. Another wrongful claim from them is that their was wind in the hangar where they shot the moon landing, I.E. the flag moves. There is a logical explanation: the astronaut moved it with his hand, so it moved. And what proves this: well, if the conspiracy theorists even studied the footage, they would see that the flag NEVER moves after the astronaut have let it be, I.E. the conspiracy theorists are bad-scientists, they cant study a subject properly, or only studies it until they have what they came for, so that they can make a lie from that, and make a profit (I.E. this so-called \\"documentary\\"). A claim says that it cant possible have been filmed on the moon because all the shadows come from different places, because there are different light-sources, the artificial lighting from the studio. Once again the conspiracy theorists are wrong (as usual), the same would happen in an earth desert at night, with no light-sources. But i doubt that any Conspiracy theorists have ever been outside their grandmothers basement for more than how many days a Star Treck-convention is held over. The Conspiracy theorists are in denial, BIG TIME. They only see what they want to see. So they make up all these lies to seem important - that is a fact. Now, what is this review like? Options are: (i) negative. (ii) positive.","output":"This reviewer provides a negative review of the so-called \\"documentary\\" claiming that the USA faked the moon landing. The reviewer brings forth several points to refute the various claims made by conspiracy theorists and showcases the reasons why such theories are baseless and false. Firstly, the reviewer mentions the irrefutable proof of the moon landing, which is the moon rocks brought back by the astronauts. These rocks were analyzed by hundreds of laboratories worldwide, and all results confirmed that they originated from a celestial body other than Earth, with isotopes similar to those expected to be found on the moon. This invalidates the conspiracy theorists' argument since they tend to selectively focus on certain aspects that seemingly support their agenda, while completely disregarding evidence that goes against it. Secondly, the reviewer debunks the claim that there was wind in the hangar where the moon landing was allegedly filmed, as the conspiracy theorists argue that the moving flag indicates this. The reviewer accurately explains that the flag moves due to the astronaut's physical interaction and subsequently stops moving once the astronaut lets go of it. This demonstrates that the conspiracy theorists either do not study their subjects diligently or cherry-pick information to create false narratives while attempting to profit from them. Thirdly, the reviewer logically disputes the conspiracy theorists' claim that multiple light sources were used during the supposed filming of the moon landing in a studio since the shadows cast are inconsistent. The reviewer points out that similar shadow inconsistencies would occur in an Earth desert at night, even without artificial light sources. This further illustrates the flawed methodology employed by conspiracy theorists, and the reviewer questions their credibility by hinting that they might lack real-world experience. Overall, the reviewer strongly critiques the conspiracy theorists and their agenda of seeking importance by propagating misleading and false claims. They emphasize that these theorists are in denial and only see what they choose to see, hence their insistence on spreading unfounded allegations about the moon landing being faked. The review clearly leans towards a negative sentiment regarding the so-called \\"documentary\\" and the conspiracy theories it promotes."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Question: -  Some of the rock in the ground is made of limestone - Over long periods of time rain can hit the limestone - And cause a acidic reaction - The limestone will slowly disintegrate - A large gap with be where the limestone was  What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step of the process, after the acidic rainwater has caused the limestone to slowly disintegrate and create a large gap, would likely involve the formation of unique geological features known as karst landscapes. Karst landscapes are characterized by a variety of landforms that are commonly associated with the dissolution of limestone and other soluble rocks. When the limestone erodes and dissolves, it leaves behind open spaces called voids. As more limestone dissolves and more voids are created, the overall stability of the ground is compromised. This can lead to the development of several features as part of the karst landscape, which may include: 1. Sinkholes: These are surface depressions that form as a result of the dissolution of the limestone and the subsequent collapse of the overlying sediment. Sinkholes can vary in size, ranging from small, shallow depressions to large, deep holes that can be several meters in diameter. 2. Caves: As the limestone dissolves, it can create a network of interconnected underground chambers known as caves. Caves can be formed through a combination of chemical dissolution and physical erosion processes. They may contain unique formations such as stalactites, stalagmites, columns, draperies, and flowstones, which are formed by the deposition of minerals as water drips or flows through the cave. 3. Springs: As water infiltrates the ground and moves through the limestone, it can collect in underground reservoirs. Eventually, the water may emerge at the surface as a spring, providing a natural source of freshwater. 4. Karst rivers and streams: In karst landscapes, rivers and streams often experience significant fluctuations in their flow. This is because the water can easily seep below the surface due to the high permeability of the limestone. Some karst rivers may disappear completely during drier periods and reappear during periods of increased precipitation. 5. Disappearing or sinking rivers: In some cases, a river may flow into a sinkhole or a cave entrance and disappear underground. This is typical in karst terrains where the limestone bedrock has been extensively eroded and the surface water discharges directly into the subsurface. Overall, the last step of the process after the limestone has disintegrated and left a large gap would be the formation of a diverse and complex karst landscape. These landscapes are not only striking in their beauty but are also important natural systems that support ecosystems, provide unique habitats, and influence water resources. In some cases, these karst systems can also pose challenges to human activities, such as land use planning, infrastructure development, and resource extraction because of their fragile nature and susceptibility to pollution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: Before the Rains is set in 1930s Malabar District of the Madras Presidency of British India, against the backdrop of a growing nationalist movement. An idealistic young Indian man, T.K. Neelan (Rahul Bose) finds himself torn between his ambitions for the future and his loyalty to tradition when people in his village learn of an affair between his British boss and close friend Henry Moores (Linus Roache) and a married village woman Sajani (Nandita Das). Henry and T.K. are working on constructing a road in rural Kerala. The start of the film focuses on the affair between Henry and his house-maid Sajani. They make love near a waterfall, witnessed by two children who flee. Both Henry and Sajani are married to different partners and both know of each other's marriages. Henry's wife Laura and son Peter return from their vacation in England. Sajani is distraught but Henry assures Sajani that she is the one he loves. Sajani's violent husband finds out about her infidelity and brutally beats her. Sajani flees to Henry's house; Henry instructs T.K. to take her away into hiding. T.K tells Sajani never to come back as she is now disgraced and her presence in the village will endanger Henry's life. Sajani does not believe T.K but leaves nonetheless. During this time, resentment towards the British grows stronger; news about an adulterous act between an Indian woman and a British man would be inflammatory. Sajani's love for Henry drives her back to Henry's house. Henry tells her to leave and admits that he does not love her. A distraught Sajani finds T.K's handgun (a gift from Henry), shoots herself in the chest and dies. T.K. and Henry throw her body in the river to conceal her death. Sajani's disappearance garners interest in the village. Sajani's brother Manas and husband gather the men of the village to search the jungle for her.

Does the term drink mean the same thing in both these sentences?","output":"In both sentences, the term \\"drink\\" primarily refers to a beverage, usually an alcoholic one such as a cocktail, beer, or glass of wine. However, the context and connotations of the term \\"drink\\" in each sentence are slightly different. In the first sentence, \\"Likes a drink before dinner,\\" the term \\"drink\\" is used to describe a common preference or habit of enjoying a beverage prior to eating dinner. In this context, it carries a relaxed and casual connotation. The word \\"drink\\" suggests a single serving of a beverage, and the emphasis is on the act of consuming the beverage in a leisurely manner, possibly to unwind after a long day or to prepare for a sociable meal. In the second sentence, \\"Can I buy you a drink?\\" the term \\"drink\\" serves as an invitation or offer, and it is often perceived as a social gesture of goodwill. This usage is commonly associated with bars, restaurants, or social events where individuals interact and get to know each other. The purpose of offering to buy someone a drink is typically to initiate a conversation, show politeness, or express interest in the other person. In this context, the term \\"drink\\" is not only about the beverage itself but also the social exchange that takes place when the offer is made. To summarize, while the term \\"drink\\" in both sentences primarily refers to a beverage, the context and purpose of the term in each sentence are distinct. In the first sentence, \\"drink\\" denotes a personal preference or habit related to relaxation and enjoyment, whereas in the second sentence, the term \\"drink\\" signifies a social exchange aimed at initiating conversation or showing interest in someone else."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He noted that the album contained less \\"rough edges and attitude\\" than predecessor Vulture Street, and likening the album more to Odyssey Number Five. Sputnikmusic's James Bishop agreed, claiming the band should be concerned by the \\"lack of experimentation or ambition\\" on the album. He again stated that the album was consistent, noting that \\"there actually isn't a bad song present\\".

Winning a goldfish at the carnival was worth all the money to Lawrence but not Neil because    (a). Lawrence liked the yellow fish.  (b). Neil liked the yellow fish.","output":"Lawrence had always been an avid animal lover. He just couldn't resist the allure of the little being swimming right there in front of his eyes, its shiny, yellow scales gleaming like liquid gold under the bright, carnival lights. The immense joy and satisfaction that washed over him when he finally won the goldfish had made every penny he'd spent well worth it. Neil, on the other hand, was rather indifferent toward animals. He considered himself more of a pragmatist and definitely preferred material gains over building emotional connections, especially with nonhuman beings. And as far as this particular yellow goldfish was concerned, he didn’t quite understand what the fuss was all about. Their friendship, a tumultuous yet well-balanced bond, was built on the thick foundation of respect and understanding for each other's differing opinions and preferences. Despite their polar-opposite dispositions, Lawrence and Neil found solace in their shared experiences and had managed to forge a lasting connection, learning and growing from one another. After the win, Lawrence could hardly contain his excitement. He bubbled with pride and joy, already envisioning the perfect little home he would create for his new companion. But Neil couldn’t help but side-eye his enthusiastic friend. Nevertheless, he smiled, respecting Lawrence’s passion and happiness, while secretly wondering if Lawrence would eventually grow tired of the seemingly trivial responsibility of taking care of a mere goldfish. Days turned into weeks, and Lawrence's love for the goldfish only grew stronger with time. He spent a great deal of effort creating the perfect aquarium, filling it with vibrant plants, intriguing toys, and even a tiny, ornate castle for the little creature to swim through. He even gave it a name: Apollo. Much to Neil’s surprise, Lawrence never grew tired of his commitment to the tiny creature. As time passed, Neil began noticing the subtle yet profound changes in his friend. Every visit to Lawrence's house, he noticed the pride and adoration with which Lawrence spoke about Apollo. And seeing the mesmerizing beauty of the fish swimming contentedly through its intricately designed aquatic domain began to have an effect on Neil. He found himself fascinated by the goldfish's grace and colorful, mesmerizing beauty. Slowly and surely, a change began to dawn. Neil found himself feeling a deep sense of understanding towards his friend's love for the little aquatic creature. While he still didn't share the same degree of passion Lawrence held for Apollo, he could appreciate the happiness and profound effect the goldfish had brought into his friend's life. This shift in Neil's outlook ultimately served to bring the two friends even closer together. The goldfish, once a point of divergence between them, eventually became the glue that bonded Lawrence and Neil in their shared journey of love, friendship, and personal growth. In a way that neither of them could have predicted, it was Apollo the goldfish - that breathtakingly beautiful, shimmering symbol of their differing priorities - that wound up enriching their friendship, teaching them both the value of opening up to new experiences and emotions. And so, the story of Neil and Lawrence unfolded, their friendship evolving and maturing as they learned from each other and the countless experiences that life presented them. But deep down, both friends would always remain grateful to the little yellow goldfish who served as the catalyst for their personal growth and brought them closer together, solidifying the already-strong bond they'd forged."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose temperatures are higher happens, how will it affect More mass is burned by the red giant.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"In order to answer the question, let's first revise the process described, as well as the effects of higher temperatures on a red giant: 1. A red giant burns mass (i.e., it undergoes nuclear fusion in its core, fusing lighter elements into heavier ones). 2. This mass burning creates high core temperatures which sustain the nuclear fusion processes. 3. As the mass decreases due to nuclear fusion, the core starts contracting. 4. The red giant can no longer fuse the carbon and oxygen in its center. 5. The gravity of the star can no longer hold the outside layers. 6. The layers break away in a process known as a planetary nebula. 7. Only the inner core remains, which is known as a white dwarf. Now, let's focus on the question asked: Suppose the temperatures are higher, and more mass is burned by the red giant. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned (i.e., high core temperatures leading to nuclear fusion)? If the red giant experiences higher temperatures, it will cause an increased rate of nuclear fusion reactions. Consequently, the star will burn more mass, converting lighter elements into heavier elements at a faster pace. As a result of this increased rate of fusion reactions, more energy will be produced in the form of light and thermal radiation. The perturbation influences the second effect by causing a more intense and potentially faster nuclear fusion process. There will be a higher rate of mass burning accompanied by higher core temperatures, which could lead to an accelerated rate of core contraction and a more rapid evolution of the star. The increased mass burning due to higher core temperatures will also lead to a greater loss of mass by the red giant. This may ultimately affect the remaining steps in the process, such as the formation of a planetary nebula and the final stages of the star’s life as a white dwarf. In summary, the supposed perturbation has a significant effect on the second effect mentioned. The higher temperatures lead to an increased rate of nuclear fusion reactions and more mass being burned in the red giant, potentially affecting the other stages of its evolution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The dentist injects an anesthetic into your gum and it eventually becomes numb. One theory as to why anesthetics work deals with the movement of ions across the cell membrane. The anesthetic gets into the membrane structure and causes shifts in how ions move across the membrane. If ion movement is disrupted, nerve impulses will not be transmitted and you will not sense pain – at least not until the anesthetic wears off.  and the situation: Jake and his brother Jordan both have to go to the dentist to get a tooth pulled. Jake is allergic to the anesthetic unfortunately, so he has to have the procedure done without it. Jordan isn't allergic, so he is able to get his tooth pulled after an anesthetic is injected.

The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate.  Paragraph: Two regions of the same country had very different climates because of the different landscapes. East region had an alpine landscape, was situated in the mountains.

It was developed first by Commodore International and introduced with the launch of the first Amiga, the Amiga 1000, in 1985. Early versions of AmigaOS required the Motorola 68000 series of 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors. Later versions were developed by Haage & Partner (AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9) and then Hyperion Entertainment (AmigaOS 4.0-4.1). A PowerPC microprocessor is required for the most recent release, AmigaOS 4.  - A type-in program, type-in game or just type-in, is a computer program listing of source code printed in a computer magazine or book, meant to be typed in on the computer's keyboard by the reader in order to run the program.  - A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system.  - In computing, source code is any collection of computer instructions, possibly with comments, written using a human-readable programming language, usually as ordinary text. The source code of a program is specially designed to facilitate the work of computer programmers, who specify the actions to be performed by a computer mostly by writing source code. The source code is often transformed by an assembler or compiler into binary machine code understood by the computer. The machine code might then be stored for execution at a later time. Alternatively, source code may be interpreted and thus immediately executed.  - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.  - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.  - Guinness World Records, known from its inception in 1955 until 1998 as The Guinness Book of Records and in previous U.S. editions as The Guinness Book of World Records, is a reference book published annually, listing world records and national records, both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. The book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book of all time. As of the 2017 edition, it is now in its 63rd year of publication, published in 100 countries and 23 languages. The international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in \\"Guinness World Records\\" becoming the primary international authority on the cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records; the organisation employs official record adjudicators authorised to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records.  - Ahoy ! was a magazine published between January 1984 and January 1989 that focused on all Commodore International color computers , but especially the Commodore 64 and Amiga . It was noted for the quality and learnability of its type - in program listings .  - The Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by Commodore in the 1980s and 1990s. Based on the Motorola 68000 family of microprocessors, the machine has a custom chipset with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from earlier 8-bit home computers, including Commodore's own C64.  - The Motorola 68000 (\\"'sixty-eight-thousand'\\"; also called the m68k or Motorola 68k, \\"\\"sixty-eight-kay\\"\\") is a 32-bit CISC microprocessor with a 16-bit external data bus, designed and marketed by Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector (later Freescale Semiconductor, now NXP). Introduced in 1979 with HMOS technology as the first member of the successful 32-bit m68k family of microprocessors, it is generally software forward compatible with the rest of the line despite being limited to a 16-bit wide external bus. After 37 years in production, the 68000 architecture is still in use.  - Commodore International (or Commodore International Limited) was a North American home computer and electronics manufacturer. Commodore International (CI), along with its subsidiary Commodore Business Machines (CBM), participated in the development of the homepersonal computer industry in the 1970s and 1980s. The company developed and marketed one of the world's best-selling desktop computers, the Commodore 64 (1982) and released its Amiga computer line in July 1985.  - The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, C-64, C= 64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64 in Sweden, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units.

Sunday's incident that left 49 people dead and 53 others wounded was the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. The gunman, Omar Mateen, was a U.S. citizen and the son of Afghan parents. In her first speech since the shooting, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told supporters in Cleveland, \\"The Orlando terrorist may be dead, but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive.\\" Clinton laid out a multi-faceted approach to combating terrorism. The plan would disrupt terrorist groups by infiltrating their online networks, enhancing intelligence sharing among local and federal law enforcement agencies, and asking allied nations to help \\"prevent the radicalization and recruitment\\" of potential terrorists in the U.S. and Europe. In an apparent response to presumptive Republican Party opponent Donald Trump's charge that President Barack Obama and other Democrats refuse to use the word \\"radical\\" to describe terrorists who happen to be Muslim, Clinton said earlier on CNN that she is not afraid to use the term, but says she refuses \\"to demonize and demagogue and declare war on an entire religion.\\" Doing so, she said, \\"plays right into the ISIS' hands.\\" ISIS is an acronym for Islamic State, which is also known as IS, ISIL and Daesh.

He became a highly respected and decorated Union officer, reaching the rank of brigadier general (and brevet major general). He is best known for his gallantry at the Battle of Gettysburg, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor. Chamberlain was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment in 1862 and fought at the Battle of Fredericksburg. Chamberlain became most famous for his achievements during the Battle of Gettysburg. On July 2, the second day of the battle, Union forces were recovering from initial setbacks and hastily regrouping into defensive positions on a line of hills south of the town. Sensing the momentary vulnerability of the Union forces, the Confederates began an attack against the Union left flank. Chamberlain's brigade, commanded by Col. Strong Vincent, was sent to defend Little Round Top by the army's Chief of Engineers, Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren. Chamberlain found himself and the 20th Maine at the far left end of the entire Union line. He quickly understood the strategic significance of the small hill, and the need for the 20th Maine to hold the Union left at all costs. The men from Maine waited until troops from the 15th Regiment Alabama Infantry, commanded by Col. William C. Oates, charged up the hill, attempting to flank the Union position. Time and time again the Confederates struck, until the 20th Maine was almost doubled back upon itself. With many casualties and ammunition running low, Col. Chamberlain recognized the dire circumstances and ordered his left wing (which was now looking southeast, compared to the rest of the regiment, which was facing west) to initiate a bayonet charge. From his report of the day: \\"At that crisis, I ordered the bayonet. The word was enough.\\" While battlefield conditions make it unlikely that many men heard Chamberlain's order, most historians believe he initiated the charge.  The 20th Maine charged down the hill, with the left wing wheeling continually to make the charging line swing like a hinge, thus creating a simultaneous frontal assault and flanking maneuver, capturing 101 of the Confederate soldiers and successfully saving the flank. This version of the battle was popularized by the book The Killer Angels and the movie Gettysburg, but there is debate on the historical validity of this account. Chamberlain sustained two slight wounds in the battle, one when a shot hit his sword scabbard and bruised his thigh, and another when his right foot was hit by a spent bullet or piece of shrapnel. Chamberlain also personally took a Confederate prisoner with his saber during the charge. After initiating the maneuver, he came upon a Confederate Officer wielding a revolver who quickly fired, narrowly missing his face. Chamberlain remained steadfast, and with his sword at the officer's throat accepted the man's arms and surrender. The pistol Chamberlain captured at Gettysburg can still be seen on display in the Civil War exhibit of the Maine State Museum. For his tenacity at defending Little Round Top, he was known by the sobriquet Lion of the Round Top. Prior to the battle, Chamberlain was quite ill, developing malaria and dysentery. Later, due to this illness, he was taken off active duty until he recovered.  For his \\"daring heroism and great tenacity in holding his position on the Little Round Top against repeated assaults, and carrying the advance position on the Great Round Top\\", Chamberlain was awarded the Medal of Honor. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did Chamberlain continue to fight following this Battle?","output":"Yes, Chamberlain continued to fight following the Battle of Gettysburg. The quote from the article that supports this is: \\"Later, due to this illness, he was taken off active duty until he recovered.\\" This statement implies that he was still engaged in fighting after the Battle of Gettysburg but had to temporarily stop due to illness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Bob Dylan released his album Together Through Life on April 28, 2009. In a conversation with music journalist Bill Flanagan, published on Dylan's website, Dylan explained that the genesis of the record was when French film director Olivier Dahan asked him to supply a song for his new road movie, My Own Love Song; initially only intending to record a single track, \\"Life Is Hard,\\" \\"the record sort of took its own direction\\". Nine of the ten songs on the album are credited as co-written by Bob Dylan and Robert Hunter.The album received largely favorable reviews, although several critics described it as a minor addition to Dylan's canon of work.

So while it may not contain too many landmark tracks, it's one of the most naturally enjoyable albums you'll hear all year.\\"In its first week of release, the album reached number one in the Billboard 200 chart in the U.S., making Bob Dylan (67 years of age) the oldest artist to ever debut at number one on that chart.

Write an article using the following points: At £63 million, house is most expensive ever in terms of cost per square foot. Listed by Sun Hung Kai Properties, it is one of 12 luxury homes on market. Liveable area just 4,600 ft - a quarter of the size of £140 million London flat.","output":"Title: £63 Million Mansion: Redefining Luxury and the Value of Space Intro: Luxury real estates have always caught the eye of the ultra-wealthy, and today, we take a closer look at a unique estate that has broken records with its price tag. Listed at a whopping £63 million, this property is not only one of the most expensive in the world, but also holds the title for the highest cost per square foot. Let's explore the different facets of this extraordinary house and what makes it so valuable. Step 1: Discuss the basic features & listing information The £63 million house has been listed by Sun Hung Kai Properties, a prestigious real estate developer known for its luxurious and well-crafted properties. Located in a prime location, this estate is one of 12 exclusive luxury homes currently on the market. Despite its high price, the liveable area of this house stands at just 4,600 square feet, making the cost per square foot even more impressive and quickly catching the attention of luxury home seekers. Step 2: Compare the size & cost of the house to the London flat To better understand the value proposition of this unique property, it is worth comparing it to other luxury homes on the market. In particular, let's look at the £140 million flat in London, which is another property landmark with an astounding price. Interestingly, while the London flat's value is undoubtedly remarkable, its size is almost four times larger than the £63 million house, spanning around 16,000 square feet of liveable space. This comparison shows that the £63 million house truly stands out in terms of the value it places on each square foot. With a selling price of approximately £13,695 per square foot, it is evident that this property breaks existing records. Step 3: Discuss the key selling points for this property Identifying what makes this home so extraordinary is essential in understanding why individuals would be willing to invest such a significant sum in a relatively smaller living space. Some of its most notable features include an excellent location, state-of-the-art architecture, and exclusive amenities such as private elevators, a rooftop swimming pool, and access to top-notch security services. Furthermore, the property's limited availability adds to its desirability since there are only 12 such luxury homes on the market. Step 4: Conclude and state the significance of this luxurious property To conclude, the £63 million house's unprecedented cost per square foot changes how we perceive the value of space in luxury real estates. This trendsetting property emphasizes the importance of location and exclusivity, urging luxury home buyers to give priority to these characteristics instead of solely focusing on size. By breaking records and setting a new benchmark for cost per square foot, the £63 million house has undoubtedly raised the bar for future luxury home listings and sales. This house signifies how luxury living is not merely about vast spaces and opulent designs, but also about the scarce availability, the exclusivity of the location, and the unique features it has to offer. With this paradigm shift in luxury real estate, the future of the luxury property market is bound to become even more competitive and innovative."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Sentence 1: I look for GAO to become a model organization in the federal government and I am convinced that, because of our employees, we will achieve that goal. Sentence 2: Because of the employees we have, I believe we will be successful. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"Yes, the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true, mainly based on the logic contained within both sentences. Here's the more detailed explanation: In the first sentence, the speaker states that they are looking for the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to become a model organization in the federal government. The speaker is also convinced that this goal will be achieved because of the employees. So, the speaker is attributing success (GAO becoming a model organization) to their employees. In the second sentence, the speaker simply states that they believe they will be successful because of the employees without specifying the success context. However, given that success in the first sentence was attributed to the employees, it can be assumed that similar reasons would apply in the second sentence. In essence, both sentences indicate a belief in success attributed to \\"the employees we have.\\" The expression of belief in success combined with the reason provided for this belief (the employees) remains consistent in both sentences. Therefore, if one accepts the first sentence as true, it naturally follows that the second sentence would also be true. However, it's important to note that this conclusion is based on the assumption that the success mentioned in the second sentence is similar or related to the success defined in the first sentence. If \\"success\\" in the second sentence refers to a completely different goal or context, then additional information would be required to determine the truth of the second sentence.

The detailed answer can be derived from the information provided in Mr. Reg Simpson's diary. The diary consists of a series of appointments and events related to his professional life – meetings, clients' arrivals, people that require hotel accommodations, and group discussions. However, on the 21st of March, the entry is about having dinner with Bella at King Garden and watching King Kong at 9:00 p.m. This particular entry appears to be personal in nature, indicating a leisure activity rather than professional business. Let's examine each option: A: Mr. Reg's client - This option is unlikely as the entry about Bella does not mention any business-related activities, unlike the other entries about clients. The event seems to be more personal and recreational. B: His mother - While it's possible for one to have dinner and watch a movie with their mother, the diary entries do not provide any information related to his family. The other appointments in the diary solely revolve around clients and work-related events, so it's improbable that Bella is his mother. C: His girlfriend - Given that the event appears to be recreational and separate from the professional appointments in his diary, it is highly plausible that Bella is Mr. Reg Simpson's girlfriend. This entry stands out from the others as a personal activity, indicating a close relationship with Bella. Additionally, going out for dinner and a movie is a common activity for dating couples. D: A stranger - It is highly unlikely that Bella is a stranger, as Mr. Reg Simpson wouldn't typically have a dinner and movie planned with someone he doesn't know, especially considering his diary appears to be focused on clients and professional appointments. It wouldn't make sense to schedule a personal activity like this with a stranger. Thus, considering the information provided in the diary, Option C: His girlfriend seems to be the most likely answer. The entry about Bella having dinner and a movie with Mr. Reg Simpson suggests a close personal relationship and leisure time away from his work."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

During a partial lunar eclipse, only a portion of the Moon enters Earths umbra. When the Moon passes through Earths penumbra, it is a penumbral eclipse. Since Earths shadow is large, a lunar eclipse lasts for hours. Anyone with a view of the Moon can see a lunar eclipse. So unlike a solar eclipse, it doesnt get dark on Earth. Instead it gets dark on the Moon. Partial lunar eclipses occur at least twice a year, but total lunar eclipses are less common. The Moon glows with a dull red coloring during a total lunar eclipse.  Question: \\"What is it called when the Moon moves through Earth's shadow completely?\\" Answer: \\"Lunar eclipse\\" Is this answer to the question correct? Select from the following. a). no b). yes","output":"b). yes Lunar eclipses occur when the Moon moves through Earth's shadow, and a total lunar eclipse happens when the Moon travels completely through Earth's umbra. In this scenario, the Moon is entirely covered by the Earth's shadow, causing it to take on a dull red hue. Partial lunar eclipses, on the other hand, involve only a portion of the Moon entering Earth's umbra, while penumbral eclipses occur when the Moon passes through Earth's penumbra. Although total lunar eclipses are less common than partial ones, they are an awe-inspiring sight for anyone with a clear view of the Moon during the event. While solar eclipses are only visible to those in the path of the Moon's shadow and cause temporary darkness on Earth, lunar eclipses are visible to many people since Earth's shadow is much larger, and they last for hours. Consequently, lunar eclipses do not cause darkness on Earth but rather on the Moon. This phenomenon, in which the Moon appears to go dark or take on a reddish color, is an intriguing reminder of the celestial mechanics at play in our solar system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Part of Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport was evacuated Wednesday after workers unearthed a suspected World War II bomb near the airport's main terminal _ one of Europe's busiest aviation hubs.      Airport spokeswoman Karin Heldeweg said Schiphol's Pier C was shut down for arriving and departing flights while bomb disposal experts checked the suspected explosive and decided what to do with it.      The airport warned passengers that the pier's closure could lead to delays and cancellations. Around noon (1000 GMT), Schiphol's website showed many flights to and from the airport delayed and departures to destinations including Glasgow, Scotland, Gothenburg, Sweden, and Frankfurt, Germany, cancelled.      The suspected bomb was uncovered early Wednesday by workers digging trenches near the pier to lay pipes. The pier houses many of Schiphol's departure and arrival gates.      Nazi forces who occupied the Netherlands in WWII took over Schiphol and used it as a base for Luftwaffe aircraft. It was repeatedly bombed by Allied air forces.      The scare at Schiphol came a day after a World War II bomb was detonated in the German city of Munich, sparking fires in several nearby buildings that had been evacuated after the bomb was discovered Monday. ||||| Sign shows direction to the departure of Alitalia and Iberia flights at Amsterdam Schiphol airport on May 12, 1998.      AMSTERDAM Authorities evacuated parts of Amsterdam's Schiphol airport on Wednesday after workers found an unexploded World War Two bomb, forcing airlines to delay and cancel some flights.      The German bomb was discovered buried underground near the transport hub's busy Terminal C, which handles flights to most major European destinations, the Dutch Defence Ministry said in a statement.      Schiphol cleared and closed Terminal C, parts of Terminal D and one landing strip, an airport spokeswoman said.      A handful of European flights were canceled, while several dozen were delayed, she added.      The 500kg explosive, uncovered during construction work, would be taken to a safe location and dismantled, the ministry said.      Schiphol was a military airport during World War Two. It was bombed both by the Germans at the start of the conflict and by Allied forces during the fighting.      Flights by airline KLM, which is part of Franco-Dutch group Air France KLM and uses Schiphol as its main hub, were affected, Schiphol's website showed.      Schiphol is Europe's fifth busiest airport and handled about 45 million passengers in 2010.      It is owned by the Dutch state, the cities of Amsterdam and Rotterdam, and French airports operator Aeroports de Paris.

Movie title: Once Upon a Time in the West Movie plot: The film portrays two conflicts that take place around Flagstone, a fictional town in the American Old West: a land battle related to construction of a railroad, and a mission of vengeance against a cold-blooded killer. A struggle exists for Sweetwater, a piece of land near Flagstone containing the region's only water source. The land was bought by Brett McBain (Frank Wolff), who foresaw that the railroad would have to pass through that area to provide water for the steam locomotives. When crippled railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti) learns of this, he sends his hired gun Frank (Henry Fonda) to intimidate McBain to move off the land, but Frank instead kills McBain and his three children, planting evidence to frame the bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards). It appears the land has no owner; however, a former prostitute (Claudia Cardinale) arrives from New Orleans, revealing she is Jill McBain, Brett's new wife and the owner of the land. Meanwhile, a mysterious harmonica-playing gunman (Charles Bronson), whom Cheyenne later dubs \\"Harmonica\\", pursues Frank. In the film's opening scene, Harmonica kills three men sent by Frank to kill him. In a roadhouse on the way to Sweetwater, he informs Cheyenne that the three gunfighters appeared to be posing as Cheyenne's men. Back at Sweetwater, construction materials are delivered to build a railroad station and a small town. Harmonica explains that Jill will lose Sweetwater unless the station is built by the time the track's construction crews reach that point, so Cheyenne puts his men to work building it. Frank turns against Morton, who wanted to make a deal with Jill; Morton's disability makes him unable to fight back. After raping Jill, Frank forces her to sell the property in an auction. He tries to buy the farm cheaply by intimidating the other bidders, but Harmonica arrives, holding Cheyenne at gunpoint, and makes a much higher bid based on his reward money for delivering Cheyenne to the authorities. Harmonica rebuffs an offer by Frank to buy the farm from him for... The answer is:","output":"In the movie Once Upon a Time in the West, the main construction taking place in Sweetwater is the development of a railroad station and a small town. This construction is happening due to the strategic location of Sweetwater, which contains the region's only water source. This water source is crucial for the functioning of steam locomotives, making it an essential piece of land for the railroad tycoon Morton. Brett McBain, the original owner of the land, had foreseen the importance of this location for the railroad and had purchased it with the intention of profiting from its value. However, when Morton learns of this, he sends the cold-blooded killer Frank to intimidate McBain into giving up the land. Instead, Frank murders McBain and his family, framing the bandit Cheyenne for the crime. As the plot unfolds, it is revealed that the land now belongs to Jill McBain, Brett's new wife. She becomes the key to the future of Sweetwater and the railroad construction. Harmonica, a mysterious gunfighter, explains that Jill will lose Sweetwater unless the railroad station is built by the time the track's construction crews reach the location. Cheyenne, realizing the situation and the framing carried out by Frank, assists in the construction by putting his men to work on building the railroad station. With the construction of the railroad station and the small town underway, various conflicts escalate as the characters fight for control over the valuable land. This further cements the significance of Sweetwater and the development happening there, as it becomes the central focus of the movie's storyline and character motivations. In conclusion, the construction happening in Sweetwater consists of a railroad station and a small town, which is essential due to the valuable water source located there. This development becomes the primary focus of the movie's plot and serves as the catalyst for various conflicts among the characters, highlighting the importance of controlling this critical resource in the American Old West."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Vietnam's coast guard said the boat was encircled by 40 Chinese vessels before it was rammed, reports said. But Chinese state media outlet Xinhua said Vietnam's boat collided with its vessel after \\"engaging in harassment\\". The BBC's Martin Patience says that whatever the truth, the sinking is likely to further escalate tensions between the two countries, given that for the past few weeks they have engaged in skirmishes at sea. The two are locked in an intensifying dispute over South China Sea territory. Vietnam has protested against China moving its Haiyang Shiyou 981 rig to waters also claimed by Hanoi, at a spot near the disputed Paracel Islands. Monday's incident happened just 17 nautical miles from the rig, Vietnamese reports said. Xinhua on Tuesday claimed that Vietnam had \\"on many occasions dispatched various boats with the sole intention of harassing Chinese-linked companies drilling in that part of the ocean\\". It said China had made serious representations to Vietnam to request that it \\"halt its harassing and destructive activities\\". Vietnamese media meanwhile reported that China deployed \\"a fast attack missile boat and a minesweeper\\" around the rig on Monday. China's refusal to move the rig sparked anti-China protests in Vietnam earlier in May, which left at least two people dead and several factories burnt. Vietnamese legislators are preparing to sue China in an international court over the rig and other attacks on Vietnamese ships, according to local media. China in recent days has upped its rhetoric on the South China Sea. On Monday, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry addressed a recent attempt by Vietnam to list its historical claims to the Paracel Islands, saying it was \\"absurd and laughable\\". On the same day, Xinhua published a commentary in English which accused Vietnam of wanting to \\"disturb and play up the normal drilling of Haiyang Shiyou 981\\". Written by Chinese law professor Yang Zewei, the commentary states: \\"Hanoi should know that such drilling in the said area is China's sovereign right endowed by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\\" \\"Vietnam should immediately stop any interruptive activities and undertake corresponding consequences and international responsibilities for its provocations.\\". Japan has urged calm. Government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said it was important that \\"relevant countries abstain from unilateral actions that raise tensions\\". Meanwhile, Vietnam is preparing to prosecute \\"hundreds of suspects\\" involved in the anti-China protests earlier in May, and has already jailed two participants, according to local media. China has for decades claimed a U-shaped swathe of the South China Sea. But tensions have flared up in the region recently as China seeks to assert its claims in a more muscular fashion with a beefed-up maritime presence. Its actions have upset several neighbouring countries, including the Philippines - which is taking China to a United Nations tribunal. Summary:","output":"The incident at the center of escalating tensions between China and Vietnam involves a Vietnamese boat that slid off at sea, with each nation blaming the other for the incident. This situation is further complicated by the fact that the event happened amidst existing volatility over territorial claims in the South China Sea. While Vietnam claims that its boat was encircically by 40 Chinese vessels and then rammed, Xinhua, a Chinese state media outlet, contradicts this by saying that the Vietnamese boat collided with their vessel following a series of \\"harassment\\" attempts.  This event has the potential to aggravate tensions between these countries due to recent maritime skirmishes and an intensifying dispute over South China Sea territory. Part of this dispute involves an oil rig, Haiyang Shiyou 981, that China moved closer to waters that Vietnam also asserts rights over, near the contested Paracel Islands. The occurrence with the boat occurred 17 nautical miles from this rig, suggesting potential strategic intentions underlying the incident.  China accuses Vietnam of trying \\"on many occasions\\" to use various boats to harass Chinese companies drilling in the disputed ocean area, and has asked Vietnam to stop its \\"harassing and destructive activities\\". In contrast, Vietnamese media alleges that China deployed a \\"fast attack missile boat and a minesweeper\\" near the rig.  This conflict has already sparked anti-China protests in Vietnam, where at least two people have died and multiple factories have been burnt down. Vietnamese lawmakers are now looking into suing China in an international court over the oil rig and other attacks on Vietnamese vessels.  At the same time, China is taking a more aggressive approach towards its claims on the South China Sea territory. It also pointedly dismissed Vietnam's recent attempt to list historical claims to the Paracel Islands as \\"absurd and laughable\\", while accusing Vietnam of trying to disrupt the drilling activities of the Haiyang Shiyou 981.  In response, Japan has called for peace and restraint among the affected countries, admonishing against any unilateral actions that could heighten the tension more. Yet, in Vietnam, there are now preparations to prosecute \\"hundreds of suspects\\" from the anti-China protests in May and two participants have already been jailed. China's territorial claims on the South China Sea, represented by a U-shaped swathe, has been a longstanding point of contention. Recent concerted efforts to assert these claims more forcefully, however, have roused tensions in the region and upset several neighboring countries such as the Philippines, which is taking China to the United Nations tribunal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius said Thursday that 7.5 million Americans had enrolled in Obamacare insurance coverage by the time the dust settled on April 1, but reused to tell senators how many of them were already covered before the law took full effect. The question is an important one: Republicans claim that most of those who signed up are Americans who lost their existing policies in 2013 because they didn't meet the Affordable Care Act's strict and sometimes bewildering minimum standards. President Barack Obama promised that his signature insurance overhaul law would dramatically reduce the ranks of the uninsured. Democrats hope the numbers turn out to show he's delivered on that pledge. She said OPTIONS: - Affordable Care Act is still collecting that data from insurance companies since it has no way of tracking the previous insurance status of individual enrollees. - Americans is still collecting that data from insurance companies since it has no way of tracking the previous insurance status of individual enrollees. - Barack Obama is still collecting that data from insurance companies since it has no way of tracking the previous insurance status of individual enrollees. - Business Daily is still collecting that data from insurance companies since it has no way of tracking the previous insurance status of individual enrollees. - Democrats is still collecting that data from insurance companies since it has no way of tracking the previous insurance status of individual enrollees. - HHS is still collecting that data from insurance companies since it has no way of tracking the previous insurance status of individual enrollees. - Kathleen Sebelius is still collecting that data from insurance companies since it has no way of tracking the previous insurance status of individual enrollees. - Obamacare is still collecting that data from insurance companies since it has no way of tracking the previous insurance status of individual enrollees. - Republicans is still collecting that data from insurance companies since it has no way of tracking the previous insurance status of individual enrollees. - White House is still collecting that data from insurance companies since it has no way of tracking the previous insurance status of individual enrollees.","output":"She said that HHS is still collecting that data from insurance companies since it has no way of tracking the previous insurance status of individual enrollees. This lack of information has led to a debate between Republicans and Democrats on whether the Affordable Care Act has truly succeeded in reducing the number of uninsured Americans or if it has merely led to a shift in the insurance landscape. Republicans argue that many enrollees were people who had their previous insurance coverage canceled due to the new minimum standards set by the Affordable Care Act. They assert that the high enrollment numbers do not necessarily represent a reduction in the uninsured population. On the other side, Democrats are hopeful that the 7.5 million enrollees are indicative of progress towards their goal of increasing insurance coverage. The truth likely lies somewhere in between these two positions, but without accurate data on the previous insurance status of individual enrollees, it is difficult to determine the full impact of the Affordable Care Act on the uninsured population. It is also important to note that the enrollment numbers do not take into account other factors such as how many of the new enrollees have paid their premiums or the affordability of coverage for different individuals. Another aspect to consider is whether the Affordable Care Act has made healthcare more affordable and accessible for the average American. The new minimum standards for insurance coverage mean that some individuals might have higher quality plans than they had before, but it is also possible that these higher standards have resulted in higher premiums for certain people. As the data collection process continues, a clearer picture of the Affordable Care Act's impact on insurance coverage in the United States should emerge. This information will be crucial in determining if the law has fulfilled its goals and if further adjustments are needed to better address the healthcare crisis in America. Overall, it is essential for both sides of this debate to remain open to the facts and to engage in a constructive dialogue on how to improve the healthcare system for all Americans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which arteries supply the head and neck with oxygenated blood?","output":"The head and neck receive oxygenated blood from a network of arteries that mainly originate from the aortic arch, a major blood vessel stemming from the heart's left ventricle. Within this network are two major arterial systems: the common carotid arteries and the vertebral arteries. Each system consists of both a left and right artery originating from separate locations. 1. Common Carotid Arteries The common carotid arteries divide into the external and internal carotid arteries. These arteries are responsible for providing the majority of the blood supply to the head and neck.  a) External Carotid Artery (ECA): This artery supplies blood to the face, scalp, and various muscles and tissues in the neck. As the ECA ascends through the neck, it branches out into several smaller arteries: - Superior thyroid artery: Supplies blood to the thyroid gland and neighboring muscles. - Lingual artery: Supplies blood to the tongue, floor of the mouth, and tonsils. - Facial artery: Supplies blood to the facial muscles, soft palate, pharynx, and submandibular glands. - Occipital artery: Supplies blood to the posterior scalp, neck muscles, and the meninges. - Posterior auricular artery: Supplies blood to the ear, scalp, and facial muscles. - Superficial temporal artery: Supplies blood to the forehead, scalp, and muscles that control the temple and jaw. - Maxillary artery: Supplies blood to the deep structures of the face, palate, nasal cavity, orbit, teeth, and jaw. b) Internal Carotid Artery (ICA): This artery supplies blood to the brain, including the eyes and the forehead region. It has no branches in the neck and enters the skull through the carotid canal. Within the skull, it gives off the following branches: - Ophthalmic artery: Supplies blood to the orbit, retina, and supporting eye structures. - Anterior cerebral artery: Supplies blood to the brain's frontal and parietal lobes. - Middle cerebral artery: Supplies blood to the brain's frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. 2. Vertebral Arteries The vertebral arteries arise from the subclavian arteries, which branch out from the aortic arch. They ascend through the neck within the transverse foramina of the cervical vertebrae. Upon entering the skull through the foramen magnum, they merge to form the basilar artery, which ultimately supplies blood to the posterior part of the brain, cerebellum, and brainstem. Throughout their course, the vertebral arteries also give off numerous spinal branches that supply blood to the spinal cord, as well as the meninges and surrounding muscles. In conclusion, a network of arteries supplies the head and neck with oxygenated blood. The major artery systems in this network are the common carotid and vertebral arteries, which branch further to provide circulation to specific areas of the head, neck, and brain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - An electronic game is a game that employs electronics to create an interactive system with which a player can play. Video game is the most common form today, and for this reason the terms are often mistakenly used synonymously. Other common forms of electronic game include such products as handheld electronic games, standalone systems (e.g. pinball, slot machines, or electro-mechanical arcade games), and exclusively non-visual products (e.g. audio games).  - Konami is famous for popular video game series such as \\"Castlevania\\", \\"Contra\\", \\"Dance Dance Revolution\\", \\"Gradius\\", \\"Frogger\\", \\"Suikoden\\", \\"Ganbare Goemon\\", \\"Metal Gear\\", \\"Mirmo\\", \\"Beatmania IIDX\\", \\"Pro Evolution Soccer\\", \\"Boktai\\", \\"Silent Hill\\", \\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\\", and \\"Sound Voltex\\". The 2012 purchase and absorption of Hudson Soft resulted in the addition of several other popular franchises, including \\"Adventure Island\\", \\"Bonk\\", \\"Bloody Roar\\", \\"Bomberman\\", \\"Far East of Eden\\" and \\"Star Soldier\\". Konami is the twentieth-largest game company in the world by revenue.   - The first game, named \\"Star Soldier\\", appeared on the MSX and NES in 1986, and the series has continued on various gaming systems. \\"Star Soldier\\" itself has received enhanced remakes for both the GameCube and PlayStation 2 in 2003, and a different remake for the PlayStation Portable in 2005, while the latest installment of the series was released on the Wii as a WiiWare game in 2008. In addition, \\"Super Star Soldier\\", \\"Final Soldier\\", \\"Soldier Blade\\" and \\"Star Parodier\\" have been re-released on the Wii's Virtual Console and on the Japanese PC Engine's Best Collection lineup for the PSP.  - Information. The series began in 1997 under the name \\"Beastorizer\\". The game's theme incorporated anthropomorphism, where the player has the ability to transform into a half-human, half-animal creature known as a \\"Zoanthrope\\" (the name came from the clinical term, 'zoanthropy', which is similar to that of lycanthropy, but not just with the mindset of a wolf). The game would appear under the name \\"\\"Bloody Roar\\"\\" when ported to the PlayStation in 1998, which would become the permanent title thereafter. There are three \\"Bloody Roar\\" sequels, plus a game based on a sidestory set between 3 and 4 on the Nintendo GameCube which was later ported to the Xbox.  - Silent Scope 3 is a rail shooter video game developed and published by Konami .

Some birds of prey specialize on migrating waders. Question: What do greater noctule bats feed on?","output":"Greater noctule bats (Nyctalus lasiopterus) primarily feed on nocturnal migrating passerines, which are perching birds belonging to the order Passeriformes. These bats have evolved to take advantage of the high concentration of birds during migration periods, making it a unique adaptation among bat species. Nocturnal migrating passerines comprise a diverse group of bird species that includes warblers, thrushes, sparrows, and many others. Their migration patterns typically involve traveling at night to avoid predators and take advantage of calmer atmospheric conditions. However, this nighttime migration also exposes them to predation from greater noctule bats. Greater noctule bats are Europe's largest bat species, with a wingspan reaching up to 46 cm (18 inches) and a body length ranging from 7.5 to 9.5 cm (3 to 3.7 inches). These bats are agile hunters, using their large size and acute echolocation abilities to detect, pursue, and capture their avian prey in mid-air. The bats have specialized diets that mainly consist of nocturnal migrating passerines, but they may also consume insects when bird prey is scarce. To locate their prey, greater noctule bats rely on their highly sensitive echolocation system, which allows them to detect and track their targets even in complete darkness. They emit a series of high-frequency calls through their mouths and then listen for the returning echoes to determine the location and distance of potential prey items. Once they have zeroed in on their target, these bats use their sharp teeth and large wings to seize and incapacitate the birds before consuming them. The predatory behavior of greater noctule bats is advantageous for several reasons. It provides a consistent, high-energy food source during the migration periods, which helps the bats survive and reproduce. The high concentration of birds during these periods also enables the bats to expend less energy searching for prey, as they can take advantage of the abundance of available food. Additionally, preying on nocturnal migrating passerines allows the greater noctule bats to occupy a unique ecological niche and avoid competition with other predators that hunt during the day. In summary, greater noctule bats specialize in feeding on nocturnal migrating passerines, taking advantage of the birds' high concentrations during migration periods. This adaptation allows the bats to access a consistent, high-energy food source and occupy a unique ecological niche, which has likely contributed to their survival and success as a species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean border guards arrested an American man who they believe was attempting to swim across the border into rival North Korea, a South Korean defense official said Wednesday.      The man was arrested Tuesday night at a river near the Korean Demilitarized Zone, part of a restricted military area, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to office policy. He said investigators are questioning the man about the purpose of his apparent attempt to enter North Korea but gave no further details.      Yonhap news agency, citing an unidentified government source, reported the man was in his late 20s or early 30s and told investigators that he tried to go to North Korea to meet leader Kim Jong Un. He was caught by South Korean marines while lying on the shore of the river after swimming north, the report said.      Last year, South Korean soldiers shot and killed a man with a South Korean passport who officials said ignored warnings to return the South after trying to go to North Korea via a river that runs through the border.      There have been occasional cases of Americans being arrested in North Korea after allegedly entering the country illegally from China, but an American trying to go to North Korea from South Korea is unusual.      In 1996, American Evan C. Hunziker entered the North by swimming across the Yalu River, which marks the border with China. Hunziker, who apparently made the swim on a drunken dare, was accused of spying and detained for three months.      Hunziker, then 26, was eventually freed after negotiations involving a special U.S. envoy. The North Koreans wanted to slap Hunziker with a 100,000 criminal fine but eventually agreed on a 5,000 payment to settle a bill for a hotel where he was detained.      North Korea is currently holding three Americans and the country's Supreme Court on Sunday sentenced one of them to six years of hard labor for illegally entering the country to commit espionage.      The Korean Peninsula remains in a technical state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea to deter potential aggression from North Korea.      About 27,000 North Koreans have defected to South Korea to avoid poverty and political suppression since the end of the Korean War. A few South Koreans have previously tried to defect to the impoverished, authoritarian country, but such cases are rare. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"South Korean border guards arrested an American man who they believe was attempting to swim across the border into North Korea.

In English, this sentence translates to \\"I have decided to go to London.\\" Czech is a West Slavic language spoken primarily in the Czech Republic, where it is the official language. It is also spoken by Czech expats and communities worldwide. Czech is closely related to other Slavic languages, particularly Slovak, with which it has a high degree of mutual intelligibility. Besides Slovak, Czech is also related to Polish and the Sorbian languages of Eastern Germany. The Czech language uses the Latin alphabet with diacritics (accent marks) added to some letters to change their sound. The modern Czech alphabet has 26 basic Latin letters plus 10 special characters with diacritics, for a total of 36 letters. The Czech language has a rich history, tracing back its roots to Old Church Slavonic, the first Slavic literary language, which was created in the 9th century. Over time, the language evolved through phases such as Old Czech, Middle Czech, and finally, Modern Czech, which is spoken today. Czech grammar is known for its complexity, with a high degree of inflection and a flexible word order. It has seven cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental. These cases are used to indicate the function of a noun or pronoun in a sentence and to convey various grammatical relationships between words. Czech vocabulary has been influenced by several languages throughout history, primarily Latin, German, French, and English. Therefore, you might find many loanwords from these languages in Czech, particularly for technical, scientific, and cultural terms. In conclusion, the phrase \\"Rozhodl jsem se odjet do Londýna\\" is in the Czech language, a rich and complex Slavic language spoken mostly in the Czech Republic.

This  would  help ease  the pressure of too many people living in the poor parts of London. From these problems,the idea of the London Underground,the first subway system,was born. The plans for building the Underground met with several problems and delays,but the fast track was finally opened in January 1863. A steam train pulled the cars along the fast underground track which was 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) long. About 30,000 people got on the subway the first day. Riders were treated to comfortable seats (standing up while the train was moving was not allowed), and pleasant decorations inside each of the cars. However, the smoke from the engine soon filled the air in the tunnels with ash and soot , as well as chemical gases. Fans had to be put in the tunnels later to keep the air clean enough for people to breathe. Even with its problems,riding in the Underground did . It carried 9 million riders in its first year.

In the first three months of 2012, there were 11, compared with 21 in the first three months of 2011 and a record 28 in the first quarter of 2010. On Monday, Pakistan's parliament started to debate whether the United States should be made to stop CIA drone strikes altogether in the Pakistani border regions with Afghanistan and also whether the U.S. should apologize for NATO airstrikes that killed some two dozen Pakistani soldiers late last year. Given the high level of hostility to the United States in Pakistan, the results of the parliamentary debate are pretty much a foregone conclusion. The parliament will almost certainly vote against the allowing the continuation of the drone strikes and will also demand an American apology for the deaths of its soldiers.

It establishes a condition for approval but does not assure that overtime or compensatory time will always be included or granted. Hypothesis: \\"Overtime or compensatory time are always included.\\" This statement suggests that overtime or compensatory time will never be denied or excluded from employees' work hours. However, it is making a generalized assumption without specifying any conditions or criteria. Now, let's connect the premise and hypothesis to analyze the options: 1) Yes - This option implies that the hypothesis would be true if the premise is true. But since the premise only states a condition for approval without guaranteeing that overtime or compensatory time will be included, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true based solely on the premise being true. 2) It is not possible to tell - This option suggests that there is not enough information provided to accurately conclude if the hypothesis is true when the premise is true. Considering the absence of a direct link between the premise and the hypothesis, we cannot establish that the hypothesis would always be correct given the premise. Thus, this option is the most accurate. 3) No - This option implies that the hypothesis is automatically false if the premise is true. But there is no information provided in the premise or hypothesis that contradicts one another. It is insufficient to conclude that the hypothesis would always be false given the premise's truth, so this option is not valid.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Analysis of the composition of quicksand shows that there are four key ingredients--sand, obviously water, clay and salt. Together these materials form a structure resembling a house of cards, with large water-filled gaps between the sand particles, which are loosely glued in place by the clay. As long as it's left alone, the structure remains stable. But as soon as it's disturbed, by stepping on it, the clay changes from a jelly-like consistency to a runny liquid. The effect is the same as stirring a pot of yoghurt. Liquefying the clay makes the quicksand about one million times runnier, and the whole house of cards comes tumbling down, with you inside it. Very quickly, the sand sinks to the bottom and the water floats to the top. This is where the salt comes in. When there's enough salt present, as soon as the clay particles liquefy, electrical charges make them begin to stick together to form bigger particles and these also settle with the sand. Quicksand is a mixture which looks like solid, but behaves more like a liquid. Despite its murderous reputation, quicksand does not such people under and swallow them, although it can hold a person in firm grip. The human body is more buoyant  in quicksand than in water, and sooner or later anyone trapped in it will float. Unlike most liquids, quicksand's viscosity, or \\"runniness\\" can suddenly change if it comes under pressure, for example under a human foot. The surface gives way and the victim quickly sinks in up to the knees, surrounded by an area of dirty things that turns semi-solid around its victim. Escaping from the quicksand's grip  requires a large amount of force. Without something solid to pull at, people often find they are stuck fast. Pulling at one leg simply makes the other one sink further. So how do you escape from quicksand's control? Stay still and call for help. Staying still stops you sinking any further, until--with luck--help arrives on the scene. If no one appears and you need to draw yourself out, gently lie down on your back until your...

To do this, we will add 1041*l to both sides. 549 * l + 1041 * l + 84270 = -1041 * l + 1041 * l (549 + 1041) * l + 84270 = 0 [Combining like terms on the left side] Now the equation will look like: 1590 * l + 84270 = 0 Step 3: Move the constant to the other side of the equation Next, we need to move the constant to the other side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract 84270 from both sides. 1590 * l + 84270 - 84270 = 0 - 84270 1590 * l = -84270 [Subtracting the constants] Step 4: Solve for the variable l Finally, in order to find the value for l, we will divide both sides of the equation by 1590. l = -84270 / 1590 On calculating, we get: l ≈ -53 So, the solution for the given equation is l ≈ -53."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Why should a ruling elite give up power because the gross national product is declining or because the country is falling behind technologically? Does it follow that \\"The ruling elite dictate the national economy.\\"?","output":"The relationship between a ruling elite, national economy, and technological development is multi-faceted and complex. The power of the ruling elite often rests on their ability to successfully manage and improve the economic and technological health of their nation. When the gross national product (GNP) is declining or the country is falling behind technologically, it represents a potential failure in leadership and policy-making, making it a valid reasoning for a shift or change of power. However, before delving into the reasons why a ruling elite might need to give up power in such situations, it is essential to present a nuanced understanding of the assertion: \\"The ruling elite dictate the national economy.\\" To answer your second question first, while the ruling elite hold significant influence over the national economy through their policy-making powers, their ability to dictate the economy is not absolute. This is due to several factors, including the global economic environment, unforeseen events like natural disasters or pandemics, and individual business decisions made within the economy. The ruling elite can certainly shape the national economy through fiscal and monetary policies, regulations, and international trade agreements, but they cannot completely control or predict all aspects of it. Their policies can guide economic directions, promote or impede certain industries, manage inflation, and affect business cycles, but they must still work within complex and sometimes unpredictable economic systems.  Coming back to the initial question, there are several reasons why a ruling elite should give up power in the face of declining GNP or technological lag: 1. Achievement of Socio-Economic Objectives: The primary responsibility of the ruling elite is to steer the country towards progress, which includes economic stability, growth, and technological advancement. If the elite are ineffective in leading the nation towards these goals, it signals a breakdown of their capability to govern. Therefore, it’s fair, under democratic principles, that they step aside and let others take the helm. 2. Public Trust and Confidence: The effectiveness of the ruling elite in managing the national economy significantly influences public trust and confidence. Continued decline in GNP can lead to higher unemployment rates and lower living standards, which can erode public trust in leadership. Simultaneously, falling behind technologically can limit future economic opportunity and create dissatisfaction among business communities and educated professionals. With declining trust and confidence, the legitimacy and authority of the ruling elite become undermined, making it difficult for them to effectively govern. 3. National Security Issues: Issues related to the economy and technological development can have direct implications for national security. A declining GNP can lead to cutbacks in defense and security budgets and impair a nation's ability to protect itself and its interests. Technological lag can make a country vulnerable to cyber threats, espionage, and other high-tech modes of attacks from hostile entities. 4. Global Competitiveness: In the 21st-century globalized economy, remaining competitive depends significantly on technological progress. Technological development fosters innovation, increases productivity, and offers new avenues for economic growth. Falling behind technologically could lead to continued economic stagnation, degradation of industry, and an inability to compete in the international market. Therefore, a consistent inability to improve the technological stature of the country might warrant a change in leadership. 5. Change may bring a New Perspective: New leadership might bring fresh ideas, policy changes, or a new direction to reverse the downward trend in economics or technology. Positive change often comes with different perspectives and fresh energy to tackle existing problems. Nevertheless, the decision to unseat a ruling elite due to a declining GNP or a technological lag isn't always straightforward. It needs a comprehensive analysis of the cause and measure of underperformance, the alternatives available, and the possible future trajectories under a new regime. A variety of factors such as culture, history, political stability, and international relations can also influence this decision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer to this question? in which of the following mountain ranges would you find mont blanc?","output":"Mont Blanc, the highest peak in the Alps and Western Europe, is located in the Alpine Mountain Range. The Alps stretch across eight countries, including France, Switzerland, Italy, Monaco, Liechtenstein, Austria, Germany, and Slovenia. Mont Blanc straddles the border of France and Italy, with its summit at an elevation of 4,808 meters (15,774 feet). The Mont Blanc Massif, which is a mountain range within the Alps, comprises several peaks surrounding Mont Blanc. The massif is a popular destination for mountaineering, skiing, and snowboarding, drawing tourists from around the world. Moreover, it serves as a great platform for professional climbers to train for more challenging peaks such as those in the Himalayas. The region surrounding Mont Blanc offers a striking blend of picturesque landscapes, glaciers, and verdant valleys. The towns of Chamonix (France) and Courmayeur (Italy) provide access to Mont Blanc, with Chamonix being the most popular starting point for climbers attempting to reach the summit. The Tour du Mont Blanc, a famous long-distance hiking circuit, circumnavigates the Mont Blanc Massif and passes through France, Italy, and Switzerland. The Alpine region is not only significant for its breathtaking beauty, but it also carries immense cultural, historical, and environmental importance. As the highest peak in the Alps, Mont Blanc plays a crucial role in the weather patterns and climate of the region. Moreover, the diverse flora and fauna of the area contribute to the uniqueness of this natural treasure.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here's a question: Where can humans have a cup of coffee or a sandwich?  Here are possible answers to this question: - movies - idaho - university - cafe - universe  I believe the correct choice is \\"cafe\\", here's why: The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"Cafe,\\" and here's why: A cafe, also known as a coffeehouse or coffee shop, is an establishment that primarily serves coffee beverages as well as a variety of food items such as sandwiches, pastries, and desserts. Cafes are designed specifically for individuals to relax, socialize, and enjoy a delicious snack or meal while sipping on their favorite coffee or other beverages. The warm and inviting atmosphere of cafes often provides a comfortable space for friends and family to catch up, professionals to hold casual meetings, or even individuals to spend some quality time alone while reading or working on their laptops. Let's briefly examine the other choices provided and why they are not the correct answer: 1. Movies: The movies, or movie theaters, primarily offer a venue for people to watch films on a big screen. Although movie theaters may provide refreshments and snacks such as popcorn, soda, and candy, they typically do not offer a sit-down area or provide a diverse menu that includes coffee and sandwiches. Movie theaters focus on entertaining audiences with the latest films, rather than offering a cozy space for people to enjoy coffee and food. 2. Idaho: Idaho is a state in the United States of America, and although it may have numerous cafes and coffee shops within its borders, the question is asking for a type of establishment, not a location. Idaho is more like a geographical area where cafes and other establishments can be found, rather than a specific place to have a cup of coffee or a sandwich. 3. University: A university is an institution for higher learning, providing tertiary or post-secondary education to students. Although universities often have places on campus where students, faculty, and staff can grab a cup of coffee or eat a sandwich, such as a cafeteria or student center, the primary purpose of a university is to facilitate education and research, not to serve coffee and food. There may be cafes on university campuses, but that doesn't make the university, as an institution, the answer to the question. 4. Universe: The universe is the term for the whole celestial system, including all galaxies, planets, stars, and other space bodies, as well as time and space itself. While the universe may contain many places where humans can enjoy a cup of coffee or a sandwich, the universe on its own is not a specific type of establishment or venue designed for that particular purpose. The universe is an all-encompassing term for everything that exists, both seen and unseen, but not a coffee-serving establishment. In conclusion, the correct choice for where humans can have a cup of coffee or a sandwich is \\"cafe.\\" Cafes provide an appropriate environment for individuals to enjoy coffee, food, and conversations in a cozy and pleasant atmosphere, creating a unique experience that differentiates them from other establishments such as movie theaters, universities, and even the vastness of the universe itself."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write highlights for this article: Tom MacArthur, a multi-millionaire former mayor who is battling a prominent tea party challenger for the Republican congressional nomination in a New Jersey district, ran an insurance company accused of cheating disaster victims, MailOnline can reveal. From 2002 until late 2010, MacArthur was chairman of the board of York Risk Services Group, a unit of the global insurer American International Group. He was also the company's president and CEO from 1999 to 2009 and a major shareholder until at least 2006. York boasts on its website that 'We re-price 500,000 medical bills per year and save clients an average of 61% on each bill.' That cost-cutting focus caught up with the company in 2008 after Hurricane Ike devastated the U.S. Gulf coast and a massive wildfire laid waste to hundreds of homes in Sylmar, California. It ended up settling two Ike-related lawsuits and paying a sizable fine to the state of California in connection with allegations of underpaying claims from the fire's victims. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Tom MacArthur (L), a former New Jersey Mayor, ran a controversial insurance company sued for low-balling payouts after Hurricane Ike (R) A massive 2008 wildfire consumed most of the Oakridge Mobile home park near Sylmar, Calif. York and another company paid 285,000 to settle claims that they cheated more than 100 homeowners out of portions of their insurance payouts. York isn't a traditional insurer, but its clients are. It helps them save money by carefully vetting and processing their claims. Ritchie Venier, the company's senior vice president, told MailOnline that 'the amount of work we do is determined by what our clients would like us to process on their behalf.' 'However, since we are not an insurance company we do not play the role of one.' York's apparent hand in determining the size of claim payouts, however, has landed it in the same legal hot water as the companies it serves, facing legal accusations along with them of unfairly slow-walking, low-balling or denying claims. MacArthur, the New Jersey congressional candidate, is not named personally in any of the legal actions described in this report, but he was both a York officer and a major shareholder. The Port of Galveston, Texas, which suffered extensive damage following Hurricane Ike in 2008, filed a lawsuit against York and three other insurers. Both the storm and the resulting insurance claims came on MacArthur's watch. And York, along with another AIG unit, paid the state of California a 285,000 settlement. following charges that they violated the state's Fair Claims Settlement. Practice regulations while handling damage claims following a massive. November 14, 2008 fire in the town of Sylmar. That blaze, known in the American West as the Sayre fire, burned more than 11,000 acres of forest and destroyed 600 structures and 480 mobile homes. It also produced hundreds of 'total loss' homeowners claims, including those covering 370. mobile home policies held by AIG's New Hampshire Insurance Company. The. California Department of Insurance claimed that the two companies had underpaid the devastated homeowners by 10.8 million. York, led by MacArthur, was responsible for processing and evaluating those claims as part of New Hampshire Insurance's outsourcing strategy. The two companies each paid half the penalty, or 142,500, according to court documents. Both denied wrongdoing, but agreed to a settlement in August 2012 to end California's years-long investigation into 125 separate alleged violations of the California Insurance Code. Much of coastal Texas, including Galveston and cities as far inland as Houston, were slammed with flood and wind damage after Hurricane Ike hit in September 2008. Water everywhere: Insurers paid out 16.2 billion in claims after Hurricane Ike, with another estimated 1.2 billion coming after litigation. The two suits related to Hurricane Ike, the massive 2008 storm that swept through the Gulf Coast and crippled coastal Texas, were settled with undisclosed terms. One, filed by Houston Baptist University, alleged that York low-balled its settlement offer after the hurricane laid waste to its main administration building and student center. Robert Sloan, the school's president, told The campus Collegian newspaper that it would cost more than 21 million to repair and rebuild the structure. But ACE American Insurance Company and York, which evaluated and vetted the claim, offered about 5 million. 'They drug [sic] their feet,' Sloan said in 2010 of the case that began during MacArthur's tenure. 'They. weren’t very responsive. They obviously have not paid us what they owe. us under our coverage. I don’t think the insurance company has acted in. good faith.' Terms of York's 2011 settlement with Houston Baptist University – which came only after MacArthur left – were kept sealed. But on February 22, 2011 Sloan told the school's trustees that he 'went to bed the other night with a big grin on my face, and when I woke up, it was still there.' The university president was happy enough about the size of the checks York and ACE wrote to credit the Almighty with the result. 'This is a testament to the goodness and faithfulness of God,' he said, according to the campus paper. Another. Hurricane Ike legal action involving York came from the Port of. Galveston on the Gulf of Mexico. The Texas harbor was insured for at least 55. million, with Lexington Insurance Company owing the last 15 million. after other insurers had paid their part. York was the company tasked with evaluating and processing the Galveston claim for Lexington. 'Lexington. owed us the last layer of our insurance, which was 15 million,' Port of. Galveston Director Michael Mierzwa told the Houston-based Guidry News – which reported that the port recovered the entire 15 million in a 2012 settlement without going to trial. The pool of insurers 'had got to 40 million and had stopped paying us; and that’s why we sued them,' he said. The California wildfire turned a thriving community of more than 600 homes into a ghost town, with the California government finding more than 10 million in underpaid insurance settlements. After the fire: Hundreds of homeowners were left with bricks steps and concrete slabs where their prefabricated homes had stood, and the state of California pursued York and another insurance company for allegedly cheating them out of 10.8 million. The Republican National Committee has embraced MacArthur as one of its so-called 'young guns,' suggesting a vigor and fearlessness usually associated with strong retail campaigners. But according to the Newark Star-Ledger, a 2 million cash loan from MacArthur's personal wealth makes up nearly his entire election war chest. He is running a tight race with tea party favorite Steve Lonegan. Both men are former mayors of New Jersey towns. MacArthur's cash-on-hand, though, reportedly dwarfs Lonegan's by a 10-to-1 margin. 'I’m not going to buy a congressional seat,' Lonegan told the Star-Ledger on April 15. 'I could put a lot more money in the race. I’m not going to because you don’t buy your seat. You earn it.' MacArthur has insisted that he is raising money from ordinary New Jerseyans as the June 3 primary election draws near. Russell, his campaign spokesman, emailed MailOnline an aggressive statement, lashing out at Lonegan – who he claimed was responsible for this report. 'Another day, another embarrassment for Steve Lonegan,' Russel wrote, complaining that the tea partier's campaign 'would go to such extreme and underhanded lengths to plant a hatchet job story, and then fail to get their facts straight.' 'Under Tom MacArthur’s leadership,. York handled upwards of one million insurance claims,' Russell added. 'From that, the best Lonegan’s crew could do was find three. cases – all of which were settled after Tom had already left the company. and none of which found wrongdoing by York.' 'Two. of the cases were settled out of court and dismissed, and the third was. a case pressed by an ultra-liberal California Democrat politician that. was also ultimately settled.' Houston Baptist University president Robert Sloan fought York Risk Services Group and its client over unpaid millions to fix a campus building hit by Hurricane Ike, winning an undisclosed  settlement that he attributed to divine intervention. Former Bogota, N.J., Mayor Steve Lonegan, last year's U.S. Senate also-ran, is a tea party favorite who might benefit if revelations about Tom MacArthur's past cause him electoral troubles. Lonegan lost a shot at a U.S. Senate seat last year, falling in a special election to defeat then-Newark mayor Cory Booker. But in that race, he carried the 3rd Congressional District that he now wants to represent in Congress. Three Democrats are vying to face the Republican victor, including lawyers Aimee Belgard and Howard Kleinhendler, and Lyndon Larouche devotee Bruce Todd. The eventual winner in November will replace two-term Rep. Jon Runyan, a former pro football player who is retiring. In a March poll sponsored by PolitickerNJ, Lonegan held a commanding lead with 41 per cent support. MacArthur 'barely moved the needle' with 2 per cent, the political website reported. But that was in a three-way race: Toms River, NJ city councilman Mo HIll withdrew from the race last month and later endorsed MacArthur. Since then, MacArthur has surged forward but it's unclear by how much – or how little. The state's Republican establishment has also coalesced around MacArthur, with GOP parties in both counties straddling the 3rd district endorsing him in late March. His campaign website describes him as 'a self-made businessman running for Congress to be a leader in promoting policies that spur job creation and empower people; that ensure our recovery and renewal in the wake of [Hurricane] Sandy.' MacArthur is quoted on the site saying he believes in a small federal government that, among other things, 'gives a hand up to those in need.'

If everyone has a car and drives anywhere they want to go, there will be serious traffic problems on the road. Luckily, trains are a good form of public transport. British people use trains a lot. This is especially so for people who are travelling from London to Paris. Every day about 20 trains leave London. They travel at a very high speed and people feel glad that the trains take only 2 hours and 30 minutes to reach Paris. It's much faster to travel by train than by bus or by car. This is because people have to drive cars or buses very carefully and lowly for many reasons, such as speed limits and traffic jams. However, when you are travelling by train, the speed is almost the same and there is no traffic jam for a train. Besides, Londoners think taking a train is one of the safest ways of travelling on the ground. Trains take quite a number of quality tests while they are made. More importantly, they have to take many safety checks before they are used on the rail track. What's more, trains in Britain are comfortable and provide fine services for their users.

Choose your answer from: --no. --yes.","output":"--no. While both questions are related to the popular television series Game of Thrones, they address different aspects of the story. Let's analyze each question separately. 1. Does it make sense for Tommen to do what he did? To provide an adequate answer, let's recall what Tommen did. Tommen Baratheon, the youngest of the Baratheon children, is crowned king after his brother Joffrey's death. Throughout his rule, he is manipulated by several characters, including his mother Cersei Lannister and the High Sparrow. In the series, Tommen ultimately takes his own life after Cersei destroys the Sept of Baelor, which results in the death of his wife, Margaery Tyrell, and many other individuals. There are arguments for and against the idea that Tommen's actions made sense. On one hand, his decision to take his life can be attributed to feelings of despair, guilt, and a perceived lack of control. Losing his wife, coupled with his mother's ruthless manipulation and his inability to assert his authority contributed to his extreme emotional state. In that context, his actions might have made sense from a character development and narrative standpoint. On the other hand, some viewers may argue that Tommen's suicide was somewhat contrived for the sake of drama and shock value. There were potential alternatives for his character, such as seeking guidance from others or taking action against his mother, but the show chose a more tragic resolution. 2. What are some plot holes in Game of Thrones? Throughout the eight seasons of Game of Thrones, there are instances of plot holes, inconsistencies, and unaddressed storylines. Here are a few significant examples: - Travel times: There are inconsistencies in travel times for certain characters, with distances across Westeros being covered seemingly too quickly. This is particularly noticeable with Euron Greyjoy's fleet and Daenerys Targaryen's dragons. - Littlefinger's demise: Petyr Baelish's character arc and his sudden demise at the hands of the Stark sisters seemed rushed and out of character for the cunning manipulator that viewers had come to know. - Bran Stark's abilities: The extent of Bran's powers as the Three-Eyed Raven is not always clear, leaving viewers wondering why he doesn't utilize them more effectively for the benefit of his family. - Character motivations: Certain characters' motivations change abruptly, with little explanation or justification. This is perhaps most notable in Daenerys Targaryen's transformation into the Mad Queen, which some fans found to be an unearned character turn. As for the multi-choice problem, the appropriate answer is \\"--no\\" because even though both questions are related to Game of Thrones, they discuss different aspects of the series - one being character-specific and the other addressing broader plot holes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on this summary: al-jazeera on television is causing trouble for british pubs but it 's not political Text:","output":"Title: Al-Jazeera on Television Sparks Unrest in British Pubs, Unrelated to Politics In a surprising twist of events, the presence of Al-Jazeera on television sets has been causing turmoil in British pubs across the nation. This disruption, it should be noted, is not politically driven, but rather stems from some unforeseen consequences. Al-Jazeera, the Middle Eastern news network, has recently gained access to a wide variety of British sports broadcasts, which has resulted in the network being increasingly present in pubs, where locals gather to watch their favourite matches. This has inadvertently led to some tension among pub-goers. The complaints surrounding Al-Jazeera's broadcasts appear to be centred primarily around language barriers, strong accents, and unfamiliar names. British fans, accustomed to their local commentators, have found it challenging to follow the games being displayed. The fact that the disruption is non-political highlights a significant cultural disconnect, despite the mutual love for sports. Publicans and pub-owners are also feeling the strain. With a growing number of complaints from customers, many are trying to identify ways to appease their clientele without hurting their business. Some pubs have opted to switch their broadcasts back to local channels, albeit at a higher cost, to maintain their patronage and reduce tension among customers. In conclusion, while the presence of Al-Jazeera on television screens in British pubs is causing difficulties, it is important to emphasize that these issues are not politically fueled. Rather, the situation shines light on the cultural differences that can emerge even in the shared world of sports entertainment. Moving forward, it remains to be seen how publicans, broadcasters, and fans will adapt to bridge these gaps and foster an environment of unity and enjoyment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When he cannot talk a hostage-taker into surrendering, he offers himself as an additional hostage and lures the subject into a position where he can be taken down with the minimum use of force, rather than an all-out assault.Roman is middle-aged and recently married. While celebrating his most recent success, he is approached by his colleague Nathan 'Nate' Roenick (Guilfoyle) who warns him that large sums of money are being embezzled from the Chicago Police Department's disability fund of which Roman is on the board. Roenick has an informant with whom he was at the Police Academy and served with for a while, but refuses to name him. Later that evening, Roman is summoned via his pager for another meeting with Roenick but instead finds him dead by gunshot wounds.The case goes badly for Roman when it is assigned to Inspector Niebaum (Walsh) of the Internal Affairs Division (IAD) whom Roenick claimed was part of the embezzling. Furthermore the gun used to kill Roenick was one of three that were part of a case Roman handled in the past: two were recovered but not the third. Documents found in Roman's house indicate that the money has gone to an offshore account of which he denies any knowledge.Facing serious charges, suspended from the force and rejected by his friends, including Roenick's widow, a frustrated Roman storms into Niebaum's office and, in the chaos that follows, takes him and several others hostage, including his personal assistant Maggie (Fallon), police Commander Grant Frost (Rifkin) and two-bit con-man Rudy Timmons (Giamatti).With the building evacuated and placed under siege by police and FBI, Roman issues his conditions which include finding Roenick's informant and summoning police Lieutenant Chris Sabian (Spacey), another top negotiator. Sabian, who has been trying rather unsuccessfully to negotiate peace between his sulking wife (Keller) and cheeky daughter (Mulrooney), arrives on the scene. Roman and Sabian have only met once...

[B]. a dog. [C]. a bird. [D]. a cat.","output":"[A]. a chameleon. Out of the given choices, a chameleon would be the most likely animal to be in disguise. Chameleons are known for their remarkable ability to change their skin color rapidly to blend in with their surroundings or to hide from predators. This biological adaptation allows them to easily disguise themselves within their natural environment. This characteristic is unique among the options presented and is the primary reason why the chameleon is the most likely candidate for an animal in disguise. Chameleons possess special cells called chromatophores in the outermost layers of their skin. These cells contain pigments and structural components that can change color by reflecting different wavelengths of light. By manipulating the concentration and distribution of these pigments within their chromatophores, chameleons can change their appearance quickly and effectively. This process can be triggered by various factors such as temperature, mood, or even in response to a perceived threat. While other animals can employ camouflage to a certain degree, such as a bird or a cat, their ability to do so is limited by comparison. For birds, their plumage might be designed for blending into their surroundings, but it doesn't allow them to change their appearance actively. Cats, on the other hand, might rely on stealth and the careful selection of hiding spots, but they cannot alter their appearance at will like chameleons can. Dogs, on the other hand, typically do not have any natural abilities to blend into their surroundings or to change their appearance as a form of disguise. While some types of dogs have coloring and markings that may help them blend in with the environment, this is generally not considered nearly as effective as the chameleon's ability to change its color actively. In conclusion, the chameleon is the most likely animal to be in disguise among the given options due to its remarkable ability to actively change its appearance to hide from potential threats or blend into its surroundings. Chameleons have evolved this capability as an essential survival tool in their natural habitat, making them the clear choice for the animal most likely to be disguised."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Born in Glen Dale, West Virginia, Brett was the youngest of four sons of a sports-minded family which included Ken, the second oldest, a major league pitcher who pitched in the 1967 World Series at age 19. Brothers John (eldest) and Bobby had brief careers in the minor leagues. Although his three older brothers were born in Brooklyn, George was born in the northern panhandle of West Virginia. Jack and Ethel Brett then moved the family to the Midwest and three years later to El Segundo, California, a suburb of Los Angeles, just south of Los Angeles International Airport. On July 24, 1983, the Royals played the Yankees at Yankee Stadium. In the top of the ninth inning with two out, Brett hit a go-ahead two-run homer off of Goose Gossage to put the Royals up 5-4. Upon Brett crossing the plate, Yankees manager Billy Martin cited to the umpires a rule that stated that any foreign substance on a bat could extend no further than 18 inches from the knob. The umpires measured the amount of pine tar, a legal substance used by hitters to improve their grip, on Brett's bat; the pine tar extended about 24 inches. The home plate umpire, Tim McClelland, signaled Brett out, ending the game as a Yankees win. In a now famous image, an enraged Brett charged out of the dugout sprinting directly toward McClelland and had to be physically restrained by two umpires and a Royals coach.  The Royals protested the game, and American League president Lee MacPhail upheld the protest, reasoning that the bat should have been excluded from future use but the home run should not have been nullified. Amid much controversy, the game was resumed on August 18 from the point of Brett's home run and ended with a Royals win.  In 1985, Brett had another brilliant season in which he helped propel the Royals to their second American League Championship. He batted .335 with 30 home runs and 112 RBI, finishing in the top 10 of the league in 10 different offensive categories. Defensively, he won his only Gold Glove, which broke Buddy Bell's six-year run of the award. In the final week of the regular season, he went 9-for-20 at the plate with 7 runs, 5 homers, and 9 RBI in six crucial games, five of them victories, as the Royals closed the gap and won the division title at the end. He was MVP of the 1985 playoffs against the Toronto Blue Jays, with an incredible Game 3. With KC down in the series two games to none, Brett went 4-for-4, homering in his first two at bats against Doyle Alexander, and doubled to the same spot in right field in his third at bat, leading the Royals' comeback. Brett then batted .370 in the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals including a four-hit performance in Game 7. The Royals again rallied from a 3-1 deficit to become World Series Champions for the first time in Royals history.

Here is an article: Hillary Clinton has learned the lessons of her Michigan meltdown. Maybe. Standing in a loading dock in the Mahoning Valley on Saturday night, she vowed to bring back manufacturing jobs and helps small businesses. Surrounded by the working-class voters who sided with rival Bernie Sanders last week in Michigan, Clinton appealed to the blue-collar Democrats who supported her husband but have been wary of her. “I will stand up for companies in Ohio,” Clinton said, her voice at times sounding hoarse from a primary that continues in earnest. “I am really, totally committed to bringing back manufacturing. I’m the only candidate on either side who actually has a plan to do that.” Clinton’s host was a company founded in 1918 to provide parts for the Mahoning Valley’s steel industry. In recent years, it has transitioned to high-tech manufacturing and is a tech incubator. “The future of Youngstown is happening right here,” said Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, who represents Youngstown in Congress. Yet, his optimism is not widely shared in Ohio, let alone the former manufacturing hubs. Storefronts are boarded up. Houses are abandoned. Factories have mothballed wings if not completely shut down. A deep sense of dread pervades. “Being angry isn’t necessarily bad. It’s what you do after you’re angry that matters,” Ryan said, before comparing setbacks—the area’s and Clinton’s—to a sporting loss. “You watch film. You figure out what you did wrong. And then you put together a plan together so you don’t lose again,” Ryan said. Clinton is trying to tap into a populism that has powered Sanders to wins. Her pitch post-Michigan is deeply worker-focused, and she is pitching herself more as an emotional pick than the wonk who rolled out a deeply considered manufacturing policy in Detroit. “I will be a strong supporter of the American labor movement and unions,” she vowed, drawing cheers from the crowd standing under beams that once moved steel. Clinton is still the likely nominee. Her delegate count is outpacing Sanders and, even in loss, Clinton is still picking up the party activists who will crown the nominee this summer in Philadelphia. But the storyline is not on her side. She is trying to remedy the deep problems she faced in Michigan, where she saw a 20-point lead evaporate in the final days of campaigning. She ended up losing white voters by 15 points. Exit polls found 81% younger voters—those under 30—sided with Sanders, too. “Young voters, all they know is Benghazi,” shrugged Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, a Clinton ally. Michigan was a rout, for sure, and it left her campaign advisers frustrated. They aren’t sure that they won’t be feeling déjà vu when Ohio votes on Tuesday. After all, Ohio is like Michigan. Technology has made manufacturing jobs less labor-intensive, if not easier to outsource to cheaper workers abroad. It leaves deep anxiety throughout the Rust Belt. One number that keeps giving Clinton supporters concern is the level of resentment about trade policy. In Michigan, 57% of Democratic voters said trade takes away U.S. jobs. Clinton lost those voters by 15 percentage points. That sentiment is unlikely to fade in Ohio, where a shuttered Ford factory greets visitors leaving the Cleveland airport, and pockets of cities look like Detroit. Clinton’s backers are trying to beat back Sanders’ populism. “She has the best, thought-through trade and manufacturing policy,” said Brown, who is among his party’s strongest voices on trade. His endorsement of Clinton was a nod for union workers that she could be trusted. But the same criticism that dogged her in Michigan on trade—especially over the 1994 NAFTA trade bill—followed her to Ohio. “It was 20 years ago. It was her husband,” Brown said. He shakes his head, suggesting that Clinton might have been opposed to the deal, but stayed quiet so as not to embarrass her husband, then-President Bill Clinton. Others understand the gnashing over trade. “Secretary Clinton has waffled back and forth on the TPP. While she should not be judged by her husband’s policies, her husband was behind NAFTA and people do not forget those things,” said Capri Cafaro, a former state Senate Minority Leader and a Clinton ally. A CNN poll released last week shows Clinton up 30 points in Ohio. But she was similar ahead in Michigan and came up short. “It’s going to be closer than anybody expects. But I think Hillary pulls it out,” Cafaro said. Even so, some of Clinton’s supporters were far from confident. “This,” said Joe Schiavoni, the Minority Leader in Ohio’s state Senate, “is going to be a grind.” Write a title for it.","output":"Hillary Clinton Pledges to Revive Manufacturing Jobs and Appeal to Blue-Collar Democrats in Ohio"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  The oxygen travels to the lungs through the windpipe - The air sacs in the lungs send the oxygen into the blood stream - The carbon dioxide in the blood stream is transferred to the air sacs - The lungs expel through the nose or mouth back into the environment. A:","output":"The missing first step of the given process is \\"Inhalation or Breathing In.\\" The detailed process can be described as: 1. Inhalation or Breathing In: This is the initial and crucial step in the process of respiration. During inhalation, air containing oxygen is drawn into the body through the nose or the mouth. The hair and mucus in the nasal cavity help filter out dust, allergens, and other particles present in the air. 2. Oxygen Travels to the Lungs through the Windpipe: After entering through the nose or mouth, the air travels down the throat (pharynx) and into the windpipe (trachea). The trachea is a tube-like structure that connects the upper respiratory system to the lower respiratory system, allowing the passage of air from the environment to the lungs. 3. The Air Sacs in the Lungs Send the Oxygen into the Bloodstream: The trachea divides into two smaller tubes called bronchi, which further split into smaller branches called bronchioles. These bronchioles finally end at the alveoli, small air sacs surrounded by a rich network of capillaries. Oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses across the thin walls of the alveoli into the capillaries, where it binds to the hemoglobin molecules in the red blood cells. This allows the oxygen to be transported throughout the body via the bloodstream. 4. The Carbon Dioxide in the Bloodstream is Transferred to the Air Sacs: While oxygen is being absorbed into the blood, carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, diffuses from the blood into the alveoli. This exchange of gases occurs at the same time through a process called diffusion, where molecules move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. 5. The Lungs Expel the Carbon Dioxide through the Nose or Mouth Back into the Environment: Once the exchange of gases is complete, the carbon dioxide-rich air in the alveoli is expelled from the body. The process of exhaling, or breathing out, involves the contraction of the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles, forcing the carbon dioxide-laden air up the bronchioles, through the bronchi and trachea, and finally out of the nose or mouth and back into the environment. This completes the respiration process, continuously providing the body with the oxygen it needs while simultaneously removing carbon dioxide waste."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

We start with an empty result list and iterate through the given list: [-28, -9, -42, -14, -52, 82, -68, -83, 85, 65] For each number, we check if it is even by dividing it by 2 and checking the remainder: -28 is even (-28 % 2 = 0), so we add it to the result list -9 is odd (-9 % 2 = 1), so we skip it -42 is even (-42 % 2 = 0), so we add it to the list -14 is even (-14 % 2 = 0), so we add it to the list -52 is even (-52 % 2 = 0), so we add it to the list 82 is even (82 % 2 = 0), so we add it to the list -68 is even (-68 % 2 = 0), so we add it to the list -83 is odd (-83 % 2 = 1), so we skip it 85 is odd (85 % 2 = 1), so we skip it 65 is odd (65 % 2 = 1), so we skip it After removing all odd numbers, our result list contains: [-28, -42, -14, -52, 82, -68] Now we just need to represent the result as a string inside brackets and separated by commas: \\"[-28, -42, -14, -52, 82, -68]\\" So, using the definition of even numbers to filter out odd numbers, the final solution for the given list of integers is: [-28, -42, -14, -52, 82, -68]"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The story flashes back to when Cat meets Josephine Wong, a police commissioner who wishes to re-open an investigation involving the death of a young girl at the hands of her mother. She is joined by her female colleagues: Barbara, a criminologist; and Ivy, a police sergeant. Josephine decides to conduct an interrogation with the suspect, Becky Lee. Throughout the interrogation, Becky refuses to give a statement, and as a result, becomes subject to police brutality. Josephine and her colleagues leave her naked in the cold interrogation room, and later conduct a body cavity search. Cat later tells how she became involved in the investigation. She arrives at a hospital to find the little girl, Ho Heiyi, lying unconscious and her body full of scars. She dies immediately before doctors can prepare for an operation. She later arrests Jo, Becky's boyfriend, who was caught trying to get rid of possible evidence on his computer. The police also find a series of burnt videotapes.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: RuPaul's Drag Race is an American reality competition television series produced by World of Wonder for Logo TV and, beginning with the ninth season, VH1. The show documents RuPaul in the search for \\"America's next drag superstar.\\" RuPaul plays the role of host, mentor, and head judge for this series, as contestants are given different challenges each week. RuPaul's Drag Race employs a panel of judges, including RuPaul, Michelle Visage, Ross Mathews, Carson Kressley, and a host of other guest judges, who critique contestants' progress throughout the competition. Beginning with the seventh season, Michelle Visage, Ross Mathews and Carson Kressley are the staple judges alongside RuPaul. Visage joined the show at the start of season 3, while Mathews and Kressley joined at the start of season 7, and each joins RuPaul and Visage on alternate episodes. Past fixtures on the panel include Merle Ginsberg, who was a regular judge in the first two seasons, and Santino Rice, who held his position from the first season until the conclusion of the sixth. Until season 8, Rice was the only person, apart from RuPaul, to take part in every season of the show, serving as a main judge for seasons one through six, and all stars 1, and guest judging for season seven. In certain instances, Rice was absent and replacement judging has been provided by make-up artist Billy Brasfield (better known as Billy B), Mike Ruiz, Jeffrey Moran (Absolut Vodka marketing executive), or Lucian Piane. However, due to Brasfield's numerous appearances in seasons three and four, including appearing in the Reunited episodes both seasons, Rice and Billy B are considered to have been alternates for the same seat at the judges table throughout the two seasons.  Prior to the grande finale, the three main judges are joined by two celebrity guest judges each week. Guest judges have included Paula Abdul, Pamela Anderson, Eve, Ariana Grande, Neil Patrick Harris, Kathy Griffin, Debbie Harry, Khloe Kardashian, La Toya Jackson, Adam Lambert, Demi Lovato, Bob Mackie, Rose McGowan, Olivia Newton-John, Rebecca Romijn, Gigi Hadid, Sharon Osbourne, Dan Savage, John Waters, Michelle Williams, Candis Cayne, Martha Wash, Natalie Cole, Dita Von Teese, Niecy Nash, Debbie Reynolds, Vanessa Williams, Wilmer Valderrama, The Pointer Sisters, Trina, Leah Remini, The B-52's, Kesha and Lady Gaga.  The judges each provide their opinion on the contestants' performances in the main challenge and on the runway before RuPaul announces which queen is the episode's winner and which two had the weakest performances. The day before judging, the contestants are all provided with a song to which they must learn the lyrics. The contestants deemed as being the bottom two must \\"lip sync for their lives\\" to the song in a final attempt to impress RuPaul. After the lip sync, RuPaul alone decides who stays and who leaves. RuPaul describes the qualities the contestants must have to be crowned the winner of the show as \\"Charisma, Uniqueness, Nerve, and Talent... These are people who have taken adversity and turned it into something that is beautiful and something powerful.\\" The phrase \\"charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent\\" is used repeatedly on the show, the acronym of which is CUNT.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Two oceans have divergent plate boundaries at the bottom of their floor. The Arctic ocean has a single dormant divergent plate, while the Pacific ocean has seven diverging tectonic plates under its waters.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which ocean experiences more cooling of hot molten rock?  Hint: At the mid-oceanic ridges, two tectonic plates diverge from one another as new oceanic crust is formed by the cooling and solidifying of hot molten rock. Because the crust is very thin at these ridges due to the pull of the tectonic plates, the release of pressure leads to adiabatic expansion (without transfer of heat or matter) and the partial melting of the mantle, causing volcanism and creating new oceanic crust. Most divergent plate boundaries are at the bottom of the oceans; therefore, most volcanic activity on the Earth is submarine, forming new seafloor. Black smokers (also known as deep sea vents) are evidence of this kind of volcanic activity. Where the mid-oceanic ridge is above sea-level, volcanic islands are formed; for example, Iceland.","output":"Based on the information provided, the Pacific Ocean experiences more cooling of hot molten rock. This is because the Pacific Ocean has seven diverging tectonic plates under its waters, whereas the Arctic Ocean has only a single dormant divergent plate. With more divergent plate boundaries, the Pacific Ocean experiences a higher level of tectonic activity, resulting in more instances of new oceanic crust being formed through the cooling and solidifying of hot molten rock. This creates more opportunities for volcanic activity and the formation of new seafloor in the Pacific Ocean as compared to the Arctic Ocean."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Alcohol consumption has a direct impact on the liver and its functions, causing it to work harder to process the toxins present in alcohol. This can affect various steps of the liver's processes and even lead to liver scarring when consumed excessively. Here, we can assess the perturbation caused by alcohol on the liver in relation to the mentioned processes: 1. Directly impacting a step of the process: - Alcohol consumption leads to acetaldehyde production, a toxic substance that can damage liver cells and lead to inflammation and scarring. This directly affects the liver's primary function of removing toxins from the blood. - Drinking alcohol excessively can cause liver inflammation (hepatitis), which can impair the liver's ability to produce bile and properly process fat absorption. This impacts the liver's role in producing bile for aiding digestion. - Excessive alcohol intake can deplete the liver's glycogen stores, impacting the body's ability to use carbohydrates for fuel when needed. 2. Indirectly impacting a step of the process: - Alcohol metabolism in the liver can indirectly affect multiple liver functions by producing harmful byproducts and free radicals. These substances can cause oxidative stress, inflammation, and liver cell damage, further impairing other essential liver processes. - When the liver is overwhelmed with processing alcohol and its toxic byproducts, it may struggle to effectively remove other toxins from the blood. Based on this information, alcohol consumption at a bar, especially in excessive amounts, can cause both direct and indirect perturbations to various liver processes. Chronic and heavy alcohol consumption can eventually result in liver scarring or cirrhosis, which severely hampers liver function and can potentially lead to liver failure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Cultural impact and rewatchability: While the movie may not be considered a cinema classic, it appears to have become a cultural icon and remains enjoyable for some viewers even after multiple watchings. 2. Adrenaline-fueled action sequences: The film's action sequences, particularly those involving aerial stunts, are praised by some for being thrilling and exhilarating but criticized by others as overly indulgent and representative of the excessive nature of 1980s action films. 3. Shallow storytelling and character development: The movie's story, characters, and dialogue are frequently criticized for being simplistic, superficial, or even ridiculous. This shallowness is often attributed to the film's focus on action and style over substance. 4. Influence of the 1980s and Reagan-era politics: The film is noted for reflecting the macho bravado, elitism, and political values of the 1980s and the Reagan era. As a result, it is often viewed as a product of its time that has not aged well. 5. Appeal to adolescents and escapist entertainment: Some reviewers acknowledge the film's appeal to young audiences and adults seeking mindless entertainment, even if they recognize its various shortcomings. 6. Tom Cruise's star-making performance: The film is credited with launching Tom Cruise's career as a leading man and solidifying his status as a major Hollywood star.  In summary, the overall consensus about the movie is that it is a flawed yet enduring piece of 1980s cinema that showcases thrilling action sequences and Tom Cruise's star power, but suffers from shallow storytelling and outdated cultural and political attitudes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The grandma pushed the bowl to the little boy, who swallowed   his saliva  , looking at his grandma and saying, \\"Grandma, did you really have lunch?\\" \\"Of course.\\" His grandma chewed   a piece of radish   slowly. Very quickly, the little boy ate up the meal. Seeing this. the boss went over to them and said, \\"Old lady, congratulations, you are lucky to have the free food, for you are our 100th guest.\\" Afterwards, over a month or more, one day, the small boy squatted   across the snack bar, where he seemed to be counting something, which shocked the boss when he happened to look out office window. When the small boy saw a guest walk into the snack bar, he would put a small stone into the circle he drew, but the lunch time had almost passed, the small stones he put into the circle were hardly 50. The boss was quite worried and called up all his old guests. The guests started coming one after another. \\"81, 82, 83... \\" the small boy counted faster and faster. At last, when the 99th small stone was put into the circle, the little boy hurried to pull his grandma's hand and went into the snack bar. \\"Grandma, this time it's on me,\\" the little boy said proudly. The grandma who had become the real 100th guest was served a bowl of beef soup by her grandson. As his grandma as before, the little boy chewed a piece of radish in his mouth.

Upon his arrival, he quickly forms a close friendship with his eccentric next-door neighbor, Dang, a talented but reclusive writer whose work has never been published. The two spend long nights discussing art, life, and the mysteries of the universe, finding solace and inspiration in each other's company. Wit begins to create his most groundbreaking pieces, fueled by his conversations and the intriguing stories Dang shares. He becomes convinced that Dang's work deserves recognition and decides to surprise Dang by arranging a meeting with a prominent publisher. One morning, Wit wakes up in anticipation of sharing the good news with Dang, only to find that his friend has vanished without a trace. No one in the town appears to remember Dang or even seems to be aware that he ever existed. Wit is left with just fragments of his recollections and a series of unfinished stories Dang left behind. Determined to uncover the truth behind Dang's disappearance and to honor their friendship, Wit embarks on a journey to retrace Dang's past, piecing together the missing parts of the unfinished stories. Along the way, he discovers clues that point to a possible connection between Dang's tales and actual unsolved cases in the town's history. As Wit delves deeper into the enigmatic world of Dang's imagination, he begins to lose touch with reality, questioning his own sanity and the very nature of his friend's existence.

By weaving his findings into his fictional stories, Dang managed to cunningly gather dangerous information about powerful local figures involved in criminal activities. Fearing potential backlash from these individuals, Dang chose to protect Wit and vanished voluntarily, leaving behind his stories as a lasting testament to their friendship. To ensure Dang's sacrifice isn't in vain, Wit resolves to finish the stories and find a way to bring the culprits to justice. With the help of a few allies, he exposes the truth, allowing the town to find closure and sparing others from a similar fate.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: The preliminary data means the world's third-largest economy has contracted for a second consecutive quarter, marking a technical recession. Growth was expected to decline after it fell a revised 0.7% in the second quarter on weak domestic demand. Japan has been in recession four times since the global financial crisis. On a quarterly basis, growth fell 0.2% in the third quarter from the previous one, weaker than forecasts of a 0.1% decline. The seasonally adjusted figure was also much lower than expectations of a 0.2% drop. Economists said the weak data will put more pressure on the government and central bank to continue to stimulate the economy. However, Marcel Thieliant, economist at research firm Capital Economics, said policymakers have showed \\"considerable reluctance\\" to respond to weaker growth with more stimulus as inflation accelerates, and he does not expect more easing at the central's meeting this week. \\"The upshot is that the Bank's preferred inflation measure, which excludes prices of fresh food and energy, should start to moderate soon,\\" he said in a note. \\"We therefore remain convinced that more stimulus will eventually be needed, and now believe that the January meeting is the most likely venue for its announcement.\\" Japanese companies continue to be wary of using their record profits to raise wages and invest in the economy - a major challenge for Prime Minister's Shinzo Abe's \\"Abenomics\\" policies. Business spending fell 1.3%, against forecasts of a 0.4% decrease. It also marked the second quarter in a row of declines. But, private consumption, which accounts for 60% of the economy rose 0.5% from the previous quarter. Consumer spending has picked up from the hit it took last year from an increase in sales tax in April, which contributed to the recession in 2014. Despite the declining growth, the government is positive that a recovery is underway. \\"While there are risks such as overseas developments, we expect the economy to head toward a moderate recovery thanks to the effect of various (stimulus) steps taken so far,\\" economics minister Akira Amari said in a statement. But in reaction to the growth figures, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index was down 1.1% to 19,372.98 points in early trade in Tokyo.","output":"Japan's economy is going through a difficult time, kind of like when you're not feeling well. It has been in a weak position four times since a big money problem happened around the world. Things are not going as well as people thought in the last few months, and some people think the government and the people who take care of money should help the economy more to make it better. But, not everyone agrees with that idea. Companies in Japan are being very careful with the money they make, and they are not giving more money to the people who work for them. The Japanese government is still hoping that things will get better in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Cut the avocado: Ask a grown-up to cut the avocado in half and remove the seed.     2. Lemon or lime magic: Squeeze some lemon or lime juice on the cut avocado. This magic juice's superhero power stops the avocado from turning brown. 3. Use cling wrap or an airtight box: Cover the cut avocado tightly with cling wrap, making sure you press it gently on the avocado surface. Or place it in an airtight box with the lid closed tight. This blocks the air from touching the avocado, which helps it stay green. 4. Keep the seed: If you only use half of the avocado, keep the seed with the unused half. The seed acts like a friend holding hands with the avocado and helps it stay green for longer. 5. Put it in the fridge: Place the covered avocado in the fridge. The cool temperature helps it stay fresh and green, like taking a nap in a chilly superhero cave!

By Lucy Crossley PUBLISHED: 12:07 EST, 26 November 2013 | UPDATED: 12:50 EST, 26 November 2013 A Cambridge University student drowned while on holiday with his family after treating a warning not to swim through underwater cave tunnel as a 'challenge'. Marcus Hughes-Hallett, 20, ignored safety advice and decided to swim through the water-filled tunnel linking two sea caves on the Maltese coast. An inquest into the keen sportsman's death heard how he had managed to make his way through the chute, only to get into difficulty as he tried to return. Tragic: Cambridge University student Marcus Hughes-Hallett drowned while on holiday with his family after treating a warning not to swim through underwater cave tunnel as a 'challenge' A","output":"fter hearing the testimony of multiple witnesses and reviewing the available evidence, the inquest determined that several factors contributed to the tragic accident that led to Marcus Hughes-Hallett's untimely death. Firstly, it was apparent that the warning signs placed near the underwater cave tunnel were insufficient in conveying the potential dangers associated with attempting such a swim. The signage should have displayed more explicit warnings and the possible consequences of ignoring such advisories to ensure swimmers understood the severity of the risks involved. Secondly, despite his impressive athletic background, Marcus lacked the necessary experience in cave diving that would have better prepared him for the challenges such a swim presented. Proper cave diving courses could have equipped the young man with vital skills, such as controlled buoyancy and maintaining a continuous guideline, essential in navigating enclosed and potentially hazardous underwater environments. Another prominent factor in the accident was Marcus's overconfidence in his own abilities, likely stemming from his history as a keen sportsman. This overconfidence led him to view the warning as a challenge and ultimately prompted his decision to attempt the swim. It is vital to recognize one's own limitations and never underestimate the inherent dangers involved in such activities. Furthermore, the absence of professional supervision greatly contributed to the tragedy. An experienced cave diving guide could have assessed the situation, providing a more objective evaluation of the risks involved, and likely would have advised against Marcus's swim through the underwater cave tunnel. Lastly, the lack of adequate safety equipment played a significant role in Marcus's inability to navigate his way back through the tunnel safely. Proper gear, such as scuba equipment, a diving torch, a communication device, and a sturdy guideline, might have aided him in his return journey, and potentially prevented his drowning. In light of the inquest's findings, the jury concluded that Marcus's death was the result of a tragic accident exacerbated by the combination of poor warning signage, inexperience in cave diving, overconfidence in his abilities, lack of professional guidance, and inadequate safety equipment. In response to this tragedy, recommendations have been made to enhance the safety precautions in such underwater cavern locations. These include improving warning signs to be more explicit in detailing potential dangers, educating the public about the importance of properly accredited cave diving courses, hiring professional guides to oversee swimming in high-risk areas, and ensuring the availability of necessary safety equipment rentals at popular dive sites. It is hoped that these measures will help prevent further accidents and save lives in the future. Marcus Hughes-Hallett's untimely death serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of respecting nature's hazards and taking all necessary precautions when engaging in adventurous activities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the rural German village of Vandorf, seven murders have been committed within the past five years, each victim having been petrified into a stone figure. Rather than investigate it, the local authorities dismiss the murders for fear of a local legend having come true. When a local girl becomes the latest victim and her suicidal lover made the scapegoat, the father of the condemned man decides to investigate and discovers that the cause of the petrifying deaths is a phantom. The very last of the snake-haired Gorgon sisters haunts the local castle and turns victims to stone during the full moon.

I didn’t particularly love it but it was interesting enough at the least to hold my attention. We got to class and the teacher pulled up a list of instructions on the projector. She had each of us follow the instructions and she gave us 20 minutes to complete all of them. It may even have been a bit of a race too, to see who finished it first. This becomes a lot more evident in a second. I can’t recall the exact details of the instructions, except that clearly it had to do with art such as having to draw a bunch of things. Anyways, we all went one by one down the instructions getting increasing nervous as to try to be the first one to finish. The class goes quiet while we work. Then I get to the last instruction which reads something along the lines of: “Step 15: Skip steps 1–14 and put your pencil down.” You gotta be freaking kidding me. We’re all so confused and mad at ourselves for not reading the whole of the instructions first. She turned this into a lesson for how we need to learn to read all the instructions first and then start, which was pretty clever. She got us! I remember this vividly to this day. But I look back now on this “prank” and I realize that she was kind of…wrong. Sure if the instructions are short like 15 steps it might be good to glance through before you start. But what about a whole load of instructions? Who the hell is going to read through the instructions for how to build their Death Star LEGO set before even starting to build it.

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: A classic Product review: Springsteen has put out all world stuff before. When he changed the original E Street Band to get a different sound in 1975, he obviously found what he was looking for. When he let that band go in the early 90's to get a different sound, he found nowhere near the level of success. This time he hit a homerun-- a grand slam. I now know why he made the switch. This band brings out Springsteen as an entertainer/ singer/ performer better than the Estreet band does now. This release is a CLASSIC. iT IS BEYOND GOOD--ITS GREAT. Gotta say its better than the recent Estreet albums and by a long shot. I love it. Answer:","output":"The provided review would likely increase my chances of buying the product. The reviewer seems to have a comprehensive understanding and appreciation for Springsteen's work, as they mention the history of Springsteen's band changes and career evolution. They also express a deep satisfaction with the album, describing it as a \\"classic\\" and \\"beyond good-- its great\\". The reviewer even goes so far as to say that it is better than recent releases featuring the E Street Band. The enthusiasm and positivity expressed in the review clearly demonstrate that the reviewer believes this product to be of high quality and worth purchasing. Their well-explained opinions and historical context lend credibility to the review, making it more persuasive for potential buyers. However, it is important to consider the reviewer's personal preferences and musical tastes in determining the degree to which their opinion should influence one's purchasing decision. While they prefer the sound of this album compared to other recent E Street Band albums, other buyers with different tastes might find it less enjoyable. In conclusion, the positive and enthusiastic nature of this review would generally increase the chances of purchasing the product; however, it is essential to consider one's personal preferences and weigh the review against other opinions before making a decision."},{"instruction":"Question: Little Mike's grandmother died weeks ago.

What form of poem can be Petrarchan or Elizabethan depending on its structure? What is the answer?","output":"To find the answer, I will analyze the two forms of poems mentioned and identify a common feature that varies depending on its structure. Step 1: Analyze Petrarchan structure The Petrarchan sonnet, also known as the Italian sonnet, has a structure of 14 lines, divided into an octave (8 lines) that presents a problem or question, and a sestet (6 lines) that offers a solution or resolution. It follows a specific rhyme scheme: ABBAABBA for the octave, and either CDECDE or CDCDCD for the sestet. Step 2: Analyze Elizabethan structure The Elizabethan sonnet, also known as the Shakespearean sonnet or English sonnet, also has 14 lines. Its structure is divided into three quatrains (4 lines each) that present different aspects of a question or problem and a final rhymed couplet (2 lines) that offers a resolution. The rhyme scheme for this form is ABABCDCDEFEFGG. Step 3: Identify the common feature and the answer By analyzing both forms, I have determined that they share a common feature of having 14 lines, but their structure and rhyme schemes are different. The form of poem that can be either Petrarchan or Elizabethan, depending on its structure, is a sonnet. Answer: The form of poem is a sonnet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
