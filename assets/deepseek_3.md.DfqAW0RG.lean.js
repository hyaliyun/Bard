The village is filled with whispers and speculations about the nature and identity of Miss Heliotrope, who always wears black clothing and a hat that conceals her face. As Maria approaches her 17th birthday, she begins to question the secrecy surrounding her past and Miss Heliotrope's hidden life. With the help of her best friend, Tom, they start digging into their village's mysterious history to uncover the truth. Through their investigation, they discover that Miss Heliotrope, whose real name is Evelyn Grayson, was a renowned actress in her time. Thirty years ago, she had disappeared abruptly after the sudden death of her younger sister, who had dabbled in dark arts. Heartbroken and fearing for her safety, Evelyn had retreated from the limelight and spiraled into depression. The pair learns that Evelyn had found solace when a young woman from the village, Maria's mother, appealed for her help in protecting an infant Maria against a dangerous secret society. With newfound purpose, Evelyn had become Maria's guardian and dedicated herself to shielding the young girl from this ominous threat. As the story unfolds, Maria and her friends confront the secret society that has been lurking in the shadows, determined to unravel the dark spell that clings to Maria's life. With Miss Heliotrope's guidance, they must navigate a dangerous maze of mysteries, deceit, and supernatural forces to expose the society's wicked intentions.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: The things you say to the guy, or even the things you talk about when you're not around the guy, can be a big indication of whether or not you have a crush on the guy. Here's how to know if the things you say mean that you have a serious crush:  If you find yourself always teasing the guy. If you always end up poking fun at the guy without meaning to, it means you have a crush. If you talk really fast or stutter when you say anything to the guy, it means you have a crush. If you're careful about not saying anything that might make you look like a ditz or dumb in front of the guy, then you have a crush. And if you feel like everything you say to him does make you sound like a ditz, then you probably have a crush. If you can't talk to one of your friends for more than ten minutes without mentioning the guy, then you have a crush. If you have a crush, your friends may be able to pick up on it before you do. You can learn a lot about whether or not you have a crush on the guy based on how you act around him, or even how you act when he's miles away. Here are a few ways to know if your actions mean you've been bitten by the crush bug:  If you go out of your way to hang out with him, then you have a crush on him. If you've never watched baseball in your life but are suddenly going to all the school games because you know he'll be sitting in the bleachers, then you have a crush. If you want to be near him whenever you do hang out. If you find yourself drifting toward him when you're in a group of friends, or even touching him in a playful way whenever you can, then you have a crush. If you can't stand being around him when he's flirting with other girls, then you have a crush. If your heart falls when you show up to a place where you thought he'd be and he isn't there, then you have a crush. It may not be a coincidence that you're suddenly spending twice as much time in front of the mirror whenever you know you'll see the guy. Here's how to know if your grooming habits and attention to your looks say that you have a crush on the guy:  If you try twice as hard to look good if you know you'll see him. If you wear your best outfit, best hairdo, and most amazing eye makeup when you know he'll be there, then you have a crush. If you find yourself experimenting with new makeup looks or jewelry to see if he notices, then you have a crush. If you find yourself not caring at all about how you look if you go somewhere where you know you won't see him, then you have a crush. Let's say this guy is the athletic, typical-boy type. You might find yourself practicing basketball and soccer, or buying Nike shoes, so your guy can get interested in you. And if you want your guy to get interested in you, that basically means you have a crush on him and will kind of do anything for him.

Olivia Dunham is a fictional character and the main protagonist from the science fiction television series Fringe, which aired on the Fox Broadcasting Company in the United States from 2008 to 2013. The character was created by series' co-creator J. J. Abrams, and is portrayed by actress Anna Torv. Olivia is the series' protagonist, and was introduced as an FBI Special Agent, working for a multi-agency task force of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security called the Fringe Division, dealing with supernatural events that are linked to experimental occurrences. Having grown up with an abusive stepfather, Olivia struggles with the unexpected changes in her life, following her encounter with mentally unstable scientist Walter Bishop, and his son and an eventual love interest for her, Peter Bishop. The character of Olivia has been described as \\"an incredibly driven, incredibly brilliant agent with her own complicated past that will be peel[ed] back over time.\\" She is a loner and dedicates almost all of her time to her work. She has a strong sense of justice, which drives her to solve a case by any means necessary. It is this quality which both impresses and irritates Broyles, as it makes her a good agent but also makes her prone to biting off more than she can chew when it comes to pursuing suspects. Olivia had an abusive stepfather, and shot him several times in defense of her mother and herself. She was unable to finish him off, and so he recovered and disappeared, leaving her to blame herself for not exacting retribution against him, contributing to her determination to bring criminals to justice. She was nine years old when she shot her stepfather, and she states in an earlier episode that she knew what she wanted to do for a career \\"pretty much since [she] was nine\\", indicating a direct link between the childhood abuse and her job.  In the reset timeline for the series' fourth season, Torv explained that \\"The Olivia we meet and know has known about Fringe Division and had all this time to get used to it and work out that this is her life,\\" rather than becoming familiar with it after the attack on John Scott. Consequently, \\"when Lincoln comes in, she's a little more open to him [than she was with Peter] and working with someone again.\\"  Olivia has few close relationships. She has little family, as her mother died when she was in her early teenage years. Olivia's is close to her sister Rachel, and Rachel's daughter Ella. Olivia was involved in a serious relationship with fellow FBI agent John Scott, and his supposed betrayal and death was something she dealt with for much of the first season. In the second season finale, Olivia and Peter Bishop finally admit their feelings for each other and kiss. Fauxlivia was involved in a serious relationship with Frank Stanton and eventually became engaged, but the two broke up when he discovered she was pregnant by Peter. Olivia was in a relationship with Peter after they mended things in episode 6B But shortly after that Peter built a bridge wiping himself from existence, causing Olivia to forget who he was. But through the cortexiphan and the power of their love, she soon remembered her life with him. They were married and have a daughter.

Measure the length: First, you need to measure the total length of the metal bar using a measuring tape. Let's say, it's 10 inches long. 2. Find the middle: To find the middle point, you need to divide the total length by 2. So, for our 10-inch metal bar, the middle point is 10 ÷ 2 = 5 inches. 3. Mark the middle: Next, take a marker and make a clear mark on the metal bar at the 5-inch spot. This is where we will cut it. 4. Put on safety gear: When cutting metal, it's important to wear safety gear like gloves, and if necessary, protective glasses. 5. Use a tool to cut: With the help of an adult, use a metal cutting tool like a hacksaw or a metal-cutting saw to cut the metal bar at the middle point that we marked earlier. 6. Sand the edges: After cutting, there might be some sharp edges. Use a metal file to gently smooth them down. And there you have it! You've cut a metal bar into two equal pieces.

On February 11, 1998, they released their 14th single \\"Nishi e Higashi e\\" (nishiehigashie), theme song to the Japanese drama Kira kira Hikaru (kirakirahikaru). The group was still on hiatus during this time and made no live performances to promote the single and did not appear in the music video for the song. Finally on October 21, 1998, Mr. Children officially re-grouped and released their 15th single, \\"Owarinaki Tabi\\" (Zhong warinakiLu ) with the Japanese drama Naguru Onna (Ou ruNu ) using it as their theme song. The song remains a public favorite in voting polls, Oricon citing its inspirational lyrics as the reason.  On January 13, 1999, \\"Hikari no Sasu Hou E\\" (Guang noShe suFang he), their 16th single, was released, followed by their seventh album, Discovery, on February 3, 1999. Sakurai compared his approach to the songwriting for the record to surfing:  Eleven days later they began the Discovery Tour '99, from February 14 to July 12, where the group visited 16 cities and held 42 shows. During the tour, Mr. Children released their 17th single \\"I'll Be\\" on May 12, which was used in Shiseido's (Zi Sheng Tang ) Sea Breeze commercials. Though originally released on the Discovery album, the song was re-released as a single with a lighter beat. The single was not a success and became Mr. Children's lowest selling single since \\"Cross Road\\". During the Discovery Tour '99, an idea for a live album was brought up. It was released as a 500,000 copy limited edition on September 8, 1999 and called 1/42 (referring to one of the 42 shows in the tour). Most of the tracks were recorded on June 16, 1999 at the Makomanai ice arena, while the bonus track \\"Dakishimetai\\" was recorded at the Okinawa Ginowan-Shi seaside park.  At the beginning of a new century \\"Kuchibue\\" (Kou Di ), released on January 13, 2000 became the group's 18th single. While \\"I'll Be\\" failed to be a success, \\"Kuchibue\\" proved to be a hit selling 724,070 copies. On August 9, 2000, their 19th single \\"Not Found\\" was also used as the theme song to the Japanese drama Bus Stop (basusutotsupu), followed a month later by their 9th original album Q on September 27, 2000. The band went to New York to record this album, where they re-recorded some of their old indie material and for the first time, producer Takeshi Kobayashi performed with the band on a recording. The cover for the album was shot bought Size, Inc. at the Bonneville Salt Flats in the United States. The album was not a favorite amongst fans for various reasons and became their first album since Atomic Heart to not sell over one million copies. 'Concert tour Q' started, visiting 13 cities and holding 35 concerts between October 15, 2000 and February 24, 2001. Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"Yes, there are a few more interesting aspects in this article: 1. Mr. Children's impressive sales records and their impact on the Japanese music scene: The fact that they have sold over 50 million records and created a phenomenon in the 1990s highlights their significant influence on the Japanese music industry. 2. The group's hiatus during the release of their 14th single: Mr. Children took a hiatus and made no live performances to promote their 14th single. This shows the band's resilience in overcoming challenges and eventually re-grouping to continue their success. 3. Their connection to Japanese dramas: Several of their singles were used as theme songs for popular Japanese drama series, highlighting their contributions to not just the music industry but also the entertainment sphere in Japan. 4. The live album 1/42: This album was born out of an idea during the Discovery Tour '99 and featured recordings from various concerts during the tour. The limited edition release of 500,000 copies and the fact that it represents just one of the 42 shows gives it an exclusive appeal. 5. Experimentation and change in their musical style: Throughout their career, Mr. Children has tried different styles and worked with various music producers. Their willingness to experiment and adapt has likely contributed to their longevity as a successful band. 6. International recording experience: Mr. Children recorded their 9th original album, Q, in New York and collaborated with producer Takeshi Kobayashi, who also performed with the band for the first time on a recording. This demonstrates the band's efforts to broaden their music horizons and work with international talent."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: I grew up in a small town.

It wasn't long before I became known as a singing cook. I had been rejected so many times by record companies that it was hard not to be discouraged. One night, a woman executive   from a company named Warner Brothers Records came to hear me sing. When the show was over, we sat down and talked and after she left, I said to myself it was one more rejection. A few weeks later, my manager received a phone call -- Warner Brothers wanted to sign me to a record deal. Soon after, I released my first record in June 1986. It sold over 2 million copies.

The film cuts to a house where a man, Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina) is on a ladder nailing up a welcome home sign for Jesse. The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez (Elizabeth PeÃ±a) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesse's return. Edy then travels to his store, a small neighborhood supermarket, called Bodega. Along the way, and even in the store, Edy appears to be quite popular with the ladies. Back at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friend and cousin Johnny (Luis Guzman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who have come to pick him up. On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Lenny was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of baseball and reminisce. While at the park, Ozzy spots Alexis (Manny PÃ©rez), the man who killed his brother, recently been released from prison. Ozzy stares at Alexis, and Alexis stares back, however, before Ozzy is able to make his way to Alexis, both Jesse and Johnny hold him back then they make their way to Edy's store.

Please answer the following question: The collaborative process between me and Claire Bridge has been good so far. Upon finding out her email address we had a brief email exchange culminating in me sending her a list of potential questions for the interview. Claire quite liked a lot of the questions, but overall there were too many, so we proceeded to reduce the number of questions to six main questions. These questions would then form the basis of the artist portrait, with an attempt to limit answers to no more than a minute, so little had to be cut for the final edit. The six questions we arrived at are as follows: How would you define creativity? What does it mean to you to be an artist? Do you feel a painting or piece of art can house an energy/a feeling from the original artist? Do you feel that your own works house this energy? Change and transformation are recurrent themes in your work. What are you exploring and why do these fascinate you? And recently we saw a change in your medium too, incorporating video works and photography. You seem to draw on many influences in your work, from quantum physics, astrophysics, to environmental ecology, psychology, philosophy and metaphysics. With titles like “Dark Matter”, “Touching Infinity”, “We are made of Stars”, “Rising tides” and “A drop in the ocean” or “Alchemy”. Can you tell us something more about the convergence of these ideas and influences? What continues to motivate and inspire you as an artist? We both felt these questions addressed the initial topic of exploring creativity, explored why Claire became an artist, gives insight into Claire’s work and practise and looks toward the future of Claire’s practice. After refining the questions, we proceeded to organise a day to film, which will be on the 16th September. Hopefully if all goes well we will both have an artist portrait that lives up to our expectations. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

As I mentioned in my previous post on Sacré-Coeur, one of the other places I didn’t get a chance to see when I was in Paris last summer was the catacombs so I wanted to be sure to fit in a visit this time around. Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€.

Please answer the following question: This article: By the time Etty exhibited Musidora, the theme was becoming something of a cliche, such that by 1850 it was described by The Literary Gazette as \\"a favourite subject for a dip of the brush\\". As interest in studies of Musidora waned, its role as a pretext for nude paintings by English artists was replaced by Lady Godiva, who had become a topic of increased interest owing to Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem Godiva. After the death of William Wordsworth in 1850, James Thomson ceased to be a major influence on writers. From the 1870s his popularity with readers waned, and by the end of the 20th century his works other than Rule, Britannia! were little known.When Etty died in 1849, despite having worked and exhibited until his death, he was still  regarded by many as a pornographer. Charles Robert Leslie observed shortly after Etty's death that \\"[Etty] himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\". Interest in him declined as new movements came to characterise painting in Britain, and by the end of the 19th century the value of his paintings had fallen. It is likely that the composition and style of John Everett Millais's controversial The Knight Errant was influenced by Musidora, but other than Millais, and Etty's admirer and imitator William Edward Frost, few other artists were directly influenced by Etty's work. In 1882 Vanity Fair commented on Musidora that \\"I know only too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing.\\" By the early 20th century Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word \\"Victorian\\" had become a derogatory term. Frederick Mentone's The Human Form in Art (1944) was one of the few 20th-century academic works to favourably view Musidora. contains an answer for the question: What work was a pretext for nude paintings by English artists?, what is it ?

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is the revenue service for the United States federal government responsible for collecting taxes and administering the Internal Revenue Code, which is the primary body of federal statutory tax law. The IRS has various regional offices throughout the United States, providing services and enforcing tax laws.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).  I am facing a new situation today: Two sister cities were both situated on plate boundaries, close to volcanoes, on different continents. Red city was 10 miles from a volcano, while Tree city was 60 miles away. Red city experienced many earthquakes, Tree city few and far between.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which city experienced more convection within the Earth causing the plates to move? A:","output":"A: Based on the information provided in the background article and the given situation, it is not possible to definitively determine which city experienced more convection within the Earth causing the plates to move. However, we can analyze and compare the factors that could potentially influence convection and plate movement experienced by the two cities. It is important to understand that all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries and are a result of the stresses that build up due to convection within the Earth, causing the plates to move. In the case of the two sister cities, Red city and Tree city, both are situated on plate boundaries, and therefore, are susceptible to earthquakes. As Red city is closer to a volcano (10 miles away) compared to Tree city (60 miles away), it may suggest that Red city is closer to an active subduction zone or a divergent boundary, where significant convection currents may cause the plate movement, leading to more earthquakes. The closer proximity to a volcano could also indicate that the subduction process or the upwelling of magma from below is more intense in Red city's location, which would result in greater tectonic activity and more earthquakes. On the other hand, Tree city experiences fewer earthquakes, which could imply that the convection currents and plate movement in its location are relatively more moderate. This is not to say that Tree city doesn't experience any tectonic activity, but rather, the intensity may be lower as compared to Red city's location. However, it is essential to acknowledge that there are numerous factors at play when determining the occurrence and frequency of earthquakes. The types of rocks, the overall geological setting, fault zones, and the history of seismic activity in the surrounding area all play a vital role. As such, even though we can infer possible correlations between the proximity to volcanoes and tectonic activity based on the given information, it does not provide a direct conclusion about which city experienced more convection within the Earth causing the plates to move. In summary, while we cannot directly answer which city experienced more convection causing plates to move, we can infer that Red city experiences more earthquakes, possibly due to its closer proximity to a volcano, and thus might be subject to stronger convection currents and more plate movement. However, this estimation is not definitive without considering other geophysical factors and analyzing the detailed geological setup of each location."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But what do you do when you're ready to take it to the next level and let them know you're interested? This article lays out a comprehensive guide on how to effectively and appropriately let that special someone know you're interested in them. We'll cover everything from communication cues to getting friends involved and even stalking (but just a little). So, buckle up, put on your best smile, and let's dive right in. 1. Let Him Know You're Available The first step in letting someone know you're interested in them is making sure they're aware that you're available. If you're currently seeing someone or have a strong commitment to another person, it's important to remain honest and open about your status. However, if you're single, it's important to ensure the person you're interested in knows this as well. This can be done through casual conversation, or even by dropping subtle hints when talking about your weekend plans or personal life. 2. Send Clear Signals Communication is key in any relationship, and it's especially important when trying to convey your interest. Instead of being passive or hoping they'll pick up on your vibes, be bold by sending clear signals. This can include making an extra effort to laugh at their jokes, maintaining eye contact, or finding ways to touch their arm or shoulder lightly during conversation. Remember that your body language speaks volumes, so pay attention to maintaining open and relaxed body posture. 3. Invite Him to Join You One of the easiest ways to let someone know you're interested is by inviting them to join you in a group or casual setting. This could be anything from asking them to join you at a coffee shop, inviting them to a party, or suggesting they join you at a sports game. Keep the atmosphere relaxed and pressure-free to allow them to feel comfortable and make a connection. 4. Get Friends Involved If you're not comfortable or confident enough to approach your crush on your own, you can always enlist the help of your trusted friends. Let your friends know about your feelings and ask them to help create opportunities for you to engage with your crush. They can casually invite both you and your love interest to a gathering or an event where you can exchange conversations and get to know each other better. 5. Stalk Him (Just a Little) We're not condoning obsessive behavior here, but doing a little bit of social media research on the person you're interested in can help you gain valuable insight into their likes, dislikes, and hobbies. This will give you excellent conversation starters and help you find common ground, allowing you to relate to them on a deeper level. However, be cautious not to reveal too much knowledge of their profile during conversations, as this may come across as intrusive and creepy. 6. Drop Hints If you've gotten to know your crush better, it's time to become a bit more forward about your intentions. You can start dropping hints about your feelings by casually mentioning that you think they're attractive, or by giving them compliments on their skills or achievements. You could also find more playful ways to engage with them, such as light teasing or joking banter, which can help create a sense of closeness and rapport. 7. Ask Him Out Finally, if you've tried all the above strategies and you're still unsure whether your crush is aware of your feelings, it's time to make a bold move and ask them out. You can simply ask them if they'd like to go out for a drink, dinner, or another date-worthy activity. Be confident and assertive in your approach, and remember that the worst thing that can happen is that they'll say no. Even in this scenario, at least you'll have the satisfaction of knowing that you tried and put yourself out there. Conclusion All in all, letting someone know you're interested in them does not have to be an intimidating or complex endeavor. Simply follow the steps outlined above, adapt them based on your comfort levels and individual situation, and remember to remain genuine, patient, and respectful of the other person's feelings. By doing so, you'll increase your chances of success and may just find yourself in the company of that special someone you've had your eye on."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Article: The passport photographs of the future could turn out to be more than just another pretty picture if a new computer technique developed by Israeli scientists catches on. Researchers at Ben-Gurion University, in Israel, have invented a way to hide information such as a fingerprint or signature in color images. They believe this could improve passport safety or be used to produce product bar codes  or designs that cannot be seen. \\"The papers can be faxed, scanned  and reprinted without hidden data disappearing,\\" New Scientist magazine said last week. Joseph Rosen and a team of scientists worked out the new instrument by creating a mathematical model. The model turns a fingerprint or signature into a series of numbers which are used to shape the dots that make up a color picture. \\"Each dot can be forced out of the usual place slightly without noticeably changing the final appearance of the image,\\" the magazine said. Several images that can be hidden in a single picture are scanned into a computer which does the work. The hidden images or fingerprints cannot be shown until the picture is scanned again. The computer rebuilds the fingerprint by measuring the displacement of the dots in the picture. The magazine said that if he model is used for passport checkpoints the picture can be unscrambled  to show the fingerprint or signature and checked against the person holding the passport. The researchers are now working on a handheld, and instrument which could make unscrambling the hidden information easier. Question: The new passport photos will probably contain all EXCEPT   _  .

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Choose your story that continues the following story. Chris was working fine with the computer but was maladaptive to the tablet because the  OPTIONS: + computer was easy to use.; + tablet was easy to use.;","output":"Chris had always been well-acquainted with using a computer, finding it easy to navigate through various programs and applications. From browsing the internet to working on an important presentation, Chris was confident in his computer skills. However, things took a turn when he was introduced to a tablet. While many people believed that tablets were easy to use, like the second storyline suggests, Chris found it challenging to adapt to this new device. The touch interface and the change in screen size were simply too different from his computer experience, leading him to be maladaptive to this new technology. There was a lot to learn, and Chris felt overwhelmed by it all. In his struggle to adapt to the tablet, Chris started researching articles and blog posts to better understand its functionalities. He even went as far as watching YouTube tutorials in an attempt to build his confidence and get used to the entirely new interface. One significant drawback he experienced with using the tablet was the touch-based keyboard, which made typing much more challenging for him. Unlike the tactile feedback on a computer, he struggled to type accurately, and it took longer for him to produce any written content. Chris also found it difficult to navigate between applications on the tablet. He missed the convenience of having multiple windows open simultaneously, which enabled him to work on several tasks at once. The tablet demanded a more linear approach, causing him to feel less productive and efficient with his work. At the same time, Chris realized that the tablet had its advantages. It was portable and lightweight, allowing him to work from practically anywhere. The battery life was also considerably better than that of his laptop. He noticed that more and more people were opting for tablets, especially for on-the-go work or entertainment. Their user-friendly interface made them approachable and accessible to a broad range of people, including those new to technology. Determined to overcome the challenges, Chris started by practicing his typing skills on the tablet, opting for a Bluetooth keyboard to replicate a more familiar computer keyboard experience. He also made an effort to explore different applications and learned how to use cloud-based storage to ensure seamless file synchronization between his computer and his tablet. With time, Chris saw considerable improvements in his ability to use the tablet for various tasks. He actively sought advice and recommendations from friends and colleagues who were proficient tablet users and even joined online forums for tips and tricks to maximize his device's potential. He slowly started to appreciate the convenience and versatility that tablets had to offer. In the end, Chris managed to find a comfortable balance between using both his computer and tablet for different tasks. He continued using his computer for tasks that required more extensive keyboard input, while the tablet became his go-to device for meetings and remote work situations. Chris had learned that both technologies had their unique benefits, and mastering both was the key to staying productive in an ever-advancing technological world. So, the story that continues from Chris's situation is that although the computer was comfortable and easy for him to use, he faced challenges adapting to the tablet initially. However, his persistence in learning and adapting to the new device eventually led to becoming proficient and productive, tailoring each technology to his unique needs. The story demonstrates that with patience, effort, and determination, anyone can overcome obstacles to adapt to new technologies."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

As academic work is becoming arguably more precarious and competitive, shorter contracts are becoming the norm, and the number of people completing PhDs in the UK is increasing, the risks associated with researching academia are high. This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants. Reflection is and was an important element in the research process for me, as it allowed me to reflect on the effects of the self on the research process and, ultimately, also on the data, as well as the various power dynamics discernible during interviews for my study.

The duration of a PhD program varies depending on the field of study, specific program requirements, and the progress of individual students. However, in the UK, a PhD typically takes around three to four years for full-time students and up to six years for part-time students to complete. This time frame includes the research, writing, and submission of the thesis or dissertation. Please note that this is a general estimate, and actual completion times may vary depending on various factors such as personal circumstances, funding, and the complexity of the research project.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. They are part-motor home, part-coach ... and all style. With 43 full-time drivers on NASCAR's elite Sprint Cup circuit and 36 races each season, it means lot of traveling across the country every year. So in order to avoid constantly checking in-and-out of confined, expensive hotel rooms, many of the drivers have invested in a 'home away from home' on wheels. They can also park them at the speedway. 'This is where you spend all your weekends,' Darrell Waltrip , a NASCAR Hall of Fame driver, told The Orlando Sentinel. The motor homes cost anywhere from 1.2 million to more than 2 million. Scroll down for video. Sleek: Many of the RV's are custom-built to tailor to the needs of the drivers and their families, who usually travel with them to competitions. here are 43 full-time NASCAR drivers and 36 races each season all over the country. 'It's our home away from home': NASCAR Hall of Fame driver Darren Waltrip is one of many race men scooping up elaborate motor homes. He has been using motor homes since the 1980s, and recalls the days when he would park in among the fans. Modern: The motor homes come equipped with state-of-the-art, luxury features, such as motel-style beds and temperature settings. The only problem can be the noise, since they are parked so close to the speedways where NASCAR stage their races. Impressive: The kitchens allow the drivers and their families to self-cater and not rely on restaurants while on the road, including elaborate fridges, freezes and other cooking appliances. Being able to cook eliminates having to rely on restaurants for the drivers and their families. Essentials: Even the bathrooms come with quality finishings, such as luxury showers with marble tiling and even a step. Some showers are a little more rudimentary than others, and like other motor homes are held up above the toilet. Comfortable: Usually the NASCAR stars hire a driver, who ferries the motor coaches around the country, or will captain the vehicle themselves. The drivers and their families are then able to fly ahead and meet the motor coach, rather than spend so much time on the road. Decadent: The RV's are built as 'homes away from home'. Seen here is an office-style study with a leather armchair. NASCAR drivers earn a salary of between 1 million to 20 million, not including endorsement deals. Relaxing: There are 36 races a season, meaning the driver's use the motor homes frequently, parking outside the speedways. A good couch is essential after a long day in a race car. State-of-the-art: The company that produces many of the motor homes, Featherlite Coaches, describes the finish as 'yacht-like'. They hail themselves the 'official NASCAR provider' when it comes to motor coaches. Classy: The RV's are built to be 'houses on wheels' and come complete with living rooms and even studies, like the one seen here. Luxury: The motor homes cost anywhere from 1.2 million to more than 2 million. Pre-owned vehicles start at around 200,000. Seen here is a smaller model, however fitted with the same luxury inclination, with white leather seats. Family-oriented: Older, pre-owned models sell for between 200,000 and 800,000. Seen here is a diner-style booth for meals and for sitting while traveling between races. Chauffeur: The NASCAR star's usually hire drivers to captain the vehicles so they can relax, fastening into comfortable chairs like these. Important: The motor homes are completely self-contained, built to be on the road for long periods. Some showers are less elaborate, like this one. Self-catered: The kitchens resemble those of a modest apartment, with finer details. This particular home has a Las Vegas-like hotel theme. Older, pre-owned models sell for between 200,000 and 800,000. A NASCAR driver, generally, earns a yearly salary between 1 million and  20 million, not including endorsements. The motor homes are often custom-built to suit the requests of the driver's and their families, who usually travel with them, including features like baby rooms, plush carpeting and proper kitchens. 'During the season, I probably spend at least three days a week in my motor home,' NASCAR icon Richard Petty told The Sentinel. 'So it's not only my home away from home, it's my home.' Typically, the NASCAR drivers hire motor home drivers to ferry the RV's across the the country, while they fly ahead. A company called Fetherlite Coaches, which is based in Suffolk, Virginia, cater to many of the NASCAR drivers. On their website they describe the finishings of the motor coaches as 'yacht-like'. They can feature up to four sliding rooms. Veteran: Driver Richard Petty (left) has been living in motor homes since the 1980s, starting with a simple caravan-style, and now upgrades every few years. He is seen here in 2002. At-home: The coaches are usually parked outside the speedways where the drivers will be racing, in what they call 'motor home row' Child-friendly: Bunk beds are fairly standard sleeping arrangements, outside the master suite, with many having at least three. Driver David Ragan (right) owns a similar motor coach to the one seen here, which he travels in with his family. Novelty: The motor homes usually provide for space for children to play than a hotel room. It's not unusual for adults to sleep in the bunks, too. Practical: The kitchens could easily be mistaken for something from a regular apartment, with stove, fridge, microwave, oven and sizable sink. Spacious: The larger-sized motor homes can cost up to 2 million, but eradicate expensive hotels and flights. The master suites are quite spacious. Amenities: The motor coaches can fit even a large family of five, although typically only feature one bathroom to share. Beautiful: The newer motor homes have plenty of space and stunning finishings. Seen here is a model-style sink in the bathroom. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"NASCAR drivers have to travel a lot for their races, so instead of staying in small hotel rooms, they buy big, fancy motor homes to live in during race weekends. These motor homes cost between 1.2 million and 2 million and have special features, like baby rooms and nice kitchens, to make them feel like a real home. The drivers usually hire someone to drive the motor home to the race while they fly there.

Q:Information:  - A persona (plural personae or personas), in the word's everyday usage, is a social role or a character played by an actor. The word is derived from Latin, where it originally referred to a theatrical mask. The Latin word probably derived from the Etruscan word \\"phersu\\", with the same meaning, and that from the Greek  (\\"prospon\\"). Its meaning in the latter Roman period changed to indicate a \\"character\\" of a theatrical performance or court of law, when it became apparent that different individuals could assume the same role, and legal attributes such as rights, powers, and duties followed the role. The same individuals as actors could play different roles, each with its own legal attributes, sometimes even in the same court appearance. According to other sources, which also admit that the origin of the term is not completely clear, \\"persona\\" could possibly be related to the Latin verb \\"per-sonare\\", literally: \\"sounding through\\", with an obvious link to the above-mentioned theatrical mask.  - Paul Daniel \\"Ace\\" Frehley (born April 27, 1951) is an American musician, singer and songwriter best known as the former lead guitarist and founding member of the rock band Kiss. He invented the persona of the \\"Spaceman\\" or \\"Space Ace\\" and played with the group from its inception in 1973 until his departure in 1982. After leaving Kiss, Frehley embarked on a solo career, which was put on hold when he rejoined Kiss in 1996 for a highly successful reunion tour.  - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards.  - Casablanca Records is an American recording label owned by Universal Music Group and operated under Republic Records. The label became most successful as a disco label in the 1970s and currently operates as an Electronic dance music label under the direction of Tommy Mottola.  - Love Gun is the sixth studio album by American hard rock band Kiss, released on June 30, 1977 by Casablanca Records. The album was remastered in 1997. It is notable for being their first album to feature a lead vocal performance from Ace Frehley, making it the first Kiss album to feature lead vocal performances from all four band members. It was also the last studio album to feature Peter Criss on every song, as he was replaced by session drummer Anton Fig for all but one song on 1979's \\"Dynasty\\". \\"Love Gun\\" was certified platinum on June 30, 1977.  - Anton Fig (born 8 August 1952 in Cape Town, South Africa), known as \\"The Thunder from Down Under\\", is a South African/American session drummer, noted for his work in David Letterman's house band, the CBS Orchestra. Letterman often refers to Fig as \\"Anton Zip\\" or \\"Buddy Rich Jr.\\"  - \`\` Shock Me '' is a song by American hard rock band Kiss on their 1977 album Love Gun . It was written by lead guitarist Ace Frehley , who made his lead vocal debut .

Normally, only traces of protein are found in urine, and when higher amounts are found, damage to the glomeruli is the likely basis. Unusually large quantities of urine may point to diseases like diabetes mellitus or hypothalamic tumors that cause diabetes insipidus. The color of urine is determined mostly by the breakdown products of red blood cell destruction (Figure 25.2). The “heme” of hemoglobin is converted by the liver into water-soluble forms that can be excreted into the bile and indirectly into the urine. This yellow pigment is urochrome. Urine color may also be affected by certain foods like beets, berries, and fava beans. A kidney stone or a cancer of the urinary system may produce sufficient bleeding to manifest as pink or even bright red urine. Diseases of the liver or obstructions of bile drainage from the liver impart a dark “tea” or “cola” hue to the urine. Dehydration produces darker, concentrated urine that may also possess the slight odor of ammonia. Most of the ammonia produced from protein breakdown is converted into urea by the liver, so ammonia is rarely detected in fresh urine. The strong ammonia odor you may detect in bathrooms or alleys is due to the breakdown of urea into ammonia by bacteria in the environment. About one in five people detect a distinctive odor in their urine after consuming asparagus; other foods such as onions, garlic, and fish can impart their own aromas! These food-caused odors are harmless.   Q: Normally, only traces of protein are found in urine, and when higher amounts are found, damage to what is the likely cause?

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) Question: What is the author's profession? Options:  A. not enough information  B. Doctor.  C. Journalist.  D. Pharmacist.

The perfect trip: The Seychelles Splendidly isolated in mid-ocean between Africa and India, the Seychelles are perfect island-hopping territory; hop aboard a local ferry to access rainforest walks, gin-clear waters ripe for snorkelling, and some of the world’s oldest animals. Mahé: Best for walking Spears of sunlight slice through the forest canopy as Terence Belle tramps into the jungled heart of Mahé, the largest and most mountainous of the hundred-odd islands that make up the Seychelles. He picks his way along the overgrown trail, hacking through ferns and palm fronds, stopping only to squeeze past a granite boulder or step across a brook. Overhead, unseen birds screech and hoot among the treetops, and palm leaves rattle like paper in the breeze. ‘I haven’t walked this trail for six months,’ explains Terence, who runs botanical walks around the island. ‘And in that time the forest has already changed so much. Everything grows so fast that if we don’t walk the trails regularly, before too long we can’t find them again!’ He steps off the path into a thicket of bamboo stalks as thick as drainpipes. ‘This bamboo is only a few years old,’ he says laughing. ‘And look at the size of it! I think if you just stood still and waited, you could almost see it grow.’ A spine of craggy granite peaks runs along the centre of Mahé, crossed by a network of trails tramped by generations of Mahélois. Some are packhorse routes that date back to the days of the early settlers. Others were cut by spice traders during the 17th and 18th centuries, who planted tea, cinnamon, cloves and ginger, long since abandoned and now growing wild on the hillsides. Mahé’s trails open up the island’s secret corners. While much of the coast has been cleared for agriculture, at higher altitudes large tracts of virgin rainforest survive. Here, geckos and skinks dart through the foliage, and pitcher plants dangle among moss-covered palms. Some of the islands’ most endangered flora and fauna is found here, including the Gardiner’s Seychelles frog, tinier than a human fingernail, and the fabulously rare jellyfish tree, which gets its name from its starfish-like flowers. ‘Most people never explore beyond the beaches,’ says Terence, as the trail emerges onto a plateau overlooking the misty summit of Morne Seychellois, the island’s highest mountain. ‘But it’s in the forest where you find the greatest treasures. You just have to know where to look.’ As he begins the tramp back down the trail, and is soon swallowed up by the jungle, the holler of bulbul birds booms from the treeline, and white clouds spill over Mahé’s jagged peaks. Ste-Anne Marine Park: Best for island-hopping A skein of spray arcs over the boat’s prow as it sculls across the waves, heading for a chain of islands framed against the afternoon sky. Beneath the keel, the water flashes through a kaleidoscope of ocean colours: lime-greens, aquamarines, cobalts, china-blues. Sometimes it’s like peering through frosted glass; at others, it’s as pure as crystal. As he nears one of the islands, captain Eric Lafortune cuts the motor and lets the boat drift on the swell, allowing his cargo of snorkellers to slip into the water without the faintest trace of a splash. Situated just off Mahé’s northeast coast, the Ste-Anne Marine Park encompasses six islands spread across five square miles of the Indian Ocean. In previous centuries these islands were home to just a few scattered residents – as well as a leper colony and a prison – but since 1973 the underwater habitat around them has been protected as a marine reserve. Each island has its own topography: Ile Cachée and Round Island are little more than specks of scrubby land peeping out above the ocean, while Long Island and Ste-Anne Island are jungled and hilly. They are divided by channels filled with coral banks and meadows of sea-grass, providing the perfect habitat for all kinds of underwater life: spiny sea urchins, striped sergeant majors and shiny parrotfish.

Beijing (CNN) -- A Chinese journalist, whose work exposed alleged human rights abuses of the government, has been detained by secret police in Beijing, said a close friend and human rights groups. Du Bin released a feature-length documentary on the notorious Masanjia labor camp in May. He vanished later that month, says Hu Jia, an activist and friend of Du. Hu says the last time Du's friends heard from him was 10 p.m. on May 31. Friends went to his apartment to look for him the next day but no one answered the door. Hu says family members found two copies of an unsigned police subpoena at Du's residence in Beijing.","output":"The situation surrounding Du's disappearance has raised concerns among international human rights organizations, prompting them to demand answers from the Chinese government. Investigations into the matter revealed that Du's detention is likely a direct result of his work exposing the human rights abuses occurring within the Masanjia labor camp, which has long been criticized for its harsh conditions, forced labor, and physical abuse of detainees. The unsigned police subpoena found at Du's residence is viewed as further evidence of the government's efforts to silence critical voices. As international pressure mounts, the Chinese government initially remained tight-lipped on Du's whereabouts, neither confirming nor denying his detention. This silence led to growing protests both within and outside China, with journalists and human rights activists demanding transparency and the immediate release of Du Bin. In response to this increasing pressure, the Chinese government eventually acknowledged Du's detention, stating that he had been charged with \\"disseminating state secrets and endangering national security.\\" Rights groups and Du's friends, however, continue to denounce these charges as baseless and politically motivated. The case of Du Bin highlights the broader issue of deteriorating press freedoms and human rights under authoritarian regimes. Despite the Chinese government's claims that they have been actively working to improve the country's human rights conditions, Du's detention clearly paints a different picture. With strict censorship laws and a crackdown on dissent, journalists like Du face a continuous struggle in their pursuit of truth and justice. Amid global outcry and ongoing efforts from human rights organizations, Du Bin's legal team works tirelessly to secure his release. Ultimately, after serving a lengthy prison sentence, Du is finally freed, though his career and reputation have been significantly tarnished under the shadow of his ordeal. Upon his release, Du remains resolute in his work for human rights in China and continues to advocate for press freedom, despite the risks posed to his own safety. Du's story serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of a free press and the need to protect human rights activists around the world. The tenacity of individuals like Du Bin and those who support them ensures that the fight for truth and justice continues in the face of adversity and authoritarian restrictions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Skunk Anansie are a British rock band whose members include Skin (lead vocals, guitar), Cass (guitar, bass, backing vocals), Ace (guitar, backing vocals) and Mark Richardson (drums and percussion). Skunk Anansie formed on 12 February 1994, disbanded in 2001 and reformed in 2009. The name \\"Skunk Anansie\\" is taken from Akann folk tales of Anansi the spider-man of Ghana, with \\"Skunk\\" added to \\"make the name nastier\\". They have released six studio albums: Paranoid & Sunburnt (1995), Stoosh (1996), Post Orgasmic Chill (1999), Wonderlustre (2010), Black Traffic (2012) and Anarchytecture (2016); one compilation album, Smashes and Trashes (2009); and several hit singles, including \\"Charity\\", \\"Hedonism\\", \\"Selling Jesus\\" and \\"Weak\\". Mark Richardson confirmed reports that the band was reforming in an interview with Drummer Magazine (November 2008 issue), and said that the band planned to release a \\"best of\\" compilation as well as new material.

By 1912, his future Antarctic plans depended on the results of Scott's Terra Nova Expedition, which had left Cardiff in July 1910, and on the concurrent Norwegian expedition led by Roald Amundsen. The news of Amundsen's conquest of the South Pole reached Shackleton on 11 March 1912, to which he responded: \\"The discovery of the South Pole will not be the end of Antarctic exploration\\". The next work, he said, would be \\"a transcontinental journey from sea to sea, crossing the pole\\". He was aware that others were in the field pursuing this objective. On 11 December 1911, a German expedition under Wilhelm Filchner had sailed from South Georgia, intending to penetrate deep into the Weddell Sea and establishing a base from which he would cross the continent to the Ross Sea. In late 1912 Filchner returned to South Georgia, having failed to land and set up his base. However, his reports of possible landing sites in Vahsel Bay, at around 78° latitude, were noted by Shackleton, and incorporated into his developing expedition plans.News of the deaths of Captain Scott and his companions on their return from the South Pole reached London in February 1913. Against this gloomy background Shackleton initiated preparations for his proposed journey. He solicited financial and practical support from, among others, Tryggve Gran of Scott's expedition, and the former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, but received no help from either. Gran was evasive, and Rosebery blunt: \\"I have never been able to care one farthing about the Poles\\".Shackleton got support, however, from William Speirs Bruce, leader of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of 1902–1904, who had harboured plans for an Antarctic crossing since 1908, but had abandoned the project for lack of funds. Bruce generously allowed Shackleton to...  Guess a valid title for it!

Information:  - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history.  - Gregory III Laham (born Lutfy Laham, December 15, 1933, in Darayya, Syria), Patriarch of Antioch and All the East, and Alexandria and Jerusalem, is the spiritual leader of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, elected on November 29, 2000, succeeding Patriarch Maximos V Hakim.  - Athanasius IV Ignace Michael Jawhar ( or Jahouar or Jauhar or Giohar , 1733 -- 1794 ) was Patriarch of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church from 1788 to 1794 . He previously claimed to be patriarch from 1759 to 1764 and from 1765 to 1768 .  - Antioch on the Orontes (also Syrian Antioch) was an ancient Greco-Roman city on the eastern side of the Orontes River. Its ruins lie near the modern city of Antakya, Turkey, and lends the modern city its name.  - Syria, officially known as the Syrian Arab Republic (\\"\\"), is a country in Western Asia, bordering Lebanon and the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, Jordan to the south, and Israel to the southwest. Syria's capital and largest city is Damascus.  - The Melkite (Greek) Catholic Church (\\"\\") is an Eastern Catholic Church in full communion with the Holy See as part of the worldwide Catholic Church. The Melkites, Byzantine Rite Catholics of mixed Eastern Mediterranean (Levantine) and Greek origin, trace their history to the early Christians of Antioch, formerly part of Syria and now in Turkey, of the 1st century AD, where Christianity was introduced by Saint Peter. It is headed by \\"His Beatitude\\" Patriarch Gregory III Laham.  - The Holy See  is the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Catholic Church in Rome, the episcopal see of the Pope, and an independent sovereign entity. It serves as the central point of reference for the Catholic Church everywhere and the focal point of communion due to its position as the pre-eminent episcopal see of the universal church. It traces its origin to the 1st century during the apostolic era, when Saint Peter arrived in Rome to evangelise and formed a significant early Christian community of believers there. Today, it is responsible for the governance of all Catholics, organised in their Particular Churches, Patriarchates and religious institutes.  - The Levant (Arabic:  \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term \\"Mashriq\\", meaning \\"the land where the sun rises\\".

Write a title for this article: New York Times reporters are investigating the devastating fire that killed 36 people this month at a warehouse called the Ghost Ship in Oakland, Calif. We’re also doing something new: providing regular updates on our findings. Do you have information, advice or feedback? Send an email to oaklandfire@nytimes.com. The first update can be found here. The second is here. As reporters from The Times’s graphics department, we wanted to visualize what had happened and give readers a sense of the space where the disaster unfolded. To do this, we began to recreate a 3D model of the interior of the warehouse. One of the key things we discovered was that concertgoers trying to escape the deadly fire had to negotiate a narrow, makeshift staircase, and then a circuitous path through a jumble of furniture and found objects. Below are just a few of the factors we found that contributed to making the inferno one of the worst structure fires in the United States in over a decade. 1 The performance space was often used by underground musicians. On the night of the disaster, a crowd was attending an electronic music performance. 2 Survivors told of a sudden onslaught of smoke and heat, and a dash to the narrow staircase that opened off to the dance floor. 3 Derick Ion Almena, the leaseholder of the Ghost Ship, who rented space to others, lived in this area with his wife and three children. They were at a hotel the night of the fire. Steel roof trusses were covered with wood sheathing. Door to restroom in building next door. Steel roof trusses were covered with wood sheathing.

It would have put survivors far from an exit. 6 Ms. Brito’s loft, near where she said she saw the fire start. Investigators said the fire began in the back of the building.

A critical issue to us was why more people didn’t get out. Omar Vega, the proprietor of the automobile shop next door, told us that the front stairway had actually been built by the residents. That space was once occupied by a conveyor belt when the building was used as a warehouse. 7 The front stairway exited into an open space, a kind of living room in the communal interior of the warehouse, with no direct route to the front door. 8 The path to the front door led around three pianos, requiring two left turns and a right turn to the street and safety. 9 Survivors reported confusion as they crawled along the floor to escape choking smoke, searching for the front door. Some said they had been saved by someone who kept shouting the exit location from the door. 7 The front stairway exited into an open space, a kind of living room in the communal interior of the warehouse, with no direct route to the front door. 8 The path to the front door led around three pianos, requiring two left turns and a right turn to the street and safety. 9 Survivors reported confusion as they crawled along the floor to escape choking smoke, searching for the front door. Some said they had been saved by someone who kept shouting the exit location from the door. A website contained numerous photos of the cluttered interior of the Ghost Ship before it burned. We needed a guide to help us sort through them, and we reached out to Ms. Brito and Nikki Kelber, both of whom had lived there. They described the ornate, bohemian interior in the pictures and gave us a clear idea of the layout. The stage had musical instruments, amplifiers and a screen, seen on the left, for electronic shows. The green louvered doors in the center led to the back staircase, and to a hole in the wall that gave access to a bathroom in the building next door. The route from the stairway to safety was a maze. “I got lost there the first time I went in,” Ms. Brito said. This photo shows part of the route from the stairs to the front door, which is to the left of where the photographer is standing. A Garuda statue faces the entrance. Ms. Brito, 28, lived in a space in the southwest corner of the first floor. From her bed at the top left corner of this photo, she could see a floor-to-ceiling fire near the white door. She ran to safety. On Friday, she went through the building and said her loft was still largely intact. The building had few real interior walls, but working and sleeping lofts were partitioned using window sashes, pallets and furniture that one visitor had called a “tinderbox.” Organs and pianos were scattered around the warehouse. This area was on the second floor, off the performance space. The stairs were just to the right, out of the frame. Ms. Brito emphasized how difficult it would have been for anyone who didn’t know the place to find the exit in the best of circumstances. And survivors who told their stories to reporters described difficulty on the twisting route to the stairs, down them and then out. We’re still looking for survivors’ stories of their trail to safety, and who they lost on the way.","output":"Title: \\"Inside the Ghost Ship: Tracing the Maze of a Deadly Fire in Oakland Warehouse\\""},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

You might find a tear-jerking tragedy  is just the thing you need to brighten your day. A team of researchers at Ohio State University, US, has found sad movies can make people happier, Science Daily reported last month. Many people find tragedies make them realize how good their own lives are, the study showed. \\"People seem to use tragedies as a way to reflect on the important relationships in their own lives,\\" said Silvia Knobloch-Westerwick, leader of the study. \\"Tragic stories often focus on themes of eternal  love, and this leads viewers to think about their loved ones and count their good and helpful things.\\" In the study, researchers gathered 361 college students and showed them the 2007 movie, Alonement. The movie is about two lovers who are separated  and finally die during Worid War II. Before and after the movie, the students were asked questions measuring  how happy they were with their lives. Researchers also asked them before, afier and three times during the movie to measure various emotions, including sadness. Researchers found that the sadder students felt while watching the movie, the more likely they were to think about real people they had close relationships with in life. This increased their happiness afier watching the movie. Knobloch-Westerwick explained that negative  moods make people more thoughtful. \\"Positive  emotions show that everything is fine, you don't have to worry, you don't have to think about problems in your life,\\" she said. \\"But negative emotions, like sadness, make you think more critically about your situation. So seeing a tragic movie may make you sad, but that will make you to think more about your own close relationships and appreciate them more.\\" The link between watching a tragic story and feeling better has long been recognized.

The action takes place during the time of the first exploration of the Coast; an early scenario has the film opening with Vancouvers ship coming into the bay, though that part did not make it into the final film.The story overlays three plot elements onto each other: a melodramatic love triangle; an equally melodramatic series of aboriginal battles (from which the Head Hunting title is drawn); and a full range of Kwakwakawakw ceremonial performances in regalia fully restored for the film. The hero, Motana, falls in love with the maid of his dreams, Naida, while on a vision quest. Unfortunately for him, Naida is betrothed to an evil sorcerer. After completing his quest, Motana embarks on a battle to win Naida by killing the evil sorcerer. As might be expected, the sorcerers equally unsavory brother, Yaklus, is outraged. He takes his revenge by ransacking Motanas village, killing his father, and stealing Naida for himself. Strangely, the most magnificent Kwakwakawakw dance ceremonies in the film come in celebration of Yakluss success. But then, Motana and his crew stage a dramatic rescue of Naida from the bedside of Yaklus.

After the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1776, the Connecticut colonial government ordered the construction of Black Rock Fort (to be built on top of an older 17th-century fort) to protect the port of New Haven. In 1779, during the Battle of New Haven, British soldiers captured Black Rock Fort and burned the barracks to the ground. The fort was reconstructed in 1807 by the federal government (on orders from the Thomas Jefferson administration), and rechristened Fort Nathan Hale, after the Revolutionary War hero who had lived in New Haven. The cannons of Fort Nathan Hale were successful in defying British war ships during the War of 1812. In 1863, during the Civil War, a second Fort Hale was built next to the original, complete with bomb-resistant bunkers and a moat, to defend the city should a Southern raid against New Haven be launched.

Frank Morgan, playing an unabashed gold-digger, loudly complains to Cooper about his perceived penury at the hands of his family - including his daughter, Anita Louise. I am a fan of all 3 actors. Frank Morgan is (to my mind) a Hollywood treasure, Cooper a legend, and Louise a very lovely, versatile and under-appreciated actress seldom seen in the leading role. I also have nothing against Teresa Wright, and while not blessed with great range, she usually delivers heart-warming performances. From a promising opening, the story slides downhill all the way to the end. I found nothing humorous about burning down the home of Cooper's would-be in-laws. The butler in such a fastidious, non-smoking household would never just blithely walk away, allowing Cooper to continue smoking, or alternatively he would certainly supply him with some means of disposing of his ill-timed cigarette. Moreover, nobody with any common sense would permit himself to be left holding a lit cigarette without asking for some means of disposing of it. And finally, nobody in his right mind crushes out a cigarette in a handkerchief and sticks it in his pocket! This whole sequence just made Cooper seem foolish and gauche. It is a poor contrivance - ill conceived and filmed in a way that induces ridicule not laughter.  The forced medical examination of Cooper is equally contrived. Nobody lets himself undergo a complete medical examination without his being advised of its purpose or giving his consent! That Cooper did so is too removed from reality to be funny - it's absurd! Stealing babies from hospitals is a serious legal offense, and that, too, is nothing to laugh about. Finally, the scenes of Cooper's overly fastidious, neurotic attention to his baby's feeding and weight may have struck a nerve with a few people who have experienced anxiety over their own newborn babies. But to me they just seem tedious and slow. The wardrobe and prop departments went over the top in those scenes, while paradoxically, the script writer went to sleep. The lines are just not in the script to generate humor. They just miss on all cylinders. The laughs come not a mile-a-minute, but more like a light year-a-minute. The only time the movie has any energy or humor is when Frank Morgan is on camera. The scene that is totally wasted is when both of Cooper's love interests and their respective fathers are cooped up in the same hotel room together. There is probably a rich vein of humor somewhere in that mine, but none of it was extracted. In the end, one of the two very likable girls is going to get hurt. Predictably, it is the Anita Louise character, who gets jilted on her would-be-wedding night! While it is not on camera, that is her fate, and it is not particularly funny - even as a loose end. She hadn't done anything in this film to make me unsympathetic (unlike Gail Patrick, say, in My Favorite Wife). Consequently, I was expecting (perhaps \\"hoping\\" is a better word in the context of the film!) for Anita Louise to enjoy a happy ending, too. The fact that such a nice character is essentially wiped out at the movie's end really undermines the effect of the \\"happy ending\\" for Cooper and Wright. I kept waiting for something to happen, for the witty dialog so characteristic of movies of the era... And it never delivered. A good performance by Frank Morgan in a slightly different role is totally wasted here. Choose your answer. What is the sentiment of this review?

Please write a short summary for the following article: Foursquare, Facebook and Gilt Groupe embrace hackathons NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Throw a bunch of programmers into a room with laptops, Red Bull and pizza for a hours at a stretch and what do you get? Creative breakthroughs. That's the idea behind \\"hackathons,\\" where groups of engineers band together for marathon coding sessions. The term \\"hacking\\" tends to come with negative connotations, but in the tech world, it simply means cranking out code for a cause. \\"Hacking really doesn't mean I'm going to break into a system and steal people's identities,\\" says Gilt Groupe engineer Mark Wunsch. \\"It means we're going to try and come up with clever solutions for problems.\\" Hackathons are typically off-the-cuff events with loose guiding goals, and open-source developers are among their biggest evangelists. But lately, companies have been adopting the idea. Online fashion retailer Gilt Groupe recently held its second hackathon to invent and improve on features for its website. Armed with coffee and snacks, staff engineers set up shop at 11 a.m. on a Thursday morning and prepared to spend 24 straight hours coding. \\"It gave us a chance to actually focus on one thing,\\" says developer Evan Maloney. \\"There's something else that happens with the creative process when you've been awake for a while, where you start to have ideas that you may not necessarily have if you had your wits about you.\\" A full day later -- noticeably more exhausted -- the group presented their creations. One new app they created detects the color of any object you point your smartphone at. It will then show everything the website has for sale in that color. Gilt Group isn't the only company using hackathons to spark corporate creativity. Facebook makes them a regular feature of its product development process. \\"Hacking is a central part of Facebook's culture,\\" the company wrote on its blog in December. \\"Whether we're building the next big product at one of our Hackathons or creating a smarter search algorithm, we're always hacking to find a better way of doing things.\\" Location-based network Foursquare recently hosted its first Hackathon. More than 150 developers spent a day building new features on top of the company's API. Fifteen hours -- plus 25 pizzas and 300 cups of coffee later -- engineers came up with 39 apps built on Foursquare's infrastructure. \\"It definitely helps kickstart creativity,\\" says programmer Jonathan Wegener, who took a break from working on his own venture -- part of startup accelerator TechStars' first New York cohort -- to participate. In one day, Wegener created a feature for Foursquare users called 4squareand7yearsago, which sends users a daily history of their check-ins a year ago. And as startup valuations soar and tech companies battle to find engineers, it can't hurt to gather a group of talented engineers in a room for 24 hours to see what they're capable of. \\"It's often secretly about recruiting,\\" Wegener says.","output":"A \\"hackathon\\" is an event where groups of engineers work together for hours, trying to create new computer codes and solve problems.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....

Here is an article: This week The Wall Street Journal and VentureSource ranked the top 50 U.S. venture-backed companies with the most potential to become \\"The Next Big Thing.\\" You can check out the list, along with the methodology, here. We thought we'd take a look at where these companies reside. After all, if these are the next Ciscos, Microsofts and Amgens (all formerly venture-backed companies), which cities and states will claim bragging rights? Let's be clear—it's hard to draw hard conclusions from such a tiny sliver of the 10,000-plus venture-backed companies out there, and many stellar start-ups just missed making this list (or were excluded because their valuation was above 1 billion). But the study is interesting, nonetheless. For your convenience, we've marked these companies' exact locations on the interactive, color-coded map here. Blue is for information technology companies, red for health care, green for clean technology, yellow for consumer services and purple for business and financial services. Not surprisingly, a large share of these companies make their home in California, a state that year-after-year captures the most venture funding thanks mostly to Silicon Valley. (California companies raised 49% of the 21.4 billion in venture capital distributed last year.) But it was curious that such a high percentage of the top companies—33 out of 50, or 66%—hailed from California. Within the state, nearly half—24 of 50—are in Silicon Valley, which received 36% of the total venture dollars last year. In fact, five companies—No. 6 Azul Systems, No. 7 Complete Genomics, No. 12 NeuroPace, No. 17 Fanfare Group and No. 36 Soasta—all operate a few blocks from each other in Mountain View. So why is this list so heavily tilted in California's favor? The answer is likely in the survey's methodology. The track record of these companies' venture capital board members account for 27.5% of the final rank, and some of the most well-established venture firms dwell in Silicon Valley. Even though it's a documented fact that the density of entrepreneurs and investors in a place like Silicon Valley breeds innovation, the list may provide some interesting insight into the subtle and powerful ways those connections help companies rise to the top. Perhaps more curious is the lack of companies in Massachusetts, which, thanks to the Boston area, is the second largest region for venture-capital funding (12% of last year's venture dollars). Just three companies—No. 29 Boston-Power, No. 43 Akorri Networks and No. 50 Acceleron Pharma—live there. By comparison, five companies are in the New York City area: No. 19 Gilt Groupe, No. 22 HuffingtonPost.com, No. 24 Small Bone Innovations, No. 33 Vidyo and No. 39 Etsy. Then there are the few companies outside the traditional venture-capital hot spots. For instance, No. 21 Xanodyne Pharma is located in Newport, Ky. (Cincinnati area), No. 15 Suniva in Norcross, Ga. (Atlanta suburb), and No. 31 CVRx in Minneapolis. That's impressive, considering they're in regions not know for producing major high-tech companies. Perhaps we should do follow-up \\"top 50″ lists and apply the methodology to individual regions. That might help us understand, as Seattle tech blogger John Cook asked, why there are no companies on this list in the tech-heavy Seattle area.

(CNN) -- Henry Joseph Madden was a good student and track team member in high school, but he had a secret: He sometimes wore his mother's pantyhose and underwear under his clothes.  Dr. Jennifer Madden, a family physician, began her transition to being female at age 48.  \\"I really wanted to be a girl so bad, and that was one way for me to satisfy those feelings,\\" Madden said. \\"I always felt like someone was looking over my shoulder.\\"  The desire to be female never went away. At age 48, Madden confessed these feelings to a doctor, and started seeing a gender therapist who suggested Madden was transgendered.  Through reconstructive surgeries, electrolysis, laser procedures and voice lessons, Henry Joseph became Jennifer Elizabeth, known as Jenny. She is a practicing family physician in Nashua, New Hampshire. Watch Jenny's story »  Chastity Bono, child of performer Cher and the late entertainer and politician Sonny Bono, announced Thursday the beginning of a transition from female to a male.  While still relatively rare -- one advocate estimates that 0.25 to 0.5 percent of the American population is transgendered -- the idea of changing gender identity has become more widespread in recent years. The term \\"LGBT\\" (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) is more commonly recognized, and transgendered people have been portrayed in the 1999 film \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" as well as the 2002 book \\"Middlesex\\" by Jeffrey Eugenides.  Many people who have transitioned, including Madden, say they knew they had been born into the wrong gender from childhood. As early as age 3, Dr. Julie Praus, born male, didn't understand why her father wanted to play catch. As a boy, Praus learned how to fish and hunt, but enjoyed collecting Depression-era glassware vases. Praus, 48, a psychiatrist in Brattleboro, Vermont, started living as a woman in March 2008.

From the moment I stepped into the restaurant, I was impressed by the ambient atmosphere and impeccable service provided by the staff. Upon being seated, we were greeted by our knowledgeable and attentive server, Sarah, who guided us through the menu with great enthusiasm. We started our culinary journey with the chef's signature appetizer – the delectable Crab Cakes, which were cooked to perfection, boasting a light, crispy exterior and flavorful, succulent interior.  For our main course, we opted for the Pan-Seared Salmon and the Herb-Crusted Rack of Lamb. The salmon was beautifully cooked, with a crispy skin and tender, flaky flesh, complemented by a tangy lemon dill sauce. The rack of lamb was equally impressive: tender, juicy, and full of flavor, encased in a golden, herb-infused crust. The accompaniments – garlic mashed potatoes, honey-glazed carrots, and seasonal sautéed greens – were absolutely scrumptious, elevating the overall dining experience. We couldn't resist indulging in one of their delectable desserts – the decadent Triple Chocolate Mousse. It was a heavenly combination of rich, silky chocolate layers, complete with fresh berries and a delicate dusting of powdered sugar – the perfect ending to a fabulous meal. There were a couple of minor issues – the restaurant was a bit noisy, and the wait for our food was longer than expected. However, these concerns became insignificant considering the warm hospitality, exceptional food, and overall memorable dining experience. In conclusion, I highly recommend The Gourmet Garden for anyone seeking a fantastic culinary adventure in a charming and elegant setting. I'm already looking forward to my next visit!

Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: -  The bat sends out sound waves from their mouth or nose - The sound waves hit an object - Echoes are produced - The echo returns to the bat&#x27;s ears - The bat hears the echo Answer:","output":"Step 1: The bat sends out sound waves from their mouth or nose. Justification: This step is necessary for the bat to emit the sound waves in the environment to detect objects. Step 2: The sound waves hit an object. Justification: This step is crucial as it enables the bat to detect objects when the sound waves encounter the object's surface and reflect off it. Step 3: Echoes are produced. Justification: This step is a result of the previous step, where reflecting sound waves create sound echoes. The echo contains information about the object's distance, size, and shape. Step 4: The echo returns to the bat's ears. Justification: This step is critical for the bat as it captures and processes the echoes returning to its ears, which helps the bat gather information about its surroundings. Step 5: The bat hears the echo. Justification: This is the step where the bat receives the echoes through its specialized hearing system, which translates the echoes into neurological signals. Answer: The final step of the process is the bat using its specialized hearing system to process the echoes and interpret the information about its surroundings, like distance, size, and shape of the objects. This allows the bat to navigate and forage effectively in its environment."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

How do you say this sentence in English?","output":"\\"At the moment, there are no customer comments regarding Europcar in Champlay.\\" Here is a detailed breakdown of the translation: \\"De momento\\" (at the moment) - in this context, it means that currently or as of now, there is a particular situation regarding customer comments. In English, we use \\"at the moment\\" to convey the same idea. \\"no hay\\" (there are no) - this phrase is a negative one, stating that something doesn't exist or is not present. In English, we would say \\"there are no\\" to communicate the nonexistence or absence of the subject matter. \\"comentarios\\" (comments) - this word refers to feedback, thoughts, or opinions given by individuals. In this context, it relates to what customers think about a particular service or company, namely Europcar. \\"por parte de los clientes\\" (from the customers) - This phrase is specifying who should provide the comments. In this context, it refers to the customers or clients who have used the service or dealt with the company. \\"para\\" (regarding, for) - it is a preposition that, in this context, indicates the subject that the comments refer to. In English, we use \\"regarding\\" or \\"for\\" to convey a similar meaning as the original phrase. \\"Europcar en Champlay\\" (Europcar in Champlay) - Europcar is a car rental company, and Champlay is the location where this particular branch of the company is situated.

Context: Mantua is the ancestral city where the male line of the Gonzaga dynasty ruled, first as marquesses, then after 1540 as dukes, in vassalage to the Holy Roman Empire. Monferrato was a duchy since 1574 on the eastern side of Piedmont, and an Imperial fief since the eleventh or twelfth century. The Gonzagas had enlarged their realm with Monferrato after receiving it in dowry from the wife of duke Frederick II Gonzaga. On 22 September 1612, Francis IV, Duke of Mantua and Monferrato died at the age of 26. His death occurred only a couple of months after the death of his father Vincent I, Duke of Mantua. He left only a three-year-old daughter, Maria of Mantua. Francis IV also had two younger brothers who, both being cardinals, could not marry and were thus ineligible to succeed to Mantua's throne. Nonetheless, Francis' two brothers, Ferdinando I  and Vincenzo II , eventually did become Dukes of Mantua. Despite marrying, following the resignation of Ferdinando and the expulsion of Vincenzo from the Sacred College of Cardinals, neither produced any legitimate children. A crisis erupted when Vincenzo II died on 26 December 1627 at the age of 33, the same day that his niece Maria Gonzaga's marriage with Charles de Nevers was celebrated. Nevers was the eldest son and heir of Charles, Duke of Nevers, Rethel and Mayenne. Moreover, he was the head of the cadet branch of the House of Gonzaga, and after Vincenzo II, heir male of the Duchy of Mantua. Question: How many years after the male line of the Gonzaga dynasty ruled Mantua as dukes did Monferrato become a duchy? Answer:","output":"To find the answer, let's identify the relevant dates first: 1. The male line of the Gonzaga dynasty ruled Mantua as dukes starting in 1540. 2. Monferrato became a duchy in 1574. Now, let's calculate the difference between these two dates: 1574 (Monferrato becomes a duchy) - 1540 (Gonzaga dynasty rules Mantua as dukes) = 34 years So, 34 years after the male line of the Gonzaga dynasty ruled Mantua as dukes, Monferrato became a duchy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the United States, the verdict in criminal cases must be unanimous. A non-unanimous verdict results in a hung jury which in turn forces a mistrial. The question they are deciding is whether the defendant, a teenaged boy from a city slum, murdered his father. The jury is further instructed that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence. Under current American criminal law, a defendant must first be found guilty, and then the jury in the sentencing phase must find an aggravating circumstance and unanimously agree to recommend the death penalty, if the state has the death penalty.[citation needed] The jury of twelve retires to the jury room, where they begin to become acquainted with their personalities and discuss the case. The story revolves around their difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict, mainly because of the personal prejudices of several of the jurors. An initial vote is taken and eleven of the jurors vote for conviction. Juror number 8, the lone dissenter, states that the evidence presented is circumstantial and the boy deserves a fair deliberation, upon which he questions the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses to the murder, the fact that the knife used in the murder is not as unusual as the testimony indicates (he produces an identical one from his pocket), and the overall shady circumstances. Having argued several points, Juror 8 requests another vote, this time by secret ballot. He proposed that he would abstain from voting, and if the other eleven jurors voted guilty unanimously, then he would acquiesce to their decision. However, if at least one...

Bennett, 21, of C Battery, U.S. 17th Field Artillery Regiment, was a four-year veteran of the U.S. Army, and had served in the division since March 1943. Records show he had no medical history until 6 August 1943, when a friend was wounded in combat. According to a report, he \\"could not sleep and was nervous.\\" Bennett was brought to the 93rd Evacuation Hospital. In addition to having a fever, he exhibited symptoms of dehydration, including fatigue, confusion, and listlessness. His request to return to his unit was turned down by medical officers. The shells going over him bothered him. The next day he was worried about his buddy and became more nervous. He was sent down to the rear echelon by a battery aid man and there the medical aid man gave him some medicine which made him sleep, but still he was nervous and disturbed. On the next day the medical officer ordered him to be evacuated, although the boy begged not to be evacuated because he did not want to leave his unit. On 10 August, Patton entered the receiving tent of the hospital, speaking to the injured there. Patton approached Bennett, who was huddled and shivering, and asked what the trouble was.  \\"It's my nerves,\\" Bennett responded. \\"I can't stand the shelling anymore.\\" Patton reportedly became enraged at him, slapping him across the face. He began yelling: \\"Your nerves, hell, you are just a goddamned coward. Shut up that goddamned crying. I won't have these brave men who have been shot at seeing this yellow bastard sitting here crying.\\" Patton then reportedly slapped Bennett again, knocking his helmet liner off, and ordered the receiving officer, Major Charles B. Etter, not to admit him. Patton then threatened Bennett, \\"You're going back to the front lines and you may get shot and killed, but you're going to fight. If you don't, I'll stand you up against a wall and have a firing squad kill you on purpose. In fact, I ought to shoot you myself, you goddamned whimpering coward.\\" Upon saying this, Patton pulled out his pistol...

On arriving at the parking lot of the restaurant,Helen began to search for Ed's car but she failed,which suggested Ed wasn't there.We decided to have a talk with the manager before we returned to the hospital.On our way to the manager's office.I received a call from a nurse,who said they had found Ed.What a relief!

From the mid 16th century with the Peace of Amasya, and decisively from the first half of the 17th century with the Treaty of Zuhab until the first half of the 19th century, Eastern Armenia was ruled by the successive Iranian Safavid, Afsharid and Qajar empires, while Western Armenia remained under Ottoman rule. In the late 1820s, the parts of historic Armenia under Iranian control centering on Yerevan and Lake Sevan (all of Eastern Armenia) were incorporated into the Russian Empire following Iran's forced ceding of the territories after its loss in the Russo-Persian War (1826-1828) and the outcoming Treaty of Turkmenchay.

This marked the beginning of a major campaign and series of events that led to the significant territorial expansion of the German forces throughout Eastern Europe. Following this initial invasion, German forces advanced quickly into Soviet territory. It took a little over two weeks, in fact, before they reached Estonia. On 7 July 1941, the Wehrmacht crossed the Estonian southern border, as indicated in the statement. Estonia at the time was occupied by the Soviet Union since the Soviet occupation in June 1940. As the German forces pushed further into Soviet-held territory, they established and consolidated their presence in Estonia and other occupied regions. The Wehrmacht crossing the Estonian southern border was part of a much larger conflict taking place on the Eastern Front during World War II. The eventual German invasion of Estonia and the broader Baltic states brought them into direct conflict with Soviet forces. This conflict ultimately played a pivotal role in shaping the outcome of both the Eastern Front and the overall progression of the war. So, in conclusion, the statement provided does contain the correct answer to the question pertaining to when the Wehrmacht crossed the Estonian southern border.

We will meet again  OPT: * negative; * positive;","output":"Based on the information given in the provided tweet, the sentiment can be classified as positive.  To further explain, sentiment analysis is a form of natural language processing that interprets and classifies emotions in textual data using techniques such as text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics. This technique is often used in social media monitoring, allowing businesses to gain insights into how the public perceives their brand, product, or service.  The tweet \\"@jamesurquhart Great. We will meet again\\" does not express any form of disappointment, sadness, anger, or any negative feelings. Instead, the word \\"Great\\" indicates a positive sentiment. The phrase \\"We will meet again\\" can further back up this claim as it is usually used in a joyful, emotional circumstance where people are looking forward to seeing each other again in the future. Such an expression demonstrates anticipation and exhilaration, indicating a positive sentiment. Even though text sentiment analysis lacks the sureness of understanding the complete sentiment without knowing the entire context or situation, based on the provided text and standard vocabulary, we can say the sentiment of the tweet is positive. These keywords \\"Great\\" and \\"will meet again\\" are often associated with positive emotions and reactions.

Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Organic food, once considered something that only health fanatics desired, is now a regular feature at most supermarkets. And that has created a bit of a dilemma. On the one hand, you have a conventionally grown apple. On the other, you have one that's organic. Both apples are firm, shiny and red. Both provide vitamins and fiber, and both are free of fat, sodium and cholesterol. Conventionally grown food generally costs less, but is organic food a better choice? The advantages claimed for such foods over conventionally grown and sold food products are now being debated on a large scale. Supporters of organic foods -- a term whose meaning varies greatly --are frequently telling the world that such products are safer and more nutritious than others. The growing interest of consumers in the safety and nutritional quality of daily foods is a welcome development. However, much of this interest has been aroused by sweeping claims that the conventional food supply is unsafe or inadequate in meeting nutritional needs. Almost daily, the public is surrounded by claims for \\"no-aging\\" diets, new vitamins and other wonder foods. There are numerous unsubstantiated  reports that natural vitamins are superior to man-made ones, that fertilized eggs are nutritionally superior to unfertilized eggs, that untreated grains are better than those treated with insect spray and the like. Although most of these claims are not supported by scientific evidence, large amounts of written material about the benefits of organic foods makes it difficult for people to separate fact from fiction. As a result, claims that eating a diet consisting of organically grown foods prevents or cures disease or provides other benefits to health have become widely advertised and form the basis for people's opinion. One thing that most organically grown food products seem to have in common is that they cost more than conventionally grown foods. But in many cases consumers are misled if they believe organic foods can maintain health and provide better... Question: It can be inferred from the passage that   _  . - most doctors believe organic foods prevent disease or provide other benefits to health - organic foods are actually less nutritious than conventionally grown foods - people cannot separate fact from fiction because of the TV advertisements - organic foods cost more but are not necessarily better than conventionally grown foods Answer:","output":"It can be inferred from the passage that organic foods cost more but are not necessarily better than conventionally grown foods.

Problem:Rick Perry‘s campaigned launched a new campaign ad, and it’s exactly the sort of action packed trailer a candidate who runs with a gun might want. Borrowing the services of Tim Pawlenty‘s old video man, Lucas Baiano, the ad mostly forgoes biographic info in favor of setting a strong tone for his campaign. “A great country requires a better direction, a renewed nation needs a new president,” you hear him say. “The United States of America really is the last great hope of mankind.”      The first forty seconds of the ad go to Barack Obama, the “Zero President” — zero jobs, zero confidence, zero hope, zero change, etc. The attack juxtaposes images of an abandon nation of crumbling billboards and and increasingly urgent news casts reporting high poverty rates against Obama’s assurance that, “I’m just getting started.”      Then all goes quiet and “In 2012” flashes across the screen.      Things brighten: there are wild horses, paparazzi flashes, and the world is again populated with healthy looking children. There is a shot of him in his Air Force jump suit, and images of him shaking hands with workers across the country. “I believe in America,” he says, implying better days ahead. “I believe in her purpose and promise.”      See what you think.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Winter is dangerous because it's so difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents take place so easily. Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding under the melting snow, waiting ahead to send you off the road. The car coming to you may suddenly slip across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly . Sudden movements can make a car very difficult to control. So every time you either start or stop your car, increase or reduce your speed, you must be as gentle and slow as possible. Suppose you are driving with a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so that you wouldn't spill  it. Rule Number Two is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further down the road you have to look. Test how long it takes to gently stop your car. Remember that you may be driving more quickly than you think. Generally, allow twice of your usual stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice.

Hans Lundgren was born on 3 November 1957 in Spanga, the son of Sigrid Birgitta (nee Tjerneld), a language teacher, and Karl Johan Hugo Lundgren, an engineer and economist for the Swedish government. He lived in Spanga until the age of 13, when he moved to his grandparents' home in Nyland, Angermanland. Some sources wrongly state 1959 as his year of birth, but Lundgren himself has confirmed it to be 1957. He has two sisters and an older brother; he was raised in the Lutheran church. Lundgren resides in Los Angeles, California. He speaks Swedish and English, as well as smaller amounts of French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish, but is not fluent in five languages as has often been reported.  He is an avid football fan. He supported Everton FC when he lived in Europe, but developed more of an interest in international football tournaments (such as the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup) after moving to Los Angeles.  During the 1980s, Lundgren had relationships with Jamaican singer Grace Jones and American model Paula Barbieri. In 1994, he married Anette Qviberg, a jewellery designer and fashion stylist, in Marbella. The couple decided they liked Marbella so much that they rented accommodation there for years, before eventually buying a family home there. They have two daughters: Ida Sigrid Lundgren and Greta Eveline Lundgren, both born in Stockholm. Lundgren and Qviberg have cited the reason for living away from Hollywood is that they want to give their children as normal a childhood as possible. His father died in 2000.  In early May 2009, Lundgren's Marbella home was reportedly broken into by three masked burglars who tied up and threatened his wife, but fled when they found a family photo and realized that the house was owned by Lundgren. Lundgren later stated he believed the intruders to be Eastern European and had asked contacts in Bulgaria to investigate them, but to no avail. After the incident, Lundgren's elder daughter, Ida, suffered from PTSD. His wife was the \\"most traumatized\\", and as of 2011, they are divorced.  Lundgren currently lives in Los Angeles, California. He broke up with his girlfriend, Jenny Sandersson, in 2014 and it was said that they were secretly engaged and married later.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The legislature voted in 1810 to relocate the capital again, and moved the seat of government to Harrisburg in October 1812 onto the land originally given by Harris a decade earlier. An additional 10 acres (4 ha) was also purchased from United States Senator William Maclay. The legislature met in the old Dauphin County courthouse for the next decade until a new capitol was constructed. A competition was held to determine the design of the capitol starting in 1816, which \\"was the first formal contest for [designing] an American statehouse\\". The designs submitted, including one from William Strickland, were rejected as being too expensive. Another contest was started in January 1819. Of the seventeen designs submitted, two were selected as semifinalists. One was from Harrisburg architect Stephen Hills and the other was from the designer of the Washington Monument, Robert Mills; Hills' design was selected. Hills had designed a \\"red-brick, Federal-style\\" capitol to \\"architecturally represent the function of democratic government.\\" Construction began on the Hills Capitol in 1819 and it was completed in 1822.  The capitol's construction and subsequent furnishing was estimated to have cost 244,500. The Hills Capitol was visited by famous people, including the Marquis de Lafayette in 1825 and Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, (later King Edward VII) in 1860. Abraham Lincoln visited the capitol in 1861 as president-elect, and then his body lay in state there after his 1865 assassination. Pennsylvania's collection of Civil War battle flags, which were accumulated in 1866, was moved from the State Arsenal to the second floor of the capitol in 1872. The flags were moved, again, in 1895 to the Executive, Library and Museum Building. On February 2, 1897, around noon, smoke was discovered coming from the Lieutenant Governor's offices.

Answer the question...the free surface of a rotating fluid is??","output":"To answer this question, let's first break it down step-by-step: Step 1: Understand the context of the question The question is asking about the nature of the free surface of a rotating fluid. A free surface is the boundary between a fluid and a gas, such as air, where the pressure of the fluid is equal to the pressure of the gas. Step 2: Consider the effect of rotation on the fluid When a fluid is rotating, the particles in the fluid experience centrifugal force, which pushes them away from the center of rotation. This causes the fluid surface to adjust according to the balance between the centrifugal forces acting on the fluid particles and the gravitational forces pulling them down. Step 3: Describe the free surface of a rotating fluid The free surface of a rotating fluid takes the shape of a paraboloid, also known as a parabolic surface. This is because the particles are subjected to both centrifugal and gravitational forces, causing the fluid to form a curve. In conclusion, the free surface of a rotating fluid is a paraboloid shape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Information:  - A voice type is a particular human singing voice identified as having certain qualities or characteristics of vocal range, vocal weight, tessitura, vocal timbre, and vocal transition points (\\"passaggio\\"), such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal register. A singer's voice type is identified by a process known as voice classification, by which the human voice is evaluated and thereby designated into a particular voice type. The discipline of voice classification developed within European classical music and is not generally applicable to other forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices. Several different voice classification systems are available to identify voice types, including the German \\"Fach\\" system and the choral music system among many others; no system is universally applied or accepted.  - Maria Malibran ( 24 March 1808 -- 23 September 1836 ) was a Spanish mezzo - soprano who commonly sang both contralto and soprano parts , and was one of the most famous opera singers of the 19th century . Malibran was known for her stormy personality and dramatic intensity , becoming a legendary figure after her death at age 28 . Contemporary accounts of her voice describe its range , power and flexibility as extraordinary .  - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody.  The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice.  - Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice, and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality, rhythm, and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist. Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists, or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues and popular music styles such as pop and rock.  - A contralto is a type of classical female singing voice whose vocal range is the lowest female voice type. The contralto's vocal range is fairly rare; similar to, but different from the alto, and almost identical to that of a countertenor, typically between the F below middle C (F in scientific pitch notation) to the second F above middle C (F), although at the extremes some voices can reach the E below middle C (E) or the second B above middle C (B). The contralto voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, lyric, and dramatic contralto.

There is one at the canteen entrance. I always cherish a secret desire to take a glance before it at myself in a beautiful new dress. However, each time when it comes to the fulfillment, I get seized with such an uneasiness that I literally stagger  away--backing out at the critical moment. At the root of it is my lack of confidence by which I have been enslaved since childhood. It embarrasses me at the mildest praise, crushes my utmost efforts to say \\"No\\", and prevents me from asking my parents for one cent more than necessary. Among other things, lack of confidence has wormed its way into my love of piano. At the age of 14, one Sunday morning, I was woken up by a resounding hymn . Tracing that call of God into a neighboring church, I found myself deeply attracted by the melody of a piano--something beyond the means of my parents. To make it worse, people say a pianist is supposed to have music in the blood, but I believe I had none from my engineer father and technician mother. For days on end, I kept thinking of nothing else. I had a dream. It wasn't a dream after gold, which made some of my close friends to engage in business as self-employed traders or street peddlers. I was sometimes dazzled by their gold rings or elegant necklaces behind which, however, I seemed to catch sight of skeletons in their cupboards and was frightened away from the craze for fortunate. Out of despair, I kept it to myself, lack of confidence weighing heavy on me. I could do nothing but turn to my dream for comfort, for courage to aim high and wish for the impossible. I was convinced that before I could afford anything expensive (to me, it was a piano), I should climb up the academic ladder as high as possible.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"Yes, the information you found on Google is indeed a correct answer. The greater palatine canal, also known as the pterygopalatine canal, is a passage in the human skull that plays a crucial role in connecting various anatomical structures. To provide further insight into this structure and its significance, we can explore its features, location, and associated structures in more detail. The greater palatine canal is located within the skull, specifically in the posterior region of the maxilla and the adjoining palatine bone. Its position can be described as inferior to the eye socket (inferior orbital fissure) and near the root of the pterygoid process. The canal emerges from the pterygopalatine fossa, a small, pyramid-shaped depression located on the sphenoid bone, where several nerves and blood vessels converge. From this fossa, the canal descends in an anterior and medial direction towards the oral cavity. Structures that pass through the greater palatine canal include the greater palatine artery, vein, and nerve. Each of these components plays a vital role within the skull and oral cavity: 1. Greater palatine artery: This artery is a branch of the maxillary artery, which is a major blood vessel supplying the face and various structures within the oral and nasal cavities. The greater palatine artery supplies blood to the hard palate, the gums of the maxillary teeth, and parts of the nasal cavity. 2. Greater palatine vein: This vein drains the blood from the regions supplied by the greater palatine artery, such as the hard palate and the gums of the maxillary teeth. The blood then travels back to the venous circulation through the pterygoid venous plexus. 3. Greater palatine nerve: This nerve is a branch of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), which is responsible for sensation in the face. The greater palatine nerve provides sensory innervation to the hard and soft palate, the maxillary gingiva, and parts of the nasal cavity. In summary, the greater palatine canal is a vital passage in the human skull that connects the pterygopalatine fossa with the oral cavity. It facilitates the transmission of essential structures such as the greater palatine artery, vein, and nerve, ensuring the proper functioning of associated oral and nasal anatomical components."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: People give off noticeable changes in their movements when they feel attracted to someone.  While everyone has their own set of bodily cues, there are some common signs to look out for when someone's crushing.  Open postures such as uncrossed legs, open arms, and palms facing up. People will often lean in much closer to a crush when speaking with them in comparison to the personal space they use with platonic friends. Sometimes people will play with their hair, jewelry, or will simply make extended eye contact and smile during their conversations with crushes. Prolonged eye contact, even for just over a second, is a common sign of either aggression or romantic interest. Pay close attention to how long your friend's crush gazes at your buddy. If they fail to maintain consistent eye contact, then it could be a bad sign for any hopes of a relationship. On the contrary, it's an excellent signal of affection if they constantly stay locked onto each other's eyes during conversations. See if your friend's crush interacts with your friend frequently on social media accounts such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Pay attention to the language they use with your friend, and see if they use obvious signs such as smiley face or winky face emojis. People looking to give off signs of attraction will likely dole out many compliments to their crush.  Watch to see if your friend's crush praises them on their talents or academic accomplishments. It's important to note that being complimentary isn't always a sign of affection, so it's crucial to pay attention to the frequency of their praise and admiration. Compliments on physical features are an especially key sign of flirting. Did your friend's crush notice their new glasses, haircut, or workout routine? Flirts tend to notice these subtle changes and point them out to convey affection. Sexual innuendos laced in jokes and conversations can also be not-so-subtle signs of a flirt's desire to spice up conversations with the person of their desire. Flirts will commonly drop hints in conversations that reflect their relationship status, such as mentioning they're recently single or how lonely they've been. Some people may flirt very openly and little guessing is required, while others can be introverted flirts with more subtle signs of affection.  Physical flirts rely on body language cues to convey their feelings. They often use physical signs of affection before verbal cues, such as eye contact and playful touching. Traditional flirts tend to be more polite, preferring to convey affection over a longer period of time instead of using flashy and overt statements such as saying they're single or rubbing their crush's arm. These flirts also prefer professional environments like bookstores or study groups to build relationships over parties. Playful flirts use very clear signs of affection in a boisterous manner. For example, they may joke excessively in a sexual way with their crush or make bold physical complements about their crush's appearance. Find out who your crush's friends are and ask around to see if what the status of the crush's feelings are. Chances are if the crush is significant the word has already made its way around to people.

Please answer the following question: -  Green is a color that gathers sunlight easily - Sunlight is gathered by the leaves of the plant - The sunlight is broken down into glucose through photosynthesis - The glucose travels the plant  What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step of the process after glucose has been produced and transported throughout the plant is the utilization and storage of this glucose for various vital functions of the plant. This occurs in two primary ways: cellular respiration and growth, and storing for later use.  1. Cellular Respiration and Growth: The glucose produced through photosynthesis acts as the primary energy source for the plant. A portion of this glucose is converted to a readily available energy molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via the process of cellular respiration, which occurs mainly in the mitochondria of plant cells. Cellular respiration involves a series of chemical reactions, including glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and electron transport, which ultimately results in producing ATP from glucose. The ATP is then used to provide energy for various biochemical processes, including the synthesis of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids necessary for the plant's growth, development, and reproduction. It also helps to maintain the balance of nutrients, ions, and other essential molecules inside cells and aids in transport across cell membranes.  2. Storing for Later Use: As plants produce more glucose than is immediately needed for energy, they store the excess glucose in different forms for future use. This glucose is stored in plant cells as starch, a complex carbohydrate consisting of long chains of glucose molecules. Starch serves as a reserve energy source, and its storage occurs mainly in specialized plastids called amyloplasts in plant organs like roots, stems, and seeds. In times of low light or darkness, when photosynthesis cannot occur, plants break down this stored starch into glucose, allowing them to continue meeting their energy requirements. Moreover, a portion of glucose is also converted into other storage compounds, such as lipids, which can be found in seeds or fruits, and sugars like sucrose, which is used for long-distance transport in the plant's vascular tissues (phloem). These stored compounds can not only provide energy under low light conditions but also become the initial energy source for germination and growth of a new plant. In summary, the last step of the process after sunlight is broken down into glucose through photosynthesis and transported through the plant involves utilizing and storing the glucose for essential functions, including cellular respiration and growth, and maintaining a reserve for future energy needs."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Let's break down the given premise and hypothesis and explore the reasoning behind this conclusion. Premise: \\"Watch them at the wheel of a Long ago, driving became a major opportunity for the Italians to display their dramatic talents.\\" This premise suggests that Italians have, historically, used driving as an opportunity to showcase their dramatic abilities. In other words, they have developed a distinctive driving style, which may involve a certain level of flair and theatrics on the road. Hypothesis: \\"Italians have never learned how to drive.\\" This hypothesis claims that Italians do not know or have never learned the skill of driving. Now, let's try to determine if the truth of the premise implies the truth of the hypothesis. From the premise, we infer that Italians have a unique driving style, which is more theatrical and dramatic compared to drivers of other nationalities. However, it is important to note that a unique, dramatic driving style does not equate to not knowing how to drive. For the hypothesis to be true based on the premise, there would have to be a link between the dramatic driving style and not understanding the skill of driving at all. This evidence is not present in the premise, and therefore, it is not possible to conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. Furthermore, it is possible for someone to have a dramatic driving style while still having proper knowledge and competence in driving. In this case, knowing how to drive does not necessarily mean adhering strictly to a standardized, non-dramatic driving style. In conclusion, if the premise is true, it does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. The premise speaks about a distinctive driving style characterized by dramatic talents, while the hypothesis claims that Italians have never learned how to drive.

Scientists are building a \\"Cold Atom Lab,\\" which would be able to bring matter within down as low as 0.0000000001 degrees above absolute zero, the Christian Science Monitor reports. (The lab itself will be a \\"fridge-sized box,\\" it notes.) Absolute zero, which is equivalent to −459.67 Fahrenheit, is the theoretical point at which matter loses all thermal energy. As matter approaches it, things get weird; it begins acting like a wave, and can be in two places at once. NASA will be studying in particular Bose-Einstein condensates, which are created when millions of atoms begin coalescing into a single wave. Building the lab in zero gravity will make it a lot easier to generate these low temperatures, allowing particles to sit comfortably within a force field. The effort is piggybacking on a broader microgravity lab, the Tech Times adds, and like that lab, isn't expected to launch until 2016. But once it's live, it'll be the coldest place in the known universe—even deep space between galaxies only reaches 3 Kelvin, or -454.27 degrees Fahrenheit, Geek.com points out, compared to the lab's 100 pico-Kelvin. (In other chilly news, scientists have identified the coldest spot on Earth.) Expand this summary.","output":"NASA is working on the development of a \\"Cold Atom Lab\\" to be used in the International Space Station. This lab will have the capability to cool matter down to an unprecedented 0.0000000001 degrees above absolute zero, which is equivalent to -459.67 Fahrenheit. Absolute zero represents the theoretical point at which matter loses all thermal energy and takes on unusual properties, such as behaving like a wave and existing in two places at once. The Cold Atom Lab will be contained within a fridge-sized box and will focus primarily on studying Bose-Einstein condensates, a state of matter that occurs when millions of atoms coalesce into a single wave. By situating the lab in zero gravity, it will be easier to generate the ultra-low temperatures needed for these experiments since particles can be supported within a force field. This project is part of a larger microgravity research initiative and is expected to launch in 2016. When the Cold Atom Lab finally becomes operational, it will effectively be the coldest place in the known universe. For comparison, the emptiness of deep space between galaxies reaches a temperature of 3 Kelvin, or -454.27 Fahrenheit, while the lab will achieve a temperature of 100 pico-Kelvin.

The Redskins played a 4-0 Atlanta Falcons team for the second time in four years; they had previously hosted the 4-0 Falcons in the 2012 season, when Atlanta won 24-17 to move to 5-0 for the first time in franchise history. That game, coincidentally, was Kirk Cousins' first appearance in an NFL game. Three years later, now as the starter, he was attempting to lead Washington to their first 3-2 start since 2011. He faced a stern test though, as his career TD-INT ratio on the road was 11-13, and he had never played in a road game without throwing at least one interception. Washington was only able to run four plays on their first drive before having to punt to Atlanta. The Falcons were able to cross midfield before quarterback Matt Ryan's pass to superstar receiver Julio Jones was tipped and intercepted by Redskins safety Trenton Robinson; it was Washington's first interception of the season. Nearing the end of a scoreless first quarter, the Redskins tried to accumulate some momentum in the running game, as their longest run so far had been only 4 yards. Alfred Morris and Matt Jones both saw action, but it was the passing game that began to heat up. The two longest plays on the drive were a 14-yard pass to Chris Thompson and a 21-yarder to Pierre Gar&#231;on. The drive culminated in tight end Derek Carrier's first career touchdown pass, a 7-yard throw from Cousins that gave the Redskins a 7-0 lead early in the second quarter. Atlanta responded with a methodical drive, including only 2 plays longer than 7 yards, to get on the board. Kicker Matt Bryant connected on a 42-yard field goal and the Falcons cut the deficit to 7-3. Washington's next drive was not as effective, with only one out of five plays gaining positive yards before Cousins threw deep and was intercepted by Falcons cornerback Robert Alford, who returned the ball into Redskins territory. Of the 8 career road games in which Cousins had now played, he totaled 14 interceptions, and had thrown at least one interception in each. The Falcons now needed to capitalize on the turnover, and advanced the ball to the Redskins' 23-yard-line, easily within field goal range. Defensive end Chris Baker had other ideas, sacking Ryan on 3rd and 3 and forcing a fumble, which was recovered by linebacker Will Compton. However, Atlanta regained possession with 1:39 left and all three of their timeouts. Running back Devonta Freeman and tight end Jacob Tamme helped get the Falcons into field goal range, but Bryant missed a short 38-yard attempt, bouncing the ball off of the right upright. Entering halftime, undefeated Atlanta trailed Washington 7-3 at home. The Falcons began the second half aggressively, throwing on 6 of their first 7 plays. This got them into field goal range. Bryant attempted to redeem himself for the earlier miss, but this kick bounced off the left upright. The ensuing Redskins drive utilized several short Cousins passes to get into field goal range, although Hopkins missed the 53-yard attempt. Atlanta crossed midfield on their next drive, and faced a decision on 4th-and-6 from the Redskins' 40-yard-line, just outside of Bryant's range. Ryan threw to Jones, his most reliable target, for a gain of 9 and the first down. Two plays later, Bashaud Breeland was called for a horse-collar tackle, which moved the ball from the Redskins' 30-yard-line to the 15. This was close enough for Bryant to convert a field goal, and Atlanta had crept within one of Washington, 7-6. Still unable to move the ball effectively, the Redskins went three-and-out to give the ball back to Atlanta. Washington then struggled on defense as well, allowing 4 plays of 10+ yards. Chris Baker forced a Freeman fumble at the goal line, but Julio Jones jumped on the ball in the endzone for the go-ahead score. Falcons first-year head coach Dan Quinn opted to attempt a two-point conversion to go up by a full seven points, but Ryan's pass fell incomplete to keep the lead at 12-7. The Atlanta drive covered 91 yards in just 11 plays, and now only 9 minutes remained in the game. With their lead gone, and having been shut out in the second half, the Redskins began a crucial drive from their own 20-yard-line. A 10-yard pass and a 26-yard pass, both to rookie receiver Jamison Crowder, were followed by a deep attempt to fellow rookie Rashad Ross. The ball fell incomplete, but Atlanta defensive back Robert Alford was assessed a 42-yard pass interference penalty that gave Washington the ball on the 2-yard line. On the next play, Matt Jones completed the all-rookie drive with a touchdown, allowing Washington to regain the lead, 13-12. Redskins coach Jay Gruden attempted a two-point conversion to extend the margin to a field goal, but it, like the Falcons' attempt, fell incomplete. Atlanta then committed a surprising turnover, a Ryan pass intercepted by Breeland, who returned the ball all the way back to the Atlanta 21-yard-line. This allowed the Redskins to extend the lead to 16-12, significant because Atlanta now needed a touchdown to win instead of a field goal. Atlanta's next 6 plays covered 67 yards, followed by an apparent 13-yard touchdown pass on 3rd and 2; however, the play was later ruled an incomplete pass because Freeman did not maintain possession of the ball as he fell to the ground. The Falcons had to convert the next play, a 4th and 2, to keep any hope of a perfect season. Veteran receiver Roddy White made the catch, and Freeman redeemed himself on the next play with a touchdown, resulting in a 19-16 Falcons lead. They had run the clock down to 24 seconds, leaving almost no time for the Redskins to respond, but Washington still had all three timeouts. Their next three plays, gains of 20, 19, and 7 to Carrier, Garcon, and Crowder, took only 19 seconds, leaving 5 seconds for a 52-yard attempt at a game-tying field goal. Hopkins drilled the kick, tying the game at 19-19, and the game went into overtime. In 24 previous meetings, dating back to 1966, the Redskins and Falcons had never gone into overtime, and Atlanta had won the last four meetings. The Redskins won the coin toss and began overtime on offense. A Crowder 17-yard catch moved them near midfield, only needing about 20 more yards to get into Hopkins' range. Three plays later, though, Cousins attempted to pass to rookie receiver Ryan Grant, but Grant slipped on the route, allowing Robert Alford to intercept the pass and return it 59 yards for a touchdown, a 25-19 Falcons win, and their second 5-0 start in franchise history. For the Redskins, the heartbreaking loss was the second time in four seasons they had lost to Atlanta in Week 5 by 7 points or fewer. Cousins moved to 0-3 in his career against the Falcons and threw the 15th career interception on the road in only 8 games. In each of Washington's three losses, Cousins had thrown 2 interceptions; in their two wins, he had not thrown any. Based on the above article, answer a question.

In 1923 a major earthquake struck the city. Thousands of people were killed and millions were left homeless as buildings collapsed and fires broke out throughout Tokyo. It took seven years to rebuild the city. During World War II, Tokyo was destroyed once again. As a result of these disasters, there is nothing of old Tokyo remaining in the downtown area. After the war, the people of Tokyo began to rebuild their city. Buildings went up at a fantastic rate, and between1945 and 1960, the city's population more than doubled. Because of the Olympic Games held in Tokyo in 1964, many new stadiums, parks and hotels were built to treat visitors from all over the world.

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that  Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress.

Choose your answer from:  -no.  -yes.","output":"The process of manufacturing laptop chargers by Sony and Apple may share similarities. However, they are not the same due to differences in the products and the companies themselves. So, the answer to your question is: no. First, let's look at how Sony makes laptop chargers: Sony, a Japanese multinational conglomerate, has its charger manufacturing process well-established to meet high-quality standards for their products. The process of making laptop chargers includes several stages: 1. Design and Development: Sony engineers work together to design the charger with the competing factors of size, output voltage, and current in mind. Their goal is to create a charger that provides the necessary output while remaining compact and durable. 2. Material Selection: High-quality components and materials, such as transformers, capacitors, diodes, and resistors, must be selected to ensure the charger can withstand prolonged usage without failure. 3. Manufacturing: During the manufacturing phase, the electronic components are assembled onto a printed circuit board (PCB). Soldering techniques, automated machines, and quality control measures are employed to ensure the safe and proper assembly of the charger. 4. Testing: Each charger undergoes a series of tests, including stress tests, electrical tests, and safety tests, to ensure it meets quality requirements. 5. Packaging: Finally, the chargers are packaged and prepared for shipment to various locations worldwide. Now let's look at how Apple makes laptop chargers: Apple, an American multinational technology company, is known for its sleek and innovative product designs. The process of making laptop chargers at Apple also involves several stages: 1. Design and Development: Apple's design team creates chargers with aesthetic appeal, convenience, and technological advancement in mind. The company is known for its innovations, such as the MagSafe connector, which was unique to Apple chargers and provided a magnetic attachment. 2. Material Selection: As with Sony, high-quality components and materials must be selected to build a reliable and long-lasting charger. Apple also emphasizes using environmentally friendly materials in their manufacturing processes. 3. Manufacturing: Apple outsources its manufacturing to contract manufacturers like Foxconn, who assemble the charger components onto a printed circuit board. The process involves soldering, automated machinery, and strict quality control measures to ensure each charger meets Apple's standards. 4. Testing: Similar to Sony, laptop chargers made by Apple also undergo a series of tests, including electrical and safety tests, to meet compliance standards and ensure product quality. 5. Packaging: Apple's chargers are then packaged in their recognizable minimalist packaging and shipped globally. In conclusion, while both Sony and Apple produce laptop chargers through similar steps, the design, technological innovations, and company-specific process details make these two questions different.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Did you sleep the day away on March 21? Well, you should have done that because it was World Sleeping Day. This is the one day of the year when people around the world care about their sleep and ask themselves a lot of questions about sleep. Why do we need sleep? Nobody as yet can give a correct answer to this question. However, tests have shown that lack of sleep over about four weeks leads to a strong drop in body temperature, great weight loss and finally sickness. Different people need different amounts of sleep. Eight hours a night is considered the average amount of sleep. For teenagers the least number of sleeping hours advised by doctors are ten hours for primary school students, nine for junior highs and eight for senior highs. Some people seem to get along just fine with very little sleep at night. Leading American scientist Thomas Edison said that sleep was a waste of time. He did, however, take naps during the day. On the other hand, Albert Einstein, another great scientist, said he needed at least ten hours' sleep a night. Here are some of the most useful suggestions, for a good night's sleep. Go to bed regularly. Use your bed only to sleep. Don't exercise in the evening. Keep the bedroom dark and quiet. Drink a glass of milk before sleep.

Input: Passage: The Sack of Brescia took place on February 18, 1512 during the War of the League of Cambrai. The city of Brescia had revolted against French control, garrisoning itself with Venetian troops. Gaston de Foix, recently arrived to command the French armies in Italy, ordered the city to surrender; when it refused, he attacked it with around 12,000 men. The French attack took place in a pouring rain, through a field of mud; Foix ordered his men to remove their shoes for better traction. The defenders inflicted heavy casualties on the French, but were eventually overrun, suffering 8,000 - 15,000 casualties. The Gascon infantry and landsknechts then proceeded to thoroughly sack the city, massacring thousands of civilians over the next five days. Following this, the city of Bergamo paid some 60,000 ducats to the French to avoid a similar fate. Output:","output":"1.

Billie Jo (our daughter) was probably around ten years old when it happened. We had a young Black Labrador dog who had become quite smitten with chewing things up that she wasn't supposed to. The list grew longer as the months passed. Looker, our black lab, had chewed up and eaten a 10 bill, my VCR remote control (probably around 1987), and a sticker-filled blackberry vine my wife had planted. How she did that one without serious repercussions is beyond me. She also had a habit of grabbing the mail as it slid through the slot that was in our front door, taking it out back and 'sorting' it for us. So what happened really came as no big surprise. My daughter was a very diligent student, never wanting to let down her teachers by not turning her homework in as soon as she got to school (at least until she hit 14). One morning our daughter was trying to find the math homework that she knew she had completed the night before. My wife assisted in the search and soon found a partially chewed up piece of our daughter's homework page. Our daughter was devastated! How could she possibly walk in to school and publicly announce, “My dog ate my homework!” without becoming the laughing stock of the school? Like this: Mama Bear (my wife) storms into the classroom and vehemently upholds our daughter's “dog ate my homework” bit, showing the teacher the half eaten paper. Funny thing was, the teacher would have never doubted our little girl for one minute.

Einstein was displeased with quantum theory and mechanics (the very theory he helped create), despite its acceptance by other physicists, stating that God \\"is not playing at dice.\\" Einstein continued to maintain his disbelief in the theory, and attempted unsuccessfully to disprove it until he died at the age of 76. In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser. This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws. Einstein discovered Louis de Broglie's work, and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for de Broglie waves, which Einstein suggested was the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of mechanics.

One day, ahot spring causes Graboid eggs to hatch, resulting in the death of 17 miners. Hiram Gummer, great-grandfather of Burt Gummer (Michael Gross) and the mine's owner, arrives in town to fix the problem. After Graboids attack his camp one night, he is shocked by their presence. One of his companions, Juan, kills one with a pickax, and the pair escapes. Inexperienced and not fond with firearms, Hiram calls for a gunfighter, Black Hand Kelly (Billy Drago). Hiram and Kelly do not get along well, though Kelly succeeds in conveying to Hiram some of his attitude towards firearms and life in general. Eventually, Kelly is eaten alive but not before discovering that a total of four Graboids have hatched. Hiram decides to abandon Rejection and leave the townsfolk to their fate. However, they force him to give them the silver mine, threatening to alert potential buyers to the danger if he sells it out from under them. In Carson City, Hiram hears a telegram revealing that the fully-grown Graboids have made it through the pass and are headed for the town. Changing his mind, he buys weapons, heads back to Rejection to lead a last stand against the Graboids, and helps the town ready itself. After two Graboids are killed, the third and final one adapts and avoids all of the traps. Hiram tricks it into coming to the surface and then attaches it by the tail to the wheel of a steam traction engine. The Graboid is reeled in and slammed against the wheel with such force that it is explosively decapitated on impact. With the creatures dead, the town decides to keep them secret out of fear that no one would settle in the area if their existence was known, and use the proceeds from the mine to pay for their belongings.

Background: Pfeiffer was born in Santa Ana, California, the second of four children of Richard Pfeiffer, an air-conditioning contractor, and Donna (nee Taverna), a housewife. She has one elder brother, Rick (born 1955), and two younger sisters, Dedee Pfeiffer (born 1964), a television and film actress, and Lori Pfeiffer (born 1965). Her parents were both originally from North Dakota. Her paternal grandfather was of German ancestry and her paternal grandmother was of English, Welsh, French, Irish, and Dutch descent, while her maternal grandfather was of Swiss-German descent and her maternal grandmother of Swedish ancestry. Context: Pfeiffer's subsequent career choices have met with varying degrees of success. After The Age of Innocence, she played the role of Laura Alden opposite Jack Nicholson in Wolf (1994), a horror film that garnered a mixed critical reception. The New York Times wrote: \\"Ms. Pfeiffer's role is underwritten, but her performance is expert enough to make even diffidence compelling\\". The movie grossed US65 million (equivalent to 107.3 million) at the domestic box office and US131 million worldwide (equivalent to 216.3 million). Her next role was that of high school teacher and former US Marine LouAnne Johnson in the surprise box office hit Dangerous Minds (1995), which was co-produced under Pfeiffer's film production company Via Rosa Productions. She appeared as her character in the music video for the soundtrack's lead single, \\"Gangsta's Paradise\\" by Coolio (featuring L.V.), which was used by the producer Jerry Bruckheimer for television advertising. A 60-second version was aired on music channels, while a 30-second cut was aired in the rest of the networks. The song won the 1996 Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance, and the video won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Rap Video.  In 1996, she turned down the Golden Globe Award-winning role of Eva Peron in the biopic Evita, which went to Madonna. Pfeiffer then portrayed Sally Atwater in the romantic drama Up Close & Personal (1996) opposite Robert Redford. The film's screenplay, co-written by husband and wife team John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion, was intended to be a biographical account of the career of news anchor Jessica Savitch, but the final version had almost nothing to do with Savitch's life, leading Dunne to write an expose of his eight-year battle with the Hollywood producers, Monster: Living Off the Big Screen.  She took the role of Gillian Lewis in To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday (1996), which was adapted by her husband David Kelley from Michael Brady's play of the same name. Pfeiffer and her producing partner Guinzburg were on a winning streak of producing three back to back films next under their Via Rosa Productions header that included, One Fine Day (1996), A Thousand Acres (1997) and The Deep End of the Ocean (1998). She served as an executive producer and starred as the divorced single mother architect Melanie Parker in the romantic comedy One Fine Day (1996) opposite George Clooney, Subsequent performances included Rose Cook Lewis in the film adaptation of Jane Smiley's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel A Thousand Acres (1997) with Jessica Lange and Jennifer Jason Leigh; Beth Cappadora in The Deep End of the Ocean (1998) about a married couple who found their son who was kidnapped nine years ago; Titania the Queen of the Fairies in A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999) with Kevin Kline, Rupert Everett and Stanley Tucci; and Katie Jordan in Rob Reiner's comedy-drama The Story of Us (1999) opposite Bruce Willis.

These stories can be difficult due to their length and how each story has at least one of the three following scenarios: the first is when the individual's belief matches reality, the second is when the individual's belief does not match reality, and the third is when an individual has a false belief about another individual's beliefs. The question will ask about the location of an object in the story with respect to either none or one of the three scenarios. Note that there are distractor sentences in each story that are unrelated to the question and are designed to confuse the reader. Mia entered the kitchen. Hannah entered the kitchen. The corn is in the green_basket. Hannah exited the kitchen. Mia moved the corn to the blue_treasure_chest. Mia exited the kitchen. Hannah entered the kitchen. Phone rang. Mia entered the den.

A:","output":"Part #1: Identifying scenarios within the story. Usage: The first scenario is when the individual's belief matches reality. Example: The corn is in the green_basket, and Mia knows it's there. This meets the criteria because the individual (Mia) and reality both acknowledge the object's location. Part #2: Identifying distractor sentences. Usage: Phone rang. Example: The sentence \\"Phone rang\\" is not relevant to the location of objects or the story's main events. It meets the criteria since it's designed to confuse the reader. Part #3: Answering the question about the story. Usage: Where will James look for the strawberry? Example: In the blue_crate. This meets the criteria because it addresses the location of the object (strawberry) based on the events in the story and James' knowledge."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information:  - The President of Iraq is the head of state of Iraq and \\"safeguards the commitment to the Constitution and the preservation of Iraq's independence, sovereignty, unity, the security of its territories in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution\\". The President is elected by the Council of Representatives by a two-thirds majority, and is limited to two four-year terms. The President is responsible for ratifying treaties and laws passed by the Council of Representatives, issues pardons on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, and performs the \\"duty of the Higher Command of the armed forces for ceremonial and honorary purposes\\".  - The Prime Minister of Iraq is Iraq's head of government. Prime Minister was originally an appointed office, subsidiary to the head of state, and the nominal leader of the Iraqi parliament. Under the newly adopted constitution the Prime Minister is to be the country's active executive authority. Nouri al-Maliki (formerly Jawad al-Maliki) was selected to be Prime Minister on 21 April 2006. On 14 August 2014 al-Maliki agreed to step down as prime minister of Iraq to allow Haider al-Abadi to take his place.  - Iraq (, or ; '; '), officially known as the Republic of Iraq ('; ') is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west. The capital, and largest city, is Baghdad. The main ethnic groups are Arabs and Kurds; others include Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Yazidis, Armenians, Mandeans, Circassians, and Kawliya. Around 95% of the country's 36 million citizens are Muslims, with Christianity, Yarsan, Yezidism, and Mandeanism also present. The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish.  - Nouri Kamil Mohammed Hasan al-Maliki (born 20 June 1950), also known as Jawad al-Maliki or Abu Esraa, is an Iraqi politician who was Prime Minister of Iraq from 2006 to 2014. He is secretary-general of the Islamic Dawa Party and a Vice President of Iraq from 2014 to 2015.  - Saddam Hussein Abd al-Majid al-Tikriti (Arabic: \\"\\"; 28 April 1937  30 December 2006) was the fifth President of Iraq, serving in this capacity from 16 July 1979 until 9 April 2003.

In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch.  - Baghdad is the capital of the Republic of Iraq. The population of Baghdad, , is approximately 7.216.040 making it the largest city in Iraq, the second largest city in the Arab world (after Cairo, Egypt), and the second largest city in Western Asia (after Tehran, Iran).  - Haider Jawad Kadhim Al - Abadi ( or al - ' Ibadi ; Arabic :      , born 25 April 1952 ) is an Iraqi politician who has been Prime Minister of Iraq since 2014 .

Daraar is a 1996 Indian thriller film directed by Abbas-Mustan starring Juhi Chawla, Rishi Kapoor and Arbaaz Khan in his film debut. Khan received the Filmfare Best Villain Award for his portrayal as a possessive husband. The film became average at the box office and was inspired by the Julia Roberts thriller \\"Sleeping with the Enemy\\".","output":"Based on the text provided, it is difficult to definitively determine if Daraar is Arbaaz Khan's most successful role. However, we can analyze the available information to make a more informed assessment. In Daraar, Arbaaz Khan made his film debut and won the Filmfare Best Villain Award for his portrayal of a possessive husband. This achievement suggests that his performance in the film was critically acclaimed and recognized with an important award. The film itself was declared average at the box office, which indicates that while not a blockbuster commercial hit, it still had some level of success. Additionally, Daraar was inspired by the Julia Roberts thriller \\"Sleeping with the Enemy,\\" which could mean that the source material and general theme of the film had a proven track record of attractiveness to audiences. However, simply winning an award for his debut role doesn't necessarily constitute Arbaaz Khan's most successful role. Success can be measured in various ways such as commercial success, critical acclaim, personal satisfaction, or lasting impact on the industry. To truly determine whether Daraar is Arbaaz Khan's most successful role, more information about his career, other film roles, and achievements would be required. In conclusion, based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively say if Daraar is Arbaaz Khan's most successful role. While his award-winning performance is a significant achievement, a more comprehensive analysis of his entire career would be necessary to make this determination."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I liked Simon Pegg in the two films I've seen him in--- Hot Fuzz, and Shaun of the Dead. His role here, though, took a completely different turn. Shows his range as an actor, but nonetheless I really disliked th character as he was portrayed at the beginning. There's a kind of humour I call \\"frustration comedy.\\" Its supposed \\"jokes\\" and wit are really nothing more than painful and awkward moments. Much like the Bean character Rowan Atkinmson plays. There are a number of other comedic actors who portray similar characters too. I don't mean to bash them here, so will not. But do be warned that if you are like me, and you dislike smarmy and maddeningly bungling idiots, Pegg shows just such characteristics for the first third of this film. It DOES get better, however. I read somewhere that this is based on a true story. Hmmm. Maybe. The film's story stopped being annoying, and became kind of a triumph of the \\"little guy\\" in the final third. I don't need all films to be sugar and light--- but coincidentally, as this film got better, it also started to be more and more of a happy ending. It was also a pleasure to see an old favourite, Jeff Bridges, play a role so masterfully. I liked \\"Iron Man,\\" but was saddened by the fact that Bridges' character was a villain. Purely personal taste, of course, as his acting in that was superb. Nonetheless, he was a marvel here as the Bigger Than Life man of vision, the publisher of Sharps. It was nice to see him in a role that I could actually enjoy. Overall then, I liked it! I just wish I had come in 40 minutes late, and missed the beginning. Would you say this review is positive or negative?","output":"This review can be considered as a mixed one, leaning more towards positive. The reviewer starts off describing their dislike for Simon Pegg's character at the beginning of the film but later states that it gets better, and they end up appreciating the triumph of the \\"little guy\\" and the happy ending. The reviewer also enjoyed Jeff Bridges' performance and liked the film overall but wished they had missed the beginning.

Step 4: Consider alternative explanations One possible explanation for the baby having glasses in his mouth is that the baby is teething, meaning his teeth are growing in and he feels discomfort. It is common for teething babies to chew on objects to help relieve their discomfort.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  In addition to a produce market in Cornville, Arizona; Keenan, whose grandparents and great-uncle made wine in Northern Italy, owns Merkin Vineyards and Caduceus Cellars, based in the unincorporated area of Page Springs/Cornville, Arizona, southwest of Sedona, where he resides. While the winery is named after an ancient symbol for commerce (caduceus), the vineyard is named after a pubic wig (merkin).

Next, we iterate through the given list of integers [-55, 6, -90, -43] using a loop.    a. In the first iteration, we have the elements -55 and 6.       i. We find the difference: -55 - 6 = -61       ii. We take the absolute value of the difference: |-61| = 61       iii. We append the absolute difference to the 'differences' list: differences = [61]    b. In the second iteration, we have the elements 6 and -90.       i.

You can do this by iterating through the list and counting the number of numbers and alphabets. Here's a step by step process: 1. Initialize two counters - one for numbers (numCount) and one for alphabets (alphaCount). Set both to 0. 2. Loop through each element in the list. 3. For each element, check if it is a number or an alphabet.    a. To check if an element is a number, you can use the \`isdigit()\` string method. If the element is a number, increment the numCount by 1.        b. To check if an element is an alphabet, you can use the \`isalpha()\` string method. If the element is an alphabet, increment the alphaCount by 1. 4. After the loop finishes, compare the values of numCount and alphaCount.    a. If numCount is greater than alphaCount, return 'Numbers Win'.        b. If alphaCount is greater than numCount, return 'Alphabets Win'.        c.

Initialize numCount to 0 and alphaCount to 0. 2. Loop through each element in the list:    For '671': isdigit() is True, increment numCount (numCount = 1).    For 'S': isalpha() is True, increment alphaCount (alphaCount = 1).    For '1815': isdigit() is True, increment numCount (numCount = 2).    For 'H': isalpha() is True, increment alphaCount (alphaCount = 2).    For '8893': isdigit() is True, increment numCount (numCount = 3).    For 'D': isalpha() is True, increment alphaCount (alphaCount = 3). 3. Compare numCount and alphaCount:   a. numCount = 3   b. alphaCount = 3   c.

I did not know much about Close to Leo  just that it was supposed to be excellent coming out of age movie and it deals with a very serious topic  Aids.  Although the person who has aids  is Leo  the scenario wraps around the way in which Marcel (the youngest brother of Leo) coupes with the sickness of his relative. At first everyone is trying to hide the truth from Marcel  he is believed to be too young to understand the sickness of his brother  the fact that Leo is also a homosexual contributes to the unwillingness of the parents to discus the matter with the young Marcel. I know from experience that on many occasions most older people do not want to accept the fact that sometimes even when someone is young this does not automatically means that he will not be able to accept the reality and act in more adequate manner then even themselves . With exception of the fact that the family tried to conceal the truth from Marcel, they have left quite an impression for me  the way they supported their son  even after discovering the truth about his sexuality and his sickness. The fact that they allowed the young Marcel to travel along with Leo to Paris to meet his ex boyfriend was quite a gesture from them most families I know will be reluctant to do that. There is a lot of warmth in the scenes in which the brothers spend some time together  you can see them being real friends , concern about each other.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Intel delivers updated Itanium 2 chips Gunning for markets that have long been the domain of RISC-based systems, Intel yesterday delivered updated Itanium 2 processors with larger memory caches. What is this text about?","output":"This text discusses Intel's release of updated Itanium 2 processors designed to compete in markets traditionally dominated by RISC-based systems. By incorporating larger memory caches into the processors, Intel aims to gain a strategic advantage in these markets. To provide a detailed and long answer, we'll take a step-by-step approach: 1. Introduction to Itanium Processor: The Itanium processor family is a series of 64-bit processors developed by Intel in collaboration with Hewlett-Packard (HP). These processors use the Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC) architecture, which enables better parallelism and instruction-level parallelism for superior performance. Itanium processors are typically used in high-end server and workstation environments where high performance, large memory addressability, and reliability are crucial.  2. RISC-based systems: RISC stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computing and is a processor design that emphasizes a simplified set of instructions with an intent to improve performance. RISC-based systems have historically been popular in high-performance computing, server and workstation markets, which value their speed and efficiency. Some popular RISC architectures are ARM, PowerPC, and MIPS. 3. The competition between Itanium and RISC-based systems: Before the release of the updated Itanium 2 processors mentioned in the text, markets that required powerful computing capabilities heavily relied on RISC-based systems. These systems were generally faster and easier to implement, thereby becoming the preferred choice over Intel's Itanium processors for high-performance computing applications. 4. The launch of updated Itanium 2 processors: To gain a foothold in the market dominated by RISC-based systems, Intel released updated versions of its Itanium 2 processors. The primary improvement in these updated processors was the inclusion of larger memory caches. Memory caches are crucial for improving performance in processors, as they help in reducing the latency involved with processing data by storing frequently used instructions or data, speeding up the CPU's overall function. 5. Importance of larger memory caches: By incorporating larger memory caches in the updated Itanium 2 processors, Intel aimed to enhance the performance of their chips, making them more competent contenders against RISC-based systems. Larger caches allow for better storage of frequently accessed data, leading to reduced latency and a faster processing speed. This improvement can give Intel's processors an edge over their RISC-based counterparts, allowing them to grab a share of the high-performance computing market. In conclusion, the text refers to Intel's introduction of updated Itanium 2 processors, featuring larger memory caches, to make strides in markets predominantly occupied by RISC-based systems. This move was intended to improve the performance of the Itanium processors, making them more competitive contenders against RISC-designed architectures in high-performance computing applications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Romans are known for the great number of deities they honored, a capacity that earned the mockery of early Christian polemicists. The presence of Greeks on the Italian peninsula from the beginning of the historical period influenced Roman culture, introducing some religious practices that became as fundamental as the cult of Apollo. The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks (interpretatio graeca), adapting Greek myths and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art.

From the moment I first came across \\"The Stone Boy\\", something told me it would be a great film. In spite of that, it seemed very unlikely that I'd ever have the opportunity to actually see it for myself. Then, one day, while looking through the online catalogue of my local library, I saw that they had recently purchased the DVD release of this film. Which I'm extremely glad for, because the cinematography is of a stunning depth and quality that an old VHS copy could never replicate. And speaking of the cinematography, I must single it out as far and above the most stunning aspect of this film. As a photographer who pursues very nearly the exact visual style portrayed in \\"The Stone Boy\\", I'm a firm believer in the fact that a great cinematographer can almost single-handedly carry a film. Here, he has a lot of help from an extremely talented cast, and a director who understands perfectly what the story needs. But to have Juan Ruiz Anchía behind the camera makes virtually every scene something of beauty. And you can almost never say that. Most films would never even expect such a thing of you. Scene after scene captures some detail, some little bit of visual magic that takes your breath away. The director, Christopher Cain, has had a long and interesting career. As far as I can gather, this film is not very representative of it. But, sometimes, to catch a director near the beginnings of his career, before all the big budgets and loss of focus, there's a real subtle magic to be found. Cain steps back in this film, lets things happen with a life of their own, and then ever further. Much like early John Sayles films, characters are given space to breathe, time to talk. Side stories happen because they do, and that's how life is. Cain displays a remarkable, raw, even outright painful understanding of human nature in this film. The acting ties much of this story together. When people talk, when they exist in this film, they do so as actual people, not held back by the fact that they are playing characters. Gina Berriault's script allows immensely talented and respected actors like Wilford Brimley, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Frederic Forrest to spend time simply existing. Whether the things they have to say are minor or of deep significance, it all comes down with the weight of pure reality. When you look at the actors involved, or the great soundtrack by James Horner, it seems strange that such a film be very nearly forgotten. Maybe much of what makes \\"The Stone Boy\\" what it is was the time period it was made in. There's this 1970s hangover feeling to this picture that reminds me deeply of my own childhood. People talk of the 80s in terms of modern styles and music, but that's not the 80s I lived in or remember. The look of the images, the understated and dark knowing quality of the acting, and the overall result should get under the skin of any person who grew up in or near this era of time in North America. I see myself in this. I see how I saw the world. And a film like \\"The Stone Boy\\" sees the world for how it truly is. For more of this feeling, please see: The Black Stallion (1979), Never Cry Wolf (1983), Tender Mercies (1983), Testament (1983), Places in the Heart (1984), Matewan (1987), High Tide (1987), Driving Miss Daisy (1989), The Secret Garden (1993), The Secret of Roan Inish (1994), Wendy and Lucy (2008) Would you say this review is positive or negative?","output":"This review is definitely positive.

Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him. Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump has... After the story ends, Comey probably: - returns to the FBI after a few months - not enough information - Does not return to working for the FBI ever - works for a restaurant chain Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided and the circumstances surrounding Comey's firing and subsequent events, it is most likely that James Comey does not return to working for the FBI ever. To elaborate on this assessment, it is essential to consider the following points: 1. Tense relationship with Trump: The relationship between Comey and President Trump was strained, as evidenced by the harsh criticisms and insults exchanged between them. Trump's public condemnation of Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball\\" and his comment that it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him make it highly improbable that Comey would be welcomed back into the FBI under Trump's administration. 2. Comey's book and allegations: Comey's memoir, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" criticizes Trump on several fronts, accusing him of being unethical, unfit to lead, and demanding personal loyalty over professional duties. By writing this book and making such serious accusations against the president, Comey has further distanced himself from any possibility of returning to the FBI. 3. Appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel: Following Comey's firing, Robert Mueller was appointed as the special counsel to oversee the Russia investigation. This development confirmed that the investigation would continue and has since expanded to include possible obstruction of justice by Trump due to Comey's firing. Given this context, it is unlikely that Comey would be brought back into the FBI, as it could imply political influence or interference in the ongoing investigation. 4. Future career prospects: After leaving such a high-profile position within the FBI and given the controversy surrounding his dismissal, it is more probable that Comey may pursue opportunities in other professional fields, such as academia, private sector consulting, or even starting his own ventures, rather than working for a restaurant chain as suggested. In conclusion, taking into account the contentious relationship between Comey and Trump, the accusations made in his memoir, and the ongoing Mueller investigation, it is most plausible that James Comey does not return to working for the FBI ever. His future career moves may involve exploring new fields or leveraging his extensive experience in law enforcement and national security in other capacities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Eye contact and smiling are two universal acts of flirting. Looking at someone from across a room lets them know that you notice them. When you smile, you're showing them that you are open to talking to them and that you may be interested in them, or that you like how they look. Don't force a smile or stare at them, however!  You can meet a potential date at school, work, a grocery store, a bar, or in other social situations. Smiling also releases endorphins that make you happier and can make other people react in a positive way.  Maintain eye contact for two to three seconds before looking away. If you look back and the person is still looking in your direction, this is a good sign that they meant to lock eyes with you. You can tell a lot just by the way someone looks at you or carries themselves. For example, if they point their feet toward you or lean in your direction, they may be interested in you. If they cross their arms and legs or point their knees away from you, they are not interested in you. Other signs include:  If the person smiles back, it's a good indicator that they wouldn't mind your company. If they hold your gaze for more than two seconds, it's a good sign that they would talk to you. If they avoid your gaze, look uncomfortable, or avoid you altogether, this is a sign that they aren't interested. Once you've evaluated that they like your attention, you can introduce yourself. Walk up to them with confidence by standing upright and keeping your shoulders back. Start by offering a handshake and saying hello. Begin the conversation by asking for their name or talking about something relatable.  For example, you can say something like, \\"Hey, my name's Alex. This band rocks. What do you think of them?\\" Pay close attention to their body language and facial expressions. If they look disgusted, disinterested, or frightened, you may not want to introduce yourself. Once you've introduced yourself to them and they appear receptive to you, you can start a conversation. Start by asking small questions, like how their day is so far or if they live in the area. If the conversation seems like it's stalling, ask them questions about themselves. Practice active listening by paying close attention to what the person has to say and where they are coming from. Improve your communication and listening skills by providing feedback, deferring judgemental thoughts, and responding appropriately. Instead of waiting for your turn to say something, internalize and listen to what the person is saying and show them that you're invested in the conversation.  You can enhance your listening skills by summarizing or repeating something that the person said. For example, if they explain how they liked a band before they went mainstream, you can say something like, \\"So what you're saying is that you liked their underground sound more than their poppy new music, right?\\" Some good starter questions include: What do you like to do in your spare time? What kind of music do you prefer? Are you a student? Do you like art? or What's your favorite movie? Don't plainly ask the question by itself. Integrate it into the conversation. For example say, \\"I just saw the new Guillermo Del Toro film and thought it was amazing. What movies do you like?\\" If you listen to what they have to say, you'll determine whether the person would be interested in seeing you again. If they mention a significant other, then they will most likely not go on a date with you. If they seem happy and enthusiastic to talk to you, then it's likely they want to see you again. If they avoid eye contact altogether and have short responses, you should take this as a sign to leave. If they seem comfortable and happy while talking to you, it's a good hint that they will say yes if you ask them out. Ask them for their contact information first, then see how they feel about meeting up with you later. It may be stressful to ask the question, but don't wait too long to ask, or you may never get the opportunity. You can say something like, \\"I had a fun time talking to you. Do you want to do this again?\\"","output":"This article explains the importance of eye contact, smiling, and body language in the flirting process. It suggests maintaining eye contact for two to three seconds and observing the other person's body language to gauge their interest. Once a connection is established, approach confidently, introduce yourself, and start a conversation by asking open-ended questions. Active listening and appropriate responses are crucial in understanding the other person's intentions.

Fonda made his mark early as a Broadway actor. He also appeared in 1938 in plays performed in White Plains, New York, with Joan Tompkins. He made his Hollywood debut in 1935, and his career gained momentum after his Academy Award-nominated performance as Tom Joad in The Grapes of Wrath, a 1940 adaptation of John Steinbeck's novel about an Oklahoma family who moved west during the Dust Bowl. At age 20, Fonda started his acting career at the Omaha Community Playhouse, when his mother's friend Dodie Brando (mother of Marlon Brando) recommended that he try out for a juvenile part in You and I, in which he was cast as Ricky. He was fascinated by the stage, learning everything from set construction to stage production, and embarrassed by his acting ability. When he received the lead in Merton of the Movies, he realized the beauty of acting as a profession, as it allowed him to deflect attention from his own tongue-tied personality and create stage characters relying on someone else's scripted words. Fonda decided to quit his job and go east in 1928 to seek his fortune.  He arrived on Cape Cod and played a minor role at the Cape Playhouse in Dennis, Massachusetts. A friend took him to Falmouth, MA where he joined and quickly became a valued member of the University Players, an intercollegiate summer stock company. There he worked with Margaret Sullavan, his future wife. James Stewart joined the Players a few months after Fonda left, though they were soon to become lifelong friends. Fonda left the Players at the end of their 1931-1932 season after appearing in his first professional role in The Jest, by Sem Benelli. Joshua Logan, a young sophomore at Princeton who had been double-cast in the show, gave Fonda the part of Tornaquinci, \\"an elderly Italian man with a long white beard and even longer hair.\\" Also in the cast of The Jest with Fonda and Logan were Bretaigne Windust, Kent Smith, and Eleanor Phelps.  The tall (6 ft, 1.5 in) Fonda headed for New York City, to be with his then wife, Margaret Sullavan. The marriage was brief, but when James Stewart came to New York his luck changed. Getting contact information from Joshua Logan, Jimmy, as he was called, found Hank Fonda and these small town boys found they had a lot in common, as long as they didn't discuss politics. The two men became roommates and honed their skills on Broadway. Fonda appeared in theatrical productions from 1926 to 1934. They fared no better than many Americans in and out of work during the Great Depression, sometimes lacking enough money to take the subway.

He was really good at running with the ball and dodging all the other players who were trying to catch him. Everyone loved to watch him play because he was so exciting and talented! But one day, during an important game, something sad happened. While Adrian was running super fast with the ball, another player tried to stop him. In this big, fast chase, Adrian's ankle got hurt. An ankle is a part of your leg that connects your foot to your leg, and it's really important for running and walking. Adrian's ankle hurt really, really bad, so he couldn't play in the game anymore. His team's helpers needed to bring a special cart to help him leave the field. A cart is like a small car for people who are hurt or can't walk well and need help to move around. Everyone in the stadium felt sad and worried about Adrian because they wanted him to play and to be okay. After the game, the doctors and team helpers checked on Adrian's ankle to see what was wrong and how to help him feel better. They will take extra good care of him and make sure he gets lots of rest and treatment so his ankle can heal quickly. If all goes well, Adrian will be back playing and running with the ball soon, making everyone excited to watch him again!

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who transcribed the music of an English composer?, using the article: In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in..., what would be the answer ?

By performing the same operation on both sides of the equation, we maintain the equality. -80*c + 762 - 762 = 122 - 762 This simplifies to: -80*c = -640 Step 2: Solve for c by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable c, which is -80. To isolate c, we will divide both sides of the equation by -80. By doing this, we cancel out the -80 on the left side of the equation and isolate c. (-80*c) / (-80) = (-640) / (-80) This simplifies to: c = 8 The solution to the equation -80*c + 762 = 122 is c = 8."},{"instruction":"Question: Read the passage below and choose the right answer to the following question (choices are increases it or decreases it ):  The full box is harder to move because it has greater mass and therefore greater inertia.

Solve this math problem Solve -5*n = -132 + 167 for n.","output":"To solve for n, we will perform the following steps: Step 1: Simplify the right side of the equation The equation is -5*n = -132 + 167. To simplify, we add together the numbers on the right side: -132 + 167 = 35 So, our equation now becomes -5*n = 35. Step 2: Solve for n Now, we can solve for n by dividing both sides of the equation by -5. The mathematical reason for this is that it is the inverse operation of multiplication. Doing this will isolate the variable n to one side of the equation, which allows us to determine its value. Our equation becomes: -5*n / -5 = 35 / -5 Both -5's on the left side will cancel out, so n = 35 / -5. This further simplifies to n = -7.  Hence, the solution to the equation -5*n = -132 + 167 is n = -7."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

This weekend I am engaged in extensive sessions with members of my National Security Council, as we plan a comprehensive assault on terrorism. This will be a different kind of conflict against a different kind of enemy. This is a conflict without battlefields or beachheads, a conflict with opponents who believe they are invisible. Yet, they are mistaken. They will be exposed, and they will discover what others in the past have learned:  Those who make war against the United States have chosen their own destruction. Victory against terrorism will not take place in a single battle, but in a series of decisive actions against terrorist organizations and those who harbor and support them. We are planning a broad and sustained campaign to secure our country and eradicate the evil of terrorism. And we are determined to see this conflict through. Americans of every faith and background are committed to this goal. Yesterday I visited the site of the destruction in New York City and saw an amazing spirit of sacrifice and patriotism and defiance. I met with rescuers who have worked past exhaustion, who cheered for our country and the great cause we have entered. In Washington, D.C., the political parties and both Houses of Congress have shown a remarkable unity, and I'm deeply grateful. A terrorist attack designed to tear us apart has instead bound us together as a nation.

Context: Coming off their close win over the Colts, the Patriots flew to FedExField for an interconference duel with the Washington Redskins. The Patriots grabbed the early lead, when defensive tackle Vince Wilfork recovered a fumble off Redskins' quarterback Rex Grossman in the end zone for a touchdown. The Redskins responded with a 24-yard field goal by placekicker Graham Gano. The Patriots added to their lead, with quarterback Tom Brady throwing an 11-yard touchdown pass to tight end Rob Gronkowski. The Redskins countered, with Grossman throwing a 9-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jabar Gaffney, then grabbed the lead early in the second quarter, with wide receiver Brandon Banks throwing a 49-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Santana Moss. The Patriots tied the game with a 23-yard field goal by placekicker Stephen Gostkowski. The Redskins countered with a 25-yard field goal by Gano, and a 24-yard field goal by Gostskowski just before halftime tied the game at 20. The Patriots grabbed the lead early in the third quarter, with a 37-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Gronkowski, but the Redskins countered again, with Grossman throwing a 6-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver David Anderson. The final scoring play of the game came from the Patriots, with Brady connecting with wide receiver Wes Welker on a 24-yard touchdown. Both teams were held scoreless in the fourth quarter, which included linebacker Jerod Mayo intercepting Grossman at the Patriots' 5-yard line with 29 seconds remaining. Brady was intercepted in the Redskins endzone on a pass intended for Tiquan Underwood; Brady's sideline argument with Underwood led to a quick but spirited showdown with assistant coach Bill O'Brien that resulted in intervention by Bill Belichick - all of it caught by CBS Sports cameras.

Write some highlights for the following article: Rangers midfielder Lewis Macleod is determined to take all he can from his first experience in the full Scotland squad. The 20-year-old will spend the week training with Gordon Strachan's men ahead of their European Championship qualifier against the Republic of Ireland on Friday night and the friendly with England the following Tuesday. Macleod further enhanced his reputation with his eighth goal of the season on Saturday, heading home the second goal in a 4-0 Scottish Championship win over Falkirk after meeting Jon Daly's cross on the counter-attack. Rangers star Lewis MacLeod (centre) celebrates his goal during the 4-0 league win over Falkirk. He also set up the third for Kenny Miller with a low cross to the far post as Rangers remained four points behind leaders Hearts. His passing ability also helped Rangers put Falkirk on the back foot ahead of Nicky Law's 25th-minute opener, when the former Motherwell man forced the ball home after the visitors struggled to clear a corner. Macleod had sent Miller away to set up a break by drilling a 60-yard pass just inside the left touchline, and then arrived in the attack to thread a defence-splitting ball to the veteran forward, who saw his shot turned wide. Macleod poses with the Saltire after being called up for Scotland to face Republic of Ireland and England. Macleod has already featured for Scotland at Under 21 level as he takes on the Slovakia defence in September. It is such creativity that has earned him a place in the Scotland squad as Strachan continues to involve the country's promising young players. Hull left-back Andy Robertson utilised his chance to force his way into Strachan's regular plans, and although Macleod has a tougher position to break into, he aims to make sure he gives himself every chance. 'I don't expect to play but it will be a great experience training and you couldn't get two bigger games to be involved in,' Macleod said. 'If I get any game time at all I'll be more than happy. 'It's a massive step. It was a big step playing with the 21s and it will be hard but I'm looking forward to it. It can only benefit me.' The 20-year-old is a fast rising star and has been named October's SPFL young player of the month, thanks to performances such as at Livingston when he opened the scoring with an acrobatic effort. The likes of Miller and Kris Boyd have given Macleod some advice ahead of his first involvement. 'They have just told me to take it all in and enjoy every minute of it because, you never know, it could be your last time but hopefully it will be the first of many times,' said the midfielder. Macleod secured another accolade this weekend after helping Rangers win their eighth consecutive game when he was named SPFL young player of the month. 'It's been a great month and the team has played a lot better,' he said. 'The call-up came as a big surprise and I'm delighted with the award too.' Highlights:","output":"1.

That was probably one of the biggest surprises: For a Doctor who is darker than the ones we're used to recently (he certainly doesn't have the wackiness of Matt Smith), there was a great deal of humor in the episode. When we saw his final costume toward the end of the episode, we've gotta say, the Twelfth Doctor is looking sharp. 2. Clara back how we remember her. When Clara first officially met the Doctor, she was in Victorian dress. Having ended up in the 19th century, she was dressed for the times once more. Whether it was a callback or not, the producers seemed to know that the look really suits Jenna Coleman (In fact, a lot of the memorable parts of this episode seemed to do with the clothes - see Madame Vastra and Jenny's battle gear as well). With a few episodes under her belt, Clara is the \\"veteran\\" of the show, and much of it revolved around her, especially with the Doctor being in a confused state for much of it. She had some trouble getting used to this new Doctor, having fallen for the last one (see below), but she had instant chemistry with the Twelfth. 3. The icky new villain. A restaurant where you're on the menu? The half-visaged android the Doctor met could give Hannibal Lecter a run for his money. Their face-off (sorry) toward the end was one of the most memorable confrontations in recent \\"Doctor Who\\" history as well. 4. A dinosaur in the Thames?! Not much to say here, except that tyrannosaurus rex was quite a way to kick off the season. 5. The Eleventh Doctor makes a call. The biggest surprise of them all was the Eleventh Doctor's time-shifted call to Clara at the end of the episode, asking her to take care of the new him. (Though he wasn't a big fan of looking old.) We'll miss you, Matt Smith! What were your favorite parts of the episode? Highlights:","output":"1. Peter Capaldi's debut as the Twelfth Doctor: Capaldi's performance showcased a darker Doctor, yet still maintained humor throughout the episode. His new look, along with clever lines, brings a fresh perspective to the iconic character. 2. Clara's return in Victorian attire: Jenna Coleman's character, Clara, is shown in 19th century clothing once again, a nod to her first meeting with the Doctor. The storyline heavily revolves around her as she struggles to adapt to the new Doctor, but their chemistry is evident. 3. The chilling new villain: The half-faced android brings a sinister edge, creating one of the most memorable confrontations in \\"Doctor Who\\" history. The restaurant-themed premise adds a creepy touch. 4. A dinosaur in the Thames: The season premiere kicks off with an unexpected twist - a tyrannosaurus rex being swallowed by a dinosaur, transporting them to 19th century London. This scene captures the vivid imagination and excitement of the show. 5. The Eleventh Doctor's cameo: Matt Smith's surprise call to Clara at the end of the episode tugged at the heartstrings of fans, as he asks her to take care of his new incarnation. It was a touching tribute to his time on the show and a passing of the torch to Capaldi."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They quickly exchanged hellos before moving on with their shopping.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which boy will less likely struggle to see the chalkboard when they start school?  Hint: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.

Choices: (1). yes (2). it is not possible to tell (3). no And the answer is:","output":"(2). it is not possible to tell The premise provided, \\"Individual Development Accounts for Low-Income Savers,\\" does not directly imply that low-income earners often spend the money as soon as they get it. Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) are savings accounts designed to help low-income individuals save for specific goals, such as education, homeownership, or starting a business. While the premise introduces a financial tool for low-income earners to help them save, it does not provide information about their spending habits. The hypothesis that low-income earners often spend the money as soon as they get it is not clearly entailed by the premise. The premise is focused on providing an opportunity for low-income savers to improve their financial situation, rather than addressing their spending habits. It is true that some low-income earners might struggle to save money and therefore spend it as soon as they get it, but this claim is not directly supported by the given premise. Furthermore, the presence of IDAs in the premise suggests that there is an effort to help low-income earners save and manage their money more effectively. However, this does not inherently mean they spend their money immediately upon receipt. Hence, it is not possible to tell if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, as the premise talks about a financial instrument for low-income earners to save, but does not address their spending patterns."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: As time passes, the number of HIV copies keeps increasing, while the number of helper T cells keeps decreasing. The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS. There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one.  Now, I have a new situation: Robert and Justin are both patients in the hospital who are suffering complications from their HIV infections. The doctor is trying to get information from both men about their diseases so he can create customized treatment plans for both men. After a few questions, the doctor discovers that Robert has been infected with HIV for many years, while Justin's infection is quite recent.  Answer this question please: Who will develop infections less frequently? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information provided, Justin, who has a more recent HIV infection, will likely develop infections less frequently than Robert, who has been living with HIV for many years.  Let's delve into the scientific basis behind the situation. The progression of HIV affects the immune system over time, specifically the T cells. T cells play an instrumental role in the body's ability to ward off infections and diseases. They are a type of white blood cell that circulates around our bodies, scanning for cellular abnormalities and infections. In an HIV infection, the virus attaches itself to these T cells and uses them to replicate and spread, damaging and eventually killing them in the process. From the information given, we understand that as time passes, the number of HIV copies in the body increases, while the number of helper T cells – which play a crucial role in the immune response – decreases. This leads to a decrease in the immune system's ability to defend the body, resulting in the development of more and frequent infections, a state known as immunodeficiency.  So, if Robert has been infected with HIV for many years, his T cell count will likely be significantly lower than it was at the onset of his infection. This means that his immune system's ability to fend off infections is much more compromised than Justin's, who has a recent HIV infection. With a more robust T cell count, Justin's immune system is better equipped to combat infections. However, it's important to remember that the rate at which an HIV infection progresses can vary greatly from person to person. Some people may see a rapid decrease in T cells and a corresponding increase in infections soon after infection; for others, this process may take years. Justin's recent diagnosis does not guarantee immunity from regular infections, but statistically, he is likely to face lesser infections than Robert. Lastly, it's essential to keep in mind that medication adherence can significantly impact the course of HIV. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can suppress the virus to undetectable levels, slow disease progression, and prolong life. The likelihood of both Robert and Justin developing infections also will depend on how consistently they stick to their treatment plans, as well as the efficacy of the treatments themselves. Long-term HIV infection like Robert's can result in the virus developing resistance to certain medications, which can make managing the disease more challenging."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"Derry's head snapped up.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Derry looked up.\\"?","output":"If the premise \\"Derry's head snapped up\\" is true, it entails the hypothesis \\"Derry looked up\\" as a natural consequence since the action of someone's head snapping up implies that their gaze, and thus their line of sight, has changed direction and shifted upwards. Let's break down the relationship between the premise and hypothesis and the logical implications of this scenario. \\"Derry's head snapped up\\" indicates that there was a sudden or abrupt movement of Derry's head from a lower position to a higher one. This could be a reaction to a sound, an event, or any other stimulus requiring immediate attention. It can indicate that Derry was initially looking down or at a level below the horizon and then quickly redirected their gaze upwards. The hypothesis \\"Derry looked up\\" essentially refers to Derry's change in gaze direction to a higher position or a position above the horizon. Since the premise involves the action of Derry's head moving upwards, the hypothesis about Derry's gaze can be inferred because the movement of the head is directly related to the direction of sight in humans. Analyzing the premise and hypothesis in terms of logical consequences, we can establish the following inferences: Premise: Derry's head snapped up. 1. Derry's head moved from a lower to a higher position. 2. This movement was sudden and quick, reflecting urgency or surprise. Hypothesis: Derry looked up. 1. Derry's gaze moved from a lower position to a higher position. 2. Derry's line of sight shifted upwards, focusing on something above the initial line of sight. By examining these inferences, we can deduce that the premise entails the hypothesis. When Derry's head snapped up, it directly caused or influenced Derry's gaze to move from a lower position to a higher position. This upward shift in the head and gaze indicates but does not fully describe the specific object or event responsible for capturing Derry's attention, but it does make it clear that Derry looked up as a result. Therefore, if the premise \\"Derry's head snapped up\\" is true, it logically follows that the hypothesis \\"Derry looked up\\" is also true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This can be written as follows: 2086 - 182 = 136*c + 182 - 182 This gives us: 1904 = 136*c. Our equation is now simplified to represent 'c' in terms of other constants. Step 3: Now, the final step is to solve for 'c'. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by 136: 1904 / 136 = 136*c / 136 This simplifies to:  c = 14 So, the solution to the original equation is c = 14."},{"instruction":"Question: why was kitty claiming that she sold them?

He frequently performed with the slogan \\"This machine kills fascists\\" displayed on his guitar. His best-known song is \\"This Land Is Your Land\\". Many of his recorded songs are archived in the Library of Congress. Songwriters such as Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs, Johnny Cash, Bruce Springsteen, Robert Hunter, Harry Chapin, John Mellencamp, Pete Seeger, Andy Irvine, Joe Strummer, Billy Bragg, Jerry Garcia, Jay Farrar, Bob Weir, Jeff Tweedy, Bob Childers, Sammy Walker and Tom Paxton have acknowledged Guthrie as a major influence.  - Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen (born September 23, 1949) is an American singer-songwriter. He is best known for his work with the E Street Band. Nicknamed \\"The Boss\\", Springsteen is widely known for his brand of poetic lyrics, Americana, working class and sometimes political sentiments centered on his native New Jersey, his distinctive voice, and his lengthy and energetic stage performanceswith concerts from the 1970s to the present decade running at up to four hours in length.  - Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman, May 24, 1941) is an American songwriter, singer, artist, and writer. He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when his songs chronicled social unrest. Early songs such as \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" and \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\" became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six-minute single \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", recorded in 1965, enlarged the range of popular music.  - Smartie Mine ( 1999 ) is Iowa native singer / songwriter Dan Bern 's follow - up to Fifty Eggs .  - Philip David \\"Phil\\" Ochs (December 19, 1940  April 9, 1976) was an American protest singer (or, as he preferred, a topical singer) and songwriter who was known for his sharp wit, sardonic humor, earnest humanism, political activism, insightful and alliterative lyrics, and distinctive voice. He wrote hundreds of songs in the 1960s and 1970s and released eight albums.  - Dan Bern (also known as Bernstein; born July 27, 1965) is an American guitarist, singer, songwriter, novelist and painter. His music is often compared to that of Bob Dylan, Woody Guthrie, Bruce Springsteen, Phil Ochs and Elvis Costello.  - Declan Patrick MacManus (born 25 August 1954), better known by his stage name Elvis Costello, is an English musician, singer-songwriter, and record producer. He began his career as part of London's pub rock scene in the early 1970s and later became associated with the first wave of the British punk and new wave movement that emerged in the mid-to-late 1970s. His critically acclaimed debut album, \\"My Aim Is True\\", was released in 1977. Shortly after recording it, he formed the Attractions as his backing band. His second album, \\"This Year's Model\\", was released in 1978, and was ranked number 11 by \\"Rolling Stone\\" on its list of the best albums from 19671987.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.  Now, I have a new situation: Two mycologists studied about mushrooms. Bert studied mycorrhizal fungi, while Vince studied saprophytic mushrooms.  Answer this question please: Which person studied a bit less about mineral nutrient absorption from the soil? Answer:","output":"Vince studied a bit less about mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. This is because he focused on saprophytic mushrooms, which obtain their nutrients by breaking down dead organic matter, rather than forming mutualistic relationships with plant roots like mycorrhizal fungi.

Unreal landscape: This term reflects that the scenery being described is fictional or has an otherworldly, dreamlike quality. The landscape is not representative of the typical, real-world environment. 2. Lone tree silhouette: The \\"lone tree silhouette\\" is a distinct visual element in this scene.

Its silhouette suggests that the tree's detailing is not the main focus here, but instead, the tree is providing a contrast to the surrounding elements. 3. Planet: The mention of \\"planet\\" adds a celestial aspect to the landscape, hinting that the scene might be from a viewpoint in outer space, or may be showcasing a unique planetary body that is not usually visible in typical landscapes. It signifies the presence of celestial objects within the scene. 4. Galaxy: Adding to the celestial theme, the \\"galaxy\\" keyword suggests that an entire galactic system, with countless stars and planets, can be seen within the vivid sky. This creates an even more awe-inspiring and fantastical setting. 5. Visible: This keyword indicates that the celestial objects, such as the planet and the galaxy, are clearly observable within the scene. It highlights that these celestial bodies are not obscured, but rather easy to see and distinguish. 6. Vivid orange sky: The adjective \\"vivid\\" paired with \\"orange sky\\" refers to the strikingly bright and intense color of the sky in this landscape.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Some scientists say that animals in the ocean are increasingly threatened  by noise pollution caused by human beings. The noise that affects sea animals comes from a number of human activities. Such noises are added to natural sounds. These sounds include the breaking of ice fields, underwater earthquakes, and sounds made by animals themselves. Decibels  measured in water are different from those measured on land. A noise of one hundred and twenty decibels on land caused pain to human ears. In water, a decibel level of one hundred and ninety-five would have the same effect. Some scientists have planned to set a noise limit of one hundred and twenty decibels in oceans. They have found that noises at that level can frighten and confuse  whales. A team of American and Canadian scientists discovered that loud noises can seriously hurt some animals. The research team found that powerful underwater explosions were causing whales in the area to lose their hearing. This seriously affected the whales' ability to exchange information and find their way. Some of the whales even died. The explosions had caused their ears to bleed and become infected. Many researchers whose work depends on ocean sounds disagree to a limit of one hundred and twenty decibels. They say such a limit would mean an end to important industrial and scientific research. Scientists do not know how much and what kinds of noises are harmful to ocean animals. However, many scientists suspect  that noise is a greater danger than they believed. They want to stop noises from harming creatures in the ocean.

Hume argued that it requires inductive reasoning to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument. Among Hume's conclusions regarding the problem of induction is that there is no certainty that the future will resemble the past.

Movie title: Freeheld Movie plot: The film opens at a meeting of the Board of Chosen Freeholders of Ocean County, New Jersey in 2005. Ocean County resident and New Jersey police officer Lieutenant Laurel Hester, a 23-year veteran of the police force, has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and expected to live only one year, she wishes to pass on her pension to her domestic partner of five years, Stacie Andree. Although New Jersey counties have the option to extend pension benefits to domestic partners, Ocean County Freeholders will not do this. In protest, the state's LGBT civil rights organization, Garden State Equality, organizes hundreds of people to speak out at each of the Freeholders' meetings. The crowds Garden State Equality organizes get bigger and more vociferous at each meeting.Among those speaking out are Laurel's police colleagues and Ocean County residents, describing Laurel's 25 years of exemplary work for the police department, and petitioning the Freeholders to allow her to pass on her pension to Stacie. Laurel's first police partner, Dane Wells, speaks about her and compares the situation to separate drinking fountains and seats at the back of the bus. Freeholder Joseph Vicari says that although they are \\"anguished\\" by Laurel's case, they are unable to change things because of state legislature and moves for an adjournment. The members of the public present are unhappy with this decision and some begin to chant \\"It's in your power\\".Outside the administration building, news reporter Ida Siegal explains the background to the case.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. This week could turn out to be pivotal for the Trump White House as both major parties get ready for midterm congressional elections in November. President Donald Trump’s decision to reverse a policy of separating families coming across the U.S. southern border came in the wake of a political firestorm that fired up opposition Democrats and alarmed even some Republicans. At the very least, it likely set the stage for immigration to be a key issue in November. Trump was in combat mode Wednesday during a political rally in Duluth, Minnesota, where he vowed to make immigration a central focus in the upcoming congressional campaign. “If you want to create a humane, lawful system of immigration then you need to retire the Democrats and elect Republicans to finally secure our borders,” Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd, some chanting, “Build the wall!” Just hours earlier, the president reversed his controversial policy of separating children from their parents by signing an executive order in the White House. “We are going to have strong, very strong, borders. But we are going to keep the families together,” he said. Trump decided to back away from the controversial policy of separating families after an outcry from around the country that included protests in several states, including Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Also driving the outrage was a recording of children crying out for their parents released by the investigative journalist group ProPublica. The separation policy drew condemnation from Republicans including former first lady Laura Bush and a host of Democrats. “We should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view,” said Maryland Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings. “What country is that? This is the United States of America!” Advocates for a tough border policy sided with the president including Art Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies. He cited a recent upsurge in attempted border crossings. Where is Elijah Cummings a Congressman from? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. Texas  B. Pennsylvania  C. Maryland  D. not enough information Answer:","output":"C. Maryland"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Options:  A. guide foreigners  B. introduced  C. foreigner  D. established  E. immigrant The answer to this question is:","output":"B. introduced To answer this question in line with common sense, we must first understand the context and the possible implication of each option. The question sets up a scenario in which Sam assumes that James is a native based on the actions of Lane.  Let's analyze each option: A. guide foreigners - This option suggests that Lane is helping James like a guide assisting foreigners. This information would more likely lead Sam to assume that James is a foreigner and not a native. So, this option doesn't make sense. B. introduced - If Lane introduced James to Sam, it's possible that Sam could infer from their interaction that James was a native. The manner in which Lane introduced James might have indicated familiarity, which might lead Sam to assume that James is a native. As this option can lead Sam to assume James being a native, it is a plausible answer. C. foreigner - This option refers to a person from another country, and if Lane did something in relation to James being a foreigner, it would not lead Sam to think that James is a native. Therefore, it is not logical and in line with common sense. D. established - This word alone doesn't provide a clear context to understand Lane's actions towards James. We do not know if Lane established a business or relationship with James, but either way, it doesn't offer enough information for Sam to assume James is a native. Thus, this option doesn't make sense as an answer. E. immigrant - This option refers to an individual who has moved to another place to live permanently. If Lane did something involving James as an immigrant, it would make Sam think that James is not a native. So, this option doesn't fit as an answer. In conclusion, option B, which refers to Lane introducing James, is the most logical and sensible answer for the question. The way Lane introduced James might have provided enough context for Sam to assume that James is a native."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Throughout the season, they finished with a 10-6 record under the guidance of head coach Adam Gase. Led by quarterback Ryan Tannehill, the Dolphins secured a Wild Card playoff spot. In the Wild Card round of the playoffs which took place on January 8, 2017, the Dolphins faced the Pittsburgh Steelers at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Unfortunately for the Dolphins, they were defeated decisively by the Steelers with a final score of 30-12. Pittsburgh's defense was a significant factor in this game, managing to hold the Dolphins offense in check. Jay Ajayi, Miami's running back who had a breakout season that year, was limited to only 33 rushing yards. Since that playoff appearance in 2016, the Dolphins have gone through numerous changes such as coaching staff overhaul, roster modifications, and of course, the entry of a new franchise quarterback, Tua Tagovailoa, who was drafted in 2020. Miami's football fans continue to hope for a return to the playoffs and a potential run towards the Super Bowl, but their last taste of playoff football remains that 2016 season and the Wild Card game on January 8, 2017."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Determine the meaning and sentiment of both components: \\"Lavish\\" generally refers to something being luxurious, opulent, or extravagant. It is often used to describe a positive aspect of something, like a movie's production values, set designs, or costumes. 3. Determine the overall sentiment of the sentence: As \\"lavish\\" is a positive adjective, the sentiment of the sentence can be considered positive. However, it's important to note that the context in which this word appears can affect its sentiment. For example, if used in a sentence like, \\"The movie's lavish set designs could not make up for its poor plot,\\" the sentiment could be mixed or negative.

Detailed Instructions: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

(November 2015) In New York City in the fall of 1937, 17-year-old high-school student Richard Samuels meets Orson Welles, who unexpectedly offers him the role of Lucius in Caesar, the first production of his new Mercury Theatre repertory company. The company is immersed in rehearsals at its Broadway theater. Charmed by Welles, Richard infers that he is having an affair with the leading actress while his wife is pregnant. Richard finds ambitious production assistant Sonja Jones is attracted to him. Welles tells Richard a few days before the premiere that he is worried, because he has recently had nothing but good luck; he fears that he will finally have bad luck with the premiere, and that the play will be a flop. During rehearsals Richard accidentally sets off the sprinkler system, soaking the entire theatre. When accused by Welles he denies having anything to do with the deluge, and suggests that the catastrophe was the bad luck that Welles needed to get out of the way. Welles decides the entire production crew would benefit from a coupling game, and Richard cheats to ensure he is paired with Sonja. Richard spends the night with Sonja, but becomes jealous when she spends the next night with Welles. He confronts Welles, mentions his pregnant wife, and is fired. An apparent reconciliation follows, and Richard performs on the first night. The anti-fascist adaptation of Caesar is a huge success, but after the premiere, Richard is told that Welles only needed him in order to secure a successful first-night production and, that done, he has again been fired. The broken-hearted but wiser Richard spontaneously recites lines from Julius Caesar in his high school English class, to his classmates' applause. He later meets up with a likely new girlfriend, Gretta Adler, a young aspiring playwright whom he met in a music store at the film's beginning. With Richard's and Sonja's assistance, Adler manages to get a story published in The New Yorker, and she invites Richard out, to...

Poor relationship between parents and their children are very common. Whether we like it or not, our parents are responsible for us at least until we're out of high school. So rather than get upset about that fact, maybe we should focus on some ways to make our relationship better. The best way, in my opinion, is to learn to really communicate with my parents. When I find myself arguing with my mom and dad, I try to stop. If I can manage to stop myself from talking, I usually find that I can calm down quickly. I guess I'm usually acting out of emotion rather than logic . But if I can stop arguing for a minute, it seems that my opinion changes and I start to realize that I'm a bit childish. Emotionally I may still be upset, but logically I understand that yelling  and fighting surely won't make things better. Once I've stopped arguing, I look at my parents in the eye. You'd be amazed at how much easier it is to communicate with your parents when you've actually looking at them. Looking away doesn't do much of anything except for giving them the impression that I'm not listening or that I don't care. It's much easier to see things eye to eye when you're physically seeing them eye to eye. Finally, I listen to what they're saying (or at least I try). Communication can't happen unless both sides hear and listen to each other. There is nothing wrong with my hearing, but that doesn't mean I always listen to the sounds that people are making. When I argue with my parents, I can physically hear what they're saying without mentally listening to it. Whether I admit it or not, my parents' experience can actually help them give me some pretty sound advice at times. I don't always agree with them, but I think it's safe to say that it has truly helped our relationship in the long run. Parents and children can communicate only when  _  .

Context: The McNabb-less Eagles travelled to Indiana to take on the 9-1 Indianapolis Colts. Any chances of victory would be reliant upon a strong defensive showing, but the Colts stormed ahead behind three rushing touchdowns by rookie Joseph Addai in the first two quarters.  Philadelphia's new starting quarterback, Jeff Garcia, found L.J. Smith for a 1-yard touchdown to make it 21-7 in the second quarter. Adam Vinatieri booted a 44-yard kick before the end of the half for Indianapolis. Peyton Manning tossed an 11-yard touchdown pass to Reggie Wayne making it 31-7 Colts in the third quarter. The Eagles showed signs of life with touchdowns by Reggie Brown and Brian Westbrook to climb within ten with about ten minutes to play.  However, Addai scored his fourth touchdown of the game and a Garcia fumble led to a defensive touchdown for the Colts, making it 45-21 - a score representative of how overmatched the Eagles appeared all night. The Colts rushed for 237 yards on the Eagles' beleaguered defense. Westbrook had his third consecutive 100-yard game - the first Eagle to do that since Wilbert Montgomery 25 years ago. The loss drops the Eagles to under .500 for the first time all year. Question: Which team was playing with home field advantage?

Jon Withers and his wife June have began protesting against the group, creating a Facebook page for other residents to openly voice their concerns. Article:","output":"Title: Aveo Retirement Village Gripped in Controversy: Allegations of Abuse, Harassment, and Illicit Alcohol Sales The otherwise serene and peaceful atmosphere of the Aveo Retirement Village has recently been mired with a series of accusatory headlines as residents claim abuse, harassment, and bullying from an allegedly influential clique composed of body corporate and community members. The situation has escalated to the point where a still, an apparatus generally used for distilling alcoholic beverages, has been discovered in operation within the village's premises. What's more, it has emerged that several senior citizens have been involved in illegally selling bottles of alcohol to other residents at a staggering low price of 10. Leading the charge against the accused group is Jon Withers and his wife June, who have taken it upon themselves to put an end to the unfolding drama within the village. The couple has initiated a Facebook page to provide a platform for other residents who have been affected by the clique’s actions to voice their concerns openly. They hope that this move will not only raise awareness about the issue but also serve as a starting point for initiating dialogue, and ultimately, address the problem at hand. Aveo Retirement Village, a haven for numerous individuals during their golden years, was originally designed to offer a supportive, empowering, and comfortable community for its residents. It has since been the cause of anxiety and distress, however, as individuals such as the Withers couple found themselves subjected to mistreatment by a powerful few. The illicit alcohol trade within the village has also raised serious legal and safety concerns, as its operation, distribution, and consumption are not only unauthorized but could potentially pose a hazard to the health of the elderly, who may be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of alcohol. The Facebook page created by the Withers has received an outpouring of support and condolence from people who have either experienced or witnessed similar incidents within their communities. In documenting and sharing their stories, the group aims to tackle the issue constructively by raising awareness and garnering attention from both the management of Aveo Retirement Village and the wider public. It is their hope that this exposure will prompt the necessary actions to be taken to put an end to the suffering and injustice that has plagued the village. The situation in Aveo Retirement Village serves as a wake-up call to other similar establishments and community organizations that aim to provide a secure, nurturing, and comfortable living space for the elderly. It sheds light on the importance of vigilance and communication in ensuring that all members of these communities are treated with respect and dignity, and that their rights are upheld. Moreover, it serves as a reminder that even in spaces that are considered to be sanctuaries for the retired and elderly, there is always a possibility for the corruption of power and mistreatment when left unchecked. The unfolding events in Aveo Retirement Village have exposed the challenges that sometimes lurk beneath the surface of an otherwise idyllic community. By consistently monitoring the situation and holding authorities accountable, the residents and their well-wishers aim to restore a sense of justice, security, and collegiality within the village. However, only by addressing the root causes of this issue and introducing effective measures to prevent its spiraling recurrence will a true solution be found. As the story continues to develop, one can only hope that the best interests of Aveo's residents are prioritized and that they may soon be able to once again enjoy a peaceful retirement without fear or intimidation."},{"instruction":"Teacher:You are given a sentence in English.

With a specific focus on Andean and Páramo ecosystems, the garden highlights the diverse range of plant species that can be found across various altitudes, climates, and regions within Colombia. This emphasis on representing Colombia's unique biodiversity also serves as a testament to the extensive scale of the botanical garden, further supporting the notion that it is the largest among its counterparts. Founded in 1955 in honor of José Celestino Mutis, a distinguished botanist and astronomer, the garden carries on his legacy by promoting the study and appreciation of Colombia's natural wonders. In doing so, the garden not only enhances the understanding of the country's flora but also inspires future generations to conserve and protect these invaluable resources. In summary, based on the provided information, we can conclude that the statement is true: The José Celestino Mutis botanical garden is the largest of the five botanical gardens in Colombia. Its status as Colombia's biggest botanical garden, along with its dedication to showcasing a diverse range of plant species from every Colombian altitude, climate, and region, further underscores its most extensive scale. The garden's recreational and research-oriented activities also reinforce its position as a significant site of importance within the country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Mathematics (from Greek  \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.  - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.  - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.  - William Craig ( November 13 , 1918 -- January 13 , 2016 ) was an American academic and philosopher , who taught at the University of California , Berkeley , in Berkeley , California . His research interests included mathematical logic , and the philosophy of science , and he is best known for the Craig interpolation theorem .  - Theoretical computer science, or TCS, is a division or subset of general computer science and mathematics that focuses on more abstract or mathematical aspects of computing and includes the theory of computation.  - Nevada (Spanish for \\"snowy\\"; see pronunciations) is a state in the Western, Mountain West, and Southwestern regions of the United States of America. Nevada is the 7th most extensive, the 34th most populous, and the 9th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las VegasParadise metropolitan area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the \\"Silver State\\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \\"Battle Born State\\", because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words \\"Battle Born\\" also appear on the state flag); as the \\"Sage-brush State\\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \\"Sage-hen State\\". Nevada borders Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast and Utah to the east.  - First-order logic  also known as first-order predicate calculus and predicate logic  is a collection of formal systems used in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science. First-order logic uses quantified variables over non-logical objects and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as \\"Socrates is a man\\" one can have expressions in the form \\"there exists X such that X is Socrates and X is a man\\" where \\"there exists\\" is a quantifier and \\"X\\" is a variable. This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers.  - Logic in computer science covers the overlap between the field of logic and that of computer science. The topic can essentially be divided into three main areas:  - In mathematical logic, Craig's interpolation theorem is a result about the relationship between different logical theories. Roughly stated, the theorem says that if a formula  implies a formula , and the two have at least one atomic variable symbol in common, then there is a third formula , called an interpolant, such that every nonlogical symbol in  occurs both in  and ,  implies , and  implies . The theorem was first proved for first-order logic by William Craig in 1957. Variants of the theorem hold for other logics, such as propositional logic. A stronger form of Craig's theorem for first-order logic was proved by Roger Lyndon in 1959; the overall result is sometimes called the CraigLyndon theorem.  - Philosophy of science is a branch of philosophy concerned with the foundations, methods, and implications of science. The central questions of this study concern what qualifies as science, the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose of science. This discipline overlaps with metaphysics, ontology, and epistemology, for example, when it explores the relationship between science and truth.  - The University of California (UC) is a public university system in the U.S. state of California. Under the California Master Plan for Higher Education, the University of California is a part of the state's three-system public higher education plan, which also include the California State University system and the California Community Colleges System.  - Metaphysics is a branch of philosophy investigating the fundamental nature of being and the world that encompasses it. Metaphysics attempts to answer two basic questions:  - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County. Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over .  - A public university is a university that is predominantly funded by public means through a national or subnational government, as opposed to private universities. Whether a national university is considered public varies from one country (or region) to another, largely depending on the specific education landscape.   - Set theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which informally are collections of objects. Although any type of object can be collected into a set, set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics. The language of set theory can be used in the definitions of nearly all mathematical objects.  - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?  - Mathematical logic is a subfield of mathematics exploring the applications of formal logic to mathematics. It bears close connections to metamathematics, the foundations of mathematics, and theoretical computer science. The unifying themes in mathematical logic include the study of the expressive power of formal systems and the deductive power of formal proof systems. Mathematical logic is often divided into the fields of set theory, model theory, recursion theory, and proof theory. These areas share basic results on logic, particularly first-order logic, and definability. In computer science (particularly in the ACM Classification) mathematical logic encompasses additional topics not detailed in this article; see Logic in computer science for those.  - A formal system or logical calculus is any well-defined system of abstract thought based on the model of mathematics. A formal system need not be mathematical as such; for example, Spinoza's \\"Ethics\\" imitates the form of Euclid's \\"Elements\\".. Spinoza employed Euclidiean elements such as \\"axioms\\" or \\"primitive truths\\", rules of inferences etc. so that a calculus can be build using these. For nature of such primitive truths, one can consult Tarski's \\"Concept of truth for a formalized language\\".   - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - In mathematics, model theory is the study of classes of mathematical structures (e.g. groups, fields, graphs, universes of set theory) from the perspective of mathematical logic. The objects of study are models of theories in a formal language. A set of sentences in a formal language is called a theory; a model of a theory is a structure (e.g. an interpretation) that satisfies the sentences of that theory.  - Foundations of mathematics is the study of the philosophical and logical and/or algorithmic basis of mathematics, or, in a broader sense, the mathematical investigation of what underlies the philosophical theories concerning the nature of mathematics. In this latter sense, the distinction between foundations of mathematics and philosophy of mathematics turns out to be quite vague. Foundations of mathematics can be conceived as the study of the basic mathematical concepts (number, geometrical figure, set, function, etc.) and how they form hierarchies of more complex structures and concepts, especially the fundamentally important structures that form the language of mathematics (formulas, theories and their models giving a meaning to formulas, definitions, proofs, algorithms, etc.) also called metamathematical concepts, with an eye to the philosophical aspects and the unity of mathematics. The search for foundations of mathematics is a central question of the philosophy of mathematics; the abstract nature of mathematical objects presents special philosophical challenges.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - Metamathematics is the study of mathematics itself using mathematical methods. This study produces metatheories, which are mathematical theories about other mathematical theories. Emphasis on metamathematics (and perhaps the creation of the term itself) owes itself to David Hilbert's attempt to secure the foundations of mathematics in the early part of the 20th Century. Metamathematics provides \\"a rigorous mathematical technique for investigating a great variety of foundation problems for mathematics and logic\\" (Kleene 1952, p. 59). An important feature of metamathematics is its emphasis on differentiating between reasoning from inside a system and from outside a system. An informal illustration of this is categorizing the proposition \\"2+2=4\\" as belonging to mathematics while categorizing the proposition \\"'2+2=4' is valid\\" as belonging to metamathematics.  - The University of California, Berkeley, (also referred to as Berkeley, UC Berkeley, and Cal) is a public research university located in Berkeley, California. Founded in 1868, Berkeley is the oldest of the ten research universities affiliated with the University of California system, and is often cited as the top public university in the United States and around the world.  - Ontology is the philosophical study of the nature of being, becoming, existence or reality as well as the basic categories of being and their relations. Traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as metaphysics, ontology often deals with questions concerning what entities exist or may be said to exist and how such entities may be grouped, related within a hierarchy, and subdivided according to similarities and differences. Although ontology as a philosophical enterprise is highly theoretical, it also has practical application in information science and technology, such as ontology engineering.  - Epistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with the theory of knowledge.  - Proof theory is a major branch of mathematical logic that represents proofs as formal mathematical objects, facilitating their analysis by mathematical techniques. Proofs are typically presented as inductively-defined data structures such as plain lists, boxed lists, or trees, which are constructed according to the axioms and rules of inference of the logical system. As such, proof theory is syntactic in nature, in contrast to model theory, which is semantic in nature.  - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Yahoo’s Asian Lifeline By JEFF SOMMERJAN. 18, 2014 Yahoo’s core business has been eroding. It’s lost ground in display advertising and in online search, and the Wall Street consensus is that its revenue declined last year. When Marissa Mayer, Yahoo’s chief executive, unceremoniously dumped Henrique de Castro, her top lieutenant, on Wednesday, it was an acknowledgment that she had so far failed to turn the company around. But no matter: Wall Street greeted the news of Mr. de Castro’s dismissal with a shrug. Regardless of what Ms. Mayer does, the stock market loves Yahoo. Its shares doubled in value last year, outstripping the performance of highflying rivals like Google, AOL and Facebook. How is this feat even remotely possible? Yahoo’s lofty valuation makes sense only if you put its American business aside, and think of the company as an investment in Asia. That’s the way Wall Street sees it. From this perspective, most of Yahoo’s value is found in Japan and, especially, in China, where it has a large stake in the Internet colossus Alibaba. As Yahoo’s chief executive, Marissa Mayer has acquired more than 20 companies and removed the chief operating officer in an attempt to rejuvenate the once-dominant Internet giant. “In the United States, they are doing the best they can, and I think Marissa Mayer is doing a fine job, but their core business is challenged, to be polite, and it will likely remain that way for some time,” said Victor Anthony, managing director for Internet media at Topeka Capital Markets. “For Yahoo, it’s all about Asia.” Yahoo’s 24 percent stake in Alibaba, which has been described as a combination of Amazon, eBay and PayPal, with a bit of Google thrown in, accounts for the bulk of the American company’s value, Mr. Anthony calculates. In the United States, Yahoo trades at about 40, and he says he believes that at that price, it still has plenty of room to run. “I think Yahoo’s worth 50 to 52 a share,” he said, “but that’s not because of its American operations.” In his estimation, Yahoo’s American core, damaged by sliding advertising revenue and diminished profit margins, is worth only 10 a share. On the other hand, its holdings of Alibaba, which is planning an initial public offering that has Wall Street drooling, are worth 30 a share, he said. While that figure is subject to debate, no one questions that it is sizable: Alibaba plays a gargantuan role in China’s Internet economy. This online retailer’s two main shopping sites handled roughly 160 billion in merchandise in 2012, more than eBay and Amazon combined. Analysts estimate that its eventual I.P.O. could value it at 130 billion to 190 billion. Yahoo’s stake in its Japanese counterpart, Yahoo Japan — which still beats Google in local search — is worth an additional 7 a share to the American company, Mr. Anthony said. The rest of the stock’s value comes from Yahoo share buybacks, which are financed in large part from income derived from the Asian properties, he said. While numbers vary somewhat, many people on Wall Street make remarkably similar estimates. In a research report last Oct. 16, for example, JPMorgan Chase noted some improvements in Yahoo’s Internet search metrics and in the revamping of categories like sports and weather on its website. Over all, the report said, “the core business remains challenged and we believe the focus for most will remain on the strength in its Asian assets.” In a similar vein, Brian Wieser, senior analyst at Pivotal Research in New York, said: “It’s sad but you can pretty much forget about Yahoo’s core. I’m afraid it has no future. The Asian holdings, though — that’s another story.” Like many other people who follow Yahoo closely, Mr. Wieser says Ms. Mayer appears to be doing a perfectly fine job. “She’s talented, but it’s just that she’s facing a secular decline in the company’s core advertising business,” he said. Mr. de Castro was supposed to bring new ad revenue to the company. But Mr. Wieser suggests that the failure to do so wasn’t surprising. “I don’t care who runs the company right now,” he said. “They’re not going to be able to reverse that easily.” Fundamentally, he said, Yahoo is suffering from an ailment that afflicts “legacy publishers” of all kinds, including much older ones like newspapers and magazines. Yahoo, the dominant site of bygone days when the words “web portal” were still fashionable, can no longer attract premium display advertising as easily as it could before the rise of Google and sites like Facebook. Mr. Wieser praised Ms. Mayer’s acquisitions of Internet properties like Tumblr, the blogging service, and her hiring of prominent online talent like Katie Couric, the television host, and David Pogue, former tech writer at The New York Times. “That may all be helpful,” Mr. Wieser said. “But it’s not moving the stock.” Mark May, a Citi Research analyst, said that while Ms. Mayer had made progress, much of Yahoo’s stock market strength resulted from prescient investments by Jerry Yang, a Yahoo co-founder who stepped down from his leadership positions at the company in 2012. He made Yahoo an early financier of both Yahoo Japan and Alibaba and fought off repeated efforts by the Chinese company to buy out Yahoo’s stake. “That’s much of the value of Yahoo now,” Mr. May said. Mr. Anthony of Topeka Capital Markets added: “Marissa Mayer is really extremely lucky. She inherited many problems, of course, but she’s still got those incredible Asian assets. And that’s keeping the stock strong today.” A version of this news analysis appears in print on January 19, 2014, on page BU1 of the New York edition with the headline: Yahoo’s Asian Lifeline. Order Reprints|Today's Paper|Subscribe What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text highlight that despite Yahoo’s weakening core business in the United States, the company has maintained a high stock value due to its substantial investments in Asia. With a 24% stake in Alibaba and a significant presence in Yahoo Japan, Wall Street perceives these Asian assets as key drivers of Yahoo's value, providing a lifeline amidst steady declines in its American advertising revenue and profit margins. The article suggests that even though Marissa Mayer, Yahoo’s CEO at the time, made progress in revitalizing the company, much of Yahoo’s strength on the stock market can be attributed to the foresight of co-founder Jerry Yang who invested in Yahoo Japan and Alibaba."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If the person knows you’re interested, and they’ve reciprocated their interest in you as well, you don’t have to say much to get them smiling.  Try, “Thinking of you.” If you’re feeling more direct, go with “Wish you were here.”  This is more forward, as it explicitly indicates your desire to be in someone’s company.  It also adds an element of intrigue if the recipient doesn’t know what you’re up to, so you’ll get their imagination whirring. Know that we’re all in this together. That includes whomever you’re texting.  Just relax and be yourself - be simple, be honest, be true. It’s always best to shoot for a smile, and even better if you can get your crush laughing. Be casual. Don’t overthink it. Remember, we’re talking about texting.  Be a cheeseball.  Quote something ridiculously melodramatic or throw a ridiculously cheesy pick up line out there.  There’s nothing like a bit of Shakespeare or Thoreau.  Emerson once declared, “Thou art to me a delicious torment.”  Steal lines like this (and credit them to the appropriate authors for added drama). There are some officially bad pick-up lines that will almost should never work, and that’s the point – which means they somehow work.  Making light of your affection for someone can be a great way to convey interest casually.  There are some classics, but you probably already have a go-to in mind. Don’t abbreviate everything.  It can be misleading, confusing, and may even seem a bit childish.  You can get away with “lol” – it’s practically a part of the English language – but don’t send acronyms or abbreviations your recipient might not familiar with it.  If you’re interested in them, the least you can do is thumb out complete words.  Relatedly, be aware that emoticons should not completely take the place of words.  Cap your emoji-use.  There is definitely, definitely such a thing as too many emoticons.  Personal preference is a legitimate argument here, but don’t forget to occasionally mention that you’re interested in having a genuine conversation if they would too.  Comedy is the only realm in which it is appropriate to overuse emoticons.  In particular, feel free to indulge in storytelling with emoticons.  If you can wind together a solid, ideally humorous narrative using only tiny 2D images, by all means, emoji-away. Even emoticons are getting raunchy these days. Hold off on the emoji innuendos until you have an appropriate relationship with someone who might appreciate your smiley face based sultriness. Summary:","output":"In order to attract someone through texting, show genuine interest, be direct, maintain a light-hearted tone, and limit abbreviation and emoji use, ultimately aiming for a smile or laughter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve this math problem Solve 0 = 46*d - 24 - 68 for d.","output":"Alright, let's make this fun and simple, just like a game with numbers! We have the equation: 0 = 46*d - 24 - 68 First, we need to combine the numbers -24 and -68. If you had 24 ice creams and you ate all of 'em (that's -24) and did the same thing with 68 ice creams (another -68), you'd be out 92 ice creams. So our equation now looks like this: 0 = 46*d - 92 Now let's work on getting 'd' (which is just a place for a number we don't know yet) by itself. We do this by adding 92 to both sides of the equation (it's like saying if I give you 92 more ice creams, we wouldn't be out of any ice cream!). So, it looks like this: 0 + 92 = 46 * d  or 92 = 46 * d Now we want to figure out what number 'd' is. To do that, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 46 (it's like splitting 92 ice creams equally between 46 friends and figuring out how many each friend gets). So when we divide 92 by 46, we get: d = 2 So, you see, 'd' is just a number and in this game with numbers, we figured out that 'd' is 2!

What are the differences between primary, secondary, and tertiary production? What is the difference between a primary, secondary and tertiary industry? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"The questions you asked are similar but have slight differences in focus. The first question emphasizes production while the second one targets industries. Let me address both aspects within my answer. Differences between primary, secondary, and tertiary production: 1. Primary production: Primary production refers to the extraction of natural resources directly from the environment. This includes activities such as agriculture, forestry, fishing, and mining. In this stage, the focus is on acquiring raw materials that can be further processed, transformed, or used as inputs for other products. Primary production is typically marked by a direct interaction with the natural environment, land, and resource exploitation. 2. Secondary production: Secondary production involves the manufacturing, processing, and refining of raw materials obtained from primary production. During this stage, raw materials are transformed into intermediate goods or finished products. Common examples of secondary production include the manufacturing of goods such as automobiles, textiles, furniture, and electronic devices. Factories, mills, and workshops are sites of secondary production, which generally involves more specialized skills and technology for processing raw materials. 3. Tertiary production: Tertiary production, also known as the service sector, is characterized by the provision of services rather than the production of tangible goods. This sector comprises a wide range of activities, such as retail, transportation, healthcare, education, hospitality, and financial services. Tertiary production is concerned with the distribution, support, and enhancement of primary and secondary production activities. It can include the development of new technologies, research, and development or even creative endeavors like arts and entertainment. Differences between primary, secondary, and tertiary industries: 1. Primary industries: Primary industries are industries involved in the extraction and collection of natural resources. As with primary production, these industries are primarily agriculture, forestry, fishing, and mining. As a result, primary industries generally deal with the direct collection of raw materials from the natural environment. These industries typically require large tracts of land and natural resources, as well as low-skilled labor. 2. Secondary industries: Secondary industries are involved in the processing, manufacturing, and construction of goods using raw materials acquired from primary industries. These industries are responsible for the production of intermediate and finished goods intended for consumption or use by other industries and end consumers. This sector is characterized by a higher concentration of technology and capital investment, which results in greater employment opportunities and contributes significantly to a country's GDP. 3. Tertiary industries: Tertiary industries, also known as the service sector, encompass all industries that provide services rather than tangible products. These industries are not directly involved in the extraction or production of raw materials but rather support economic processes by offering services like transport, marketing, distribution, and consultancy. The tertiary sector includes banking, insurance, education, healthcare, and hospitality services, among others. With the rise of the knowledge-based economy, this sector is steadily becoming more significant in terms of driving economic growth, generating employment, and promoting innovation. In conclusion, the two questions you asked have similar undertones, but the focus of the first question is on the production aspect (which deals with activities within each stage), while the second question emphasizes industries (which describes the sectors that participate in each stage). Both questions address the different stages in the movement of goods and services from extraction to consumption."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer this question: what is the meaning of the name gisela?","output":"The name Gisela (also spelled Giselle, Gisele, or Gisèle) is a female given name of Germanic origin, derived from the Old High German \\"gisil,\\" meaning \\"pledge\\" or \\"hostage.\\" It is an ancient name with significant historical roots and cultural significance. The name Gisela embodies the idea of someone who is committed to their relationships, friendships, and responsibilities. It is a name that suggests loyalty, dedication, and a strong sense of duty. In early Germanic societies, a pledge or hostage was an essential aspect of sealing treaties and agreements between tribes and kingdoms. Giving a hostage, often a child of a ruler or high-ranking noble, helped ensure both parties would abide by the agreed-upon terms. This practice also provided assurance for the recipient that the other party had a vested interest in maintaining the peace. Gisela as a name, therefore, symbolizes trust, devotion, and perseverance. Historically, several women named Gisela held significant roles within European history. Some noteworthy figures include: 1. Gisela of Swabia (990-1043) - She was an influential Holy Roman Empress and the wife of Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II. Gisela exerted considerable political influence during her husband's reign and is remembered for her intelligence and strong personality. 2. Gisela of Hungary (985-1065) - The daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Henry II and Cunigunde of Luxembourg, she became the wife of St. Stephen I, the first king of Hungary. As Queen Consort of Hungary, Gisela played a crucial role in the early Christianization of the region. 3. Gisela of Bavaria (984-1060) - The daughter of Duke Henry II of Bavaria and sister of Emperor Henry II, Gisela married King Stephen I of Hungary. Their strong alliance and rule played an essential role in the Christianization of Hungary and the formation of a stable Central European power. The name Gisela has also been popular in literature and the arts. One famous example is the ballet \\"Giselle,\\" with music by Adolphe Adam and choreography by Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot. The ballet premiered in France in the 19th century and tells the story of a delicate young girl named Giselle who falls in love with a nobleman disguised as a peasant. In contemporary times, the name Gisela, or its alternative spellings, has been popular among celebrities and public figures. One well-known example is Gisele Bündchen, a Brazilian supermodel who has enjoyed a highly successful career in the fashion industry. In summary, the name Gisela carries a rich history and deep cultural significance that symbolizes loyalty, dedication, and responsibility. Its historical roots and various adaptations keep the name popular and relevant in today's world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The mysterious disappearance of this individual has captured the interest of Egyptologists for quite some time. Despite the lack of concrete evidence pointing to a clear conspiracy, various hypotheses have come to the forefront in their attempt to piece together the puzzle of his fate. As researchers delve deeper into the history, intrigue, and culture that define the ancient Egyptians, they continue to decipher clues that could lead to the understanding of how and why this particular person vanished without a trace. Theories range from political intrigue to personal motives, and as more data emerges, scientists hope to put an end to the endless speculation. Among the various hypotheses that have been proposed, some of the most prevalent include: 1. Assassination: It is possible that the person was deliberately murdered as part of a power struggle or vendetta by opposing forces, wishing to remove him from power or gain political advantage. 2. Accidental death: Given the many dangers of the ancient world, it is equally plausible that the person died accidentally. Environmental hazards or simple accidents might have caused his untimely demise, leaving no clues about his disappearance. 3. Exile: Under certain circumstances, it is conceivable that the individual was exiled from his position due to political maneuverings, personal animosity, or as a consequence of his own behavior. It is not uncommon for powerful figures in such societies to face sudden and cruel twists of fate, as their fortunes and influence can rapidly alter. 4. Forced disappearance: Another possibility is that the person was forcibly removed from his position by those who sought to undermine his power or perceived him as a threat. This could involve kidnapping, imprisonment, or more nefarious designs that led to his disappearance from the public eye. 5. Voluntary disappearance: Lastly, it is always possible that the person chose to walk away from his life of prominence in search of peace, solitude, or spiritual enlightenment. There have been instances of individuals deserting their positions to embark on personal journeys away from the pressures and expectations of high society. As Egyptologists continue to scrutinize historical records, explore hidden tombs, and unearth ancient artifacts, they hope to uncover the definitive answers to such enigmatic cases. While the truth behind this disappearance may lie buried beneath the sands of time, the fascination with this historical mystery will continue to captivate scholars and laymen alike. Each breakthrough in our understanding of this ancient civilization brings us one step closer to unraveling this intricate puzzle and learning about the person who mysteriously vanished, leaving behind no tangible trace of his existence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When Jodi Gholson Oliver's 19-year-old told her that he was going to live as a transgender male, the Las Vegas mom took to Facebook to let her family and friends know how proud and accepting she was of her child. 'For about 18 1/2 years we thought he was a girl, who just happened to like bugs, tattoos, flames, skulls, snakes, lizards, etc, etc,' Mrs Gholson Oliver wrote on her Facebook wall March 27. Last September, Jesse Oliver, born 'Jessica' but known to everyone as 'Jes,' came to his parents and revealed that he's never felt like he was supposed to be a girl and always identified as a male. Proud mom: Jodi Gholson Oliver (left) wasted no time embracing her son Jes' (right) decision to live as a transgender male. Inspiring message: The Las Vegas mother of two wrote a smart and touching Facebook post letting her family and friends know that  her 19-year-old son is transgender. 'This is something that we have all seen over the years and I am so happy that he can finally feel like the person he was born to be!' Oliver's mother added. To drive the point home, the mother of two supplemented her post with a picture of a cartoon stork wearing an 'It's a Boy' cap. While the witty and heart-warming Facebook post was meant to simply keep Gholson Oliver’s family in the loop about a major development in her son's life, it quickly became much more than that, as Daily Dot first reported. The message has gone viral, drawing more than 150 ‘likes’ from loved ones and supportive strangers alike, who praised the Las Vegas hairdresser for embracing her child's life-altering decision. The mother, who has since joined the Gender Justice Nevada group, was surprised by the public’s reaction to her Facebook statement. ‘I had no idea this was going to affect so many people like it has,’ Gholson Oliver wrote in a follow-up post. ‘My hope is that in a short time this topic can just be small talk over coffee.’ Then and now: The Las Vegas teen was born Jessica Oliver (left) 19 years ago, but he has always known that his real gender was male. Transformation: Jes enjoys when people use male pronounces to address him, including his mother (right) and his girlfriend. Jes Oliver then shared his mother's message on his Tumblr page, adding, 'Heck yeah, mom,' at the bottom. The post quickly exploded online, and Oliver’s page has been overwhelmed with more than 150,000 comments from other Tumblr users. Over the past week-and-half, Oliver has been responding to questions from curious Internet users about what it means to be FtM transgender - female to male. Photos on Jes Oliver's Facebook and Tumblr account depict a masculine-looking teenager with piercing blue eyes, short dark hair and oval face with a cleft chin. He has an 18-year-old girlfriend, Hailey, who calls herself ‘Jesse’s girl’ on her social media account. Real identity: Jes Oliver got a new birth certificate late last year and has since begun going to gender therapy sessions. Although he was born with female reproductive organs, Jes Oliver has always known that it was the wrong gender for him. The 19-year-old also has a younger sister, Juliana. An old photo from their childhood, which Oliver shared online, shows the two sisters smiling into the camera, with Jes on the right rocking a black Harley-Davidson baseball cap turned backwards. In response to a question from a Tumblr user, the 19-year-old explained that when he was in the sixth grade in Missouri, where the family are originally from, he was pretending to be a boy on a drawing website and chatting with girls online. 'My mom found out and questioned it, but the conversation only went like “if you’re gay that’s okay me and dad still love you,”' Oliver wrote, adding that despite his parents’ positive attitude, he denied being gay 'to the end of time.' Then last September, the Las Vegas teen finally came out to his parents and friends as a transgender male. The family quickly set the wheels in motion, applying for an official name change. Last December, the former Jessica Oliver got a new birth certificate with the correct gender - male. The outspoken and inspiring young man, who describes himself as a ‘pretty decent dude,' has been blogging about the process of his transformation. Supportive: Miss Gholson Oliver has joined the Gender Justice Nevada group to raise awareness of transgender people like her son. A few months ago, Oliver began attending gender therapy sessions. The goal is for him to eventually obtain what is called a T letter - a letter of recommendation for hormone replacement therapy. One of the things he enjoys the most is when people use male pronounces when addressing him. Oliver was especially overjoyed when his mother took to referring to the teen as a ‘he.’ ‘The other day my mom told me she’s gonna start trying harder to use male pronouns and I’ve even heard her use ‘em when she’s around me,’ Jes Oliver gushed.  ‘Hot diggity dog, that’s cool.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Jodi Gholson Oliver, a Las Vegas mother, posted a heart-warming message on Facebook in support of her 19-year-old transgender son, Jes Oliver.

Now, the Daily Caller, which originally broke the story, says the Post's takedown is full of holes: The paper misidentified an escort at the heart of the case, the Caller holds. According to the Post report, an escort named Nexis de los Santos Santana attested in an affidavit that she was paid by a lawyer to appear in a video claiming she'd been paid by the New Jersey Democrat for sex. In the video, \\"those are my words and that is me, but it does not reflect the truth,\\" she said, per the affidavit.

Menendez's Alleged Involvement with Dominican Prostitutes Introduction: The ongoing allegations against Senator Robert Menendez have ignited a debate between the Washington Post and the Daily Caller, with both news organizations disputing each other's versions of events concerning Menendez's alleged involvement with Dominican prostitutes. Background: The Washington Post report published yesterday raised questions about how trustworthy the initial reports were that Sens. Robert Menendez was involved with Dominican prostitutes. The original story was broken by the Daily Caller, which now argues that the Post's take on the story contains inconsistencies and misidentifications. Claims from Washington Post: According to the Washington Post, an escort named Nexis de los Santos Santana claimed, in an affidavit, that she was paid by a lawyer to appear in a video wherein she says she was paid by the New Jersey Democrat for sex. However, she later stated in the affidavit that \\"those are my words and that is me, but it does not reflect the truth.\\" She said that she thought the video would be used as evidence in a divorce case. The lawyer involved also said he was misled about how the video would be used. Counterclaims from the Daily Caller: In response to the Post's story, the Daily Caller asserts that neither of the women who appeared in its video exposé were named Nexis de los Santos Santana. It also argues that there are other flaws in the Washington Post’s report. For example, it says the Post’s story indicates that de los Santos identified a prominent lawyer in her video confession, but according to the Daily Caller, no such name was spoken in the video interview. Washington Post Hits Back: In defense of its reporting, the Washington Post stands by its story and refutes the Daily Caller's claims that its reporter did not reach out before publication, as documented by Politico. The debate between the two news organizations continues with no clear resolution in sight. Conclusion: The veracity of the allegations against Sen. Menendez remains uncertain as the Washington Post and the Daily Caller dispute one another's claims. As the debate continues, it is unclear which news organization's version of events will ultimately be proven accurate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: The Ironton Railroad became part of which Class 1 Railroad Corporation? A:","output":"The Ironton Railroad became part of the Conrail Corporation, which was a Class 1 Railroad Corporation in the United States. To provide a detailed and historical context to this answer, let us first understand the journey of the Ironton Railroad, its connections with other railroads, and how it eventually became part of the Conrail Corporation. Founded in 1861, the Ironton Railroad was initially created to transport iron ore from the various iron mines near Ironton, Pennsylvania to the Lehigh Valley Railroad (LVRR) at Catasauqua. In its early years, the railroad primarily served as a short line railroad and was only 9.2 miles long. Nevertheless, the Ironton Railroad played a crucial role in supporting the local iron industry, which was a vital part of the economy in the region. Over the years, the business of the Ironton Railroad expanded as it connected to other important railroads and industries. Although the rail line was initially constructed to transport iron ore, it later began handling coal, cement, and even passengers. By the 20th century, due to industrial progress and the decline of the iron industry in the region, the railroad started to see a decrease in the transportation of iron and subsequently shifted its focus to other freight traffic. In 1902, the Ironton Railroad leased its line to the Lehigh Valley Railroad (LVRR), which significantly connected the railroads and contributed to the Ironton Railroad's extents and exposure to larger markets. The Lehigh Valley Railroad operated and expanded the Ironton line, and by this time, the cement industry had become a prominent source of revenue for the Ironton railroad, substituting its earlier focus on iron transportation. However, the existence of the Lehigh Valley Railroad itself was turbulent. The LVRR faced bankruptcy and financial difficulties during the mid-20th century. After a series of attempts to maintain the railroad, the LVRR was finally declared bankrupt in 1970, and its operations were eventually merged with other bankrupt northeastern railroads. This merging resulted in the creation of a new Class 1 Railroad Corporation, the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail), in 1976. Conrail was established by the United States government to salvage and reconsolidate the rail services in the northeastern region for better efficiency and cost-effectiveness. As a result, the Ironton Railroad, through its connections and lease agreement with the Lehigh Valley Railroad (LVRR), became a part of the Conrail Corporation. After becoming one of the Class 1 railroads under Conrail, the Ironton Railroad continued to operate as an essential line for freight traffic services, transporting cement and other essential commodities in the region. In conclusion, the Ironton Railroad, which initially started as an iron ore transportation service, got connected with other major railroads and evolved in terms of its services and extent. The integration of the Ironton Railroad with the Lehigh Valley Railroad (LVRR) was crucial in its growth, and as LVRR eventually became a part of the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) in 1976, the Ironton Railroad also joined the Conrail Corporation, thus becoming a part of a Class 1 Railroad Corporation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Form a seal around the drain then push & pull the plunger up and down, exiting and reinserting into the drain....I think the answer is","output":"I think the answer is 1). Form a seal around the drain then push & pull the plunger up and down without removing it. Reasoning: Using a plunger effectively requires creating a strong seal around the drain so that the pressure generated from pushing and pulling the plunger can dislodge any clogs within the drain. By forming a seal around the drain and maintaining it consistently while pushing and pulling the plunger, a sustained pressure is created that maximizes the chances of clearing the blockage. Removing and reinserting the plunger between each push and pull motion, as described in option 2, would weaken the seal and reduce the effectiveness of the plunging action."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The most precise timekeeping device of the ancient world was the water clock, or clepsydra, one of which was found in the tomb of Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep I (1525–1504 BC). They could be used to measure the hours even at night, but required manual upkeep to replenish the flow of water. The Ancient Greeks and the people from Chaldea (southeastern Mesopotamia) regularly maintained timekeeping records as an essential part of their astronomical observations. Arab inventors and engineers in particular made improvements on the use of water clocks up to the Middle Ages. In the 11th century, Chinese inventors and engineers invented the first mechanical clocks driven by an escapement mechanism. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Why did the Chinese maintain timekeeping records in the 11th century?","output":"The Chinese maintained timekeeping records in the 11th century for various reasons, some of which included: 1. Civil and bureaucratic purposes: Accurate timekeeping was essential for the efficient functioning of the Chinese imperial bureaucracy. This would ensure that officials could properly schedule and arrange their daily tasks, meetings, and other important administrative activities. 2. Astronomical and astrological observations: Like many ancient civilizations, the Chinese had a strong interest in studying celestial events. Timekeeping was critical for accurately observing and predicting astronomical phenomena, such as eclipses and the movement of stars and planets. 3. Agricultural planning: Having accurate timekeeping records helped to determine the best times for planting and harvesting crops based on seasonal changes. 4. Cultural and religious practices: Timekeeping played a crucial role in Chinese society for determining the appropriate times to conduct religious and cultural ceremonies, as many of these events were based on the lunar calendar. 5. Technological advancements: The invention of mechanical clocks in the 11th century by Chinese inventors was a groundbreaking innovation and demonstrated the value of accurate timekeeping. The development of these clocks allowed for a greater level of precision in measuring time compared to previous water clock technologies. In summary, the Chinese maintained timekeeping records in the 11th century for civil, bureaucratic, astronomical, agricultural, cultural, religious, and technological reasons."},{"instruction":"Question: Q: Mammalian lungs are located in what cavity, where they are surrounded and protected by the rib cage, intercostal muscles, and chest wall?

Wood senior had started in his family's pawnbroking business, but by the time of his son's birth he was trading as a jeweller, optician and engineering modeller, much sought-after for his model engines. It was a musical household: Wood senior was an amateur cellist and sang as principal tenor in the choir of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, known as \\"the musicians' church\\".   His wife played the piano and sang songs from her native Wales. They encouraged their son's interest in music, buying him a Broadwood piano, on which his mother gave him lessons. The young Wood also learned to play the violin and viola. Wood received little religious inspiration at St Sepulchre, but was deeply stirred by the playing of the resident organist, George Cooper, who allowed him into the organ loft and gave him his first lessons on the instrument. Cooper died when Wood was seven, and the boy took further lessons from Cooper's successor, Edwin M. Lott, for whom Wood had much less regard. At the age of ten, through the influence of one of his uncles, Wood made his first paid appearance as an organist at St Mary Aldermanbury, being paid half a crown.  In June 1883, visiting the Fisheries Exhibition at South Kensington with his father, Wood was invited to play the organ in one of the galleries, making a good enough impression to be engaged to give recitals at the exhibition building over the next three months.

They were studying the effects on aging on the human body.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which group had more people with Alzheimer’s disease?  Hint: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well.

Some nights, before two of her daughters went to bed, Tanya Saylor would give them headphones.      That would help block the noise — the music, the threats and the sex noises.      The sounds were coming from the other side of a wall the room shared with a neighboring row home in Red Lion. Sometimes they lasted until 3 a.m.      \\"It's pretty pathetic when you have to have a protocol due to your neighbor's actions,\\" Saylor said Monday.      Saylor, her terminally ill husband and her five children — all between the ages of 9 and 17 and one of whom has cancer — dealt with the noise for two years, she said.      And in April, the neighbor, 25-year-old Amanda Marie Warfel, pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and harassment charges for incidents that took place in February and March, according to charging documents.      Those charges were reduced to non-traffic citations, according to District Judge John H. Fishel's office. A charge of ethnic intimidation — originally filed against Warfel in connection with a Feb. 28 incident — was dropped.            An ongoing problem      Two of Saylor's daughters — a 15-year-old and a 17-year-old — share a room in their row home in the 100 block of West Gay Street. That room shares a wall with Warfel's room, she said.      When the noise first became an issue about two years ago, Saylor said she would knock on the door and ask Warfel to quiet down. It didn't help.      Warfel would call her daughters names and threaten them, she said. As she was having sex, she would describe the acts loudly enough for the girls to hear, she said.      WHAT'S IN A TOWN: Learn more about Red Lion borough.      On March 21, Warfel was \\"loudly fornicating and banging around her bedroom to the degree that the victims' dresser and her own bed shook,\\" documents state.      A family member knocked on the common wall, but Warfel yelled back and the noise became louder, documents state.      On Feb. 28 around 11:15 p.m., Warfel made \\"racist comments\\" and ignored requests to turn down her music, according to charging documents. One of Saylor's daughters, who was trying to sleep, again asked Warfel to turn the music down, and Warfel allegedly responded by using derogatory language. The daughter is black, documents state.      But it wasn't about the racial comments, Saylor said. Not really.      \\"We're not a family that gets easily offended,\\" she said.      It was about the impact the situation was having on her family.      \\"She harassed my kids for two years,\\" Saylor said. \\"We let it go for two years.... I shouldn't have let it go that long. I should have started calling the police a year ago.\\"      Warfel's loudness, she said, would keep her two daughters up so late that one would have trouble getting to school on time the next morning. On two occasions, state police wrote notes to the school to excuse her lateness, she said.      Her 17-year-old daughter, who has cancer, needed to be quarantined after getting treatment. She stayed in the room for 10 days in January because \\"she had to be isolated up there,\\" Saylor said.      During that time, Warfel had sex \\"nonstop, making sure that my daughter heard,\\" she said.      \\"I couldn't do anything,\\" Saylor said. \\"I couldn't be around her; nobody could.\\"      And the mother of five hardly ever saw Warfel, who stayed cooped up in the neighboring row home, she said. The first time she had seen her in a while was at the preliminary hearing in April.      What's next      As of Monday, Warfel remained in York County Prison, where she is set to be released June 20.      A hearing for a second case of disorderly conduct, which police say occurred March 21, still needs to be rescheduled, according to Fishel's office.      Contact Ted Czech at 717-771-2033.

Victim mentality not only limits one's growth, but it also creates a downward spiral of negative emotions, poor self-esteem, and unhappiness. This article aims to provide practical advice and steps to help you stop playing the role of victim and embrace positivity, self-love, and well-being in your life. 1. Stop Thinking Like a Victim Taking responsibility for your actions and thoughts is the first step to overcoming a victim mentality. Acknowledge that you are not helpless and do not need to be rescued by someone else. Understand that you have the power within you to change your situation and shape your destiny. Stop dwelling on blame or past failures and start focusing on what you can do to improve your current circumstances. 2. Kick Negative Self-Talk to the Curb Negative self-talk is one of the biggest culprits of victim mentality. Replacing these destructive thoughts with positive affirmations and empowering beliefs can drastically change your mindset. Practice mindfulness and be kind to yourself. When you catch yourself thinking negatively, stop and replace the thought with something more positive and encouraging. 3. Love Yourself and Others Self-love is often underrated but is crucial in building a positive self-image. Accept and embrace your imperfections, rather than constantly striving for perfection. Recognize your worth and believe in your abilities. Additionally, show love and empathy towards others. Practicing acts of kindness and forgiveness not only contributes to the well-being of others but can dramatically boost your self-esteem and happiness. 4. Engage in Activities You Love Regularly Pursuing activities, hobbies, and interests that bring you joy is a vital part of maintaining a positive outlook on life. Find what makes you truly happy and make time for it in your daily routine. Engaging in activities you love can help take your mind off of negative thoughts and create more opportunities for growth and fulfillment. 5. Make Use of Social Support Having a strong support network can significantly help in overcoming victim mentality. Connect with friends, family, or support groups who understand and encourage your journey towards positivity and self-love. Surround yourself with people who uplift your spirits and provide constructive advice when you need it. Remember that you are not alone; others have faced similar challenges and can empathize with your situation. 6. Nurture Your Body A healthy body is essential for a healthy mind. Prioritize physical self-care by exercising regularly, eating a balanced diet, and getting enough sleep. These practices not only improve your physical well-being but also impact your mental health, mood, and attitude. Make a conscious effort to listen to your body's needs and commit to a healthier lifestyle. 7. Practice Gratitude Gratitude has been proven to have a powerful impact on one's well-being. Make it a habit to express gratitude for the good things in your life, no matter how small or insignificant they may seem. Keep a gratitude journal, verbalize your thankfulness to others, or simply take a moment each day to reflect on the positive aspects of your life. Gratitude can help shift your focus away from negativity and amplify your appreciation for the world around you. 8. Turn to Your Spirituality Regardless of your religious or spiritual beliefs, embracing and nurturing your spiritual side can provide a strong foundation for overcoming victim mentality. Engage in spiritual practices such as meditation, prayer, or mindfulness to help gain emotional strength and resilience. Connecting with a higher power or purpose can provide a sense of guidance and belonging, making it easier to navigate life's challenges. Conclusion Overcoming victim mentality involves changes in mindset, behavior, and emotions. Breaking free from this limiting state provides an opportunity to embrace positivity, self-love, and personal growth. By applying the steps in this article, you can begin to take charge of your life, improve your well-being, and drive your destiny towards a more fulfilling and rewarding future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While the phrasing of the questions may differ slightly, the underlying meaning is the same. Both of them imply that the person wants to remove their current answer and replace it with a new one. To provide a more in-depth understanding, let's examine both questions separately. 1. I want to add a new answer. How do I permanently remove my existing answer for a question? This question explicitly mentions that the person wants to remove their existing answer permanently, which means completely erasing it. They then want to write a new answer for the same question in place of the previous one. The focus here is on removing the old answer and adding a new response. 2. What if I want to write a new answer to a question I have already answered? In this question, the person is simply asking about the possibility of composing a new answer to a question they have already answered. The implication here is that they might want to remove or replace their previous response with a new one.

It's important to note that the methods for achieving this deletion and replacement process might vary depending on the platform or context where the answers are being provided.

Alexander has figured in both high and popular culture beginning in his own era to the present day. The Alexander Romance, in particular, has had a significant impact on portrayals of Alexander in later cultures, from Persian to medieval European to modern Greek. Alexander may already have considered himself as the \\"King of Asia\\" after his victory at Issos, a conception strengthened by his subsequent successes. The conception might have inspired the title given to Alexander in Babylonian documents, \\"king of the world (since \\"king of Asia\\" had no meaning in Babylonian geography). It might also be alluded in the sarcastic comments by Anaxarchus, trying to rouse Alexander after the murder of Cleitus. or in the orator Demades' comments that if Alexander were dead, \\"The whole world would stink of his corpse\\". Alexander is called \\"kosmokrator\\", ruler of the world, in the later Alexander Romance. Alexander features prominently in modern Greek folklore, more so than any other ancient figure. The colloquial form of his name in modern Greek (\\"O Megalexandros\\") is a household name, and he is the only ancient hero to appear in the Karagiozis shadow play. One well-known fable among Greek seamen involves a solitary mermaid who would grasp a ship's prow during a storm and ask the captain \\"Is King Alexander alive?\\". The correct answer is \\"He is alive and well and rules the world!\\", causing the mermaid to vanish and the sea to calm. Any other answer would cause the mermaid to turn into a raging Gorgon who would drag the ship to the bottom of the sea, all hands aboard.

What is the answer to this question? how many football players are in a team?","output":"In a football team, the total number of players varies depending on the specific rules and regulations under which the game is being played. However, in most cases, particularly within the realm of association football (also known as soccer) and American football, the number of players in a team is clearly defined. In association football, or soccer, each team is comprised of 11 players, including 1 goalkeeper and 10 outfield players. The outfield players can be further divided into positions as follows: 1. Defenders: These players are responsible for preventing the opposition from scoring goals. Defenders typically include central defenders, full-backs, and wing-backs. There are usually 4 defenders in a team, but formations may vary depending on the team's strategy. 2. Midfielders: These players are crucial for maintaining possession of the ball, creating goal-scoring opportunities, and assisting defensively. Midfielders can be divided into central midfielders, attacking midfielders, and defensive midfielders. Typically, a team has 3 to 5 midfielders, again, depending on the chosen formation. 3. Forwards: These players focus primarily on scoring goals, and their roles include center forwards, wingers, and strikers. Generally, a team will have 1 to 3 forwards on the field. In American football, each team is composed of 11 players on the field at any given time. However, unlike soccer, American football teams maintain separate squads for offense, defense, and special teams. The 11 players on each squad have different positions and roles: 1. Offensive team: The players in the offensive squad contribute to the team's goal-scoring efforts. Their positions include the quarterback, running backs, wide receivers, tight ends, offensive linemen (including tackles, guards, and centers), and occasionally a fullback. 2. Defensive team: The defensive squad is responsible for preventing the opposing team from scoring. Key positions in the defense include defensive linemen (defensive tackles and defensive ends), linebackers, cornerbacks, and safeties. 3. Special teams: Responsible for plays involving punts, kickoffs, field goals, and extra points, the special teams squad is comprised of various players who specialize in kicking, punting, or returning kicks, as well as blockers and other specialists. The total number of players on an American football team roster typically ranges from 45 to 53, depending on professional, collegiate, or other league rules. However, each team is only allowed 11 players on the field during active gameplay. In summary, a soccer team and an American football team both have 11 players on the field at any given time, but the roles and positions of the players, as well as the total roster size, are quite different between the two sports."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For this reason, there are no cities or cars or factories to burn up fossil fuels.  Does Earth have more or less greenhouse gases than Caprica?  Hint: When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change. The answer to this question is:","output":"Earth has more greenhouse gases than Caprica. The primary reason for this difference is the presence of human activities on Earth, which have significantly contributed to the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. On Earth, humans have extensively utilized fossil fuels for various purposes, such as transportation, energy production, and industrial processes. The burning of these fossil fuels releases a large amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which is a major greenhouse gas. This increase in carbon dioxide disrupts the natural carbon cycle and leads to an imbalance between the amount of carbon dioxide released and the amount absorbed through processes such as photosynthesis. In contrast, Caprica, being devoid of human presence and the associated activities, does not experience the same level of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel consumption. Given the similarities between the two planets in terms of species and topography, it is likely that the natural carbon cycle on Caprica is more balanced, with fewer disruptions in the process. This would result in lower overall greenhouse gas levels on the planet. In summary, Earth has more greenhouse gases than Caprica, primarily due to the impact of human activities that involve the burning of fossil fuels and contribute to the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Johnny 5 was the central character in which film?","output":"Johnny 5, also known as Number 5, is the central character in the 1986 American science fiction comedy film \\"Short Circuit,\\" directed by John Badham. The film was written by S. S. Wilson and Brent Maddock, who are best known for their collaborations on various movies, such as \\"Tremors\\" and \\"Batteries Not Included.\\" \\"Short Circuit\\" tells the story of an experimental military robot named Number 5, which is developed by the fictional company NOVA Robotics. The robot is initially designed for military use and is equipped with advanced artificial intelligence, allowing it to learn and adapt autonomously. However, after being struck by lightning during a demonstration, Number 5's programming malfunctions, leading the robot to gain self-awareness and a profound desire to experience life beyond its designated purpose as a weapon. As Number 5 begins to explore the world around it, the robot befriends a young woman named Stephanie Speck, played by Ally Sheedy. Stephanie, a kind-hearted and animal-loving person, becomes instrumental in helping Number 5 understand the value of life and the importance of preserving it. With Stephanie's help, Number 5 embraces a pacifist attitude and works to avoid being captured and destroyed by its creators, who believe it has gone rogue and poses a threat to society. \\"Short Circuit\\" has a lighthearted and comedic tone throughout, with plenty of slapstick humor and amusing interactions between Number 5 and other characters. In addition to Sheedy, the film features actors like Steve Guttenberg, Fisher Stevens, and G.W. Bailey, who deliver entertaining performances that contribute to the overall charm of the movie. The robot character of Johnny 5 is brought to life through a combination of puppetry, animatronics, and remote control technology. The design and mechanics involved in creating Johnny 5 were the work of Syd Mead, a renowned visual futurist and industrial designer who also contributed designs to iconic films such as \\"Blade Runner\\" and \\"Aliens.\\" Due to the success of \\"Short Circuit,\\" a sequel titled \\"Short Circuit 2\\" was released in 1988,-directed by Kenneth Johnson. The sequel follows Johnny 5 as he continues to learn about the world and adapt to life among humans while helping his friend Ben Jahrvi, played by Fisher Stevens, to produce and sell toy versions of himself. In conclusion, Johnny 5 is the central character in the 1986 science fiction comedy film \\"Short Circuit.\\" The film's unique blend of humor, adventure, and a lovable robot protagonist made it a commercial success and contributed to the creation of a sequel, as well as cementing its legacy as a beloved and enduring piece of 80s popular culture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - Flint corn (\\"Zea mays\\" var. \\"indurata\\"; also known as Indian corn or sometimes calico corn) is a variant of maize, the same species as common corn. Because each kernel has a hard outer layer to protect the soft endosperm, it is likened to being hard as flint; hence the name.  - The Andropogoneae, sometimes called the sorghum tribe, are a large tribe of grasses (family Poaceae) with roughly 1,200 species in 90 genera, mainly distributed in tropical and subtropical areas. They include such important crops as maize (corn), sugarcane, and sorghum. All species in this tribe use C carbon fixation, which makes them competitive under warm, high-light conditions.  - Forage is plant material (mainly plant leaves and stems) eaten by grazing livestock. Historically, the term \\"forage\\" has meant only plants eaten by the animals directly as pasture, crop residue, or immature cereal crops, but it is also used more loosely to include similar plants cut for fodder and carried to the animals, especially as hay or silage. The term forage fish refers to small schooling fish that are preyed on by larger aquatic animals.  - Dent corn also known as yellow dent corn, Reid's yellow dent corn, white dent corn, or field corn, is a variety of maize or corn with a high soft starch content. It received its name because of the small indentation (\\"dent\\") at the crown of each kernel on a ripe ear of corn. It is a variety developed by northern Illinois farmer James L. Reid. Reid and his father, Robert Reid, moved from Brown County, Ohio to Tazewell County, Illinois in 1846 bringing with them a red corn variety known as \\"Johnny Hopkins\\", and crossed it with varieties of flint corn and floury corn. Most of today's hybrid corn varieties and cultivars are derived from it. This variety won a prize at the 1893 World's Fair.  - Panicoideae is the second - largest subfamily of the grasses with over 3,500 species , mainly distributed in warm temperate and tropical regions . It comprises some important agricultural crops , including sugarcane , maize ( or corn ) , sorghum , and switchgrass . C4 photosynthesis evolved independently a number of times in the subfamily , which presumably had a C3 ancestor .  - Maize (; \\"Zea mays\\" subsp. \\"mays\\", from after Taíno \\"mahiz\\"), also known as corn, is a large grain plant first domesticated by indigenous peoples in Mexico about 10,000 years ago. The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn.  - Sorghum is a genus of plants in the grass family. Seventeen of the twenty-five species are native to Australia, with the range of some extending to Africa, Asia, Mesoamerica, and certain islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.  - Indigenous peoples, also known as first peoples, aboriginal peoples, native peoples, or autochthonous peoples, are ethnic groups who are descended from and identify with the original inhabitants of a given region, in contrast to groups that have settled, occupied or colonized the area more recently. Groups are usually described as indigenous when they maintain traditions or other aspects of an early culture that is associated with a given region. Not all indigenous peoples share such characteristics. Indigenous peoples may be settled in a given locale/region or exhibit a nomadic lifestyle across a large territory, but they are generally historically associated with a specific territory on which they depend. Indigenous societies are found in every inhabited climate zone and continent of the world.  - Sugarcane, or sugar cane, are several species of tall perennial true grasses of the genus \\"Saccharum\\", tribe Andropogoneae, native to the warm temperate to tropical regions of South Asia and Melanesia, and used for sugar production. It has stout, jointed, fibrous stalks that are rich in the sugar sucrose, which accumulates in the stalk internodes. The plant is tall. All sugar cane species interbreed and the major commercial cultivars are complex hybrids. Sugarcane belongs to the grass family Poaceae, an economically important seed plant family that includes maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum, and many forage crops.  - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León.  - Flour corn (\\"Zea mays\\" var. \\"amylacea\\") is a variety of corn with a soft starchy endosperm and a thin pericarp. It is primarily used to make corn flour.  - Popcorn is a type of corn that expands from the kernel and puffs up when heated. Popcorn is able to pop like amaranth grain, sorghum, quinoa, and millet. When heated, pressure builds within the kernel, and a small explosion (or \\"pop\\") is the end result. Some strains of corn are now cultivated specifically as popping corns.  - Sucrose is a common, naturally occurring saccharide found in many plants and plant parts. Saccharose is an obsolete name for sugars in general, especially sucrose. The molecule is a disaccharide combination of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose with the formula CHO.  - Saccharum is a genus of tall perennial plants of the broomsedge tribe within the grass family.  - Sweet corn (\\"Zea mays\\" convar. \\"saccharata\\" var. \\"rugosa\\"; also called sugar corn and pole corn) is a variety of maize with a high sugar content. Sweet corn is the result of a naturally occurring recessive mutation in the genes which control conversion of sugar to starch inside the endosperm of the corn kernel. Unlike field corn varieties, which are harvested when the kernels are dry and mature (dent stage), sweet corn is picked when immature (milk stage) and prepared and eaten as a vegetable, rather than a grain. Since the process of maturation involves converting sugar to starch, sweet corn stores poorly and must be eaten fresh, canned, or frozen, before the kernels become tough and starchy. History. Sweet corn occurs as a spontaneous mutation in field corn and was grown by several Native American tribes. The Iroquois gave the first recorded sweet corn (called 'Papoon') to European settlers in 1779. It soon became a popular food in southern and central regions of the United States. Open pollinated cultivars of white sweet corn started to become widely available in the United States in the 19th century. Two of the most enduring cultivars, still available today, are 'Country Gentleman' (a Shoepeg corn with small kernels in irregular rows) and 'Stowell's Evergreen'.    What entity does 'panicoideae' has the relation 'parent taxon' with? A:","output":"Panicoideae has the relation 'parent taxon' with the family Poaceae, also known as the grass family. The Poaceae family is an economically important and diverse family of plants that includes several important crops, such as sugarcane, maize (or corn), sorghum, and wheat, among others.

Q:\\"Because all of you of Earth are idiots!\\" shouted Tom, wearily wiping the glass counter, removing coconut oil from the reflections of overpriced candy bars. Inside the theater the movie echoed him: \\"Because all of you of Earth are idiots!\\" Tom sighed, not for the first time that evening. The Manager, who paid in cash every Sunday, had decided to take advantage of the bizarre tastes of his Generation X clients and offer an Ed Wood film festival. Bride of the Monster, Plan 9 From Outer Space, and Night of the Ghouls ran on the second, smaller screen on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, two bucks a head. The Manager was making a killing. Tom, who needed the job in order to move out of his parents' trailer home, found little about the Ed Wood canon amusing, although it was light-years beyond anything by Coleman Francis. Even so, Tom had been forced to hear the dialog of each film, on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday... He only had to watch them once, having filled in for the Manager's weasel-featured nephew/projectionist Neoldner, who had called in sick to buy grass in Beloit. But he would have been able to forget the experience had it not been for the penetrating soundtrack which bled into the lobby. The ordeal, for tonight, was almost over - the concession stand closed after Plan 9. He hoped he had sold enough to keep his job - there was the worry that the Manager would increase his profit margin by manning the concession stand himself. But the Manager strolled out of the second theater with a broad grin, revealing his cutting overbite. \\"I don't know why,\\" the Manager exclaimed, \\"but they love it!\\" \\"Most of them are from the 'Ed 9 Film Society,'\\" Tom replied. \\"By the way, I need to restock the chocolates.\\" Who was was making good money from saling movie tickets? - The manager of the store - Ed Wood - Tom - not enough information A:","output":"The manager of the store was making good money from selling movie tickets.

Answer: Also around this time, he was offered a post by the Philippine Commonwealth Government, namely by then Philippine President Manuel L. Quezon on recommendations by MacArthur, to become the chief of police of a new capital being planned, now named Quezon City, but he declined the offer.  A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Options: (1). yes (2). no","output":"(1). Yes To provide a more detailed and elaborate answer, Dwight D. Eisenhower was serving as a military advisor to the Philippines from 1935 to 1939. During this period, he worked closely with General Douglas MacArthur and the Philippine government. The Philippine Commonwealth Government, under the leadership of President Manuel L. Quezon, was focused on developing and modernizing the country, which included the establishment of a new capital city called Quezon City. In recognition of Eisenhower's expertise and experience in security and law enforcement, President Quezon, based on MacArthur's recommendation, offered him the position of chief of police. Being the chief of police for the new capital, Eisenhower would have played a significant role in maintaining law and order, developing the organization's structure and strategies, and ensuring the security of the growing city. However, Eisenhower declined the offer. His decision can be attributed to various factors, including a preference for a military career over a local law enforcement position. Ultimately, he continued his military service under MacArthur, leading to his distinguished career during World War II and beyond, eventually becoming the 34th President of the United States. In conclusion, Eisenhower's response to the offer to become the Philippine police chief was to decline the opportunity, preferring to remain focused on his military career and his existing responsibilities as a military advisor to the Philippines. His choice proved to be significant for his own career and the broader historical context, considering the roles he played in the successes of World War II and his subsequent presidency."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Paul Reynolds crisscrossed his sketchbook with furious strokes, filling the pages with images of the vengeance he would take on his former coworkers at Fear and Loading Games. He'd founded the company three years back and, just a few hours ago, his partners and erstwhile friends had fired him without cause or warning. He concentrated hard as his pen brought to life demonic figures from one of the best-selling comics he'd created, scythe wielding cyber-men called Myrmidons who tore into surprised computer programmers with fangs and claws. Elsewhere on the page, computers assembled themselves into 21st century Golems, rising up against traitorous CEO's and producers to crush them to bloody pulp as they cowered beneath their desks. Sitting at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge. Not wanting to succumb to the former, and not quite wanting to find a gun and go back to the office, he instead drew. He had turned to a fresh page and begun to sketch his most elaborate revenge-scheme yet when a woman walked into his line of vision. There were four or five other women in the restaurant already (most of them employees), but this one stood out. This one would've stood out anywhere.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of Andy's character on Taxi?  Andy Kaufman is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings children's songs and refuses to tell conventional jokes. As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his previously timid \\"foreign man\\" character puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them. He catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro, who signs Kaufman as a client and immediately lands him a network TV series, Taxi, much to Kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. Secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit. Invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, Tony Clifton, whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on Taxi. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a \\"villain character\\" created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda. Once again, the gag is on the audience.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: The Bronte sisters were three sisters who became famous novelists. Their lives and works are connected with the lonely moors of Yorkshire, England, where they lived. Patrick Bronte, the sisters' father, was a poor Irishman who became the parish clergyman of the small, isolated town of Haworth, Yorkshire. Bronte was somewhat strange and tended to be strict. His wife died in 1821 and her sister brought up the family out of duty, but with little love or understanding. The sisters went to several boarding schools where they received a better education than usual for girls at that time, but in a bad atmosphere. Few jobs were available for women at that time, and the Bronte sisters, except for occasional jobs as governesses or schoolteachers, lived their entire lives at home. They were shy, poor, and lonely, and occupied themselves with music, drawing, reading and ---above all---writing. Their isolation led to the early development of their imaginations. In 1846, under the male pen names of Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell, the sisters published a joint volume of poems.Although only two copies were sold, all three sisters soon had their first novels published. Charlotte Bronte's most famous novel Jane Eyre (1847) is largely _ . Through the heroine, Charlotte relived her hated boarding school life and her experiences as a governess in a large house. Rochester, the hero and master of the house, is fictional. Jane Eyre was enormously successful, but many readers were shocked that Rochester, who tried to make Jane his mistress, should be rewarded by marrying her. Some readers were also shocked because Jane wanted to be regarded as a thinking and independent person, rather than as a weak female. Charlotte Bronte wrote three other novels. The first one, The Professor, was not published until 1857, after her death. Shirley (1849) is set among the labour riots of the early 1800s. Villette (1853) the most popular of the three, is based on Charlotte's unhappy experiences as a governess in Brussels. Question: We can infer from the passage that   _  . Options: A: the three sisters were badly treated by their step-mother B: The three Bronte sisters were brought up in Ireland C: Haworth was suffering high unemployment at the time of the three Bronte sisters D: writing was not intended for women in the 19th century in Britain A:","output":"D: writing was not intended for women in the 19th century in Britain"},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Independence with Partition: The British began to see India's independence as inevitable; however, only a few seemed to understand the vital role of the religious groups. Britain prepared a parliamentary democracy with majority rule, but the majority were Hindus — and Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs had been killing each other in war for many centuries. Nehru's Congress Party, largely Hindu with a socialist leadership, wanted a parliamentary democracy. As counterweight, British legislation reserved parliamentary seats for religious minorities, but the Punjab and Bengal had such a complicated mixture of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs that it was not possible to avoid fights over how separate constituencies were to be formed. The seeds of future trouble were sown. The legislation on reserving seats gave the Muslims the basis for an alternative to an India in which they were only a quarter of the population: Partition. In 1930, the poet Muhammad Iqbal proposed a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India. A small group of Indian Muslims at Cambridge came up with the name Pakistan, using the initials of the Punjab, Afghania (N.W. Frontier Province), Kashmir, and Sind (at the same time producing the word pak, meaning \\"pure\\"), and adding \\"stan,\\" the Persian suffix for the word \\"country. \\" The Muslim campaign for Partition was led by London-trained Bombay lawyer, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Meanwhile, Gandhi vehemently opposed any dismemberment of the country, and tried to keep people united by fasting to uphold the spirit of love, and by focussing on the common adversary: the British. Advocating civil disobedience, he led his famous Salt March to the sea, to scoop up salt and circumvent the hated British salt tax. This put more than 60,000 in jail. Against this militancy, World War II did not elicit the solidarity of the first. Indians courageously fought alongside the British troops, in Burma, the Middle East, and Europe, but Gandhi saw the British as a provocation for Japanese invasion and was jailed yet again, for launching a \\"Quit India\\" campaign in the year 1942. Some anti-British extremists saw the Japanese as an Asian liberator. Winston Churchill didn't want any Indian independence and so it was probably as well for India that he was defeated by Attlee's Labor Party in 1945. With riots growing ever more bloody in Bengal, Bihar, and the Punjab, India's last viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, kept a mandate to make the British departure as quick and as smooth as possible. Quick it was — six months after his arrival — but not smooth.  Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"They were jailed\\" correctly answer the question \\"What happened to many Indian people when they participated in the Salt March to protest the British salt tax?\\"? OPT: *no. *yes.","output":"*yes. The response \\"They were jailed\\" correctly answers the question \\"What happened to many Indian people when they participated in the Salt March to protest the British salt tax?\\" because in the text it says, \\"This [the Salt March] put more than 60,000 in jail.\\" This means that a lot of people who took part in the Salt March were put in jail by the British for their actions.

Everton originally played in the southeast corner of Stanley Park, which was the site for the new Liverpool F.C. stadium, with the first official match taking place in 1879. In 1882, a man named J. Cruitt donated land at Priory Road which became the club's home before they moved to Anfield, which was Everton's home until 1892. At this time, a dispute of how the club was to be owned and run emerged with Anfield's owner and Everton's chairman, John Houlding. A dispute between Houlding and the club's committee over how the club should be run, led to Houlding attempting to gain full control of the club by registering the company, \\"Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd\\". In response, Everton left Anfield for a new ground, Goodison Park, where the club have played ever since. Houlding attempted to take over Everton's name, colours, fixtures and league position, but was denied by The Football Association. Instead, Houlding formed a new club, Liverpool F.C.

Question: The looseness of soil has a positive impact on a plant 's roots' growth in that soil, and most mulches help to keep soil surfaces loose and receptive to water absorption. Given these facts, soil receptive to water absorption has a positive impact on what aspect of the plant among the following options: - support  - growth  - stem thickness  - root growth  - energy  - dry roots  - Energy.  - bud amount Answer:","output":"The soil's receptiveness to water absorption primarily has a positive impact on the growth and root growth of the plant among the options provided. Let's delve deeper into each of the aspects and understand how soil loose in texture and its water absorption capacity influences each. 1. Support: While this term is a bit ambiguous in the context of plant biology, we can assume it refers to structural support. While planting in loose soil can help a plant establish more easily and provide a certain degree of physical support, the soil's water absorption affects support indirectly. Well-hydrated roots become stronger and may provide a better anchor to the plant in the soil, improving the overall support. 2. Growth: Both the looseness of soil and its water absorption capabilities have a direct impact on growth. Loose soil allows for easy root growth, as it means the roots can penetrate deep into the soil without much resistance. Increased water absorption provides more water to the plant, which is essential for photosynthesis and nutrient transportation within the plant. Therefore, the soil being receptive to water absorption has a very positive direct impact on the plant's overall growth. 3. Stem Thickness: The watering level can indirectly influence stem thickness, as plants in an optimal water environment have the potential to grow more robust; however, it's not the primary driver. Genetic factors, light exposure, and nutrient content play more substantial roles. 4. Root Growth: Loose soil and the soil's water absorption have a significant impact on root growth. Loose soil allows roots to spread and grow without restriction, and the ability of soil to absorb and retain water ensures that the roots have a consistent supply of water, encouraging root growth and development. 5. Energy: When we speak about the energy of a plant, we're referring to the process of photosynthesis - the way a plant converts light energy into chemical energy. Water is a crucial part of this process, so soil that's absorbent does have an impact on a plant's energy. Yet, the level of light exposure, as well as other nutrients in the soil, play a more significant role. 6. Dry Roots: Good water absorption by the soil can prevent roots from drying out, ensuring they maintain the moisture levels necessary for nutrient absorption. Therefore, soil receptive to water absorption indirectly impacts preventing dry roots. 7. Bud Amount: While the soil's water holding capability indirectly affects the bud amount (as a result of promoting overall healthier plant growth), this is not the primary factor. The formation and amount of buds are more directly influenced by the plant's genetic predisposition, seasonal changes, and light exposure. In conclusion, given the options, the soil's capacity to absorb water likely best facilitates plant growth and root growth above the other aspects. The availability of water in the right amounts when need can significantly accelerate and enhance the plant's growth, making it healthier and more robust."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

During the second half of the twentieth century, Czech dialect use began to weaken. By the early 1990s dialect use was stigmatized, associated with the shrinking lower class and used in literature or other media for comedic effect. Increased travel and media availability to dialect-speaking populations has encouraged them to shift to (or add to their own dialect) standard Czech. Although Czech has received considerable scholarly interest for a Slavic language, this interest has focused primarily on modern standard Czech and ancient texts rather than dialects.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Archaeology, or archeology, is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture. The archaeological record consists of artifacts, architecture, biofacts or ecofacts, and cultural landscapes. Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities. In North America, archaeology is considered a sub-field of anthropology, while in Europe archaeology is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines.  - Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama is the 30th-most extensive and the 24th-most populous of the U.S. states. At nearly , Alabama has one of the nation's longest navigable inland waterways.  - The Creek War (1813-1814), also known as the Red Stick War and the Creek Civil War, was a regional war between opposing Creek factions, European empires, and the United States, taking place largely in Alabama and along the Gulf Coast. The major conflicts of the war took place between state militias and the \\"Red Stick\\" Creeks.  - Fort Mitchell is an unincorporated community in Russell County, Alabama, United States. The area was originally a garrisoned fort intended to provide defense for the area during the Creek War (1813-1814).   - Fort Mitchell Historic Site is a park and an archaeological site in Fort Mitchell , Alabama , that was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1990 . The park features a reconstruction of the 1813 stockade fort that was an important United States military post in the Creek War , a museum with exhibits about the fort 's history and a collection of historic carriages , a restored 19th - century log home , and a visitor center . The Chattahoochee Indian Heritage Center has a ceremonial flame memorial to the Creek nation . Interpretive panels recount the history of the Creek War of 1836 and the subsequent forced removal of the Creek peoples along the Trail of Tears . The memorial is located adjacent to Fort Mitchell Historic Site . The site also features historic burial grounds .  - The archaeological record is the body of physical (not written) evidence about the past. It is one of the core concepts in archaeology, the academic discipline concerned with documenting and interpreting the archaeological record. Archaeological theory is used to interpret the archaeological record for a better understanding of human cultures. The archaeological record can consist of the earliest ancient findings as well as contemporary artifacts. Human activity has had a large impact on the archaeological record. Destructive human processes, such as agriculture and land development, may damage or destroy potential archaeological sites. Other threats to the archaeological record include natural phenomena and scavenging. Archaeology can be a destructive science for the finite resources of the archaeological record are lost to excavation. Therefore archaeologists limit the amount of excavation that they do at each site and keep meticulous records of what is found. The archaeological record is the record of human history, of why civilizations prosper or fail and why cultures change and grow. It is the story of the world that humans have created.  - A stockade is an enclosure of palisades and tall walls made of logs placed side by side vertically with the tops sharpened to provide security.   - A National Historic Landmark (NHL) is a building, district, object, site, or structure that is officially recognized by the United States government for its outstanding historical significance. Of over 85,000 places listed on the country's National Register of Historic Places, only some 2,500 are recognized as National Historic Landmarks.  - A militia is generally an army or some other type of fighting unit that is composed of non-professional fighters, citizens of a nation or subjects of a state or government who can be called upon to enter a combat situation, as opposed to a professional force of regular, full-time military personnel, or historically, members of the warrior nobility class (e.g., knights or samurai). Unable to hold their own against properly trained and equipped professional forces, it is common for militias to engage in guerrilla warfare or defense instead of being used in open attacks and offensive actions.  - The National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) is the United States federal government's official list of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects deemed worthy of preservation. A property listed in the National Register, or located within a National Register Historic District, may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred preserving the property.  - An archaeological site is a place (or group of physical sites) in which evidence of past activity is preserved (either prehistoric or historic or contemporary), and which has been, or may be, investigated using the discipline of archaeology and represents a part of the archaeological record. Sites may range from those with few or no remains visible above ground, to buildings and other structures still in use.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Question 1: Yes, cameras existed in 1912. They were very different from the cameras we use today. In 1912, cameras were big, box-like things made of metal, wood, and leather. You had to put a special sheet called a film inside to take photos. People couldn't see the photos right away; they had to wait for them to be developed in a special room called a darkroom. Question 2: Cameras in the 1800s looked even more different than the ones in 1912. They were still big and bulky, but they were often made of wood. They had large, accordion-like parts at the front, and people had to cover themselves with a cloth to take a photo. The process of taking a photo was much slower and more complicated than in 1912. No, the answer to these two questions is not the same because cameras changed a lot between the 1800s and 1912.

Title: A Modern Musketeer Movie plot: The film opens with a sequence in which D'Artagnan (Douglas Fairbanks) rides up to a tavern on horseback and ends up brawling with sword and fist with the patrons inside in his haste to approach a fair young stranger. After triumphing, he morphs into modern day Ned Thacker (also played by Fairbanks). Ned is born and raised in Kansas by a mother who passes along to him her love of D'Artagnan and The Three Musketeers, despite his father's concern that it is not good for him. In fact, Ned does get into trouble with his (sometimes unwanted) chivalrous attempts to help women. Finally, Ned can stand it no more; he decides to leave dull Kansas. In mirroring scenes, D'Artagnan is astride a somewhat less-than-noble steed, a present from his father for his departure from home, while Ned's father gives him the modern equivalent: a car. While driving in the desert, he comes upon a chauffeur-driven automobile stopped because the road ahead has been washed away. Unimpressed with one passenger, the middle-aged Forrest Vandeteer (the \\"richest man in Yonkers\\"), Ned is quite taken with the lovely \\"Park Avenue flapper\\" Elsie Dodge.

Larry Mullins and Adam Clayton are the rhythm section for which band?","output":"Larry Mullins and Adam Clayton are the rhythm section for the world-renowned Irish rock band U2.  U2, which was formed in 1976, is made up of Bono (vocals and rhythm guitar), the Edge (lead guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals), Adam Clayton (bass guitar), and Larry Mullen Jr. (drums and percussion). As part of the rhythm section, Clayton and Mullen play significant roles in establishing the tempo, rhythm, and beat of U2's music, contributing to their characteristic sound. Adam Clayton, U2's bassist, was one of the original founding members. His bass playing forms the backbone of U2's music, providing both rhythm and harmony. Despite having no formal musical training, Clayton's creativity and inventiveness on the bass have been critical in shaping U2's distinctive sound. He often uses a pick to play, which gives the band its rhythmic edge. From catchy, driving bass lines in songs like \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\" to brooding, aggressive ones in \\"Bullet the Blue Sky,\\" Clayton's contribution to U2's music is immense and influential. Larry Mullen Jr. is the drummer for U2, with his style considered as rock-solid, minimalistic yet with an effectual approach that avoids common rock drumming clichés. He was the one who posted a note on the school notice board seeking members for a band, which eventually led to the formation of U2. Mullen's drumming style, although it has evolved over the years, is noted for its military-like precision, helping to maintain a steady rhythm for the band's adventurous sonic explorations. His opening drumbeat on \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" is one of the most recognizable in rock history. Together, Clayton and Mullen provide the rhythmic and harmonic foundation upon which Bono and the Edge build their melodies and lyrical themes. Throughout their career, these four musicians have created a sound that, while it has evolved over the decades, remains unmistakably U2. Their work has been recognized with numerous awards, including 22 Grammy Awards and an induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Their ability to create emotionally resonate and socially conscious music has solidified their place as one of the most influential bands in rock history."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You will be given a context and a question in Spanish.

Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug.

Premise: Possibly, Bakaly meant to give the impression that Starr has a good hand without formally stating anything, but more likely it was an unintentional snafu. Hypothesis: It was possible that Bakaly meant to give Starr a bad impression. Step 2: Determine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise suggests two possibilities: 1. Bakaly meant to give the impression that Starr has a good hand without formally stating anything. 2. The situation is likely an unintentional snafu (a mistake or misunderstanding). The hypothesis introduces a third possibility: 3. Bakaly meant to give Starr a bad impression. Step 3: Assess the entailment of the hypothesis from the premise. Entailment means that the conclusion (hypothesis) logically follows from the premise. In this case, the premise does not directly entail the hypothesis. The premise presents two possibilities, neither of which is identical to the hypothesis. The premise does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis that Bakaly meant to give Starr a bad impression.

Article: A new age is coming.Call it what you will: the service economy, the information age, the knowledge society.It all translates to a fundamental change in the way we work.Already we're partly there, the percentage of people who earn their living by making things has fallen dramatically in the Western World.Today the majority of jobs in America, Europe and Japan are in the service industry, and the number is on the rise.More women are in the work force than ever before.There are more part-time jobs.More people are self-employed.But the range of the economic transformation can't be measured by numbers alone, because it also is giving rise to important new way of thinking about the nature of work itself.Long-held ideas about jobs and careers, the skills needed to succeed, even the relation between individuals and employers - all these are being challenged.  We have only to look behind us to get some sense of what may lie ahead.No one looking ahead 20 years possibly could have foreseen the ways in which a single invention, the chip , would transform our world thanks to its applications in personal computers, digital communications and factory robots.Tomorrow's achievements in biotechnology, artificial intelligence or even some still unimagined technology could produce a similar wave of dramatic changes.But one thing is certain: information and knowledge will become even more valid, and the people who possess it, whether they work in manufacturing or services, will have the advantage and produce the wealth.Computer knowledge will become as basic a requirement as the ability to read and write.The ability to solve problems by applying information instead of performing routine tasks will be valued above all else.If you cast your mind ahead 10 years, information service will be superior.It will be the way you do your job. Question: By mentioning the invention of \\"the chip\\", the author means to say that. Answer: Answer:","output":"By mentioning the invention of \\"the chip\\", the author means to highlight the profound impact that a single technological development can have on the entire society and the way we work. The chip, with its numerous applications in personal computers, digital communications, and factory robots, has transformed the world in ways that were unimaginable two decades ago. This serves as an example of how future advancements in fields like biotechnology, artificial intelligence, or other yet unimagined technologies have the potential to bring about another wave of dramatic changes. The author emphasizes the increasing importance of information and knowledge in this new age, as well as the need for individuals to adapt their skills to keep up with these rapidly evolving technologies.

What is the answer??","output":"To solve the equation -u - 16 = -16 for the variable u, we'll follow these steps: 1. Understand the equation: The given equation is -u - 16 = -16, and our goal is to find the value of u that makes the equation true. 2. Isolate the term with the variable: In this case, we want to isolate -u by moving the constant term (-16) to the other side of the equation. We can do this by adding 16 to both sides of the equation:    -u - 16 + 16 = -16 + 16 3. Simplify: Combine the constants on both sides:    -u = 0 4. Solve for u: In this case, we want to switch the sign of -u to find the value of u. To do this, we can multiply or divide both sides of the equation by -1:    -1 * -u = -1 * 0 5.

Question: SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country.

However, I must admit that my recent visit left me feeling disappointed and underwhelmed. Upon arrival, the first thing I noticed was the subpar ambiance. The lighting was too dim, making it hard to read the menus, and the tables were too close together, causing discomfort whenever a server or another patron walked by. Additionally, the constant noise from the bar area was overwhelmingly loud, preventing any casual conversation with my companions. Despite being called The Sunset Lounge, I found the lack of any visible sunset quite ironic. Moving on to the food, the overall quality didn't meet my expectations. While the menu seemed promising with a wide variety of mouth-watering dishes, the actual execution fell short. The appetizer, a plate of calamari, was overcooked to the point of chewiness and lacked seasoning. My main course, the grilled salmon with herb-crusted potatoes and green beans, arrived lukewarm and not as fresh as I would have hoped. The salmon tasted dry and bland, and the herb-crusted potatoes were overpowered by a strangely overpowering garlic flavor. Although I found the green beans passable, they were slightly undercooked and inconsistently seasoned. The service I received at The Sunset Lounge was a mixed bag. While our server was initially prompt and courteous when taking our orders, the wait time for the food was anything but reasonable. It took almost an hour for our appetizers to arrive, and the main courses were delayed even further. Some of the other diners in our vicinity seemed to be encountering similar difficulties, as they were often looking around in frustration or feverishly gesturing toward the waitstaff. Although I hoped that the dessert would salvage the evening, it provided little more than a mediocre taste on an already bittersweet evening. The chocolate lava cake was dense and dry, though the presentation was nice. As for the accompanying vanilla ice cream, it had already started to melt by the time it reached the table. To conclude, I'm dismayed to report that my experience at The Sunset Lounge did not live up to its reputation. I cannot recommend the restaurant based on my visit due to its lackluster ambiance, disappointing food, and inconsistent service. Perhaps with some much-needed improvements in these areas, The Sunset Lounge might eventually regain its sparkle.

Tanya was immune to the chicken pox and Rachel was not because Tanya got a chicken pox shot. Step 1: Identify the main subject matter of the story The story is about Tanya and Rachel, and their immunity differences towards chicken pox. Step 2: Determine the main outcome Tanya is immune to chicken pox, while Rachel is not due to the vaccination choice. Step 3: Justify the choice The story (A) suggests that Tanya got the chicken pox shot, which made her immune to the disease. On the other hand, Rachel did not get the shot, so she remains susceptible to chicken pox. This creates a contrast between the two characters and their experiences with the illness. Step 4: Expand upon the original idea The story might show the consequences of not getting vaccinated as Rachel might experience the discomfort of chicken pox in the story, while Tanya remains healthy. This could lead to interactions and experiences that demonstrate the importance of vaccinations and making informed choices. Step 5: Further develop the plot The story might progress to show how Tanya takes care of Rachel during her chicken pox ordeal, leading to a deepened friendship between them. Rachel may learn the importance of vaccination through her experience, and later decide to raise awareness around her community about vaccination benefits.

When a critical article she writes about the school's athletes is published, two of the star athletes, Shawn and Patrick, want revenge. Tamara attempts to perform a magical ritual to bind her fate to that of her teacher, but when she must spill her own blood she ceases the ritual.That night, a prank is orchestrated by Shawn and Patrick, along with Shawn's girlfriend Kisha. Shawn calls Tamara, impersonating Mr. Natolly, and invites her to a motel room. A video camera is placed there and catches Tamara undressing. Shawn, Patrick, and Kisha watch this, along with three others who did not know about the prank (Chloe, Jesse, and Roger). Shawn comes in and taunts Tamara, and Tamara is accidentally killed in a struggle. Despite Chloe's demands that they inform the police, she is blackmailed into helping bury Tamara.However the very next day, they are shocked when Tamara walks into class, alive and well and looking more attractive than ever before.

Q: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Final preparations are underway for Friday’s historic third summit between the leaders of North and South Korea. In the morning, North Korea Leader Kim Jong Un will cross the military demarcation line that divides the two Koreas at the village of Panmunjom, the historic site where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. This will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea. Kim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North’s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel. It is unclear if Kim Jong Un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. South Korea will hold a welcoming ceremony for the North Korean leader that will include a military honor guard review. During past summits, North Korea also organized the same level of ceremonial guard used to underscore friendly relations with an important visiting head of state. The two leaders will pose together for pictures, and plant a pine tree in the DMZ to symbolize Korean reconciliation. The leaders from the North and South may also walk together along a historic footbridge called the “Bridge of No Return” that was used for prisoner exchanges at the end of the Korean War. Moon and Kim will hold direct talks in the Peace House conference hall, both in the morning and the afternoon, but the North Korean delegation will...

Answer the following question: Information:  - A parliamentary republic is a republic that operates under a parliamentary system of government where the executive branch (the government) derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature (the parliament). There are a number of variations of parliamentary republics. Most have a clear differentiation between the head of government and the head of state, with the head of government holding real power, much like constitutional monarchies. Some have combined the roles of head of state and head of government, much like presidential systems, but with a dependency upon parliamentary power.  - Mustafa Bülent Ecevit (28 May 1925  5 November 2006) was a Turkish politician, poet, writer, scholar, and journalist, who served as the Prime Minister of Turkey four times between 1974 and 2002. He served as prime minister of Turkey in 1974, 1977, 197879, and 19992002. He was the leader of the Republican People's Party (CHP) between 1972 and 1980, and in 1989 he became the leader of the Democratic Left Party (DSP).  - The 15th Turkish general election was held on 3 November 2002 following the collapse of the DSP - MHP - ANAP coalition led by Bülent Ecevit . It was the 15th general election to be held in Turkey . All 550 members of the Grand National Assembly were up for election . The election was held during an ongoing economic crisis which followed the 2001 financial crash , which resulted in a deep resentment of coalition governments which had governed the country since the 1980 military coup . The Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) , which had only been formed in 2001 by Recep Tayyip Erdoan , won the election with nearly two - thirds of the seats . The protest vote was such that every sitting party previously represented in parliament was ejected , with the AKP winning 363 seats with just 34.3 % of the vote . The only other party which passed the 10 % threshold to gain representation was the Republican People 's Party , which came second with 19.38 % of the vote and 178 seats . The election produced Turkey 's first single party government since 1987 and the country 's first two - party parliament since 1960 . The moderate Islamism advocated by the AKP was at odds with the secular establishment of the Republic of Turkey . While serving as the Mayor of Istanbul , Erdoan was sentenced to a 10 month prison term in 1998 for reciting a poem in Siirt which incited racial intolerance . This barred him from initially seeking a seat in parliament , meaning that the AKP 's co-founder Abdullah Gül became Prime Minister following their election victory . With the help of the CHP , the government overturned Erdoan 's political ban in 2003 , after which he was able to seek a seat in a controversial by - election in the Province of Siirt . Erdoan became Prime Minister in March 2003 , with Abdullah Gül concurrently assuming the role of Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister .  - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history.  - The Prime Minister of Turkey (Turkish: \\"Babakan\\") is the head of government of Turkey. The prime minister is the leader of a political coalition in the Turkish parliament (Meclis) and the leader of the cabinet. The current holder of the position is Binali Yldrm of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), who took office on 24 May 2016.    What is the relationship between 'turkish general election' and 'prime minister of turkey'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between the Turkish general election and the Prime Minister of Turkey lies in the electoral process and the formation of the government. In Turkey, a parliamentary republic, the Prime Minister is the head of government and holds significant power, leading the country's political coalition and the cabinet. The Turkish general election is held to elect members of the Grand National Assembly, which is Turkey's unicameral parliament.  During the general election, Turkish citizens vote for political parties, with each party needing to surpass a 10% threshold to gain representation in the parliament. The seats in the Grand National Assembly are allocated proportionally to the votes each party receives, provided they have met the threshold. Following the general election, the President of Turkey generally tasks the leader of the party with the most seats in the parliament to form a government. In cases where a single party wins the majority of the seats in the parliament, the party leader typically assumes the role of Prime Minister, as they have a strong mandate to lead the government. If no party wins the majority, coalition governments may be formed through negotiations between multiple parties. In such cases, the Prime Minister is often chosen from the leading party in the coalition. Therefore, the Turkish general election plays a crucial role in determining the composition of the parliament, and consequently, the party that has the power to form the government and appoint the Prime Minister of Turkey. The Prime Minister, as the head of government, is responsible for implementing policies and decisions, shaping the country's political landscape, and is held accountable to the parliament."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Possible answers: Tired, Energized, Active A:","output":"Bailey can be described as tired in this situation, as taking a nap during the second period of the class indicates that she was unable to maintain her focus or stay awake. There could be several factors contributing to her tiredness, and it is essential to analyze the situation from multiple perspectives before coming to a conclusion. First and foremost, Bailey might have had a long day before attending the class or did not have enough sleep the previous night, causing her to feel exhausted during the class. Inadequate rest can lead to difficulty in concentrating and retaining information. Therefore, taking a short nap would have been an effective way for her to restore her energy and get ready for what is to come during the rest of the day. Secondly, Bailey might be struggling with personal issues that can affect her physically or emotionally, contributing to her tiredness. For example, stress, anxiety, or depression can lead to poor sleep quality or difficulty concentrating, resulting in her feeling tired during class. Additionally, underlying health issues could be contributing factors. Conditions such as sleep apnea, anemia, or thyroid problems can result in tiredness and fatigue. If her tiredness persists and impacts her ability to perform daily activities, seeking medical help to identify any underlying health conditions would be necessary. Moreover, Bailey could be lacking in time management skills or struggling with the workload, causing her to overwork herself and not allocate enough time for rest. This overexertion could lead to her feeling tired during the class. Developing better time management strategies, setting realistic goals, and prioritizing self-care would help mitigate this issue. Furthermore, it is essential to consider the external factors of the class itself. The class environment may be conducive to sleepiness, such as dim lighting, a warm temperature, or the second period might be right after a lunch break when students generally feel sleepier. Lastly, it is important to note that this situation might have been a one-time occurrence for Bailey. She could generally be an active and energized individual, but she might have faced personal or physical challenges on that specific day, leading to her tiredness. In conclusion, based on the provided context, Bailey can be described as tired during the second period of the class. Factors such as inadequate sleep, personal stress, health issues, or even the class environment could have contributed to her tiredness. It is crucial to consider these various aspects and encourage her to address any underlying concerns to prevent further instances of tiredness during class, allowing her to remain focused and engaged in her academic pursuits."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Involving the authorities should be your last recourse for a barking dog, because it is likely to take a good bit of time and effort to secure an acceptable resolution, and is sure to make your relationship with your neighbor uncomfortable at best — and quite possibly openly hostile.  But, if you have exhausted other options and/or see no alternative, make sure you know your rights and how to assert them.  Some municipalities have specific codes regarding barking dogs, while others include it within nuisance or noise ordinances.  Within a single metropolitan area, local codes can vary widely, so contact your local government authority for clarification.  If you and your neighbor are both part of a neighborhood association, there may be codes that cover barking dogs.  Similarly, if you are renters (especially if you have the same landlord), look into the terms of your lease. Some municipalities may provide, or be able to refer you to, mediation services (binding or non-binding) to keep such disputes out of the courts.  Contact your local government, district attorney’s office, or small claims court to inquire. The days of the dog catcher coming around unannounced and snatching up problem dogs is over, but your local animal control service may be able to intervene for you. Contact the service to find out whether it handles nuisance barking, or whether you need to involve the police first.  You may need to be persistent in your calls and/or be able to provide evidence that the dog is a nuisance for animal control to act.  Call animal control right away if the dog is barking because it is in pain, has trapped itself in a small area, has tangled its chain, or is otherwise unable to access water.  Contact the owner first if you are comfortable doing so, but don’t ignore a suffering dog that is not receiving proper care. Involving the police will usually either immediately escalate or immediately resolve the situation.  Your amount of preparation beforehand may well make the difference.  Once you make yourself familiar with the relevant dog/noise/nuisance ordinance(s) in your area, call the non-emergency police number to report a violation. Unless your local police uses the emergency number (such as 911) for all calls, do not call it to make a barking dog complaint.  It is conceivable that you may be cited for misuse of the emergency line. Many police departments and other services require you to prove that the barking is extreme before they can take action. Here is where your record-keeping — log book, recordings, statements from other neighbors, etc. — can prove invaluable in supporting your claim.  Once the police are involved, your neighbor may feel besieged and try to frame the issue as a dispute between neighbors, in which you are primarily at fault for some reason.  This is why it is essential to never give him ammunition to use against you by making threats, shouting, swearing, accosting the dog in any way, etc. If you need to go to court to prove a noise/nuisance violation, come prepared with the evidence you have gathered.  Calmly and clearly establish your case.  You may be able to sue your neighbor in small claims court for causing you loss of enjoyment of your home and property.  You’re not going to strike it rich this way (and may even end up losing money in the process), but if you provide a clear, strong case supported by documented evidence, you may be able to get your neighbor to finally quiet that dog.  If you find that the local laws regarding nuisance dogs are lacking in your area, start a petition and contact your elected leaders. Summary:","output":"If you have exhausted all other options and need to involve the authorities for a barking dog issue, make sure you know your rights and local regulations. Some municipalities have specific codes, while others include barking dogs within nuisance or noise ordinances. Contact your local government, neighborhood association, or landlord for clarification on rules, mediation services, and possible legal avenues. Local animal control services may intervene for you, especially if the dog is in distress. Call animal control or the police non-emergency line to report a violation. Be prepared with evidence, such as logs, recordings, and statements from other neighbors, to support your claim.

Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend hailed the performance of Pyrgos in the 27-20 win over Cardiff Blues in the Pro12. \\"I thought Henry Pyrgos was outstanding,\\" he told BBC Scotland. \\"To be out of the game for four months and really add tempo to our game, make the right decisions of where to attack and the players followed him and we got a couple of cracking tries in there.\\" Cowan and Maitland will be notable absentees from the Scotland squad that will gather on Tuesday at Murrayfield ahead of Sunday's Six Nations game against France. Loose forward Cowan missed the victory over Italy through concussion, while winger Maitland dropped out of the squad with a thigh injury. Both returned to London Irish for treatment but were deemed fit enough to play in the 47-20 defeat by Leicester in the English Premiership, a game that took place 24 hours after Scotland's win in Rome. However, Scotland coach Vern Cotter has decided against recalling either player after the likes Ryan Wilson and Tim Visser, who had returned to the squad after recovering from their own injuries, took their chance to impress. Dunbar, Pyrgos and Brown had missed the start of the tournament through injury. Pygos, who captained Scotland for the first time last year in the absence of Greig Laidlaw, had wrist surgery after picking up his injury in October. Brown, who takes the place of Edinburgh hooker George Turner, suffered an ankle injury at the same time. He returned to action along with Dunbar in matches against Dragons and Cardiff.

Along with fellow researchers Camila and Bridget, Dr. Edwards spends two months examining Porter in isolation. Porter continually asks to see his wife, but he is continually denied. Marcus prepares to marry wealthy heiress Kate Arias in the Dominican Republic. Mark's best friend Dobs, his brother Josh, and Josh's girlfriend Penny charter a boat and take Mark to a supposedly unpopulated island for a low key bachelor party. Sympathetic researcher Camila creates a rapport with Porter. Frustrated with his confinement, Porter intentionally infects one of the researchers as he begins revolting against his continued isolation. Porter warns Camila that he is dangerous. Bridget becomes infected. Josh and Penny go snorkeling and find dead sea animals littering the ocean floor. When they return to camp, Josh and Penny discover strange rashes on their skin.

Tony and Rudolph are now tit-for-tat, each having saved the other. They decide to become friends. Rudolph sleeps the next day in Tony's toybox but is gone when Tony gets home from school. Rudolph shows up again that night, asking about a picture Tony drew of an amulet he saw in a dream, the amulet of Attamon, made by the Great Magician from a piece of the comet of Attamon. Tony offers to help Rudolph find it because it could mean the end of a curse that causes Rudolph and his family to remain vampires.

Hewlett-Packard Co.'s board is expected Thursday to name the former eBay chief its next CEO, replacing Leo Apotheker, according to a person briefed on the matter.      H-P's board is expected to oust CEO Leo Apotheker and replace him with former eBay CEO Meg Whitman today. Colin Barr and Marcelo Prince discuss whether a new strategy and a new CEO can save H-P. (Photo: AP.)      Ms. Whitman—a Silicon Valley veteran who turned eBay Inc. from a quirky start-up into an online auction giant—remains an influential figure in the technology scene as an H-P director and an adviser to a leading venture-capital firm.      But the former eBay CEO also has little background in the hardware industry, never ran a company of H-P's size, made some missteps at eBay, and most recently drew attention for a failed bid to become governor of California.      In an interview Monday, Ms. Whitman, 55, described H-P as \\"a Silicon Valley icon that is in the process of reshaping itself.\\" She acknowledged that the Palo Alto, Calif., company \\"has certainly had challenges\\" and that \\"time will tell\\" how it fares. But she added, \\"I'm optimistic about H-P's future.\\"      Enlarge Image Close Bloomberg News H-P board member and former eBay CEO Meg Whitman, shown in August, is a candidate for H-P interim CEO.      Asked about Mr. Apotheker's recent decision to potentially spin off the company's personal-computer business, Ms. Whitman said, \\"There are tremendous strategic changes that are taking place in the PC business, and H-P wants to capitalize on those changes and make sure this operating division has the autonomy and the ability to respond to rapidly changing technology.\\"      On Wednesday, a spokesman for Ms. Whitman referred a request for additional comment to H-P. H-P then declined to comment.      The re-emergence of Ms. Whitman—who has kept a relatively low profile since losing her gubernatorial bid to Democrat Jerry Brown last year—is likely to renew investors' focus on her track record at eBay.      Ms. Whitman joined eBay in 1998 after stints at Hasbro Inc., Florists Transworld Delivery and Stride Rite Corp. By the time she left the Internet company in March 2008, eBay's annual revenue was 7.7 billion, up from 86 million when she joined.      But concerns later mounted as eBay's once-torrid growth slowed amid competition from other e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com Inc. Ms. Whitman was also roundly criticized for eBay's 2005 purchase of Internet-calling firm Skype for 2.5 billion, for which it later took a 1.4 billion write-down. EBay has been viewed as a turnaround situation for the last few years under CEO John Donahoe.      A year after leaving eBay, Ms. Whitman announced she would run as a Republican for governor of California, which had struggled with deep deficits during Arnold Schwarzenegger's tenure. She won the Republican nomination, but despite spending a record amount on her campaign—178.5 million, most of it out of her own pocket—she ultimately lost to Mr. Brown.      In March, Ms. Whitman became a part-time adviser at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, a prominent Silicon Valley venture-capital firm.      In the Monday interview, Ms. Whitman also mused about the challenge for big companies of keeping up with increasingly rapid change.      \\"The bigger you get, the harder it is to be nimble,\\" she said. \\"How do you grow big and stay small? That still is the fundamental question.\\"      —Ben Worthen contributed to this article.      Write to Vauhini Vara at vauhini.vara@wsj.com ||||| Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), facing investor frustration over sales-forecast cuts and jarring strategy shifts, is considering replacing Chief Executive Officer Leo Apotheker, two people familiar with the matter said.      The board may appoint Hewlett-Packard director and former EBay Inc. (EBAY) CEO Meg Whitman as Apotheker’s successor, possibly on an interim basis, said one of the people, who asked not to be named because the plans aren’t public. The board also is reconsidering a proposal to spin off the company’s personal- computer unit, another person said.      Hewlett-Packard has lowered its sales forecasts three times since Apotheker became CEO in November, and he’s presided over strategy swings that left shareholders doubting his credibility. Before today, the company’s stock has plunged 47 percent on his watch, and “investor exasperation” with management is at its highest in more than a decade, according to Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.      “There’s certainly a lot of investor discontent with them,” said Amit Daryanani, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in San Francisco, who rates the shares “sector perform” and doesn’t own them. “There’s widespread frustration with the fact that numbers have been cut three times since he’s been there.”      Hewlett-Packard rose 1.51, or 6.7 percent, to 23.98 today on the New York Stock Exchange after Bloomberg reported the possible management change.      Revisiting the Spinoff      Hewlett-Packard’s board, due to meet this week, is open to re-examining the spinoff proposal now because some directors think the idea wasn’t studied as thoroughly as other high- profile spinoffs, such as one by Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT), the person familiar with the matter said. At the same time, the turmoil raises the possibility that some or all of Hewlett-Packard may become a takeover candidate.      Mylene Mangalindan, a spokeswoman for Palo Alto, California-based Hewlett-Packard, declined to comment.      The possible spinoff would take as long as 18 months to complete, Hewlett-Packard said at the time. That elicited criticism that it should have had a buyer lined up or a more concrete plan in place before making the announcement.      Whitman, who joined Hewlett-Packard’s board in January after a failed bid to become California’s governor last year, had a mixed record at EBay. CEO for a decade, she took the company public and pioneered e-commerce for small businesses. Yet in the final years of her tenure, she couldn’t halt a slowdown in sales growth and overpaid for Skype Technologies SA after a bidding war with Google Inc. and Yahoo! Inc.      Not Long-Term?      Her lack of experience in computing for large companies may mean she doesn’t stay in the role for long, said Jayson Noland, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. in San Francisco.      “She’s on the board and is a logical interim CEO, but not a logical long-term CEO,” said Noland, who has a “neutral” rating on the stock. “She doesn’t have enterprise experience.”      Pressure on Apotheker intensified on Aug. 18, when he announced a sweeping overhaul that included a 10.3 billion acquisition of Autonomy Corp. and the possible PC spinoff. He also killed off the company’s WebOS tablets and smartphones, just five months after vowing to put the operating system on a full range of the company’s computers.      The shares plunged 20 percent following the announcement, fueled by concerns that Autonomy was too expensive and the plans showed a lack of deliberation. The stock slumped to the point that other breakup and takeover scenarios are possible, Hewlett- Packard investor Michael Mullaney said at the time.      ‘Scoop It Up’      “For the right company, it probably would make sense for someone to come in and scoop it up,” Mullaney, who helps manage 9.5 billion at Fiduciary Trust in Boston, said in August. “Someone could come and at least buy pieces of the firm.”      The server unit would boost Oracle Corp.’s share fivefold and help it become the biggest maker of the hardware. Hewlett- Packard’s printer business, which is 70 percent more profitable than the company as a whole, may also attract private-equity firms, Mullaney said.      While the PC spinoff would help Hewlett-Packard focus on higher-margin products, such as services and software, the way it was conveyed didn’t satisfy shareholders, Sacconaghi said. The Autonomy deal, meanwhile, hasn’t been popular, he said.      “Our conversations with investors continue to point to near universal opposition of the Autonomy acquisition, due to its high price,” he wrote in a Sept. 13 report.      Undoing Autonomy      By paying cash for Autonomy, Hewlett-Packard doesn’t need approval from its own shareholders to complete the deal, Sacconaghi said.      The company can’t undo the takeover unless Autonomy investors fail to approve it, according to a person with knowledge of the terms. That outcome is unlikely, given that 42 percent of Autonomy shares had already been tendered in favor of the sale as of Sept. 12, this person said.      Apotheker, the former CEO of German software maker SAP AG (SAP), has aimed to transform Hewlett-Packard into a provider of more profitable software and services for businesses that are doing more computing on remote servers, via the so-called cloud. Yet, results have been plagued by tepid demand for PCs, as consumers in growing numbers snapped up competing mobile devices and tablets, such as Apple Inc.’s iPad.      Short Stint      His tenure at Hewlett-Packard may barely outlast his 10- month stint as CEO of SAP. He resigned in February 2010 after an attempted price increase during the recession that rankled consumers and a clash with German unions on plans to cut jobs. He presided over the company’s first revenue decline since 2003 as customers delayed software purchases.

Context: President Donald Trump's approval rating has headed into unfamiliar territory in recent weeks — upward. Trump's approval hit 43 percent in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, with 52 percent disapproving. That represents a 3 percent improvement from last month in the same survey. Several other new surveys also show Trump at or slightly above 40 percent. The RealClearPolitics polling average puts the president's approval rating at 41 percent, a noticeable bump from August, when the rating was often in the mid-30s. For much of the second half of August, Trump's approval rating in the Gallup Daily Tracking poll was either 34 percent or 35 percent, historically a low mark for a new president. On Thursday, Gallup had Trump at 37 percent. The previous day, Trump hit 39 percent, his highest mark since late July.  Trump's recent outreach to Democrats on budget issues and, possibly, immigration has boosted his poll numbers, as has his administration's response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 71 percent of those surveyed approved of Trump's deal with Democrats to fund the government until December and raise the debt ceiling, while 8 percent disapproved. The question is whether Trump has turned a political corner, or is merely seeing a temporary respite from the low poll ratings that have plagued him since the beginning of his presidency. That could depend on whether working with Democrats is a long-range goal or a passing fad, and experts said that making a forecast on that could turn out to be foolish. \\"When it comes to President Trump, I have gotten out of the prediction business,\\" said Brookings Institution scholar Bill Galston. \\"For now, this is a significant shift of strategy and tactics.

Movie plot title: Kissing Jessica Stein Movie plot: Twenty-eight-year-old Jessica Stein, a copyeditor living and working in New York City, is plagued by failed blind dates with men, and decides to answer a newspaper's personal advertisement containing a quote from Rilke that she had read and admired earlier. The advertisement has been placed by Helen Cooper, a thirtysomething bisexual art gallerist who is seeking a lesbian relationship to replace her unsatisfying and meaningless sex with men. Given some of the men Jessica is shown to be test-dating at the start of the film, it's no surprise she'd want to fan out her prospects a little. As nervous as Jessica is about dating Helen, she realizes after a surprise kiss that a different experience can be good. Through the early part of their relationship, Jessica finds in Helen everything she'd dreamed of finding in a man. They are compatible, they like many of the same things, and they are caring for one another. Even when Helen gets sickâwhich she says earlier in the film never happens to herâJessica is there to care for her. The only predicament for the relationship is Jessica's nervousness concerning same-sex intimacy. Over the early weeks of their relationship, she and Helen slowly work on building up her confidence in this area by gradually extended make-out sessions. Eventually, they graduate to full intimacy, which is initiated by Jessica during an over night stay at her parents' home in Scarsdale. In spite of Jessica's happiness with Helen, she keeps the relationship secret. Jessica's secrecy means that she has to endure scenes that would not happen had she been open about the two of them. One example occurs during a dinner to celebrate her brother's engagement. Her mother had invited an IBM executive in hopes of setting him up with Jessica. Helen and Jessica later get into a quarrel about Jessica's refusal to inform her family of their relationship, resulting in an apparent breakup. It isn't until later, as her brother's wedding approaches, that her mother figures out that they are dating. Her mother...

OSHA finds 58 violations at Nevada's Hoover Dam LAS VEGAS – The federal agency operating Hoover Dam must correct 58 health and safety violations that investigators found in recent inspections at the massive Colorado River water retention and hydroelectric power plant east of Las Vegas. Inspectors for the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration found violations in July and October that included lead contamination, electrical hazards, inadequate personal protective equipment and machinery guards, and the possibility that electric plant workers could be exposed to cancer-causing hexavalent chromium, according to a statement released Monday by OSHA regional chief Ken Atha. None of the violations jeopardized the safety of the public or threatened the structural integrity of the dam or its operations, said Terry Fulp regional chief of the Bureau of Reclamation, which operates the dam that forms Lake Mead. . \\"We are taking the necessary steps to ensure the issues raised are fixed and do not happen again,\\" Fulp said. Other deficiencies stemmed from outdated design and improved safety awareness since the dam began producing power 77 years ago, according to officials with the OSHA office in San Francisco and Rose Davis, spokeswoman for the dam operations office in Boulder City, outside Las Vegas. None of the approximately 250 workers at the dam and its hydropower plant was injured as a result of issues that OSHA identified, Davis said. The dam was completed in 1936 and regulates the flow of the Colorado River. It holds back the Lake Mead reservoir, which supplies almost all the drinking water supply of Las Vegas, 30 miles away. Water released through the hydropower plant supplies farms, businesses and homes downstream. The hydropower plant provides electricity to some 1.3 million homes and businesses in California, Arizona and Nevada. Some 1 million people a year visit the dam, including about 880,000 who tour the colossal structure, its massive hydropower plant and its art deco architectural elements. They weren't endangered, Davis said. OSHA expects a response from dam officials by the end of the month, OSHA spokeswoman Deanne Amadensaid. She added that Bureau of Reclamation officials can seek time to correct violations. Davis said inspectors initially told dam operations supervisors they found 77 violations. Some included improper location of fire extinguishers and placement of extension cords. Some two dozen were quickly corrected, Davis said. Other shortcomings, such as doors opening the wrong direction, date from the construction of the dam in the 1930s, Davis said. Atha said eight violations were designated as repeat offenses because OSHA has previously notified the Bureau of Reclamation within the past five years of a similar violation at Hoover Dam or another bureau facility in the OSHA region including California, Nevada, Arizona, Hawaii and the Pacific.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Because white spots are also an indication of enamel damage and early stages of tooth decay or can also be produced by fluoride ingestion at an early age (childhood fluorosis), preventing these spots from forming is almost always preventable with regular brushing and flossing. Improving your dental hygiene habits will  reduce the likelihood of getting white spots in the future.  Some tips to help you have great oral hygiene habits include:  Always brush your teeth after waking up, after eating, and before going to bed. Check the fluoride content of your toothpaste. You need enough fluoride to reduce acid and balance out your mouth's pH levels, but you don’t want to have so much fluoride that it is damaging.  Try to aim for amounts of fluoride between 1,000 and 1,500 ppm unless your dentist says otherwise. Floss every night.  If you have difficulty using standard floss, try using a pre-threaded flosser, instead. Visit the dentist every six months. Good care at home can prevent most problems, but a dentist can diagnose early signs of plaque buildup and other related issues. Certain foods can damage tooth enamel and make the mouth acidic and dry, allowing more bacteria to grow as a result.  This can damage the enamel on your teeth and allow harmful bacteria to infiltrate the pores of your teeth, leeching nutrients and minerals from the teeth and causing white spots.  Some tips to reduce your intake of these products include:  Avoid sugary drinks, especially carbonated drinks like soda.  Also be wary of candy and products that contain artificial sweeteners. If you need to sweeten something, opt for natural alternatives like honey or maple syrup, and use as little as possible. If you do consume anything that is high in sugar or carbohydrates, be sure to rinse your mouth with water immediately, then brush after about 30 minutes. In addition to remineralizing your teeth with home remedies or in-office professional treatments, another great way to prevent white spots is to eat foods that are heavy in teeth strengthening minerals.   By consuming vitamin D- and calcium-rich foods like milk, cheese, and yogurt, your teeth and body will absorb nutrients that help make your teeth strong and prevent white spots. Also look for foods that are high in magnesium, like dark leafy greens, nuts, seeds, fish, soybeans, and avocado, because magnesium helps the body absorb and retain more calcium. Staying hydrated helps your body perform at its best and it may also help prevent white spots. When your mouth is dry, the lack of saliva throws off the pH balance in your mouth and allows bacteria to grow and attack your teeth with their acid.    Try to drink at least eight 8-oz (250-mL) glasses of water daily.  Avoid hydrating with liquids like fruit juice, soda, or other beverages.  If you do drink one of these damaging liquids, be sure to rinse your mouth with water or brush your teeth afterward.  Add a few drops of lemon juice which can help promote saliva flow. Two of the most damaging substances you can introduce to your mouth are tobacco and caffeine.  Caffeine is extremely acidic and damages the enamel on your teeth, allowing bacteria to enter the pores of your teeth and cause white spots and other decay.  Smoking and chewing tobacco increase plaque and tartar build-up on your teeth, which can cause more damaged areas and white spot formation. Tobacco and caffeine will also stain your teeth, and any white spots you currently have will only appear more pronounced against the yellowing enamel. What is a summary?","output":"A summary tells the main points of something in a shorter and simpler way. So, for this article, the summary would be: To prevent white spots on your teeth and keep them healthy, brush and floss regularly, be careful with the fluoride in your toothpaste, visit the dentist, eat healthy foods, avoid too much sugar, stay hydrated, and stay away from tobacco and caffeine."},{"instruction":"Q:Here's a question: What does living life too hard lead to?

It was believed by the Spanish colonial authorities that the inhabitants of San Mateo Ixtatán were friendly towards the still unconquered and fiercely hostile inhabitants of the Lacandon region, which included parts of what is now the Mexican state of Chiapas and the western part of the Petén Basin. To prevent news of the Spanish advance reaching the inhabitants of the Lacandon area, the governor ordered the capture of three of San Mateo's community leaders, named as Cristóbal Domingo, Alonso Delgado and Gaspar Jorge, and had them sent under guard to be imprisoned in Huehuetenango. The governor himself arrived in San Mateo Ixtatán on 3 February, where Captain Rodríguez Mazariegos was already awaiting him. The governor ordered the captain to remain in the village and use it as a base of operations for penetrating the Lacandon region. The Spanish missionaries Fray de Rivas and Fray Pedro de la Concepción also remained in the town. Governor Enriquez de Guzmán subsequently left San Mateo Ixtatán for Comitán in Chiapas, to enter the Lacandon region via Ocosingo.In 1695, a three-way invasion of the Lacandon was launched simultaneously from San Mateo Ixtatán, Cobán and Ocosingo. Captain Rodriguez Mazariegos, accompanied by Fray de Rivas and 6 other missionaries together with 50 Spanish soldiers, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtatán.

Gyorgy Sandor Ligeti (; Hungarian: Ligeti Gyorgy Sandor, pronounced ['ligeti 'jorj 'Sa:ndor]; 28 May 1923 - 12 June 2006) was a Hungarian-Austrian composer of contemporary classical music. He has been described as \\"one of the most important avant-garde composers in the latter half of the twentieth century\\" and \\"one of the most innovative and influential among progressive figures of his time\\". Born in Transylvania, Romania, he lived in Hungary before emigrating to Austria in 1956, and became an Austrian citizen in 1968. In 1973 he became professor of composition at the Hamburg Hochschule fur Musik und Theater until he retired in 1989. Ligeti was born in 1923 at Dicsoszentmarton (which was renamed Tarnaveni in 1941), in the Romanian region of Transylvania to Dr. Sandor Ligeti and Dr. Ilona Somogyi. His family was Hungarian Jewish. He was the grandnephew of the violinist Leopold Auer and cousin of Hungarian philosopher Agnes Heller.  Ligeti recalled that his first exposure to languages other than Hungarian came one day while listening to a conversation among the Romanian-speaking town police. Before that he had not known that other languages existed. He moved to Cluj with his family when he was six years old. He was not to return to the town of his birth until the 1990s. In 1940, Northern Transylvania was annexed by Hungary following the Second Vienna Award and Cluj became part of Hungary.  In 1941 Ligeti received his initial musical training at the conservatory in Cluj, and during the summers privately with Pal Kadosa in Budapest. In 1944, Ligeti's education was interrupted when he was sent to a forced labor brigade by the Horthy regime. His brother, age 16, was deported to the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp and both of his parents were sent to Auschwitz. His mother was the only other survivor of his immediate family.  Following World War II, Ligeti returned to his studies in Budapest, Hungary, graduating in 1949 from the Franz Liszt Academy of Music. He studied under Pal Kadosa, Ferenc Farkas, Zoltan Kodaly and Sandor Veress. He went on to do ethnomusicological research into the Hungarian folk music of Transylvania. However, after a year he returned to Franz Liszt Academy in Budapest, this time as a teacher of harmony, counterpoint and musical analysis, a position he secured with the help of Kodaly and held between 1950 and 1956. As a young teacher, Ligeti took the unusual step of regularly attending the lectures of an older colleague, the conductor and musicologist Lajos Bardos, a conservative Christian whose circle represented for Ligeti a safe haven, and whose help and advice he later acknowledged in the prefaces to his own two harmony textbooks (1954 and 1956). However, communications between Hungary and the West by then had become difficult due to the restrictions of the communist government, and Ligeti and other artists were effectively cut off from recent developments outside the Eastern Bloc.

The brother of a Nazi war criminal possesses a safety deposit box key, but is killed in a traffic accident (after a road rage altercation with a short tempered middle-aged Jewish American motorist). Doc suspects that the criminal, Dr. Christian Szell (Laurence Olivier) will be arriving to retrieve an extremely valuable diamond collection. Szell later sends a burly assassin named Chen (James Wing Woo) to kill Doc in his Paris hotel room, but Doc fights the hit man and breaks his back.Babe enters into a relationship with a young woman named Elsa Opel (Marthe Keller), who claims to be from Switzerland.

What is \\"Where were the 1936 Summer Olympics held ?\\" asking about?","output":"The question \\"Where were the 1936 Summer Olympics held?\\" is asking about the specific location or city where the 1936 Summer Olympics, also known as the Games of the XI Olympiad, took place. These Olympic Games were an international multi-sport event that was celebrated as part of the modern Olympic movement. This question seeks to gather information about the geographic location that hosted the Olympic Games in 1936, which involved numerous athletes from different countries competing in various sporting events. Knowing the host city of this particular edition of the Summer Olympics can provide historical context and help understand the social, political, and cultural factors that may have influenced the events during that time. The 1936 Summer Olympics were held in Berlin, Germany, from August 1 to August 16, 1936. Berlin was selected as the host city during the 29th International Olympic Committee (IOC) Session in Barcelona, Spain, which took place from April 30 to May 4 in 1931. Berlin won the bid against Barcelona, which was also a candidate city for hosting the Games. These Olympics were marred by controversy due to the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi government in Germany at that time. The Games became a platform for the Nazi regime to showcase German athletic prowess and promote their ideology of Aryan racial superiority. Many nations debated boycotting the Games, but most eventually decided to participate. Notable events from the 1936 Summer Olympics include the performance of African-American track and field athlete Jesse Owens. Owens won four gold medals in the 100-meter and 200-meter sprints, the long jump, and as a member of the 4x100-meter relay team. His victories challenged the Nazi ideology of Aryan superiority and served as a significant blow to Hitler's propaganda efforts. The 1936 Summer Olympics left a lasting impression on the world of sports, establishing various precedents and innovations that are still employed, such as the Olympic torch relay and the use of electronic timing devices. Furthermore, the Berlin Games highlighted the potential for the Olympics to be used as a political tool by host countries, an issue that continues to be relevant in contemporary times."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Most people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common.  Now, I have a new situation: Ted had 2 uncles. Uncle Jerry was getting up there in age, he was 78 years-old. Uncle Tom was younger, he was in his early 50's and still very active and productive.  Answer this question please: Which uncle had retired from work? A:","output":"Based on the background information provided, it would be more reasonable to conclude that Uncle Jerry, who is 78 years old, has retired from work. This is because the background information states that old age begins in the mid-60s and most people over 65 have retired from work. Uncle Jerry, being over 65 and in his late 70s, would most likely fall into this category. On the other hand, Uncle Tom who is in his early 50s and described as very active and productive could still be working since he is younger than the defined old age and below the average retirement age in the context provided."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The update provides additional information about the situation that might weaken or strengthen the hypothesis. A weakener is a statement that weakens the hypothesis. It makes you much less likely to believe the hypothesis is true. A strengthener is a statement that strengthens the hypothesis. It makes you much more likely to believe the hypothesis is true.

It is located between Mathieson Channel and Lady Trutch Passage, and is flanked by Dowager Island (to the northwest), Lady Douglas Island (to the west), and a long finger shaped peninsula of the Canadian mainland to the east. Ironically, Lake Island is not a lake island, as it is in an inlet of the Pacific Ocean, and lies only some 6 kilometres from the open sea.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - Cape Alava, in Clallam County, Washington, U.S., is the westernmost point in the contiguous 48 states, with a longitude of (during low tide and walking out to the west side of Tskawahyah Island). The westernmost point is located in Olympic National Park and the Makah Indian Reservation. Cape Alava is accessible via a 3-mile boardwalk hike from a ranger station in the park. Cape Alava Trail was designated a National Recreation Trail in 1981.  - Flattery Rocks National Wildlife Refuge is the northernmost of the three refuges ( along with Quillayute Needles and Copalis ) which make up the Washington Maritime National Wildlife Refuge Complex , a group of 870 islands , rocks , and reefs extending for more than 100 miles along Washington 's coast from Cape Flattery to Copalis Beach . These islands are protected from human disturbance , yet are close to abundant ocean food sources . They are closed to the public , with wildlife observation only from boats and the mainland , and a 200 - yard buffer zone surrounding each island . They are a vital sanctuary where 14 species of seabirds nest and raise their young . During migration the total populations of seabirds , waterfowl , and shorebirds may exceed a million birds . Sea lions , harbor seals , sea otters , and whales may also be seen around the islands . The refuge is within the boundary of Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary and Olympic National Park , and is also incorporated into the Washington Islands Wilderness . The three agencies cooperate on research programs and other issues that may have impacts on the resources .  - Cape Flattery is the northwesternmost point of the contiguous United States. It is in Clallam County, Washington on the Olympic Peninsula, where the Strait of Juan de Fuca joins the Pacific Ocean. It is also part of the Makah Reservation, and is the northern boundary of the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary. Cape Flattery can be reached from a short hike, most of which is boardwalked. The westernmost point in the contiguous United States is at Cape Alava, south of Cape Flattery in Olympic National Park. However, the westernmost tip of Cape Flattery is almost exactly as far west as Cape Alava, the difference being approximately 5 seconds of longitude, about , at high tide and somewhat more at low tide.  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents.

Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity.  - The Olympic Peninsula is the large arm of land in western Washington that lies across Puget Sound from Seattle.

Cays occur in tropical environments throughout the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans (including in the Caribbean and on the Great Barrier Reef and Belize Barrier Reef).  - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.  - An islet is a very small island. Types.

As he is checking out of prison, he is met by his corrupt parole officer, Gates, who offers to excuse him from community service in exchange for pulling off an art heist. Hudson declines, and meets his buddy (and presumable partner-in-crime) Tommy Five-Tone (Danny Aiello), who offers him his favorite drink, a cappuccino, but spills it when he slams on the brakes.The pair return to their old haunt: their co-owned bar Five-Tone in Hoboken, but when Hudson enters, he finds it converted from a comfortable hole in the wall full of working-class regulars, to an elite, upscale urban professional bistro. While attempting to enjoy a fresh cappuccino, he is interrupted by local crime bosses Cesar Mario (Frank Stallone) and Antony Mario (Carmine Zozzora), who reveal they are behind the art heist proposed by Gates, and try to pressure Hudson into doing it.Hudson decides to go through with the heist, and plans the job with Tommy, while his desires to live a straight life fight against it.

This statement suggests that the trial would be stopped for some time as Clinton would engage in settlement talks instead. Now, let's analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise states that Clinton will stop settlement talks and go to trial. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the trial would be put on hold while pursuing settlement talks. The premise suggests that Clinton is moving from settlement talks to trial, while the hypothesis suggests the opposite, that the trial would be on hold for settlement talks.

Question: How much money was offered to rescue Rob and kill his captor? Title: The Baytown Disco Movie plot: In Alabama, Oodie brothers Brick, Lincoln and McQueen work as vigilantes for the man who raised them, Sheriff Henry Millard; they bypass the legal system to murder criminals, keeping the crime rate the lowest in the state. After one of their assaults, they are approached by Celeste, a witness to the incident, who offers them 25,000 to rescue her godson Rob and kill his godfather and captor, the drug lord Carlos. The trio accept. Meanwhile, ATF agent Anthony Reese approaches Millard about the spree of criminal deaths and his suspects; the Oodie brothers. Millard is intentionally obstructive to Reese's request for aid.The Oodies travel to Carlos's home and assault the building, killing Carlos's men but failing to kill Carlos. They recover Rob; a young mentally disabled man in a wheelchair. Carlos sends a group of female biker assassins after them. The bikers find the brothers resting at a bar. The bikers seduce the unaware brothers, separating them from each other, but when Lincoln notices one of them wheeling Rob away, the women attack them. The brothers manage to kill the women and recover Rob, but the massacre ends up on the news with sketches of the three brothers provided by the bar owner, giving Reese the evidence he needs that the Oodies are killers. Brick calls Celeste to find out why the simple job now involves assassins; Celeste confesses that Rob was from a wealthy family that were killed by Carlos so that he, as Rob's legal guardian, could obtain a large trust fund that Rob is to inherit on his impending 18th birthday. Brick makes a further call to Millard who tells them that because of Reese's evidence, he has to disavow them and will arrest them if they return to Alabama.Though he cannot speak to them, the brothers bond with Rob.

Question:   John was combining chemicals in his lab one day. If he were to decrease the temperature in his lab, what would happen to the rate of chemical reactions in his experiments increase or decrease?    Paragraph :  Chemical weathering increases as: Temperature increases: Chemical reactions proceed more rapidly at higher temperatures. A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it can be concluded that the rate of chemical reactions generally increases with higher temperatures. Therefore, if John were to decrease the temperature in his lab, it would likely lead to a decrease in the rate of chemical reactions in his experiments. Chemical reactions are influenced by several factors, and temperature is a crucial one. Higher temperatures cause particles to move faster and more energetically. This increased movement and energy give the reacting molecules a higher likelihood of colliding, overcoming the energy barrier, and successfully reacting. In the given scenario, John is working with chemicals in his lab, and the paragraph emphasizes that chemical weathering and reactions proceed more rapidly at higher temperatures. By lowering the lab's temperature, John would reduce the kinetic energy of the particles involved in the chemical reactions. Consequently, the frequency of successful collisions between reacting molecules would decrease, slowing down the rate of the reactions overall. In summary, if John decides to decrease the temperature in his lab, he could expect the rate of chemical reactions in his experiments to decrease as well. This is due to the fact that chemical reactions tend to be more rapid at higher temperatures, with the increased particle energy leading to more frequent and successful collisions between molecules."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who was trying to land on their feet again? ?

Q:What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  The can is taken to a recycling center - Melted down along with other cans - The melted metal is turned into bars - Becomes material for other products. A:","output":"The missing first step of the given recycling process is: \\"Collection and sorting of used aluminum cans.\\" To provide a detailed explanation of the complete process, let's go through each step: 1. Collection and sorting of used aluminum cans: This is the initial stage where used aluminum cans are gathered from various sources like homes, restaurants, offices, and recycling containers placed in public areas. The collected cans are transported to a recycling center or a materials recovery facility (MRF), where they are sorted based on their material type. Here, aluminum cans are separated from other recyclables like plastic, glass, and paper using a combination of manual labor and automated machinery such as eddy current separators, which use magnetic fields to repel and separate aluminum cans from the rest. 2. The can is taken to a recycling center: Once the aluminum cans are sorted, they are sent to a recycling center or an aluminum processing facility. Here, they are prepared for the recycling process by removing any contaminants or non-aluminum materials, such as labels, adhesives, or even leftover liquids. 3. Melted down along with other cans: The sorted and cleaned aluminum cans are then fed into a melting furnace, where they are melted along with other aluminum materials at high temperatures of around 1300-1500°F (700-800°C). Melting aluminum uses only about 5% of the energy needed to produce aluminum from raw materials, thereby conserving energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 4. The melted metal is turned into bars: Once the cans have been melted down into a molten aluminum alloy, any impurities or unwanted elements are removed using various refining techniques. The purified molten metal is then poured into molds or casts and allowed to cool and solidify into bars, ingots, or billets. These aluminum forms, also commonly called \\"secondary aluminum,\\" are now ready to be turned into new products. 5. Becomes material for other products: The aluminum bars, ingots, or billets are transported to manufacturers who turn them into new aluminum products using different processes such as rolling, extrusion, or casting. These recycled aluminum materials can be used to make a wide range of products including new aluminum cans, automotive parts, building materials, and even electronic devices. Since aluminum can be recycled indefinitely without losing its properties, this helps in conserving resources and reducing the overall environmental impact of our consumption habits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First, let's all agree that Lorenzo Lamas could never be considered a skilled actor, barely even decent, sometimes just plain lousy. However, in this piece of @*!^ called SnakeEater, the film industry as a whole sank. First, let's start with the plot. A Vietnam vet named Jack Kelly, aka Soldier (who is supposed to be as tough as a strap of leather and then some, which you can believe when he shoves a palate of nails through 2 guys' feet and pins them to the floor), gets word that his family has been killed and his sister kidnapped. Therefore he goes on a solo mission to save his sister. Had some potential, but still pretty thin to begin with. Now, the acting. Being an actor myself, I am qualified to say that this was some of the WORST acting in the history of the art!!!!! Lamas is, well, himself. The jackasses playing the Clampets/Deliverance rejects should be strung up and shot for their so-called performances which are insulting to actors everywhere, especially talented ones who never get their big break! Finally, the action. The gunfighting is so-so at BEST, and the fist-fighting is deplorable. I've seen more real-looking fights at the Renaissance Festival (and those were pretty fake-looking)!

Fears for Tunisian tourism industry after attack The latest shooting follows a similar Islamist-inspired attack on the country's Bardo museum in March, in which 31 people died – again, the majority of them tourists. The terrorist group which calls itself \\"Islamic State\\" claimed responsibility for both attacks. Tunisia relies heavily on tourism and the industry accounts for 15.2 percent of Tunisia's gross domestic product (GDP), according to the latest figures from the World Travel and Tourism Council. The industry directly supports 228,000 jobs -- or 6.6 percent of employment in the country.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Senate Blocks Bill to Eliminate Tax Breaks for Oil Companies WASHINGTON — The Senate on Tuesday blocked a Democratic proposal to strip the five leading oil companies of tax breaks that backers of the measure said were unfairly padding industry profits while consumers were struggling with high gas prices. Senate pages delivered charts about tax breaks for oil companies to the chamber on Tuesday. Democrats sought to eliminate five tax breaks, producing an estimated 21 billion over 10 years. Despite falling eight votes short of the 60 needed to move ahead with the bill, top Democrats said they would insist that eliminating the tax breaks to generate billions of dollars in revenue must be part of any future agreement to raise the federal debt limit. “We have to stand up and say, ‘Enough is enough,’ ” said Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota. “While oil prices are gouging the pocketbooks of American families, these companies are on a pace for a record profit this year.” The defeat on Tuesday was expected since most Republicans were dug in against what they saw as a politically motivated plan in advance of the 2012 elections. Democrats had hoped that directing the savings toward the deficit would make it harder for Republicans to reject it. In the 52-to-48 vote, 3 Democrats joined 45 Republicans in opposing the bill, which was supported by the Obama administration and fiscal watchdog groups that saw the tax help for the oil industry as wasteful. Forty-eight Democrats, two independents and two Republicans backed it. Energy-state Democrats criticized the initiative, saying it was misdirected and would do nothing to ease gasoline prices and could cost American jobs. “Why are we harming an industry — five large oil and gas companies that work internationally, that employ 9.2 million people in the United States directly?” asked Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana. “Why are we doing it?” Republicans, who on Wednesday will push their own plan to open more areas to oil drilling and speed government permits, said the Democratic proposal would contribute to higher prices and increase dependence on foreign oil even though a recent Congressional Research Service report predicted any impact on prices would be negligible. “Clearly, this is not a serious effort to address the price of gas at the pump,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. Under the proposal, Democrats would have eliminated five different tax breaks enjoyed by the multinational oil companies, producing an estimated 21 billion over 10 years. More than 12 billion would have come from eliminating a domestic manufacturing tax deduction for the big oil companies, and 6 billion would have been generated by ending their deductions for taxes paid to foreign governments. Critics suggest that the companies have been able to disguise what should be foreign royalty payments as taxes to reduce their tax liability. The bill would also deny the companies the ability to deduct some intangible drilling and development costs. The bill would have applied to BP, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips. The White House lent strong support to the effort though the president in the past has recommended applying revenue generated by ending the tax breaks to the development of alternative energy sources. “The administration believes that, at a time when it is working with the Congress on proposals to reduce federal deficits, the nation cannot afford to maintain these wasteful subsidies,” the White House said. Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat and majority leader, portrayed the vote as one that revealed the values of Republicans. “Instead of defending oil companies, Republicans should be defending the American taxpayer,” Mr. Reid said. “We believe this is the kind of wasteful spending that will lead to an agreement on reducing the debt.” While most Republicans have opposed eliminating the tax breaks as a back-door tax increase, some, including Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the Budget Committee chairman, have indicated a willingness to consider the idea. Also on Tuesday, Senate Democrats wrote to the Federal Trade Commission seeking an inquiry into whether domestic oil refiners had reduced production to drive down the gasoline supply and drive up prices. “This is just another piece of the puzzle that we need to get at as we try to take away taxpayer subsidies to Big Oil and hold Big Oil accountable for whatever may be going on in the supply chain that is hurting the families that I work for,” said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri.","output":"The US Senate has blocked a Democratic proposal to end tax breaks for the five leading oil companies, preventing an estimated 21 billion in revenue generation over a decade.

Leon Battista Alberti, who elaborates on the ideas of Vitruvius in his treatise, De Re Aedificatoria, saw beauty primarily as a matter of proportion, although ornament also played a part. For Alberti, the rules of proportion were those that governed the idealised human figure, the Golden mean. The most important aspect of beauty was therefore an inherent part of an object, rather than something applied superficially; and was based on universal, recognisable truths.

The sentence \\"Esitän mietinnön hyväksymistä\\" can be translated into English as \\"I propose the adoption of the report\\" or \\"I put forward the approval of the report.\\"  It appears that this sentence is used in a formal context, most likely during a meeting or discussion where a person or a group presents a report with their findings, recommendations, or other information. The person who utters the sentence suggests that the report should be approved or accepted by others in the meeting or the group. This proposal may then be discussed among the relevant stakeholders, and they may provide their opinions, objections, or suggestions in response. The process of adopting a report typically entails a few steps: 1. The presenter(s) or author(s) of the report shares the content and any background information relevant to the report with the rest of the group. 2. The group members have the opportunity to ask questions and discuss the key points and findings of the report. 3. Amendments or changes to the report may be proposed and discussed. 4.

So, you can give it orders in your mother tongue. But how could a cell phone or a computer \\"hear\\" what you are saying and understand it? This is all because of voice recognition technology. When you speak, your voice creates vibrations   in the air - a bit like waves in the water when you throw a rock into the lake. The microphone receives the vibrations and the computer changes them into digital data that is then divided into many parts. They are analyzed one by one to see what pronunciations each part stands for. The computer then puts these pronunciations together into possible words according to its built-in dictionary. But figuring out the words is far from enough; building words into meaningful sentences is the most difficult part. The computer has to compare what it hears to a large library of known phrases and sentences to determine what the user is saying. However, people don't always talk in the most standard way and sometimes make grammatical mistakes. This is why traditional voice recognition software always requires you to remember keywords and to speak in a certain way. Fortunately, Siri isn't like that.

It was created in 1395, when it included twenty-six towns and the wide rural area of the middle Padan Plain east of the hills of Montferrat. During much of its existence, it was wedged between Savoy to the west, Venice to the east, the Swiss Confederacy to the north, and separated from the Mediterranean by Genoa to the south. The Duchy eventually fell to Habsburg Austria with the Treaty of Baden (1714), concluding the War of the Spanish Succession. The Duchy remained an Austrian possession until 1796, when a French army under Napoleon Bonaparte conquered it, and it ceased to exist a year later as a result of the Treaty of Campo Formio, when Austria ceded it to the new Cisalpine Republic.  - The War of the League of Cambrai, sometimes known as the War of the Holy League and by several other names, was a major conflict in the Italian Wars. The main participants of the war, fought from 1508 to 1516, were France, the Papal States and the Republic of Venice; they were joined, at various times, by nearly every significant power in Western Europe, including Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, England, Scotland, the Duchy of Milan, Florence, the Duchy of Ferrara and Swiss mercenaries.  - The Italian Wars, often referred to as the Great Italian Wars or the Great Wars of Italy and sometimes as the HabsburgValois Wars or the Renaissance Wars, were a series of conflicts from 1494 to 1559 that involved, at various times, most of the city-states of Italy, the Papal States, the Republic of Venice, most of the major states of Western Europe (France, Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, England, and Scotland) as well as the Ottoman Empire. Originally arising from dynastic disputes over the Duchy of Milan and the Kingdom of Naples, the wars rapidly became a general struggle for power and territory among their various participants, and were marked with an increasing number of alliances, counter-alliances, and betrayals.  - Don Pedro Navarro , Count of Oliveto ( c. 1460 -- 28 August 1528 ) was a Spanish military engineer and general who participated in the War of the League of Cambrai . At the Battle of Ravenna in 1512 he commanded the Spanish and Papal infantry , but was captured by the French . In the service of Francis I of France , he would supervise the French crossing of the Alps before the Battle of Novara in 1513 .

Forever, that is, until in the present (OK, 1998) Tony is spotted on Ibeza (he now stocks condoms in the restrooms at the resorts there) by the son of the Wisbech promoter, who wants to put together a 20th anniversary reunion concert with all the original acts. Tony seeks out Karen, now a divorced mother who coordinates conferences for a major hotel, suggesting a possible reunion.

Just days before the Florida State Seminoles play for the ACC football championship, star quarterback Jameis Winston is appearing before a panel that can decide whether he will continue as a student at the university. It's been almost two years since the Heisman Trophy winner was accused of sexually assaulting a then-FSU student. Winston was not arrested in connection with the alleged December 2012 incident, but he still could be charged by his university with a code-of-conduct violation for sexual misconduct, depending on the results of the school's investigation. He could face a wide range of sanctions if he is found in violation -- from a reprimand or counseling to probation, suspension or expulsion. \\"This is the day that Mr. Winston has been desperately trying to avoid for two years,\\" John Clune, one of the attorneys representing the woman who accused Winston, told CNN on Tuesday. \\"This courageous young woman finally gets the chance to stand up for herself and against Mr. Winston and big-time college sports, which has long run over the rights and protection of women on campus. FSU breaks silence on Jameis Winston case. \\"Neither Jameis Winston nor his lawyer can stop what is coming.\\" Winston categorically denied the allegations in a statement. \\"I did not rape or sexually assault [the accuser]. I did not create a hostile, intimidating or offensive environment in the short period of time that we were together. [The accuser] had the capacity to consent to having sex with me and she repeatedly did so by her conduct and her verbal expressions.\\" He goes on to say, \\"Rape is a vicious crime. The only thing as vicious as rape is falsely accusing someone of rape.\\" It seems improbable that a decision will be known before Saturday, when Florida State -- which has won 28 games in a row -- plays Georgia Tech with the ACC championship and a bid to the four-team College Football Playoff on the line. According to the university, a formal decision letter will be sent within 10 class days from the conclusion of the hearing. Florida State's investigation was launched under Title IX, which requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual assault, even if criminal charges are never filed. The hearing has been delayed twice. Tim Jansen, who was Winston's attorney in the criminal investigation, has said Winston had consensual sex with the woman. According to police documents, the accuser said Winston raped her after she had been drinking with friends at a bar in Tallahassee. She said an unknown man gave her a shot glass of liquid before they left the bar. The accuser said she did not remember little of what happened afterward, but that she did remember being in a ground-floor apartment where a man took off her clothes and had sex with her despite her objections. The accuser reported the alleged assault to campus police that night. A month later, in January 2013, she said the man who allegedly assaulted her was Winston. FSU said in October that Winston informed the athletics department of the allegation after he was contacted by a Tallahassee police detective. The university said the athletics department did not initially file a report with the school's Title IX administrator because no charges were filed and because other players who were with Winston said there was no sexual assault. A Title IX investigation was opened after media inquiries, and after law enforcement had referred the case to the state attorney's office. Tallahassee interim Police Chief Tom Coe said last year that the woman \\"broke off contact\\" with investigators in February 2013 and didn't want to go forward with the case. The woman's family says a detective warned her attorney that Tallahassee is a \\"big football town\\" and that life could be miserable if she pursued the case. In December 2013, the Florida state attorney for the judicial circuit that includes Leon County and Tallahassee, announced that investigators did not have probable cause to arrest Winston. Later that month, Winston won the Heisman, and in January 2014 the Seminoles defeated Auburn to win the BCS national title. Winston spent the spring playing for the Florida State baseball team, but off the field he continued to make headlines for the wrong reasons. In April, Winston was accused of shoplifting crab legs from a Publix grocery in Tallahassee. Police said that Winston said he forgot to pay. As part of a civil citation for alleged shoplifting -- an alternative to criminal prosecution for first-time, nonviolent offenses in Leon County -- Winston was not arrested but was ordered to serve at least 20 hours of community service, authorities said. In September, Winston was suspended for the Seminoles' game against Clemson for yelling a sexually explicit remark near the school's student union. Florida State initially announced Winston would be suspended for the first half of the game after the sexual remark. However, Athletics Director Stan Wilcox increased the punishment the day before the game after hearing eyewitness accounts that differed from Winston's initial version, a source close to the situation told CNN's Rachel Nichols. In October, ESPN reported that more than 2,000 authenticated autographs by Winston were discovered online. However, Florida State said its athletic compliance department has not found evidence Winston accepted payment. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"Jameis Winston, the star quarterback for the Florida State Seminoles, has been accused of sexually assaulting a fellow student in December 2012. Despite not being arrested regarding the alleged incident, he still faces potential charges from his university for a code-of-conduct violation for sexual misconduct, which could result in sanctions ranging from reprimands and counseling to suspension or expulsion. As Winston's hearing proceeds under Title IX, which mandates schools to investigate sexual assault allegations, a decision seems unlikely to be made before the ACC championship game against Georgia Tech. In the past, Winston has faced various other controversies, including theft charges and making a sexually explicit remark on campus."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Nine Inch Nails, an industrial rock band fronted by Trent Reznor, has toured all over the world since its creation in 1988. While Reznor—the only official member until adding Atticus Ross in 2016—controls its creative and musical direction in the studio, the touring band performs different arrangements of the songs. In addition to regular concerts, the band has performed in both supporting and headlining roles at festivals such as Woodstock '94, Lollapalooza 1991 and 2008, and many other one-off performances including the MTV Video Music Awards. Prior to their 2013 tour, the band had played 938 gigs.Nine Inch Nails' live performances contrast with its in-studio counterpart. Reznor writes and performs nearly all Nine Inch Nails studio material, with occasional instrumental and vocal contributions from others artists. However, Reznor has typically assembled groups of backing musicians to interpret songs for tours and other live performances. Keyboardist Alessandro Cortini said that \\"if you see the show and you're used to the CDs it's pretty clear that the studio entity is different from the live entity\\".The only constant member of the live band is Reznor.  Live Nine Inch Nails performances are typically accompanied by lighting, stage, and video projection effects. Since 1999, the visual design components of live shows have been curated by Reznor with Rob Sheridan. Three tours have been chronicled on live albums and tour documentaries. Critical and commercial response to Nine Inch Nails live performances has generally been positive. Critics have pointed to the concerts' aggressive on-stage dynamic and visual designs as high points. Reznor decided in 2008 to cease touring with the band after a 2009 farewell tour. The band resumed touring in 2013, with the group planning a set of concerts in the U.S. beginning September 28.

Mr Zabel briefly wore the red campaign cap into his courtroom the day after the 2016 US presidential election. The Ontario Judicial Council received 81 complaints about his conduct. \\"I'm not a Trump supporter,\\" Mr Zabel told the four-person disciplinary panel looking into those complaints on Wednesday. \\"I find it very difficult to find the words to express my profound regret for what I did that day.\\" Mr Zabel described to the panel how he came to don the Donald Trump campaign hat in the Hamilton courtroom on 9 November in a fug of fatigue after staying up late to watch the results. He said he had ordered five of the caps online in June thinking it would be \\"entertaining to have some historic memorabilia\\" from the election. Mr Zabel, who appeared sombre and was wearing a charcoal pinstriped suit and patterned blue tie, described Mr Trump's win as \\"an almost surreal experience\\" and thought wearing the cap would \\"add a little humour\\" and \\"lighten the proceedings\\" in the courtroom that day. He walked in wearing the cap and then placed it on the dais until morning recess, when he returned it to his office. Returning to court briefly in the afternoon, an attorney quipped to him: \\"You lost your hat\\". He replied: \\"Brief appearance for the hat. P***** off the rest of the judges because they all voted for Hillary. I was the only Trump supporter up there but that's OK\\". A few days later, after the incident made headlines, he apologised in open court and said donning the hat was not meant as an endorsement of the US president's policies. Complainants, including the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund and 27 law professors from the University of Windsor - Mr Zabel's alma mater -say the veteran judged breached principles of impartiality and objectivity and broke rules regarding the prohibition on partisan political activity. Multiple complaints received by the council noted that the public apology he made on 15 November regarding his conduct was not consistent with the comment he made in court that afternoon about being a Trump supporter. Mr Zabel said it was a poorly worded comment about how he had come to believe that Mr Trump could win in the weeks before the election - a prediction his fellow judges did not share. On cross examination, presenting counsel Linda Rothstein pushed Mr Zabel on his choice of words on 9 November, noted the Trump hat could be tied to racism and bigotry, and asked whether he considered that many people felt devastated by the election results. \\"I wasn't thinking it through,\\" Mr Zabel conceded. Mr Zabel also received 62 character references and letters from colleagues and others expressing their support for the judge and praising his integrity. Ontario court justice Marjoh Agro appeared as a character witness for her colleague on Wednesday. \\"I remember that day well because quite frankly I deeply regret not ripping that hat off his head,\\" she said. Mr Zabel stopped being assigned cases on 21 December, which Ms Agro said has caused \\"a lot of disruption\\" at the courthouse and has strained resources.  She said she retains confidence in him as a judge. \\"I didn't have concerns then and I don't have them now, other than the misjudgement of wearing a stupid hat into court,\\" she said. The Ontario Judicial Council investigates complaints about the conduct of provincially appointed judges. Mr Zabel faces a number of possible sanctions, including being issued a warning or reprimand and suspension. The panel could also recommend to the attorney general that the judge be removed from office. The disciplinary panel reserved judgment on Wednesday. Summary:","output":"A judge named Mr. Zabel from Ontario wore a red Trump campaign hat in his courtroom after the 2016 US presidential election, and now he may be in trouble because of it. The court received 81 complaints about his actions. He said it was not to show support for Trump, but to add some humor and lighten the mood in the courtroom.
